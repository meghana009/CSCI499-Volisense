repost by request there is a covid 19 virus however covid is not more dangerous than all other flu like viruses that impact the respiratory system covid 19 is very manageable and doesn t carry a higher fatality rate why is covid 19 being disproportionately hyped as such a dangerous threat when the reality of the statistical danger is much less than the intense level of hype that is the key question the answer is social changes under the guise of covid 19 mitigation are the entry point for the goals and aspirations of the political left on a national and global scale covid 19 is a virus but also a very important political weapon and we are about to discover exactly what the purpose of the hype is all about what follows will help understand and when you encounter the fear it will help to reconcile what people cannot figure out joe biden is an avatar a political pawn a cognitively declining guy who has no idea what is happening around him the people behind the biden campaign those in real control of what this is about have not hidden their goals and aspirations these are not stupid people they are scheming conniving ever planning ever manipulating machiavellian types within the political system lusting for power influence and affluence what they are planning to do is weaponize covid 19 to attain ideological objectives this is why they hyped the fear within it for almost a year nothing within their plan requires the approval or consent of any representative body in washington dc covid is the tool to fundamentally change the way the united states exists on october 23rd those behind the biden campaign dropped all pretense openly having their candidate state publicly his intention to control the lives of all americans using the authority of a weaponized federal government to advance national covid 19 regulations as you watch this video from biden s campaign it is important to remember state government officials have already moved to define essential businesses and essential workers during the forced shut downs that is going to become a bigger issue downstream however for now just watch closely what joe biden is saying here the dept of transportation would be the agency enforcing a national interstate transit mask requirement however don t focus on the dot part of what he was saying that s only one creek instead focus on the downstream use of all federal regulatory agencies and how they align within a federal covid compliance network that s the river think about the dept of agriculture snap food stamps the dept of labor the dept of education the occupational health and safety administration osha housing and urban development health and human services dept of labor dept of energy and how they would join with the dot to create the aggregate raging river of regulation think about the federal government using mandates for enforced national covid 19 compliance rules think about usda dept of agriculture and osha federal inspections for social distancing etc in all businesses not just restaurants think about the covid 19 regulatory and compliance system and what political beneficiaries stand to gain think about the dept of education using covid to restructure the way education is taught and the downstream regulations on charter schools and non compliant educational systems that do not meet the ideological objectives of the master control plan think about how the dept of labor complaint division can be weaponized against political opposition based on arbitrary inspections under the guise of employee health and safety using federal covid compliance rules think about required days off for the entire employee base if a single infection is identified in the workplace paid days off funded by federal government think about how that changes the income dependency dynamic think about the larger green new deal goals and objectives and then contrast those objectives while aligning an overlay map of how federal covid mitigation rules can be applied as a back door to the exact same objective far beyond masks workspaces being forced to be redesigned new rules on labor density new rules on labor manufacturing and office proximity new rules on uniforms new rules on hand washing stations new rules on sick pay shift hours time off when a covid infection is detected in the workplace think about everything from rules on surfaces to rules on packaging to rules on all business operations as an outcome of federal regulatory policy under the guise of cvoid 19 mitigation osha labor agriculture transportation energy education housing health and human services and even federal building permits the entire regulatory system and compliance network think about housing and urban development hud having new rules about dwellings and complexes for housing grants population density the need to move into the suburbs and the confiscation of private property to ensure the common safety of the citizens if you think this is fear mongering i want to to evaluate that cynicism while contemplating this recent example from california think about those types of business regulations applied on a national level and then as seen in prior democrat administrations with irs etc think about them also being enforced through the prism of political affiliation think about how states that refuse to participate will be cut off from federal grants and funding for college tuition medicare and or medicaid reimbursement etc etc think about what happens to main street usa think about companies on the nasdaq or national companies on the stock market think about how those usa specific federal covid compliance regulations apply when considering u s business operations vs just taking operations overseas without those worries think about who in washington dc then takes control of what types of business interests are allowed to operation who determines the winning and losing think about how federal covid 19 regulations can be used to put the multinational corporate world back the globalists on their former financial pathways even without tpp and ttip trade deals think about how much china and europe would love to see our economy knee capped in a biden regulatory stranglehold essentially achieving the same objectives as the paris climate treaty think long and hard about how far the tentacles of achieving the green new deal can extend under the auspices of federal covid 19 mitigation remember those who are working on this don t care about the middle class and they have not for decades the visibility of the rust belt is the reference this is about government bureaucrats using their dc power base to control trillions in economic value and sell their ability to influence the winners and losers to the highest foreign bidder look at what blue states have already done to seize power and control now think about that same manipulative intent spread throughout the entire country by weaponizing federal agencies with advanced regulation that should start to frame the reference point going forward remember within totalitarian states religion is a risk the assembly for religious worship is always considered a risk to by those who demand control over free thought and lives the national legislative priority will be entirely focused on retention of that power system by generating an entirely new form of congressional representation new states new senators new election systems and funding for the needs of the executive that will be the focus of the facilitating legislative branch those behind the executive branch those controlling joe biden will harness and weaponize the power the legislative leftists will attempt to ensure the new systems they create under the guise of covid 19 are never in a position to be withdrawn why why all of this effort why such extremes why would blue state governors willingly destroy their economy follow the money it s always about the money the global ideology is worthless without money wall street s rick santelli knows he s watching the second deployment of an identical playbook so when your friends ask why let s talk about why the response to the opportunity of the financial crisis of 2007 2008 was about using the housing market collapse to create a financial mechanism to bail out blue team members tarp auto bailouts qe1 qe2 and the stimulus packages were specifically directed to the controlled crony capitalists who funded the rise of the previous tool barack obama in 2009 the orcs were deployed beyond the wall street crowd the seiu afl cio afscme nea were some of the more visible politically activist beneficiaries there was a massive hole in the u s economy and all the american recovery and reinvestment act arra funds were specifically targeted to ensure the blue team did not suffer winners and losers were selected overall main street didn t get a dime in 2020 we are seeing the exact same operational execution around covid 19 this time the crisis is a virus and the planned primary beneficiaries are the blue team states and their collapsing and unstable financial mechanisms the american electorate writ large would never support targeted taxpayer funded bailouts to blue state beneficiaries as a consequence the crisis needs to hit main street so that public support for massive bailouts can be accepted nancy pelosi sets up the proposal takes the accounting of the blue team needs and sits down with inside party club members to organize the funding mechanisms obviously all of this big picture outcome is contingent upon successful execution of president trump s removal hence the firm reliance on election fraud the transparency of the fraud needs to be obfuscated denied and ridiculed that s where the media come in meanwhile blue state teams work earnestly to create a worsening financial crisis for the american electorate the workers and business owners shutting down the economy is part of a coordinated effort when do both wings of the uniparty bird most visibly flap in unison answer when they get to the part of the playbook where their tribe starts positioning for the trough yes covid 19 as a weapon has many benefits including the purposefully convenient stopping of assemblies crowds and visible public opposition as the larger schemes are deployed hastily big tech steps in to assist the goal of isolating the electorate by shutting down voices and keeping people isolated from larger community understanding communication lines are cut as they would be in any war strategy dividing people has many benefits as soon as enough pressure is applied to main street the electorate get desperate there will be an outcry for help and that is where house speaker nancy pelosi is waiting in the wings with the previously constructed bailout package that the american people will now be more apt to support opposition voices will be framed as heartless the media will immediately jump into action and we go right into that cycle were fearful people do not stop to recognize the financial strategy as it is carried out the blue team state bailout will come at the top of a massive 2020 covid federal spending package as with the previous 2009 spending package it will be gift wrapped in paper to appear like main street is a beneficiary however just like the arra there will be no shovel ready jobs saved or created it is all a ruse for a transfer of taxpayer wealth the weaponization of covid is the ongoing crisis that will facilitate the government solutions as the american people resist the bait represented by the covid crisis those who need to weaponize it will keep turning up the pressure that pressure will continue until the american people can no longer take it and will accept the solution we are watching deployment of an identical playbook used previously to bail out wall street big banks and political benefactors beneficiaries in 2009 covid crisis 2020 replaces the housing banking crisis 2008 pelosi repackages the tarp strategy as a covid response states are bailed out in 2020 like the too big to fail banks in 2008 union leadership benefit as they did in the 2008 operation and the great reset begins that s the why
as predicted and the next step will be colleges universities students and anyone receiving federal education funding loans or grants today the white house occupant announced a federal regulatory requirement that all nurses and healthcare workers who work in facilities funded by medicaid and or medicare will be required to be vaccinated ironically joe biden noted that nurses those professionally trained in healthcare systems who understand the issues of vaccination are at a lower vaccination rate than the less trained and educated population vaccination rates among nursing home staff significantly trail the rest of the country biden said while never questioning why as pointed out recently a large subset of the vaccine resistant population are the most educated today i m announcing a new step if you work in a nursing home and serve people on medicare or medicaid you will also be required to get vaccinated more than 130 000 residents in nursing homes have sa have sadly over the period of this virus passed away at the same time vaccination rates among nursing home staff significantly trail the rest of the country read more the downstream consequence from this action will be a shortage of healthcare providers in nursing homes this has already become an issue for hospitals coast to coast who require vaccinations of their staff cth has been warning about the chicago

you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel the investing world is enthralled by a determined beijing as it cuts china s private sector down to size by relentless regulatory action that s good news for new delhi its more subtle maneuvers in the same direction are going largely unnoticed amazon com inc and walmart inc s flipkart however would surely have felt the rising temperatures even as they weigh draft e commerce rules that seek to restrict online marketplaces not just theirs but also the planned super app by india s tata group a new existential threat lurks around the corner a state sponsored open network for digital commerce commerce minister piyush goyal has set up a committee chaired by him to democratize digital commerce and provide alternatives to proprietary e commerce sites according to a ministry press release in china homegrown stores like taobao tmall and jd com have an unshakable dominance in online retail but now the only other billion people plus opportunity open to american capital is also slipping away from its grasp it s unclear how exactly india s open e commerce network will work or if it will work at all the template according to the press statement is the country s highly successful unified payments interface a public utility that allows any entity to process real time payments over smartphones provided a set of common protocols is followed the upi network has in a short time eclipsed proprietary card based payments fashioning a similar open network for online commerce will be a lot trickier it s easy to make a set of rules where there s a simple single point objective of satisfying the central bank that the same funds aren t being spent twice commerce by contrast involves far fuzzier outcomes did the consumer get the product she paid for did it arrive in one piece was the article genuine or a counterfeit was the returns policy enforceable additionally brands selling online have to worry about resellers creditworthiness and their ability to manage complicated distribution logistics in a country with poor physical infrastructure the ministry says that merchants will be able to save their data under the open network to build credit history and reach consumers breaking silos imposed by platforms to drive innovation and scale several questions arise are amazon and walmart flipkart which aren t directing even 10 of india s 800 billion annual retail sales between them stifling innovation to a point where the harm exceeds their positive influence from aggregating demand should they therefore be mandated to operate their merchant onboarding processes according to some preset rules eroding much of their power to determine what goes on over platforms in which they have invested billions of dollars like everywhere else the danger with dominant marketplaces in india is that they will copy the bestselling ideas of merchants and introduce them as private labels but is this threat currently so large as to require a systematic downgrading of platforms not allowed to own inventory the two dominant foreign owned marketplaces have solved many of the underlying problems of trust by using a handful of large sellers they can control this practice challenged by some traders groups as discriminatory is now in the crosshairs of india s competition regulator so intense is the scrutiny that amazon s joint venture with indian software tycoon narayana murthy has decided to fold up by the middle of next year the seven year old jv owns cloudtail the largest seller on amazon s india website as the news website morning context notes cloudtail helped relatively smaller manufacturers such as a saree brand from rajasthan acquire national reach on amazon something they may not have achieved on their own consumers are getting more choice than before once large platform aligned buyers like cloudtail are chased out amazon s customer satisfaction scores could be hard to sustain as india deliberately de emphasizes the platform model even the conglomerate tata group which is planning a marketplace extending from fashion and lifestyle to electronics may be handicapped if it s unable to sell a cup of starbucks coffee on its website that s because starbucks corp s joint venture in india with tata makes it a connected party which can t act as a seller on the super app according to draft e commerce rules ditto for walmart inc s separate wholesale unit as an affiliated entity of flipkart it may not be allowed to hawk a shirt on the retail website the winner may be someone pursuing a different business model for aggregating supplies mukesh ambani india s richest man controls both the largest chain of physical stores and the biggest telco ambani s reliance industries ltd could carry its own inventory using its 180 billion balance sheet to buy and stock third party merchandise and sell it online or offline or in a hybrid online offline setup a deliberate assault on the economics of digital platforms will possibly rank among the most far reaching separations of platforms and commerce seen anywhere in recent years save china s recent forced restructuring of ant group co s operations america s historic moves to segregate coal from railroads commercial enterprises from banking and television networks from programming took place in a very different era that ended with breaking up at t inc s lock on communications in 1982 but the pendulum is swinging again lina khan chosen by president joe biden to chair the federal trade commission is a keen proponent of a more muscular approach to reining in tech platforms this shifting zeitgeist gives new delhi the perfect cover to prepare its amazon slayer even though digital commerce in india is at present just a sideshow far bigger anticompetitive forces are at play in sectors ranging from telecoms and ports to airports but then politicians like to invent challenges that don t exist rather than tackle those that do an open digital commerce network is one such solution searching for a problem emasculating the economics of platforms will give a big advantage to retailers who are allowed to own inventory it could turn out to be more efficient but not necessarily more competitive
at an incredible speed hundreds of primary healthcare facilities healthcare institutions and private homes are receiving medical supplies delivered by drones in ghana this revolution in healthcare delivery is on its way to africa s most populous nation nigeria as cross river and kaduna are the flagship states for this innovation in healthcare delivery yinka olatunbosun reports on the operation of these life saving drones at the zipline distribution centre in omenako ghana spinning motors 3 2 1 was the announcement from the drone launcher and the journalists watched in awe the drone would deliver in five minutes to the designated health care facility in need of the packaged medical supplies the drone flies approximately 101km per hour and can fly up to 100km round trip on a single battery the two metre long drone usually has another battery as backup 60 of those deliveries happen on a daily basis at the facility in omenako ghana this innovation in healthcare delivery system is the brainchild of zipline rated as the world s only last mile aerial logistics company delivering medical commodities zipline is an american medical product delivery company with headquarters in south san francisco california that designs manufactures and operates delivery drones the company operates distribution centres in rwanda ghana and the us and has an academy where professionals such as pharmacist biochemists and engineers are trained on aspects of their operations as of february 2021 zipline drones have flown more than 4 million miles and made nearly 400 000 deliveries in the last five years mission with a mission to provide every human with instant access to vital medical supplies zipline began this movement in africa since 2016 starting with rwanda and then ghana delivering services to over 3 600 facilities from the current 13 hubs across the continent zipline has gained its altitude from helping to reduce the rates of avoidable deaths it is very rampant to hear that someone died because there was no blood pint within reach or there was delay in accessing a particular drug usually emergencies are reflective of the preparedness of any given healthcare system that is created to save lives hence zipline s drone services became a necessity in the rapid and efficient delivery of emergency product providing timely stock gap resupplies and disaster response powered by a reliable distribution system for remote and underserved communities zipline warehouse is built as an effective storage system for perishable medical products like blood which can only be stored for 42 days fore gleam a walk through the warehouse was conducted with the journalists from nigeria who came to witness first hand the operations of zipline ghana limited as a fore gleam of zipline in nigeria nestled in the thick bush was the zipline distribution centre in omenako about an hour drive from the city of accra the previous day senior vice president for africa zipline daniel marfo had received the journalists with a brief presentation and a documentary to showcase how the life saving drones function technology has opened the door to new possibilities being able to connect with a doctor through your phone and now receiving delivery of your medications at your doorstep via drone this partnership could lead the way in defining what instant decentralized service delivery will look like globally he declared he further revealed that zipline would start delivering covid 19 vaccines pharmaceuticals blood plasma and more to kaduna and cross river states we want to make sure that lives are not lost through logistical impediments we want to deliver drugs blood to people during emergencies like snake bites for instance he said with that piece of good news the journalists were buoyed up ready to tour the facility the next day unzipping zipline most shops in ghana were yet to open by the time the team set out on the journey to omenako on arrival their feet were clad in protective blue covers before access was granted into the maze of medical supplies like commercial flights operations zipline drones are housed at the drone port which is a critical component of every hub each hub contains the warehouse and the drone port the warehouse parades the best in class inventory management including specialized storage equipment and flight controls the drone post comprises the office and backup systems flight area launcher and drone recovery area but unlike airplanes the drones do not land they simply drop off the deliverable and return to the drone port the drones fly on predetermined routes and stay on their flight path using gps under the monitoring eyes of zipline staff while journalists were curious as to the safety of the medical supplies when dropped by the drone the performance operation lead florence haruna explained how each package is protected during the flight our packages are wrapped in a parachute once the drone gets to the facility it decreases its height to about 30 feet and with the aid of the parachute the package falls in a controlled manner a wrapping paper is padded to protect the products and beyond this we have something that serves a s a shock absorber when the package falls on the landing area with all the safety features there is a parachute that allows the product to fall without damaging we have a product validation team that is responsible for validating every product that we fly out we do several drops of the package and then we eliminate packing procedure that will cause breakages during the tests we discover breakages and we eliminate that packaging procedure and then do proper simulations and take out the best packaging procedure she revealed she walked past the refrigerating units explaining how blood products are stored and zipline s intervention in the current covid 19 pandemic we recently started flying the covid 19 vaccines we came up with a packaging procedure that kept the product intact we did the validation and were able to fly over five hundred and forty packages to them without breakages she said the zipline distribution centre in the northern part of ghana executes between 130 and 150 deliveries per day a package weighs about 1 75kg some routine checks are carried out on a daily basis while some on a weekly basis to ensure best air travel practices the drone has its in built parachute so that if there is an error it can come down by itself and we have sensitized the community where the drones operate so that they are not alarmed that is an integral part of our service we recover all our drones she said medical products are safety stored at each zipline hub to ensure that they are readily available at health facilities thus promoting patient trust in the healthcare system which in turn influences healthcare utilisation the facility has high safety and maintenance culture that makes drones consistent and reliable in strong winds heavy rain and high temperatures and deliver virtually any medication including prescriptions cold chain and infusions however windy conditions might just make a package move slightly from its usual target but not beyond the mapped out landing area as we soon discovered the sound of the approaching drone cut through the serenity of the lush garden in front of the primary healthcare centre some kilometres away from the hub as a result of this drone delivery services we have more patients because we don t run out of drugs instead of writing the drugs for them to go and buy zipline delivers it at no cost frank klomlawunu deputy chief physician at the apedwa health centre said after a drone delivered a package at the facility the cost of delivery had been covered by the national health insurance scheme in ghana the zipline intervention has made it possible to save no less than 600 cedis every month at the facility why nigeria needs drone delivery services the world health organisation defines access to medicine as a priority for citizens it must be available at all times in adequate amounts in appropriate dosage and quality an at an affordable price for individuals and communities it is estimated that two billion people do not have access to medicines and four million lives per year could be saved in africa and southeast asia with improved access to medicine in nigeria challenges that beset the supply chain for medical supplies include inadequate forecasting insufficient funds limited use of technology solutions poor road infrastructure insecurity and availability of vehicles it is against this backdrop that the zipline aerial logistics brings reduction in overall supply chain expenses reliable cold chain infrastructure 95 per cent wastage reduction due to reduction in expiries and optimisation of safety stock and good distribution practices samuel timothy a performance operations lead trained pharmacist and a nigerian from kaduna state who was part of the team that set up the kd1 hub in kaduna state explained why nigeria is in dire need of zipline drones to fast track access to medicine people have incidents of post partum hemorrhage a woman just got delivered and the nearest facility could be two hour drive away but in just 25 minutes a drone could reach her yesterday we still had the incident of a snake bite about 7pm and i was able to attend to that there is no cost to human life he said considerations for flying drones there are several pre conditions for flying any drone to avoid any counter productivity the wind direction and wind limit are some of the factors that are considered also there are legal expectations that must be met to be able to operate the communications consultant komla buami who led the team to a nearby healthcare facility that took delivery of a package dropped by a zipline drone explained why there was a little delay in the flight we wait for air clearance to fly the military is doing some operations around the area so once they finish then we can fly he said airspace authorities in the countries of operations have their flight schedule recorded and monitored which explains why there is no chance that a drone would collide with an airplane

investigative journalist azmat khan who has reported extensively in afghanistan says president joe biden has not yet addressed the chaos unleashed by the collapse of the afghan government in remarks on monday biden really focused on the decision to end the war and ignored criticism about chaos at the kabul airport and the abandonment of thousands of afghans who helped the u s over the last 20 years none of that was really discussed in any detail khan says she also discusses why the afghan military fell so quickly to the taliban its overreliance on u s air power how civilian casualties weakened support for the u s backed government and the massive profits the two decade long war generated for u s defense contractors transcript this is a rush transcript copy may not be in its final form amy goodman let s bring in azmat khan the investigative reporter who s covered afghanistan for years your response to president biden to the complete chaos at the airport the thousands of afghans who are trying to leave and the taliban victory in afghanistan overall azmat khan so president biden really focused on the decision to end the war and not on that searing criticism of this withdrawal the chaos we re seeing at the airport the leaving behind of many people to whom the united states had made promises people like translators people like local journalists who were working with american journalists as well as activists who now face not just great uncertainty like was earlier being talked about but significant threats to their lives and safety so none of that was really discussed in any detail but i think another omission that really needs to be highlighted is the fact that president biden took this negative view of afghan security forces for quote not fighting and that s not accurate you know as the earlier speaker was describing many afghan soldiers have died fighting the taliban over the last 20 years countless whereas american soldiers since operation freedom s sentinel began in 2015 you know we ve lost 64 american soldiers in hostile deaths in afghanistan so there is a real disparity about who was paying that human costs of that fight at least from the side that s fighting the taliban but at the same time what he didn t acknowledge was the fact that the entire way that those soldiers were doing that fight was with the support of u s air power so the united states was bombing heavily parts of that country where there were fights against the taliban raging so just to give some context in 2019 the united states dropped more bombs in afghanistan than in any previous year of the war so i think it was something close to more than 6 200 bombs that year as they were trying to negotiate so even with incredible bombs dropping you know this was the deal they were able to get and even then look at how many afghan soldiers were dying now once you take that level of air power out of the mix who would expect any afghan soldiers to continue to fight if that many afghan soldiers died with the support of air power what happens when you take that out of the mix now on top of that i just need to say that that air power may have helped keep this tenuous hold that the afghan government had on the country but it also killed scores of civilians in rural areas areas that don t often get talked about nearly three quarters of afghanistan is rural countryside the majority of the population comes from these kinds of areas populations that have seen the brunt of the war and we rarely hear about and they ve suffered not just bombings airstrikes and night raids but also taliban attacks and many of them wanted this war to end and you can t really talk about that air power and the tenuous grip that the government had without also acknowledging the ways in which that has created space for the taliban where even civilians who didn t like the taliban just wanted the war to end so it kind of makes sense once you take air power out of the mix that sort of tenuous hold falls but at the same time at this point the taliban has resuscitated itself and grown you know many of its more recent recruits were people who did lose loved ones and really wanted revenge for those casualties so in many ways as surprising the swiftness of it was it also makes sense what we see happening right now amy goodman the intercept reports that military stocks outperformed the stock market overall by 58 during the afghanistan war including boeing raytheon lockheed martin northrop grumman and general dynamics quote rom the perspective of some of the most powerful people in the u s may have been an extraordinary success notably the boards of directors of all five contractors include retired top level military officers you have written extensively azmat about these contracts and who financially profited from this war azmat khan it s really stunning it s incredibly stunning because people don t often talk about the massive wealth the people who maybe went to afghanistan temporarily got hazard pay and built themselves homes wealthy businessmen military former military officials who now by the way come on television talk shows to give their views without concealing necessarily their own the fact that they re on boards of many of these defense contractors so there has been incredible corruption on the part of many americans on the part of many contractors as well as just on the ground that has really helped to isolate local people from the afghan government and so just to give you some examples you know i spent a lot of time investigating u s funded schools in afghanistan something that we might consider the kind of untouchable success of the war right that in these 20 years the united states has radically transformed education for afghan children and in particular girls and i really dug into the schools the united states had funded and picked 50 of them in seven battlefield provinces and went to go see well you know what s happening at these schools now and when i would dig into it i think 10 of the schools either were never built or no longer exist a vast majority of them were falling apart and then when i would try to understand what happened you know for example in one case there was a school that was missing turns out it was built in the village of a notorious afghan police chief who was allied with the united states abdul raziq known for many human rights abuses and the local education chief said yes we built it here and there were no children in this village for three years so nobody really attended the school never opened for a number of years in another instance the school i arrived at was empty incomplete never finished and all the kids were across the street at a mosque having a religious education not the curriculum that they were on the books as recording having had and when i tried to figure out what happened it turned out the contract for the school went to the brother of the district governor who then you know pilfered the money and it was never finished as a result of that down the block in another part of kandahar the contract for a school was given to a notorious local warlord who s actually for the clinic that was going to be built next to the school was given to this notorious warlord who basically wound up being the source for the rise of the taliban in many ways his family was part of that sort of corruption in the early years that preceded the taliban that really riled up individuals to support the taliban because of the massive corruption and the human rights abuses that were happening to afghan people so even something as noble and as worthy of effort as education has been mired in this kind of corruption this kind of wheeling and dealing and if we had to understand why i think it s the fact that counterterrorism goals were baked into every single aspect of the american project in afghanistan so even something great like schools you know had these metrics had this desire to imbue a counterterrorism narrative of some kind that left them willing to work with people who were abusive actors in the name of fighting terrorism when in reality they often undercut afghan people and a lot of the promises of the united states at on almost every level amy goodman azmat khan i want to thank you for being with us and give lieutenant colonel ann wright the final word as you speak to us now from honolulu from hawaii and you look at what s happening in afghanistan where you were almost two decades ago what you think needs to happen and what you think americans should understand about the u s war in afghanistan ann wright well i think that the u s public ought to be very wary of every administration that thinks that we should take a military option in trying to resolve any sort of conflict we have seen that the united states in vietnam in iraq in afghanistan the lies that are told to us about why we need to go into countries with our military versus having some nonmilitary resolution to these issues is really really important and particularly as we face our government right now that s saying that china and russia are enemies that are threats to our national security we the u s people have to push back against our government against any more military invasions occupations attacks on any country and my heart goes out it bleeds for the people of afghanistan who have suffered through these decades long of war of violence and i certainly hope that the next years somehow calm down and that the taliban takes a very different tact than what it had when it was in power from 1996 to 2001 because the people of afghanistan deserve much better than what they have had thank you amy goodman well i want to thank you both for being with us and of course we ll continue to cover this i demoted you ann ann wright is a retired u s army colonel and former u s state department official who was part of the team that reopened the u s embassy in kabul afghanistan in december 2001 and azmat khan investigative reporter contributing writer at the new york times magazine we ll link to your articles including the one you described ghost students ghost teachers ghost schools when we come back we go to haiti where the tropical storm has slammed the same parts of the country shattered by the earthquake on saturday that s killed more than 1 400 people stay with us read more we are advised by muslim scholars that inshallah is often misused by westerners and muslims alike and of course i use it in a satircal manner as the heading of this blog inshallah is a dirty word it forces people especially women to submit to the will of old men who pose as representative of god it s a deceitful invention i shuddered in europe when it was still okay to travel when i heard my dinky dy whitey friends say the word as an integration of customs from the muslim world to appear progressive i could not argue they were trapped by the wrongside of multi culturalism suddlenly in a few short years they had lost their own willpower to that of fate dictated mostly by others old men in turbans sure the neat explanation of inshallah is god willing in our ventures not in dodging our laziness in refusing to do something but more often than not we have to do the opposite of god s will in order to be fair and knowledgeable the power of this little phrase word had wiped out the last 200 years of scientific observations and discoveries god willing bugger off as an atheist i reject the notion of freedom of religion when it is contrary to human rights and secular government as most religions have been against the notion of women s rights even in in the usa the rights of abortion is fought about on religious lines between traditionalists and religious progessives it s ugly we have to remember the altercation between trump and biden the religious man in a debate about trump taxes biden shows his ignorance of both business and religion biden uses inshallah in response to trump during debate during the first 2020 us presidential debate democratic presidential nominee joe biden dropped a phrase from everyday muslim and arab vocabulary and lit up the internet trump s tax minimisation scheme is legal he is not the first person nor the first president to use it remember our own kerry packer bless the great man an production highlights of kerry packer s 1991 house of reps select committee on print media appearance it includes perhaps the most famous australian anti government quote where packer says that anyone who pays more tax than they can get away with needs their head examined for more radical and principled politics from other great australians like john singleton lang hancock

so it s a surprise but not a shock that greenlight biosciences is taking part in the latest spacmania merger and is funding with environmental impact acquisition corp and will emerge sometime in the next several months on nasdaq as the sector s latest billion dollar baby the initial valuation in the deal is 1 2 billion more or less and includes a 100 million private placement that goes with the deal and supplements a recent 107 million private capital raise environmental impact acquisition corp is a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses the transaction in all the transaction is expected to generate proceeds to fund operations of 282 million assuming delivery of the full amount held in trust by envi and 105 million of fully committed pipe financing that includes s2g ventures cormorant asset management morningside venture investments hudson bay capital bnp paribas ecosystem restoration fund the jeremy and hannelore grantham environmental trust continental grain company pura vida investments llc xeraya capital and mls fund ii spruce why a surprise greenlight biosciences has come a long way since 2016 when as a young company with a promise of a revolutionary cell free manufacturing platform ceo and co founder andrey zaurer too the ablc stage in san francisco to introduce many of the delegates to their first taste of advanced rna technology at the time the focal point was a sustainable clean biological process at costs that can be 5x 1 000x lower than traditional comparable fermentation or organic synthesis and the target that generally was in discussion was pesticides and herbicides here it is as it was then why not a shock my the world has changed probably these days a million times as many people have now heard of rna as knew of it five years ago and in particular of mrna technology because pfizer and moderna have tapped the technology as the foundational platform for their covid 19 vaccines why mrna in short because it is faster to develop and speed matters when it comes to developing and deploying vaccines as we all now know but scale matters too producing billions of doses is no small feat so greenlight s technology for revolutionizing the production of mrna or utilizing rna interference to tap the power of biology to make sustainable pesticides that limit the growth of pests rather than simply killing them with noxious chemicals well in many ways this is the greenlight biosciences hour the greenlight backstory greenlight harnesses the power of biology to develop rna based solutions for some of humanity s greatest challenges in human health through mrna vaccines and therapeutics and in food production through rna crop protection products the company s breakthrough cell free rna manufacturing platform which is protected by numerous patents allows for cost effective and scalable production of rna for human health greenlight is developing an mrna manufacturing platform aimed at providing mrna based therapeutics at scale and an appropriate price

the latest resurgence of the coronavirus that last year virtually shut down most of the world has considerably clouded the previously bright outlook for crude oil demand driving prices down at the start of the week and capping gains made earlier today the latest covid 19 wave prompted movement restrictions in china plus the partial closure of some of the world s busiest ports there which also happen to be major oil hubs this has cast a shadow on the immediate prospect for demand from the world s top importer meanwhile infection numbers are soaring in the world s top consumer the united states adding fuel to demand worries hedge fund behavior confirms the bearishness reuters john kemp reported that hedge funds were net sellers of oil futures last week making it the sixth of the last eight weeks with net sales in the six most traded futures contracts for the week funds sold the equivalent of 64 million barrels of crude for the six week stretch sales equaled 213 million barrels with most of this in crude oil 183 million barrels and the remainder in fuels at the same time bargain hunters have emerged adding upward pressure to oil benchmarks reuters reported earlier today this was accompanied by expectations that opec would not be adding more barrels to its production anytime soon despite calls from the u s to that effect indeed unnamed sources from the extended cartel told reuters on monday that opec felt no need to boost production by more than it had already agreed which was 400 000 bpd from this month onwards until pre pandemic production levels are reached the sources noted opec members did not expect a shortfall of supply with the scheduled output additions especially in light of the latest fundamentals data from both opec itself and the international energy agency indeed the iea said last week the latest surge in covid 19 infections had hit the brakes on oil demand recovery and was reversing its direction global oil demand surged by 3 8 mb d month on month in june led by increased mobility in north america and europe the iea said in its latest oil market report however demand growth abruptly reversed course in july and the outlook for the remainder of 2021 has been downgraded due to the worsening progression of the pandemic and revisions to historical data adding further pressure on prices was the energy information administration s latest drilling productivity report released monday the report showed the eia expected u s shale oil production to inch closer to 8 1 million bpd next month which would be the highest since may last year although the monthly increase from august would be just 45 000 bpd any increase right now would be coming at the wrong time on the flip side at least according to iea data global oil stocks have been draining with oecd stocks 131 million barrels below the five year average as of june while this could lend some support to oil bulls the outlook for 2022 is for a surplus and although iea forecasts as any other forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt the combination of opec output additions and rising covid 19 case numbers is hardly bullish advertisement be that as it may trends from earlier this year showed just how quickly and strongly oil demand can recover on a global scale the rebound was so strong it devastated forecasts for a prolonged oil price depression and quickly had analysts talking about brent at 80 a barrel this suggests it could happen again once cases start going down in the meantime the upward potential of benchmarks would likely remain constrained even with the newly elevated geopolitical risk in the middle east following afghanistan s takeover by the taliban by irina slav for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

over the past three decades the rise of passively managed index funds has transformed how americans and other investors around the world invest in 1990 index funds held only less than 1 of all mutual fund assets by 2018 this had grown to more than 30 which worth over us 6 trillion and now represent the largest shareholders of many us corporations the massive rise in popularity of index fund investment drives the investors attention about monitoring and corporate governance a recent study by professor roni michaely professor in finance of hku business school and his co authors shows that comparing to active funds index funds monitor less effectively and cede power to firm management this results in negative consequences for corporate governance and firm value it may also further shift the power from investors to firm managements which would be of major concern to investors this research was done by professor michaely and co authors davidson heath and matthew ringgenberg from university of utah eccles school of business and daniele macciocchi from university of miami herbert business school the paper is accepted by the review of financial studies one of the premier journals for finance related academic researches three main options for a shareholder to disagree with a firm s management including voting engaging with management and selling shares professor michaely said to better evaluate and compare the monitoring behaviour of index funds and active funds we have examined each of these monitoring channels using comprehensive data on us equity mutual and exchange traded funds from 2004 to 2018 in the examination of the voting behaviour index funds vote with firm management 54 3 of the time while active funds do so only 47 3 of the time for contentious governance issues when examining the engagement of index funds with their portfolio firms the research finds no evidence that index funds engage publicly or privately with their portfolio firms in an effective manner when index funds hold more of a firm s stock the number or type of proposals that are tabled at annual shareholder meetings do not change and a decrease in the proportion of approved shareholder proposals is observed and in terms of divestment index funds do not exit a position even after losing a shareholder vote whereas active funds do meaning that they do not divest from a firm to express dissatisfaction with its management after a wide variety of tests and specifications the results suggest that index funds are weaker monitors than active funds relative to the active funds they are replacing index funds have limited incentives and resources to invest in costly monitoring professor michaely elaborated his findings moreover the data consistently shows that corporate governance does not improve and in fact deteriorates along several dimensions when index funds replace active funds we therefore can conclude that the rise of index investing shifts power from investors to corporate managers the findings have important policy implications as regulators around the world struggle with how to better govern and monitor management and firms behaviour especially in light of recent claims that index funds are good monitors who improve corporate governance there has been several suggestions to reward long term investors with greater voting power the findings of this paper that index funds who are long term investors are worse monitors indicate that rewarding them with greater voting power will result in the opposite outcome less monitoring and more power to management as the rise of passive investing continues a check on managerial power is suggested for balancing the interest between investors and firm management full version of this research paper do index funds monitor
an urban milwaukee retail store says prison inmates and their families could pay the price for a change in policy at the wisconsin department of corrections supplying personal property items to

jl marcus department store he just had a passion for this community weber said for this neighborhood that he grew up in weber s father realized more than 30 years ago there was a need for a store that could ship products to prisoners on behalf of their loved ones he thought hey i can do this on a grander scale weber said today weber said correctional sales are roughly 30 of the store s total business but they re about to lose that business thanks to a change in doc policy please don t do this to us said spriggie hensley father of an inmate a kettle moraine correctional institution hensley

constantly are out of stock it s just one nightmare after another trying to deal with em hensley said just before the pandemic the department of corrections said it wanted to streamline the product approval process so the department put out a request for bids for a single vendor contract we ve been doing this for 30 years we know what we re doing weber said but union supply narrowly outscored jl

new york cnn business afghanistan s currency has tumbled to record lows this week as the taliban seizes control of the impoverished nation and a shortage of us dollars sets off panic the afghani traded to 86 per us dollar on wednesday down sharply from about 80 a week ago according to refinitiv the currency plunge reflects concern about the future of afghanistan after the capital of kabul fell into the hands of the taliban a repressive militant group sanctioned by the united states and other world powers afghanistan s fragile economy relies heavily on us led international aid a lifeline that is now in severe doubt following the withdrawal by the united states military about 75 of public spending is financed through international aid grants according to the world bank the decline in afghanistan s currency will add pressure to inflation rising prices especially for food and necessities will hit the nation s poorest the hardest robert kahn director of global strategy at the eurasia group said a contributing factor for the currency drop is concern about a shortage of physical us dollars on which the afghan financial system is heavily reliant because its economy imports more than it exports the main challenge for the taliban regime will be to secure access to hard currencies to pay for imported goods and prevent a full blown balance of payments crisis said piotr matys senior fx analyst at in touch capital markets the next shipment never arrived in a pair of lengthy twitter threads afghanistan s central bank chief ajmal ahmady detailed a desperate attempt to stabilize the currency before he eventually fled the country on sunday friday we received a call that given the deteriorating environment we wouldn t get any more dollar shipments ahmady said he added that the central bank had to supply less currency to the market on saturday which further increased panic the afghani spiked from about 81 to nearly 100 on saturday ahmady said meltdown prompted him to hold meetings that day to reassure markets and currency exchanges to calm them down ahmady said ashraf ghani at the time still afghanistan s president spoke with us secretary of state antony blinken on saturday evening to request that dollar shipments resume something he said the us agreed to do in principle the next shipment never arrived seems like our partners had good intelligence as to what was going to happen ahmady said they urgently need to add an economist by sunday ahmady discovered the afghan leadership including ghani had fled the country it did not have to end this way ahmady said on twitter i was disgusted by the lack of any planning by afghan leadership afghanistan s central bank has close to zero hard currency left ahmady said given the shortage of dollars the taliban will likely have to implement capital controls he added currency will depreciate inflation will rise this will hurt the poor as food prices increase like most central banks afghanistan s holds most of its reserves overseas in the form of us treasuries gold and other assets ahmady said he has been told that taliban militants are asking central bank staffers about the location of assets if this is true it is clear they urgently need to add an economist on their team he added us blocks access to funds what will the imf do in recent days washington has effectively blocked the taliban from reaching assets held by the afghan central bank in the united states cnn has previously reported the international monetary fund is scheduled to send about 450 million to afghanistan next week but that money could be cut off given the taliban control of the country gop lawmakers sent a letter to treasury secretary janet yellen on tuesday urging her to intervene and prevent the imf from sending the funds the treasury department is taking steps to prevent the taliban from accessing the imf funds a treasury official told cnn on wednesday such a dispute is typically decided by a vote among imf members some of which have made clear they won t recognize the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan marc chandler managing director of bannockburn global forex fears the us financial crackdown on the taliban will backfire i worry that the us effort to punish the taliban for what happened two decades ago risks bringing about what it fears chandler said an impoverished economy will exacerbate the governance challenge and could weaken the taliban s hold on the country leaving room for non state actors terrorists what s next for afghanistan kahn the eurasia group director said the taliban s economic model has shown to be resilient in the past given the agrarian and decentralized basis of economic activity in afghanistan kahn said in an email to cnn their economic model has shown an ability to weather sanctions and limited access to formal financial markets resources the taliban has been sanctioned by the united states in part for human rights violations against women and girls including banning them education forced marriages and denying most of them access to employment matys the fx analyst at in touch capital markets said optimistic investors could argue afghanistan will become more stable in the future compared to the past two decades political stability even if it is provided by authoritarian regimes is an important factor for foreign investors who usually do not put democracy at the top of their list of priorities matys said if they have the list of countries worth investing in could prove very short
miramar florida spirit airlines announced that it lost 50 million and will see increased spending after cancelling 2 800 flights in a span of eleven days during the summer season spirit said its shortage of staff and the resurgence of the covid delta variant resulted in the large number of cancellations as well as fewer numbers of flights being booked spirit airlines hinted at flight reductions as part of its tactical schedule reductions strategy to run through the end of q3 in the wake of flights being cancelled along with fewer available flights the carrier has forecast q3 revenues at 885 million to 955 million a decline of 4 to 11 percent from the corresponding period in 2019 before the pandemic struck despite greater normalcy restored in airlines cancellation figures spirit noted that expenses had risen in an attempt to recover from the pandemic situation the company projected that its operational costs in q3 would be somewhat over 1 billion a nearly 20 percent rise as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 spirit made public these concerns when issuing regulatory documents following the close of the stock market on august 16 shares of the carrier have dropped over two percent spirit airlines confirmed 2 826 flight cancellations occurred during the july 30 august 9 period this summer there have been days when cancellations constituted over 60 percent of the carrier s overall fight schedule we believe the interruption was a singular event driven by an unprecedented confluence of factors and does not reflect systemic issues said spirit chief executive officer ted christie as quoted by associated press he noted that spirit has made investments to be one of the most efficient and reliable airlines in the u s industry and is taking steps to make sure we maintain that standard
short term investors are in a very risky zone as the broader market has cooled down people who do not have a very long term horizon should be wary of hospital and diagnostic stocks which have very high valuations at this point of time offering college course website indian school of business isb chief digital officer visit iim lucknow iiml chief operations officer programme visit iim kozhikode iimk chief product officer programme visit iim lucknow iiml chief executive officer programme visit india delinked from other emerging markets when the overall emerging market basket is going through a correction then one market cannot continue to rally these kinds of moves normally are unsustainable says analyst the markets have been in a huge momentum and also the indian markets have been delinked from whatever has been happening globally especially the other emerging markets we have seen deep cuts in many markets like brazil hong kong china and even korea saw a decent 5 6 cut from the top but we have rallied 5 6 in that same timeframe these kinds of moves normally are unsustainable because when the overall emerging market basket is going through a correction then one market cannot continue to rally that presents the risk to the markets because the valuation premium also keeps on going up so eventually the catch up happens i believe the market especially the people who are trading and investing short term are in a very risky zone because the broader market has cooled off reasonably many of the stocks have cooled off and corrected but there are a few sets of stocks especially on the consumer side like diagnostics or hospitals which have been rallying continuously and valuations have become very high i would think that people who do not have a very long term horizon should be wary of these stocks at this point of time when the next move happens financials have to perform this time the slack in the performance of the financial sector has been taken over largely by it in terms of the index movement most of the it stocks have continued to rally very hugely and are now trading at a huge premium to historical valuations so yes banks will have to take the slack in the next move but that does not mean that the next move is imminent overall the market needs to give up gains and the financials will also give up further gains as and when the corrective moves start yes the unlock trade has to play out whether it happens in the next three months or in the next one year it is a matter of what your horizon is it is very tough to predict whether we will also get a wave like we have seen come back in the uk or the usa where also the vaccination percentage was very high but the next wave came about do we have some sort of shield because those countries have administered largely mrna vaccines and in the uk the wave has not gone beyond a point of time because 60 of the vaccines were astrazeneca and effectively covishield whether we will get lucky only time will tell it is very tough for any of us to make any sort of prediction much of the value now lies in many of those stocks where the earnings are not much and the valuations have not gone up so high if we look at diagnostics or consumer stocks i would not be surprised that much of the prices which we are seeing now plus minus a few percentage points might not be seen in many of these stocks over the next one or two years there are two issues here one is the overall semiconductor shortage which is affecting the four wheeler companies more the two wheelers not so much the second is the overall slowdown in the demand for two wheelers in the domestic market which is impacting hero motocorp bajaj auto etc bajaj has its export business they have the three wheelers where the demand could come back as the unlock trade plays out so bajaj auto has been holding out reasonably but there also overall domestic market statistics do not look very goodin the four wheelers there is maruti but maruti has been talking about semiconductor shortages then what gets left are the commercial vehicle companies or m m m m is an interesting story because valuations are not very expensive it is in a new product cycle for its suvs and normally in new product cycles svus like its thar xuv700 are doing well typically mahindra mahindra tends to outperform in such cycles and it is a reasonable value play so i think it is a good stock to hold for one or two years tata motors has issues related to the availability of chips and the slowdown in the chinese economy a lot of demand for jlr comes from china and if that demand slows down that could impact them on top of that they have their margin stress story also so i would think even tata motors is not a play as of now

geneva switzerland the international air transport association iata announced global passenger traffic results for november showing continued strong traffic growth above the 10 year average rate of 5 6 total revenue passenger kilometers rpks rose 5 9 compared to the year ago period although below the october rate of 7 1 this largely was owing to the impact of factors that are expected to be short lived including the cessation of operations by transaero russia s second largest carrier and labor strikes at lufthansa the healthy demand continued despite some softening in economic growth in large part owing to falling fares data for the first ten months of the year show a 5 decline in average fares in currency adjusted terms november capacity available seat kilometers or asks increased by 4 2 and load factor rose 1 3 percentage points to 78 0 consumers continue to benefit from lower fares which are spurring demand the economy benefits from the stimulus to consumer spending and airlines are starting to achieve minimum acceptable profit levels it s good news all around but as we open 2016 economic risks are mounting said tony tyler iata s director general and ceo nov 2015 vs nov 2014 rpk

points to 76 2 weakness in emerging asia trade activity as well as slower than expected growth in china appear not to be impacting international rpks for asia pacific carriers european carriers saw demand increase by 2 2 the lower growth primarily was triggered by the aforementioned shutdown of transaero and labor issues at lufthansa capacity slipped 0 1 and load factor rose 1 7 percentage points to 79 5 highest among the regions north american airlines traffic climbed 2 1 in november while this was weaker than the year to date trend of 3 4 capacity dipped 0 2 boosting load factor 1 8 percentage points to 78 4 middle east carriers had a 9 8 demand increase in november capacity rose slightly faster at 11 5 causing load factor to dip 1 0 percentage point to 69 4 business conditions across the non oil producing private sectors of the uae and saudi arabia appear to be strengthening and this should help sustain solid expansion in air passenger demand for local carriers latin american airlines saw november traffic climb 10 7 compared to november 2014 capacity increased by 10 1 pushing load factor up 0 3 percentage points to 78 9 latin american carriers have seen robust growth in air travel but significant declines in yields with weakness in the key economies of brazil and argentina placing significant downward pressure on financial performance african airlines experienced their fifth consecutive month of positive traffic growth in november posting a 12 2 rise compared to november 2014 however the trend for the year to date so far remains weak with growth of just 1 3 reflecting adverse economic developments in parts of the continent including in nigeria which is highly reliant on oil revenues over the past few months exports from africa have held up better than they did earlier in 2015 and this could be helping boost international air travel on the region s carriers capacity rose 9 8 and load factor rose 1 5 percentage points to 65 1 domestic passenger markets domestic travel demand rose 6 4 in november compared to november 2014 but results were mixed with brazil russia and japan all showing declines domestic capacity climbed 4 4 and load

russian federation 7 1 10 6 71 7 us 9 1 5 3 84 5 domestic 6 4 4 4 81 1 india s strong results reflect notable increases in service frequencies ongoing economic strength and the timing of the diwali holiday which occurred in october in 2014 air travel in japan declined but measures of manufacturing activity improved strongly during the month which should support rising passenger demand the bottom line the airline industry is delivering solid financial and operational performance the industry s return on capital for 2015 and 2016 is expected to exceed its cost of capital a very rare occurrence this means we are on the path toward financial sustainability consumers are benefitting from lower fares and airlines are able to invest in new aircraft that are more comfortable quieter and more environmentally friendly passenger demand remains strong however the ongoing turmoil in the global financial markets and concerns over slowing economic growth in china are casting a shadow over the new year 2016 will be a historic year for aviation as states come together at the 39th international civil aviation organization assembly to discuss and i hope agree a market based measure that will allow airlines to achieve carbon neutral growth from 2020 said tyler
israel s largest grower and exporter of citrus is for the first time venturing out of the country to grow avocados in a move to meet the constantly rising global demand for the tasty superfood as ties between the jewish state and the north african kingdom have continued to deepen since their normalization agreement last year mehadrin has entered into a joint venture to grow avocados in morocco looking to expand production to africa and latin america in the hopes of producing the fruit year round and at lower costs planting the avocados in morocco is part of a larger plan to be able to supply our european customers more easily than from israel in terms of geography and in terms of more competitive costs shaul shelach ceo of mehadrin told the algemeiner the strategy to grow avocados outside of israel will be to have agricultural business in the southern hemisphere like africa and some geographies in latin america which will be exactly the opposite part of the year to be harvesting avocados mehadrin revenues come in large part from growing the profitable avocado crop and citrus as well as israel s prized medjool dates over the next decade the avocado is expected to be the fastest growing commodity of among fresh tropical fruits like mango pineapple and papaya as demand continues to outstrip supply avocado is a superfood and the per capita consumption is growing very fast in the us and in europe while at the same time there are very large amounts of planting of avocado also in israel in latin america and in africa shelach remarked what we experience today is that everyone is running after the avocado as most of the year there are some low stocks or shortages of avocados which is not what will be the case five years from now avocado production is forecasted to more than triple by 2030 compared with 2010 levels at 12 metric tons according to the oecd fao agricultural outlook 2021 2030 becoming the most traded major tropical fruit for now mehadrin exports avocados grown in israel to customers in europe during a limited period between october to march or april its growing season in the jewish state besides limited window the high cost of water in israel has helped push mehadrin is toward other geographies for its avocado line to ensure a competitive and efficient business even when the supply of the fruit is saturated in april the israeli grower struck an agreement with a moroccan company in which it will hold a 51 stake the two partners plan to lease land stretching across an area of at least 5 000 dunams 1 235 acres and jointly invest about 9 million over a three year period the plantation will be leased from the moroccan government and the maximum annual output is expected to be around 10 000 tons of avocados in morocco which is close to us and close to europe we found the basic advantages needed for growing avocado the needed type of land water weather and lower labor costs it s not a country with a long tradition of growing avocado but we have all the know how and experience for that shelach explained israel is a country with a very long tradition of growing them and optimal conditions so we have a lot of advantages in the know how of growing avocados we learned throughout the years when you have to do what in order to get the utmost out of the avocado tree which involves the treatment of the trees in the orchard and choosing the right parts of the tree you plant he said we say about the tree that what you give it it gives you back the agreement comes after israel and morocco in late 2020 resumed diplomatic ties as part of a normalization agreement brokered by the us joining other arab countries including the united arab emirates and bahrain a july report from israel s regional cooperation ministry and the israel export institute said that israeli exports to morocco could eventually reach some 250 million annually the political atmosphere helps to go to morocco this year rather than two or three years ago shelach added shelach expects that the two partners will receive the land from the moroccan government in the coming two weeks after which they plan to start planting in march it will then take two to three years to begin reaping fruit and five years for all of the avocado trees to come to full harvest in coming years about 74 of avocado production is expected to remain in latin america and the caribbean due to the favorable growing conditions in this region according to the oecd report the us and the european union where consumer interest in avocados is fueled by the fruit s supposed health benefits are expected to remain the main importers with 40 and 31 of global imports in 2030 respectively shelach said that about 85 of the avocados would likely be sent to europe with the rest sold in the local market in morocco our next step is to look for the right partners for two more businesses to grow avocados in africa and latin america in seasons that they don t grow in israel he said

by andy mukherjee the investing world is enthralled by a determined beijing as it cuts china s private sector down to size by relentless regulatory action that s good news for new delhi its more subtle maneuvers in the same direction are going largely unnoticed amazon com inc and walmart inc s flipkart however would surely have felt the rising temperatures even as they weigh draft e commerce rules that seek to restrict online marketplaces not just theirs but also the planned super app by india s tata group a new existential threat lurks around the corner a state sponsored open network for digital commerce commerce minister piyush goyal has set up a committee chaired by him to democratize digital commerce and provide alternatives to proprietary e commerce sites according to a ministry press release in china homegrown stores like taobao tmall and jd com have an unshakable dominance in online retail but now the only other billion people plus opportunity open to american capital is also slipping away from its grasp it s unclear how exactly india s open e commerce network will work or if it will work at all the template according to the press statement is the country s highly successful unified payments interface a public utility that allows any entity to process real time payments over smartphones provided a set of common protocols is followed the upi network has in a short time eclipsed proprietary card based payments fashioning a similar open network for online commerce will be a lot trickier it s easy to make a set of rules where there s a simple single point objective of satisfying the central bank that the same funds aren t being spent twice commerce by contrast involves far fuzzier outcomes did the consumer get the product she paid for did it arrive in one piece was the article genuine or a counterfeit was the returns policy enforceable additionally brands selling online have to worry about resellers creditworthiness and their ability to manage complicated distribution logistics in a country with poor physical infrastructure the ministry says that merchants will be able to save their data under the open network to build credit history and reach consumers breaking silos imposed by platforms to drive innovation and scale several questions arise are amazon and walmart flipkart which aren t directing even 10 of india s 800 billion annual retail sales between them stifling innovation to a point where the harm exceeds their positive influence from aggregating demand should they therefore be mandated to operate their merchant onboarding processes according to some preset rules eroding much of their power to determine what goes on over platforms in which they have invested billions of dollars like everywhere else the danger with dominant marketplaces in india is that they will copy the bestselling ideas of merchants and introduce them as private labels but is this threat currently so large as to require a systematic downgrading of platforms not allowed to own inventory the two dominant foreign owned marketplaces have solved many of the underlying problems of trust by using a handful of large sellers they can control this practice challenged by some traders groups as discriminatory is now in the crosshairs of india s competition regulator so intense is the scrutiny that amazon s joint venture with indian software tycoon narayana murthy has decided to fold up by the middle of next year the seven year old jv owns cloudtail the largest seller on amazon s india website as the news website morning context notes cloudtail helped relatively smaller manufacturers such as a saree brand from rajasthan acquire national reach on amazon something they may not have achieved on their own consumers are getting more choice than before once large platform aligned buyers like cloudtail are chased out amazon s customer satisfaction scores could be hard to sustain as india deliberately de emphasizes the platform model even the conglomerate tata group which is planning a marketplace extending from fashion and lifestyle to electronics may be handicapped if it s unable to sell a cup of starbucks coffee on its website that s because starbucks corp s joint venture in india with tata makes it a connected party which can t act as a seller on the super app according to draft e commerce rules ditto for walmart inc s separate wholesale unit as an affiliated entity of flipkart it may not be allowed to hawk a shirt on the retail website the winner may be someone pursuing a different business model for aggregating supplies mukesh ambani india s richest man controls both the largest chain of physical stores and the biggest telco ambani s reliance industries ltd could carry its own inventory using its 180 billion balance sheet to buy and stock third party merchandise and sell it online or offline or in a hybrid online offline setup a deliberate assault on the economics of digital platforms will possibly rank among the most far reaching separations of platforms and commerce seen anywhere in recent years save china s recent forced restructuring of ant group co s operations america s historic moves to segregate coal from railroads commercial enterprises from banking and television networks from programming took place in a very different era that ended with breaking up at t inc s lock on communications in 1982 but the pendulum is swinging again lina khan chosen by president joe biden to chair the federal trade commission is a keen proponent of a more muscular approach to reining in tech platforms this shifting zeitgeist gives new delhi the perfect cover to prepare its amazon slayer even though digital commerce in india is at present just a sideshow far bigger anticompetitive forces are at play in sectors ranging from telecoms and ports to airports but then politicians like to invent challenges that don t exist rather than tackle those that do an open digital commerce network is one such solution searching for a problem emasculating the economics of platforms will give a big advantage to retailers who are allowed to own inventory it could turn out to be more efficient but not necessarily more competitive facebook twitter linkedin email disclaimer views expressed above are the author s own

q how do you define esg esg refers to environmental social and governance performance attributes esg became a buzzword and a concept in and of itself in the last 5 to 10 years as investors started to see data that suggested that external environmental and social trends were creating financial impact on companies there has been an explosion of funds labeled as esg they are not all created equal in terms of the level and integration of esg information regulators have noticed the eu has already passed a first draft of a regulation directing fund managers to meet certain criteria in order to label themselves as esg they re explicitly trying to cut out the greenwashing the u s may well follow suit soon there are a number of investment strategies that use esg information the most common one by far is what we call an esg integrated strategy this is an investor looking to equal or beat market returns and they believe to do that they need to understand the environmental social and governance risks facing companies they see esg as an additional financial fundamental needed to predict companies performance there are other ways that you can use esg impact investors are drawing on the same pools of information to do slightly different things they will accept a slightly lower than market rate return in order to prioritize doing something to help save the world a little bit some esg strategies divest completely from certain sectors or only invest in other sectors i see numbers that show a third or more of all global assets under management starting to integrate esg factors into their decision making that rings true to me because i take a broad view of it if you take a narrower view the numbers get smaller it comes down to what you count as esg investing in terms of impact on companies and capital flows the biggest group is the investor that sees esg information as financially material q why does esg matter esg is a framework for looking at huge megatrends that are creating risks that companies are exposed to climate change comes with severe weather rising seas droughts wildfires it s driving the transition to clean energy climate related regulations are here or on the horizon there are trillions and trillions of dollars of risk there are also trillions of dollars of opportunity scientists are telling us there is about 22 trillion in exposure to climate change risks over the next 10 years in the americas we re looking at half a trillion dollars of agricultural productivity lost every year as a result of biodiversity degradation those are huge dollar value risks if all these things come to play climate change biodiversity impacts inequality the general drag on the economy is going to be between 5 and 20 of global output that wipes out all economic growth at a macro level that is catastrophic to economic markets in general but individual companies will suffer more or less esg matters because it s a way to understand the risks associated with these megatrends and it s a way to understand what companies are doing to respond is a company going to be paying or making money as a result of these enormous megatrends investors want to know if companies are ignoring it or prepared for it what are their management governance controls training auditing data collection continuous improvement process operational performance metrics that can mitigate the damages from external risks are companies moving to take advantage of opportunities are they positioned for the renewable energy transition q is esg our biggest bet on a market driven solution to climate change yes governments set our direction through policies and regulations that s the steering wheel a government says we need a market based system to curtail carbon emissions once the mechanisms are set up then the market steps on the accelerator and says here comes the capital to do that because the flow of capital to address climate change is predominantly around esg analysis and factors esg is the engine right now empirical studies show that companies with stronger performance across a broad swath of esg tend to do better financially we don t know exactly what in esg is driving this but we know it is q when did esg become a thing esg is an evolution of corporate social responsibility csr and corporate sustainability ideas that have been around for 30 plus years drawing on elements of compliance and philanthropy the idea is that corporations should be responsible citizens with csr and sustainability companies need to be responsible for the impacts that they create on the environment and society the arrow flowed outwards from the company to society with esg the arrow flows in what are the financial risks associated with impacts from environmental and social trends flowing into the company one caveat here is that some environmental social and governance risks are inherently about perception greenwashing can create financial performance through a reputational boost but it also creates a huge downside risk if you get caught sustainability and esg are two sides of a coin so it s not too surprising the concepts do get blended in practice the distinction i d make is that esg is focused on the financially material aspects of environmental social governance on the business whereas sustainability is implied to have a broader lens on those aspects that might not be financially material to the company but are still the right good and responsible things to do q what sorts of costs do you see with an esg lens there are three buckets direct indirect and intangible for direct there are obvious ones in regulated markets where there s a price on carbon companies pay per ton of carbon produced another example is climate change creating more difficult operating conditions a company might have to put resources into adapting processes building seawalls or even moving their operations human capital can become an indirect cost if you re in an area where the education system isn t robust or there isn t a social safety net that allows people to pursue advanced degrees as opposed to having to go straight to the workforce that costs companies money because they can t get the best people or they have to pay more for the equivalent people finally there s the intangible historically about 80 of the stock price of publicly traded companies was the book value while 20 was intangible that has completely flipped today now in the s p 500 almost 80 of stock price is intangible value intangible value is so tied up with brand and reputation that any action by a company that reduces its social and environmental capital can reflect back with an outsized impact on their stock price i e people look at a company s esg choices and say oh you re not a responsible company i m not going to purchase from you or i m going to say bad things about you on social media or i m not going to work for you because i consider you to be evil the challenge for an investor with any given company is which of these aspects should i be most concerned about how is that cost that damage or that opportunity going to come into the company and how do i assess whether they ll be able to mitigate or manage those risks q is that why we ve seen an explosion in esg data over the last five years we ve seen a hockey stick like rise in esg data investors have been pushing for better and better data specifically to understand the mechanism by which the risk is going to materialize within the company and whether the company has the means to mitigate the risk when we started seeing empirical studies showing that companies with stronger performance across a broad swath of esg tended to do better financially that led to a narrative of we don t know exactly what in esg is driving this but we know in aggregate it is many companies were already putting out voluntary sustainability reports typically following the global reporting initiative or similar standards in addition we ve been seeing more disclosure in the financial reports around climate change severe weather inequality etc as companies realize these are important fiduciary issues data analytics firms scrape both company reported data and huge outside datasets to try to understand companies exposures everything becomes a source of information an analytics firm measures the length of the shadows cast by the floating lids on 20 000 oil tanks around the world to understand oil inventory investors want data on how many assets a company has in tornado alley do they have sufficient insurance coverage do they have backup generation and a business resilience plan all of this has led to two things first it has exponentially increased the transparency on companies in esg and second there s this push to figure out what exactly we are looking for q do we know what we re looking for the level of nuance in the data lets investors track down correlations between financial materiality and esg aspects the holy grail is the causal relationship investors want to know companies that do this are going to perform better financially they re trying to find the this here s an example of the learning curve we ve seen pacific gas and electric pg e has famously strong sustainability reporting yet it declared bankruptcy as an indirect result of climate change the company was held liable for wildfires caused by line sparking which were exacerbated by climate driven drought conditions pg e s sustainability reporting focused on their incredible greenhouse gas reduction targets they didn t highlight how climate change could impact the company itself and how they were responding as companies and investors get better at this they learn to report how climate change is being internalized by the company pg e s assets are predominantly in drought and water stressed regions of the united states fire danger was key so what investors would have liked to have known what the plan was for preventing sparking of transmission lines we re at a point now where through these huge datasets we can try to figure out the externalized risks and whether companies are responding those internalization pathways are not always obvious but that s where we are q the e of esg gets a lot of focus why is there less on s and g e has better data we know the impacts of climate change we re understanding the impacts of biodiversity those are huge megatrends we understand how much money is at risk the s is much more difficult to measure it s hard to point to an individual company and say do they have the s right or not some social aspects inequality diversity equity and inclusion and human capital management are becoming clearer in terms of the scale of the potential impact and what data is needed to track within a company but there s a whole lot of s that is much more difficult to assess the reason we don t talk about the g much is that governance was a big deal in financial markets long before the esg acronym came into place q is there a role for government the role of government is huge and important in sustainability and esg i think esg s transparency is good but we should not expect it to save the world we still need to protect people s health we still need to protect species whose extinction won t have financial repercussions for companies areas where markets aren t providing clear guidance yet they re important to society that s where governments are supposed to function q where do things stand with regulators the sec hasn t established any regulations yet but they ve reopened the books on the definitions and best practices of esg disclosure and materiality there was also a red flag warning by the sec about fund managers advertising climate benefits without having the evidence to back that up in regulator terms they re moving pretty quickly the eu has begun to enact regulations so the sec now has a template that they can use i think that we ll probably see some sort of guidance around climate change come out of the sec in 2022 after that we may get guidance around esg disclosures more broadly q based on your research what does this whole thing look like from within companies we looked at esg information flows within organizations focused in particular on climate risk we found that cross functional committees are incredibly important drawing in operations finance marketing and communications investor relations general counsel and so on lets companies develop different perspectives on esg data and integrate it into enterprise risk management looking for more insights sign up to get our top stories by email email thanks for signing up one of the big shifts from corporate sustainability of yesteryear to today s esg is the increasing role of the general counsel the legal implications of calling an esg issue financially material are much more significant than saying it s important to a lot of our stakeholders and it s not just the disclosure side general counsels are in some cases very concerned about the potential liability associated with making claims in esg even if the claims can be supported the worry is it opens companies to liability that would be outside of marketing speech q what are you imagining in terms of a positive approach to standardizing and regulating this reporting dan esty and i have proposed a theory of change on the policy side we envision a three tiered structure of disclosure that we think will be effective at meeting the expectations of most institutional investors and large asset managers helping to ease the burden on companies and also creating more capital flow to sustainable investments at the core of this policy proposal would be a small set of esg indicators that are clearly financially material to the vast majority of the economy think financial risk from climate change biodiversity and ecosystems loss socioeconomic inequality and maybe social safety nets with this small set it makes sense to have a regulation that says we re all going to report on it in the same way and this is how we re going to do it that would serve investors the constituents of that government and those who can use the information flow it generates to understand issues and frame national policy a second tier of indicators are sector specific in those cases we would not propose a regulation instead we see the companies in the sectors together with academics policy experts and civil society representatives hammering out best practices in reporting if the handbook is in front of you it s easier to start disclosing so most companies would especially when investor interest creates a market lever to incentivize disclosure and the third tier is for lack of a better term the great unwashed of esg metrics it s that huge pool of reputation information social media geospatial data and everything else some investors tap into to try to find advantage we envision that as purely voluntary companies can disclose it if they want to try to influence the narrative or they can keep their mouth shut and let investors and civil society try to figure it out themselves

the ministry says that merchants will be able to save their data under the open network to build credit history and reach consumers breaking silos imposed by platforms to drive innovation and scale several questions arise are amazon and walmart flipkart which aren t directing even 10 of india s 800 billion annual retail sales between them stifling innovation to a point where the harm exceeds their positive influence from aggregating demand should they therefore be mandated to operate their merchant onboarding processes according to some preset rules eroding much of their power to determine what goes on over platforms in which they have invested billions of dollars like everywhere else the danger with dominant marketplaces in india is that they will copy the bestselling ideas of merchants and introduce them as private labels but is this threat currently so large as to require a systematic downgrading of platforms

economynext for sri lanka to move out of its dollar and debt crisis it needs to attract new investors to the country by portraying as a investor friendly country with returns a business leader said what we need at this point is export dollars foreign exchange and get us out of the debt trap that we are in vishgovindasamy the newly elected president of ceylon chamber of commerce said this means srilanka has to be portrayed around the world for investors to come and invest in sri lanka govindasamy is also the managing director of sunshine holdings plc a diversified conglomerate listed in the colombo stock while we portray that we as a nation we must also make sure that we are investor friendly and the people who come here to invest get the benefit of the investment and go forward he said he made these comments at a virtual press brief held to introduce the new office bearers of ceylon chamber of commerce new finance minister the chamber of commerce has presented to the newly appointed finance minister key short term and long term structural reforms that needs to be taken up chamber has requested the minister to allow some flexibility in the exchange rates and not hold it at particular levels we requested that there be a greater flexibility in the exchange rate and not to hold it at a particular levels this way the economic conditions will take care of what happens he said chamber also feels that there is a disparity between sri lanka rupee interest and the us dollar interest we suggested that the minister to consider increasing the local interest rates by 25 to 50 basis points so that will take away the arbitrage that is going around and get the exporters to bring in their dollars and suggested that seeking support from imf will be good economists and analysts however have pointed out that sri lanka has a fundamentally flawed monetary regime coming from a latin america style central bank with anchor conflicts targeting a domestic inflation index while collecting reserves by intervening in forex markets either to buy or sell dollars actions which change the monetary base though the rupee has been depreciated from 4 70 to below 200 it has not solved the problem a so called flexible exchange was depreciated from 131 to 182 from 2015 to 2019 amid liquidity injections apparently to target inflation flexible inflation targeting see more srilanka s rupee faces crisis after crisis because it operates a flexible exchangerate backed by contradictory money exchange policies as i advised president suharto of indonesia in 98 the only options are to dollarize or est a currency board steve hanke steve_hanke september 10 2019 however the rupee is still falling without reforming the monetary regime it will not be possible to have free trade analysts and economists have said sri lanka has been hit by trade and exchange restrictions since the latin america style central bank was set up in 1950 trade restrictions the other suggestions they have made to the minister are that to systemically ease restriction on capital and intermediary goods for economic growth to give priority to tourism and export sector to look in to cost of living and make sure there is good distribution of food supply and there is no food shortage and to make available enough foreign exchange for the export sector to bring their raw materials while giving priority to the tourism sector govindasamy says the loan moratoriums given to tourism sector should be extended beyond september we also encouraged the government to have a global tourism promotion by late 2021 to early 2022 he said to implement and speed up the suggested reforms chambers want the government to set up a secretariat in the median term in addition chamber wants sri lanka to attract ftas from european countries especially uk chamber says after uk separated from eu they have started many ftas in african region so what we felt was uk being of the largest export destinations both for apparel and seafood and many other supplies it would be a good thing geopolitics meanwhile chambers has met with the former foreign minister dinesh gunawardena to discuss about the gsp plus issue and how sri lanka could work around the issues that the eu parliament is raising we asked the minister to separate out the geopolitics that is there and the trade if we were to separate that out maybe we can focus on the trade and what needs to be done the minister had assured that most of the of these countries who have similar issues tend to keep business relationship separate and continue which was a positive thing govindaswamy said he further added that there are a lot of opportunities with different business parks being created the pharmaceutical and services park that is being created in hambantota there will be a lot opportunities there chamber proposes to set up large export houses in the country while promoting tourism exports and remittance that bring foreign exchange to sri lanka some of the countries like vietnam have done that and they are successful so we have to go seek some of these large export houses so that we can have a much more bigger export out of sri lanka and because our location literacy and production we seriously think its possible colombo aug18 2021

by tommy wilkes london reuters if you want to invest in a fund branded as sustainable under new european union rules you re spoilt for choice but you may end up owning shares in oil companies mining conglomerates or tobacco firms a reuters analysis of funds marketed to retail investors increasingly hungry for anything green shows asset managers are adopting a wide range of strategies to justify the sustainable label since the eu brought in disclosure rules in march the eu s sustainable finance disclosure regulation sfdr is an attempt to deliver transparency for investors focused on environmental social and governance esg issues but fund managers say the definition of sustainability is too vague and has created confusion about what makes the cut take the allianz global water fund it actively invests in companies that improve the supply management and quality of water and is marketed as falling under article 8 of the sfdr which means it is a fund that promotes among other characteristics environmental or social characteristics or a combination of those characteristics now take one of legal general investment management s lgim article 8 exchange traded funds etf the l g uk equity ucits etf tracks the solactive core united kingdom large mid cap index which excludes coal miners and firms that make weapons such as cluster bombs or have breached u n principles on corporate values its top 10 holdings are the same as for l g funds tracking the ftse 100 index that don t carry the article 8 label and include oil giants bp and royal dutch shell miner rio tinto and british american tobacco l g said the fund was considered article 8 because it promotes sustainability characteristics by applying lgim s future world protection list and this was a binding element of the investment process the lens we should use is what is right it s not just about what is legally required because it seems not very much is legally required said eric christian pedersen head of responsible investments at nordea asset management green rush the new eu rules have sparked a rush by investment firms to badge products as sustainable as they seek to grab a share of the booming market in sustainable mutual funds that hit a record 2 3 trillion in the second quarter from march 10 the rules automatically placed all investment funds into a coverall article 6 category managers could then upgrade them to article 8 or article 9 which is for products with an explicit sustainable investment objective the investment industry has dubbed article 8 funds light green and article 9 dark green though the eu regulations do not use those terms a european commission spokesperson said its rules were designed to ensure funds were transparent about the sustainability of products so investors could make choices and was not a labelling scheme reuters asked 20 of the biggest fund houses for a list of products they market as article 8 or 9 an analysis of the funds of the 14 firms that replied shows some article 8 products have limited claims to sustainability such as those tracking conventional stock and bond indexes investing in fossil fuels or buying debt from countries with weak esg standards such as saudi arabia and nigeria some claims hinge on funds excluding securities they would not have bought anyway based on the index being tracked for some in the industry this represents so called greenwashing where the benefits of a business or asset are exaggerated to attract environmentally aware investors hortense bioy director of sustainability research at morningstar said article 8 funds ranged from climate themed green to very very light green excluding just a few firms managers need to ask if they are even relevant she said that is the key message investors shouldn t expect anything from article 8 index trackers industry experts say none of the asset managers is breaking any rules managers determine themselves which article to apply and brussels does not check whether claims are justified the reuters analysis shows some managers are more likely to brand funds as sustainable than others two of europe s biggest firms alliance bernstein and axa investment management classify nine in every 10 euros of assets they manage under the scope of sfdr as article 8 or 9 according to data they supplied to reuters others such as pictet asset management and allianz global investors place a little over half of their relevant assets in those categories their data showed morningstar data published in july shows a third of the assets falling under sfdr are now billed as article 8 or 9 with article 6 products disappearing from recommendation lists sent by investment advisers to retail investors many article 8 funds have clear sustainability criteria such as strategies that invest in businesses with the lowest carbon impact in their sectors or allianz s water focused fund for others that s not always the case candriam s cleome index europe equities is another article 8 product it tracks the msci europe index but excludes companies that don t comply with the u n principles critics say such exclusions are very limited when asked for an example candriam did not point to any company expelled from the u n list that is also part of msci europe the candriam fund s top 10 holdings replicate the index a candriam spokesperson said it also applies exclusions on companies materially involved in controversial weapons tobacco and thermal coal and the cleome equity fund uses proprietary esg analysis relative to the benchmark justifying article 8 morningstar analysis shows one in four article 8 funds has exposure to companies involved in controversial weapons and one in five to tobacco a third of article 8 and 9 funds have more than a 5 exposure to fossil fuel firms nasty esg demand for funds with a sustainable label is soaring there is a clear commercial opportunity said eric borremans head of esg at switzerland s pictet asset management which classes 57 of its assets as article 8 or 9 borremans said pictet had no index tracking article 8 funds but planned to apply the label to some after incorporating more exclusions u s investment giant blackrock told reuters it expected to exceed a target of putting 70 of its new or rebranded products this year under articles 8 or 9 some funds use esg thresholds to justify sustainable labels jpmorgan asset management says 51 of the securities in its article 8 range must carry an esg score in the top 80 these are scores fund firms or third party providers give companies based on esg metrics such as carbon usage governance or human rights in supply chains critics say such thresholds are too weak you have funds saying most of our holdings are not nasty and therefore i m esg said pedersen at nordea which requires 100 of its article 8 holdings be above a minimum esg score the jpmorgan threshold for example also means 49 of companies in its funds could rank in the bottom 20 for esg goals although the funds exclude sectors such as tobacco controversial weapons and coal miners jpmorgan asset management did not respond to questions about esg scores a spokesperson said the firm remained focused on a thoughtful and thorough approach to the implementation of sfdr pictet s borremans said funds interpreting the rules loosely now can get away with it but strategies sailing close to the wind will eventually be exposed by next year the eu will flesh out its taxonomy a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities and from july 2022 funds must detail how they meet sustainability criteria based on the eu s regulatory technical standards rts that will clarify disclosure requirements it could hurt the reputation of an asset manager to offer financial products as falling under article 8 and 9 or as taxonomy aligned if this cannot subsequently be backed when the rts enters into application the european commission spokesperson said in emailed comments amundi s head of cross border product florian schneider said sfdr rules made clear products with minimal exclusions were article 8 the danger is everyone blindly assuming all article 8 funds

wicked local jason russell site as an 81 year lifelong resident of arlington who has visited the jason russell house many times over the years i have always thought of the jason russell site as hallowed ground on april 19 1775 there were more casualties on this site than there were in the battles of lexington and concord combined the lexington battle green is an historical landmark that commemorates the events of april 19 1775 the jason russell site is also an historical landmark and should be thought of and treated with pride and respect this past monday aug 9 i watched the selectboard meeting and to my dismay the selectboard approved with the support of the historical society the use of this site for a beer garden without any pushback from anyone this location will not benefit the merchants since it is not central to the center or adjacent to the bike path and remote from the russell parking lot i understand the decision to not go forward with town day festival relative to covid concerns but to later allow a for profit beer garden festival to take place on this property is shameful why is one event safer and more important than the other i called the lexington selectboard office to inquire about permitted and prohibited uses of the lexington battle green the person i spoke to was very helpful in giving me an overview of the rules and regulations and referred me to the battle green website for more detailed information after looking at the website i concluded that a for profit beer garden would not pass muster on this site as a town we seem to disregard this important part of our history while our neighbors to the north concord and lexington appreciate promote and are proud of the role they played on april 19 1775 i am proud of our patriots and the sacrifices the made on this day and will continue to respect this site as a hallowed ground bob radochia columbia road we need more market rate and affordable housing cheryl marceau more market rate housing does not create affordability aug 12 is correct to observe that the income profile of workers in a region is a major driver of housing prices however her apparent solution restricting development is far off the mark high paid workers can choose to live wherever they want if they want to live in the boston region because that s where the jobs are or arlington in particular they can out bid lower paid tenants or buy up older housing stock and do gut renovations or tear down rebuilds to suit their needs that puts more pressure on older ownership and rental housing stock which is naturally more affordable and drives up prices of existing stock for everyone building new housing that meets the needs of high income workers helps take pressure off the used housing market new housing production cannot just be focused on the high end though it needs to include units at a range of sizes styles and affordability levels to meet the income profiles of all residents that s why measures such as inclusionary zoning accessory dwelling units reducing parking requirements and regulation of multi family buildings based on floor space rather than number of units are all helpful this last measure gives developers an incentive to build more smaller units at lower price points rather than maximizing the size and revenue per unit affordable housing is a complicated problem and there is no silver bullet but production of more housing in all our communities and across the entire spectrum of affordability levels is a critical part of the solution chris porter lakehill avenue rodenticide use this past week we were informed that there has been another confirmed death of a bald eagle from rodenticide poisoning many of us have been watching this eaglet as she developed she was a delight to observe and we were all hoping to see her grow into a beautiful adult her death by rodenticide poisoning was confirmed by mass wildlife this past week most likely the result of ingesting a poisoned rodent the irony is these are the very animals that effectively eliminate rodents by nature and help us with the rodent issue this is a danger to every bird or animal that preys on rodents including pets like cats many people believe rodenticide found as bait in the black boxes placed around businesses restaurants and residences only kills rodents this is not true it also poisons and kills the animals and birds that prey on them the rodents eat the bait in the box leave the box and live for days in a weakened state becoming easy prey for our raptors and other animals once ingested these animals and raptors are poisoned as well i too am concerned about the rodent problem there are alternatives however while rodenticide may be an easy solution it is a cruel painful death they bleed to death and does not only kill the targeted species snap traps are effective and some people and businesses are now placing snap traps inside the bait boxes eliminating the poison i am hoping people will write to their state legislators to request that they co sponsor bill h 3991 this bill would limit the use of rodenticide and also make sure the general public is educated about its use and effects the bill likely needs support of both senators and house reps to pass committee and become law also i am hoping people will be proactive and talk to their neighbors and local businesses to request that they consider alternatives some local municipalities are using safe and effective alternative methods hopefully the town of arlington will consider reaching out to them for information and do the same margaret lewis orvis road time to stop killing our national symbol rodenticide causes excessive bleeding in rats and other pest animals leading to a very unpleasant death it also causes excessive bleeding in animals that feed on these creatures often leading to their equally unpleasant deaths so far this year we have lost two bald eagles including one baby right near my home and countless hawks and owls in our state they could have done a fine job at eliminating an awful lot of annoying animals another baby bald eagle is suffering from what is likely the same issue though signs are hopeful that it will pull through don t get me wrong i hate rats and am not too fond of mice or voles either but a long torturous death that makes them easy prey for other animals and consigns them too to sickness or death is neither humane nor sensible massachusetts hd4206 will not ban these poisons but will at least make sure that people know what they are putting around their properties and what the long term impact could be it would be a start amanda gazin mystic street rodenticides are killing our wildlife i am asking that my town neighbors to take a few minutes to call or write rep sean garballey and sen cindy friedman to support the hawkins bill our eagles eaglets one died this week in arlington another seriously ill fox bobcats and coyotes as well as unsupervised dogs and cats are exposed to rat poisoning i am sure this is not your intent but unfortunately death is the result of rodenticide going hand in hand with this is why we are putting these traps down many homes are constantly fighting a battle with rats the town needs a program to aggressively address this possibly dry ice monitored by the town and teach each resident who makes the request on how to install maintain etc much of this stems from all the building in town maybe a portion of the fees that are paid when building could be diverted to support this program this is a townwide issue that that needs to be addressed with a solid program i am fortunate in that this is not my personal issue but i would like to believe we are all in this together and need to support those who are having this issue i ve been here about 50 years this has become a major problem for many families and the town needs to take some responsibility that would also help solve the poison issue and poisonous traps could be eliminated i am publicly calling upon town manager adam chapdelaine and the board of selectmen to address this issue and assist the residents thank you julia greenwood mclaughlin lehigh street dead baby bald eagle in arlington a baby female bald eagle born here in arlington was killed by rat poison just a couple of weeks ago her sister was also found struggling but as of today after care by the local animal officer she is alive this is only the second reported death of a bald eagle by rodenticide here in mass the first also this year at the charles river in march consider this an eagle is a much more effective rodent control device than poison another consideration is that poisons laid for rats may inadvertently kill beloved dogs cats and other wild animals kara holmquist the ma director of the federal humane society feels these poisons should be regulated better rep james hawkins of attleboro has introduced a bill to regulate these poisons so that more of our beautiful bald eagles and other animals may live the bill is now with the ma legislature s joint committee on environment natural resources and agriculture please consider contacting this committee your local rep or the humane society to find out how you might help get rid of these toxic poisons that have been killing our beautiful wildlife thank you cindy floyd webcowet road rodenticide related predator deaths i was devastated to learn yesterday that one of our new bald eagle nestlings has succumbed to rodenticide ingestion and that its only sibling is also sick but i m even sadder to say that i m not surprised i know that poison bait stations are used widely in arlington by residents landlords and business owners they are cheap and easy but their consequences to a broad array of wildlife up the food chain are anything but acceptable education alone won t be fast enough to save our eagles we need to make poison unlawful and unavailable snap traps and the placement of dry ice in rat burrows by pest control professionals are two safe and effective alternatives rat poison is a crime against the animal world our world it must be banned in arlington laura harding tufts street rodenticide is killing our wildlife i was devastated to find out that one of the juvenile bald eagles nesting right here in arlington has died due to rodenticide poisoning this is the second death of a bald eagle due to rodenticide in the metro area in only a few months time over the past decade that i ve been living in this town i have watched the use of these poisons proliferate rapidly with increased development to the point where they are a pervasive aspect of our community and ironically our rat population has skyrocketed with the uptick in poisons around town as someone with a background in natural resources management and wildlife biology i know this is what can be expected these poisons literally bait rodents into the area while killing off their natural predators scientific studies show raptors are more successful at controlling rodents than poisons a single pair of rats can have 2 000 offspring in a one year they can outbreed the poisons however most birds of prey only have two or three offspring a year if they succumb to poison they are extirpated from the area we re essentially wiping out our best defense against rats there is currently a piece of legislation in the state house by rep hawkins d attleboro that would better rein in these poisons h 3991 would require pest control professionals to be transparent about the risks of poisons to wildlife pets and children and emphasize non poison alternatives i was thrilled to see that both reps garballey and rogers have signed on as co sponsors to the bill but disappointed our state senator cindy friedman has not yet this bill is due to come up for a hearing in the autumn in a joint committee chaired by both houses as such bicameral support is crucial to help it get out of committee and passed into law i hope sen friedman will do the right thing and support protecting our precious wildlife in the meantime while municipalities cannot ban or regulate these poisons the town can still do a lot to address this issue including implementing better trash management and mandatory dumpster inspections using rat resistant trash cans and adopting an official integrated pest management ipm plan we have the ability to make this town safer for our wildlife our pets and our children laura kiesel master of science in natural resources sciences and management massachusetts avenue rat issue use of rat poisons in arlington and our wildlife i wanted to bring to your attention a growing rat issue in arlington and some of its adverse effects the increasing use of rat poison and the instances of rodenticide in local wildlife most recently an eaglet in arlington perished as a result of the use of rat poison likely due to eagles preying on poisoned rodents in the area i wish local leadership would take up the issue accompanying a ban of the use of rat poison should be safe viable and effective alternatives i feel as though the town has not done enough to address the root causes something must be done as it is a public health issue and has endangered local wildlife there is a house bill hd 4206 presented by rep james hawkins that sean garballey and dave rogers have signed on and i hope that cindy friedman will soon integrated pest management ipm is an approach where human animal conflicts are resolved with minimal risks to humans wild animals and the environment hd 4206 would mandate the use of ipm plans on public lands and publicly owned property as well as require that before providing services pesticide applicators provide information about ipm to consumers hopefully local town governing bodies will join in to find a solution to the original pest management issue issue frances meale highland avenue
this article is a live version of our unhedged newsletter register here send the newsletter directly to your inbox every business day good morning the minutes of the fed s meetings are dull so i ignored them if you disagree on this or anything else please email me the new new normal or the old new normal christopher smart chief strategist at the bank of bahrain thinks i it s too big economic data has slowed recently he believes that investors have already begun to act he emailed saying we know that data is slowing down because it cannot continue to accelerate investors focus on next year and the next year if the covid variant dissipates and policy support disappears where will growth and inflation be resolved most of these will be a new round of long term stagnation debate are we still lower in growth and interest rates as we did in the past 40 years or is there something new in fiscal and monetary policy that can generate 2 inflation again whoever gets this right will retire early i will not retire early i think i can bet on my portfolio in one way or another such as using leveraged government bonds or cyclical stocks but this is just a guess deciding whether we enter a new system or return to the old system is beyond my salary level maybe higher than everyone some people believe that the new alliance of currency and fiscal profligacy alone is enough to push inflation to a new higher platform a few weeks ago albert edwards of societe generale summarized this view in his usual style the pandemic recession has allowed policymakers to cross the rubicon of fiscal integrity and reach new ground their existing currency profligacy can now be combined with fiscal debauchery at the political level i think that the sweet fruits of financial generosity funded by money have been picked and tasted and there is no turning back i m not sure that the spenders will win this day politically but there are other factors to consider economists charles goodhart and manoj pradhan believe that demographic changes will further tilt the balance toward inflation their work has become popular on wall street so some readers may have made up their minds however i want to talk about the arguments here because this is the only situation i have seen in the return of sustained inflation except for the central bank and the government coordinated currency dumping the core view of goodhart and pradhan is that as production shifts to low wage countries wages everywhere are depressed and globalization has depressed prices for 30 years however as the population of china and other countries begin to level off while the working age population in developed countries declines wages there will also rise workers everywhere will be in short supply and the deflationary effects of globalization will stop as the world ages real interest rates will rise inflation and wage growth will pick up and inequality will fall they write this is the simple supply and demand relationship as the supply of labor decreases the price of labor will rise relative to available capital and other prices will rise accordingly goodhart and pradhan believe that global aging will have another impact it will reduce savings faster than investment which will push up interest rates because of reduced capital chasing investment opportunities health care expenditures for the elderly especially in china will be the main driver of the reduction in savings the higher taxes required to maintain the social safety net will also lead to inflation as scarce workers will be able to demand higher wages in response it is important to remember that to make this important to investors goodhart and pradhan only need to be a little bit right for example a new inflation plateau of more than 3 will really make life difficult for investors first it will force the returns of bonds and stocks to be correlated thereby canceling the hedging that has worked for decades the natural response to the demographic debate is only one word japan the aging population has not increased inflation or real interest rates there in fact the situation is just the opposite goodhart pradhan s answer is that what matters is not local demographic data but global demographic data japan exports products when its labor force shrinks this is pradhan s latest interview japan is a very open economy but it is very close to its huge neighbor china in fact when you look at the timing what happened in japan is not surprising just as the japanese population turned to the south china was busy decompressing the entire world by the way an interesting result of the goodhart pradhan paper is that there was a political conflict on the way that pitted workers against retirees as they grow older the elderly will become a powerful political force we believe that it is this kind of political power that can prevent the government from betraying too much of its pension obligations the main working age population will gradually decrease but they will have an important commodity whose prices may maintain an upward trend labor the political divide in the future will lie in the social safety net for the elderly to protect them and the actual after tax income of the working age population this doesn t sound fun at all i am not a good enough economist to properly evaluate this argument i really want to know what the readers think however it seems to me that christopher smart asked the right question sooner or later will we return to the same place before the pandemic but with a higher debt burden goodhart and pradhan gave a principled case of not thinking another way of thinking about shipping inflation two days ago i wrote regarding the cost of shipping from china and whether it will remain high tony foster who runs ocean capital manage shipping asset investment and reply via email he believes that the higher prices will take a long time to subside we know that there will be a lag before the supply of cargo ships catches up but surprisingly efforts to decarbonize shipping are also a factor large liner companies are chartering ships for five years at current very high charter rates to ensure tonnage this illustrates a significant degree of confidence supermarket companies charter their own ships to ensure the certainty of supply as you said the new ship ordered will take at least two years to pass dry bulk due to the perceived technical risks the market is restricted for new orders the shipowner does not know what the future fuel will be and what propulsion fuel storage system will be needed to achieve the decarbonization goal despite regulatory tightening and upcoming carbon pricing this investment restraint coupled with the rapid rise in steel prices and ship prices has exacerbated the continued strength of the freight market even if the commodity market does not have extraordinary growth forecasts this situation is expected to exist for a long time foster s notes asked me two questions what is the inflation rate in the fight against climate change what does the central bank mean when it talks about temporary inflation there is also a word about jay powell s stock portfolio several readers responded to my approval generalize dylan grice believes that fed chairman jay powell s large holdings of stocks should affect his policy judgments the most common answer from readers is that powell can put his wealth in a blind trust which is obviously the practice of british officials alas it doesn t help powell can safely assume that the man who manages the tens of millions of dollars he trusts is not a complete idiot given that bond yields are very low this would mean a large allocation of stocks this alone can ensure that a meaningful tightening of interest rates may make powell poorer i don t want to sound like a damn communist here but letting a rich person chair the fed is likely to distort policy sometimes the job of the fed chairman is to tell the market that they can smash the sand for the rich this is a difficult thing a good book a good piece reason in new yorker i would say it missed a key point reason is not a state of mind or even a set of habits this is a promise a religious pledge we are more or less inconsistent ignorant and confused reason is a promise to strive to do better follow the rules and acknowledge it when we can t i spent too much time in graduate school

opportunities and minimizes the threats of relevance to the profession this article originally appeared in the august 2021 police1 leadership briefing to read the full briefing see leo shortage solutions extended shift effects workforce trends and add the leadership briefing to your subscriptions private and public sector organizations in the united states currently face significant challenges as they struggle to find quality employees to fill vacancies private industry strives to be competitive in attracting candidates by offering liberal work schedules and other benefits that include remote work flexible schedules gym memberships paid cell phones secure cloud storage space fertility adoption assistance dry cleaning healthy meals vehicle cleaning pet insurance and childcare facebook apple and google paved the way for fertility benefits a couple of years ago to entice more women to work for them this is on top of generous salaries and hiring bonuses synonymous with today s tech industry even mcdonald s is offering childcare as a job benefit some police agencies provide hiring bonuses however those bonuses are risky absent written contracts or agreements they can also be subject to litigation and regional labor laws since organizations outside of policing rarely offer a lucrative defined benefits pension the lower level annuities policing can offer may no longer be a draw for those choosing a career for example in the tech industry outside of 401 k plans and stock options none offer guaranteed retirement programs despite that and a growing lack of confidence in social security s viability they have little problem attracting applicants who fit the skills they are seeking so what could be a driving motivator for the youngest generation of employees to choose policing as a career the impact of job hopping job hopping defined as when an employee who jumps or hops from job to job and has short stints with several employers has emerged as a significant challenge for any organization companies end up spending more money to recruit new employees because job hoppers play the field so to speak additionally remaining employees must increase their workload resulting in reduced productivity online recruiters actively promote the advantages of job hopping to include higher salaries career advancement location change and a better work environment could policing offer some of these benefits police agencies willing to explore programs like this can be more attractive to recruits interested in movement opportunity and an accommodating work life balance for instance recruiting methods and employment models are being used in the medical field that takes advantage of these desired benefits although this is a different field it serves the same purpose workforce sharing solutions workforce sharing programs are a viable option to reduce short stint job hoppers and ease the number of vacancies instead of agencies competing against one another for qualified talent departments could partner to offer exchange programs qualified officers could transfer between agencies for set amounts of time 2 5 years creatively drafted contracts among agencies will iron out most of the small details workforce sharing is not new to law enforcement specialized task force teams comprised of officers from various agencies have proven successful and can be a model to build from it can also be a cost effective way to maintain staffing levels and demonstrate investment in the employee i e build leaders rather than cogs in the wheel by exposing them to new methods experiences and environments coupled with creative incentives geared toward what this generation is attracted to could be a viable solution for recruiting and retaining talent in the next decade establishing alliance programs what would a multijurisdictional alliance program look like one possibility is an approach that would allow officers eligible to participate in the program to bid for transfer to participating agencies for a pre determined length of time in exchange the receiving agency would transfer one of their eligible officers executives could accept transfers based on departmental or community needs employee wellness productivity and return on investment for example an agency could pre determine their desired attributes for an exchange officer to supplement their community or departmental needs i e agency a needs an experienced traffic officer or agency b is looking for an officer with community outreach experience programs like this can add value to all the entities involved especially the employees memorandums of understanding mou or interagency contracts would set the ground rules for what conditions must be met to participate this would not be dissimilar to a foreign exchange student program wherever the person employee is they are subject to all the rules policies laws and regulations set forth by that country agency no hire clauses would need to be hammered out as well for example agencies would agree not to hire headhunt one another s employees unless specific parameters existed i e minimum time of separation mutually agreed upon the circumstance etc in the medical field traveling nurses and registry employees are hired to meet staffing and workload requirements in various venues including emergency rooms occupational therapy and skilled nursing facilities many workers choose this model of employment rather than a permanent location for a variety of reasons including tax incentives higher wages expansive one of the essential benefits of agency alliances is the decrease in turnover costs associated with backfilling vacancies for extended periods a pool of qualified vetted officers could be available for transfer if needed workforce sharing alliances can serve the interest of organizations employees and the communities they serve planning for tomorrow while police departments cannot compete with the salaries offered by the tech industry incentives like family gym memberships cellular plans and ride sharing credits are inexpensive and within reach for most organizations while the debate rages on about government funded college tuition and canceling college debt altogether organizations could explore allocating funds set aside for their tuition reimbursement programs put in place in the early 2000s to pay for these and other creative benefit programs for the next generation as leaders in our organizations it is up to us to get out there engage our staff work with our allied agencies and offer creative alternatives to bargaining units to ensure policing remains a good career option for future generations business managers are preparing their companies for what their industry will be not what it is today law enforcement should take a cue from those models and apply them gathering data and forecasting what we think will happen will enable us to adjust our course now next what young cops want and what police leaders can do about it

a frontline nurse has shared her heartbreak over losing a 14 year old patient who died of covid 19 after her anti vaxxer parents forbid doctors from intubating her twitter user jessicam6946 who is a nurse practitioner in the intensive care unit revealed in a recent thread that they had four patients die of covid in one shift saying each of their deaths could have been prevented if they had been vaccinated tonight i helplessly held the hand of and stroked the hair of a beautiful 14 year old girl as she exited this world she was looking forward to starting high school and eventually becoming a veterinarian it was so senseless the arizona state university alumna tweeted on saturday heartbreaking twitter user jessicam6946 who is a nurse practitioner in the intensive care unit revealed in a thread that they had four patients die of covid in one shift stock image terrible loss she explained that one of the losses was a 14 year old girl whose anti vaxxer parents refused to let doctors intubate her when she took a turn for the worse i truly believe she could have been saved if her parents had not forbidden us from intubating her a free vaccination would have prevented it all this little girl was robbed of her whole life and of fulfilling all of her dreams jessica said the girl had been with them for nine days and had been able to communicate with the hospital staff until she took a turn for the worse the day before about two hours later we were unable to save a 25 year old mother of one who was 15 weeks pregnant the nurse continued she had refused the vaccines because of the lies about them causing infertility and harming her baby liars killed her her baby and robbed a two year old little boy of his mommy and sibling not to mention robbing a husband of his wife and child jessica said those were just two of the four deaths they had that night noting the oldest person was only 45 years old it was the first time since late march we have lost more than three covid patients in a single shift she added then we find out this morning a coworker had two of her tires cut in one of our employee parking lots overnight fortunately security caught and was able to detain the a hole until police arrived and took him into custody frustrated thousands of people have commented on the thread with many sharing their outrage over the unnecessary deaths that have occurred over vaccination misinformation jessica ended the twitter thread by slamming former president trump florida gov ron desantis dr joseph mercola and robert kennedy jr for helping fuel the anti vax movement during the pandemic f k the big orange buffoon desantis facebook fox news antivaxxers magas dr mercola robert kennedy jr all parents who believe these killers over proven science and all other killers who spread anti vaccine lies she wrote i can t deal with people right now i love you guys just days after jessica s tweets slamming anti vaxxers the u s reported more than 1 000 covid 19 deaths for the first time since march on tuesday officials recorded 1 004 deaths with a seven day rolling average of 710 which is a 159 percent increase over the last month and the highest number seen since april 20 this brings the death toll from the pandemic to just 623 329 people the highest number officially reported by any country in the world nearly all of the covid deaths in the u s are now among the unvaccinated the south remains the epicenter of the latest outbreak with florida reporting a record of nearly 26 000 new cases per day last week the centers for disease control and prevention cdc said rising on tuesday the u s recorded more than 1 000 covid 19 deaths in a single day for the first time since mid march bringing the death toll to 623 329 outbreak cases also rose

the indian delta variant has presented a major challenge the number of children hospitalized with covid 19 was 1 834 as of tuesday morning and is rising across the country according to data from the u s department of health and human services hhs this is a trend health experts attribute to the delta variant being more likely to infect children than the original k alpha strain jessica s tweet marking the death of her 14 year old patient has received more than 116 000 likes and has been retweeted over 30 000 times thousands of people have commented on the thread with many sharing their outrage over the number of unnecessary deaths that have resulted from misinformation about the covid 19 vaccine what kind of parents prevent their child from intubation one person asked while another added i can t even begin to what it is to live day to day trying so desperately to save those who refuse the vaccine especially the children who had no say either way someone else shared i am so sorry i have no idea why you still put up with all this but the majority of us are grateful for you and your faithful work

there is of course genuine concern about the environment underlined earlier this month when the head of the un issued his code red for humanity warning after scientists from the organisation s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc issued their stark assessment of the looming climate catastrophe with global surface temperatures since 1970 having risen faster than in any other 50 year period during the past 2 000 years they are predicting increasingly extreme heatwaves droughts and flooding that have wreaked havoc in places such as haiti the united states germany australia and china in recent weeks there are also the politicians who may have a sincere desire to tackle climate change but can be uniformly relied upon to jump on any bandwagon that allows them to deliver rousing speeches about long term policies that other governments can renege on in the future read more budget sunak to announce millions for scottish green energy boost whether or not these environmental policies ultimately deliver they inevitably lead to programmes such as that unveiled earlier this year when chancellor rishi sunak used his budget speech to set out plans for a new uk infrastructure bank that will be allotted 12 billion of capital in a bid to stimulate at least 40bn worth of green growth projects across the public and private sectors in conjunction with this a further 15bn will be put into green bonds to help fund the country s transition to net zero by 2050 our future economy needs investment in green industries across the united kingdom mr sunak told the house of commons we need a real commitment to green growth keen to follow the money pouring from the public purse and under pressure from investors seeking a more ethical and sustainable home for their savings fund managers have also been piling into anything that looks like an eco friendly company amid accusations of greenwashing across a variety of sectors the financial conduct authority wrote earlier this month to the uk s authorised fund managers setting out the regulator s expectations for esg environmental social and corporate governance and sustainable investment funds global funds linked to esg principles took in nearly 350bn 254 2bn last year from investors according to data from morningstar compared to 165bn in 2019 in turn these equity funds channelled more than 230bn of cash into the esg segment throughout the course of 2020 with cop26 on the horizon in glasgow the narrative for green energy investment is compelling that trend has continued into the current year research from bloombergnef shows that new investment in renewable energy products and companies from all sources reached a global total of 174bn 126 4bn in the first half of 2021 supported by record levels of public market financing venture capital and private equity commitments that 1 8 per cent increase on the same period in 2020 was the highest total recorded in the first half of any year renewable energy investment has withstood the effects of the global pandemic in contrast to other sectors of the energy economy where we have seen unprecedented volatility bloombergnef analyst albert cheung was quoted as saying however a 1 8 increase is nothing to write home about an immediate acceleration in funding is needed if we are to get on track for global net zero so there appears little on the horizon to stem the stampede into the clean energy sector with the energy transition accelerating the safe bet is that investors will continue increasing their exposure to renewables and related areas such as energy storage hydrogen and so forth read more wood flexes hydrogen muscle as its seeks to diversify away from oil services in such a scenario the value assigned to these companies will continue to climb and will likely become increasingly disconnected from their potential future earnings as was the case during the dotcom boom from 1995 to 2000 during that bull run the value of the technology dominated nasdaq index in the us rose five fold from less than 1 000 points to a peak of 5 048 in march 2000 the prospects for the commercialisation of the rapidly expanding internet created a free flow of money into established and start up internet firms with investors handing over silly amounts of cash to business that in some cases were years away from either sales or profits in some instances they didn t even have a product or a completed business plan fuelled by overconfidence and sheer speculation many of these pre revenue firms went for a public listing regardless leading to the period when reporting on profits and losses gave way to the desultory ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation in other words the money we made before paying pretty much any of the bills as is often the case in business where us exuberance led markets in other parts of the world including the uk followed the wheels came off when investment capital started drying up in the latter half of 2000 leading to the first international economic shock of the 21st century read more end of a north sea oil era at brae bravo without fresh investment to keep them afloat most of the dotcom start ups that had no revenues of their own had gone bust by the end of 2001 though the likes of amazon and ebay survived investors too eager to overlook traditional fundamentals were left with bruising losses that took years to recover most people like the idea of a green energy future even if some are less convinced than others about cataclysmic climate crisis just as the internet delivered everything and more that was envisioned at the start of this century today s world is inexorably headed towards a healthier energy mix but there will be difficulties and risks during the journey away from fossil fuels which itself will be an expensive pilgrimage enormous amounts of investment will be required yet if the clock is ticking down to irreversible environmental crisis never has it been more important to spend money wisely as the world starts to surface from the mire of the covid pandemic there is little financial capacity to cope with the fallout from artificially inflated markets and over hyped eco friendly technology in this aspect both the economy and the environment are aligned as neither can afford the years of setback should a green bubble emerge and then burst
the flights this holiday season will be less frequent and more crowded airfares likely will be higher the flights this holiday season will be less frequent and more crowded airfares likely will be higher and waiting for oil prices to drop so your trip s cost matches your holiday travel budget is no strategy at all travel experts say as the holiday and winter getaway season approaches many of the best airline seats are taken and industry insiders don t expect more to be added for snowbirds trying to plot some late winter relief from cabin fever the airline industry s tectonic shift toward higher fares and fees and fewer seats means this year s travel calendar is changing watchword to the faithful traveler plan early and book early as in now consider cancun mexico a popular winter market for people departing minneapolis st paul between northwest and sun country airlines there were four to six flights a day to cancun said gerard bellino u s leisure vice president at navigant vacations a travel firm owned by carlson wagonlit now there are two we re dealing with a significant tightening of the belt while additional flights might be added on that route bellino said that isn t happening yet speaking generally of the broader holiday season 80 percent of the space is already gone rarely has the holiday travel market changed more over a single year last year before the run up in oil prices and jet fuel costs and before the economy s foundation was in question airlines were discounting a large number of seats hoping to attract business not this time while worries about the broader economy may keep some travelers away from the airport this season don t expect huge fare sales or a reduction in all those new fees airlines imposed this summer when you look at how in the red the airlines are if those fees are increasing revenue they ll take it said gabe saglie senior editor at travel zoo an online travel site as for fares coming down i don t think it ll be until after the holidays because the next opportunity for these airlines to get some of their revenue back will be the upcoming holiday season like playing the stock market barb deborhegyi and her minneapolis family of four typically head down mexico way around christmas to visit family this year they re going to guatemala usually they start looking for tickets in september but with the spikes in ticket prices this summer deborhegyi hopped online early the prices were just crazy deborhegyi said she monitored several travel web sites looking for the best airfare at one point it was 1 000 a ticket and then the next day it would drop down to 650 it was all over the place she said within a few days she booked the tickets for 850 each at american airlines web site it was like playing the stock market there was a lot of volatility bellino and other travel experts agree if you have dates in mind now and know where you want to travel this winter then it s probably best not to wait with the economic slowdown troubles on wall street and skyrocketing airline ticket prices consumers might have thought fewer people would be traveling opening up a chance for finding decent fares but people intent on going home for the holidays will travel regardless of what the economy is like bellino said and many booked their seats six to seven months ago bookings actually have remained steady even as airlines have cut capacity to move closer to profitability meaning planes are filling faster eagan based northwest airlines for example will cut as much as 9 5 percent of systemwide capacity this quarter compared with last year the nation s other carriers including low cost competitors have made similar cuts the effect of all that flight trimming and its effect on airfares varies from market to market but few are seeing declines airfare research by harrell associates recently found year over year increases of 26 percent in philadelphia 17 percent in minneapolisst paul and 15 percent in newark n j which serves the new york city market overall nationally leisure fares were up 11 percent and business fares were up 6 percent on the flip side the research found that fares in san antonio were down 12 percent this summer compared with last year a healthier industry in the twin cities with champion air shutting down earlier this year there are no charter flights to las vegas which is unusual for this market said sheree powers owner of travel by nelson a woodbury travel agency we all kind of thought they d bring in another airline and call it a charter one result of the tighter market is that package deals may start to look better to consumers travel agents say people like being in control digging up their own hotel saglie the online travel editor said but the package deal may be the best buy this season resorts and hotels are responding to current travel economics even if airfare goes up a little saglie said the pricing on resorts in mexico is so aggressive the overall price will still be pretty good northwest airlines world vacations for example recently had a package from the twin cities for five nights in waikiki hawaii for less than 900 including airfare and hotel saglie said hotels in hawaii did well early in the summer but then saw tourism drop off he said so now reduced room rates there are more plentiful people are going to think before they fly now i think that s the difference said kenneth button director of george mason university s center for transportation policy yet he doesn t see a rerun of the 1970s and the days before airline deregulation when only the relatively well to do flew with any frequency the greater attention to airfares will apply to business travelers as much as it does to individuals button said and in the end it will lead to a healthier airline industry he believes for too many years airlines have been operating at a loss and you can t survive like that what consumers are seeing now is a balancing of supply and demand one that should have happened years ago he said

surrey bc accesswire august 19 2021 condor gold aim cnr tsx cog is pleased to announce that all assay results have now been received for the 3 370 m drilling programme in the la india starter pit infill and reserve circulation rc replacement drill holes completed between december 2020 and june this year the highlight new drill result is lidc464 of 6 6 m true width at 10 51 g t gold the drilling programme has successfully completed 4 objectives firstly to tighten the drill hole spacing to 25 m by 25 m within high grade starter pits within the fully permitted la india open pit secondly to provide the sample density required to finalize pit designs and mine schedules ahead of production thirdly the diamond drilling programme has replaced all historical rc drill holes within the overall la india open pit mineral resource and mineral reserve the results of which will improve the integrity of the geological model and sample quality lastly the diamond drilling targeted nearby inferred mineral resources to potentially upgrade the target to an indicated mineral resource and its then potential inclusion in the mine plan highlights 3 370 m diamond core drilling programme completed all assay results have been received and all significant intercepts have been reported 60 60 m 54 5 m true width at 1 98 g t gold from 4 15 m drill depth including 5 75 m 5 2 m true width at 16 88 g t gold from 42 55 m drill depth in drill hole lidc452 located between the two proposed starter pits the wide zone of gold mineralization of 54 5 m true width at 1 98 g t gold near surface has the potential to reduce the strip ratio in the area between the starter pits due to the increase in gold mineralized tonnage verses waste rock thus potentially improving project economics potential to amalgamate the two starter pits into a single larger starter pit as a broad zone of high grade gold mineralization including a high grade intercept was previously interpreted as

contain 445 kt at 4 17 g t gold for 59 700 oz gold with a 6 8 to 1 strip ratio and represent less than 10 of the full permitted la india open pit this has been a very successful drill programme and achieved a number of key objectives firstly the geological model has been re affirmed and is now more robust following a close spaced 25 m by 25 m drill programme in the starter pits with some drill assay results better than expected secondly the starter pits are now shovel ready are within 35 m of surface and will provide early high grade mill feed for the recently purchased sag mill the replacement of rc drill holes with diamond core drilling strengthens the geological model ahead of production project economics are likely to improve with a confirmation of a broad zone of mineralisation between the starter pits which should reduce the overall strip ratio and b the discovery of an additional vein in the footwall background and summary of drill programme the drilling has returned grades and widths of the principal gold mineralised structures in line with expectations and achieved the four objectives stated earlier it has also extended the strike length of an approximately 2 m wide vein in the footwall zone which potentially can add extra ounces of gold to the mineral resource a broad zone of mineralisation from near surface lidc452 of 54 5 m true width at

within the open pit mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate was undertaken to improve the quality and resolution of the geological model the diamond core twin drill holes generally confirmed the results of the rc drilling however some higher than expected grades and broader zones of mineralisation intersected near surface between the two planned starter pits are expected to improve the near surface mineral resource and positively impact on early mining economics as the strip ratio maybe reduced due to the wider zone of mineralisation 60 60 m 54 5 m true width at 1 98 g t gold from 4 15 m

from the hanging wall of the historic mine workings in drill hole lidc454 located between the two starter pits the starter pits are currently planned to exploit two high grade segments of the la india open pit to a depth of approximately 35 m below surface the southern starter pit along a 250 m strike length and the northern starter pit along 300 m strike are separated by 200 m of what was previously considered a low grade zone these new drill intercepts will be considered in the final starter pit resource estimation and mine design to see if the starter pits can be extended of even joined by exploiting the near surface gold mineralisation now demonstrated along the intervening 200 m of strike length latest assay results results for the final two drill holes one infill drill hole and one rc twin drill hole were returned an infill drill hole lidc464 intercepted 6 65 m 6 6 m true width at 10 51 g t gold some 10 m below the northern starter pit the drill hole was designed to pin down the strike extent of the high grade shoot that supports the northern starter pit by infilling at 25 m spacing between a high grade intercept of 10 11 m 9 8 m true width at 6 72 g t gold beneath the starter pit and a notably lower grade 6 28 m 6 1 m true width at 2 27 g t gold some 50 m along strike to the north the intercept should have a positive impact on the mineral resource and extends the high grade shoot along strike to the north a broad intercept of moderate grade mineralization returned from the final rc twin drill hole lidc468 is comparable with the original rc drilling results

la india open pit about the replacement of reverse circulation rc drilling with diamond core drilling following the recent completion of a 25 m spaced infill and reverse circulation rc replacement drilling on the la india starter pits see rns dated 5th july 2021 a programme of diamond core drilling to replace 90 of the remaining rc drill holes that fall within the main la india open pit shell was completed a total of twenty three rc drill holes for 1632 05 m were twinned by diamond core drilling including both those that intercepted mineralisation within and adjacent to the high grade starter pits as well as holes drilled in lower grade zones further along strike and beneath the high grade starter pits the current open pit mineral resource partially relies upon chip samples from rc drilling whilst it is generally recognised that rc drilling provides reliable gold grade data at regular metre scale sample intervals suitable for inclusion in an open pit mineral resource estimation better and more detailed geological information on the structures that contain the gold mineralised veins and breccia is provided by diamond core drilling this additional data will further enhance the current mineral resources and mineral reserves and be utilised in final mine schedules about the drilling techniques drilling was undertaken using heavy duty track mounted drilling rigs all of the drilling was undertaken using diamond core drilling techniques employing large diameter pq core barrels and triple tube in the mineralised zones to ensure good sample recovery drilling close to surface and in proximity to historical and artisanal mine workings can present challenges to the driller however the drilling programme benefited from employment of local geologists field support staff and experienced drill contractors all with a decade of experience of drilling at la india consequently all target depths were met and good sample recovery was achieved about the assaying drill core was cut and half core samples collected and bagged by condor staff on site samples were transported to bureau veritas accredited sample preparation laboratory in managua every week in batches of two or three drill holes generally being submitted to the lab within 5 10 days of completing the drill hole sub samples of the pulverised rock samples were forwarded for assay to bureau veritas

san diego county leaders gave initial approval tuesday for a pilot program to keep tabs on the region s quickly shrinking stock of cheaper older apartments and come up with a plan to buy them lawmakers said it is necessary to preserve less expensive units called naturally occurring affordable housing or noah as rent continues to rise the county s program approved unanimously still must come back to the board for a second vote because of concern about the company that would partner with the county supervisor nora vargas proposed the program and said it would be run by ethos which she said was a minority owned company however her proposal given to the other supervisors did not include information on the business such as how long it had been in business or where it is located advertisement her office told the san diego union tribune on wednesday that ethos was founded in 2021 by the senior management of santa monica based watt investment partners several county supervisors on tuesday night said they liked the idea behind the project but were concerned there was not information about the company in the board agenda or searchable online i don t have anything against ethos i just don t know anything about them said supervisor jim desmond the sentiment was echoed by supervisor joel anderson who said he was unable to find anything about the company and was concerned the contract was going to a single entity and not going out for multiple businesses to bid on it s really important that ethos is a real company and not some startup in someone s garage he said vargas said she was previously approached by the company and had no issue with ethos being properly vetted by county staff there isn t a set date for when the pilot program will return to the board for a vote which could include options to go with a different company the program comes on the the heels of new york private equity giant blackstone buying 5 800 units in may from the conrad prebys foundation almost all of the 66 residential complexes could be classified under the noah distinction and led to an outcry among affordable housing advocates the deal estimated at more than 1 billion was one of the biggest transactions in san diego county history blackstone said it plans to make units affordable for residents who make 80 percent or less of the area median income around 67 900 for an individual but that has done little to calm concerns the county s program called the housing preservation and anti displacement pilot program would identify where the less expensive housing units are and come up with a subsidy to purchase them and keep rents low for 55 years it said ethos or whatever company the county decides on should design a program where it could leverage public tax benefits to buy the units renovate them and keep them for people who earn 80 percent or less of the area median income the company would also be required to partner with a local nonprofit and make improvements to the properties within the first five years of ownership a lot of the details will need to be worked out at a future date because the supervisors vote tuesday was only to begin the process the initial proposal from vargas said the selected company would need to be reviewed by an independent third party for financial feasibility and returned to the supervisors for a final vote stephen russell president of the san diego housing federation said the move to preserving older units is a way to keep costs down instead of building new for instance real estate tracker costar said the average cost per apartment in san diego county was roughly 370 000 at the start of august but the cost to build a new subsidized unit can run much higher than that often exceeding 500 000 everything you build new will be more expensive because it reflects contemporary wages and land cost materials etc russell said there s no question we ve lost a lot of the naturally occurring affordable housing and we have a dire need to preserve more housing despite that he said he was also concerned that the pilot program was limited to one business and surprised it wasn t going out in a bidding process it is purposing a pilot with an individual entity so it hasn t been part of an open transparent or competitive process russell said competition as we know is at the core of getting your best value for the dollar for now the county s program is limited to district 1 which includes chula vista imperial beach national city coronado and logan heights the pilot program report said it could be extended to other parts of the county in the future average rent in san diego county was 2 075 a month at the start of august a roughly 9 percent increase in a year according to real estate tracker costar that is the highest annual increase in its records that go back to 2000

by tommy wilkes london reuters if you want to invest in a fund branded as sustainable under new european union rules you re spoilt for choice but you may end up owning shares in oil companies mining conglomerates or tobacco firms a reuters analysis of funds marketed to retail investors increasingly hungry for anything green shows asset managers are adopting a wide range of strategies to justify the sustainable label since the eu brought in disclosure rules in march the eu s sustainable finance disclosure regulation sfdr is an attempt to deliver transparency for investors focused on environmental social and governance esg issues but fund managers say the definition of sustainability is too vague and has created confusion about what makes the cut take the allianz global water fund it actively invests in companies that improve the supply management and quality of water and is marketed as falling under article 8 of the sfdr which means it is a fund that promotes among other characteristics environmental or social characteristics or a combination of those characteristics now take one of legal general investment management s lgim article 8 exchange traded funds etf the l g uk equity ucits etf tracks the solactive core united kingdom large mid cap index which excludes coal miners and firms that make weapons such as cluster bombs or have breached u n principles on corporate values its top 10 holdings are the same as for l g funds tracking the ftse 100 index that don t carry the article 8 label and include oil giants bp and royal dutch shell miner rio tinto and british american tobacco l g said the fund was considered article 8 because it promotes sustainability characteristics by applying lgim s future world protection list and this was a binding element of the investment process the lens we should use is what is right it s not just about what is legally required because it seems not very much is legally required said eric christian pedersen head of responsible investments at nordea asset management green rush the new eu rules have sparked a rush by investment firms to badge products as sustainable as they seek to grab a share of the booming market in sustainable mutual funds that hit a record 2 3 trillion in the second quarter from march 10 the rules automatically placed all investment funds into a coverall article 6 category managers could then upgrade them to article 8 or article 9 which is for products with an explicit sustainable investment objective the investment industry has dubbed article 8 funds light green and article 9 dark green though the eu regulations do not use those terms a european commission spokesperson said its rules were designed to ensure funds were transparent about the sustainability of products so investors could make choices and was not a labelling scheme reuters asked 20 of the biggest fund houses for a list of products they market as article 8 or 9 an analysis of the funds of the 14 firms that replied shows some article 8 products have limited claims to sustainability such as those tracking conventional stock and bond indexes investing in fossil fuels or buying debt from countries with weak esg standards such as saudi arabia and nigeria some claims hinge on funds excluding securities they would not have bought anyway based on the index being tracked for some in the industry this represents so called greenwashing where the benefits of a business or asset are exaggerated to attract environmentally aware investors hortense bioy director of sustainability research at morningstar said article 8 funds ranged from climate themed green to very very light green excluding just a few firms managers need to ask if they are even relevant she said that is the key message investors shouldn t expect anything from article 8 index trackers industry experts say none of the asset managers is breaking any rules managers determine themselves which article to apply and brussels does not check whether claims are justified the reuters analysis shows some managers are more likely to brand funds as sustainable than others two of europe s biggest firms alliance bernstein and axa investment management classify nine in every 10 euros of assets they manage under the scope of sfdr as article 8 or 9 according to data they supplied to reuters others such as pictet asset management and allianz global investors place a little over half of their relevant assets in those categories their data showed morningstar data published in july shows a third of the assets falling under sfdr are now billed as article 8 or 9 with article 6 products disappearing from recommendation lists sent by investment advisers to retail investors many article 8 funds have clear sustainability criteria such as strategies that invest in businesses with the lowest carbon impact in their sectors or allianz s water focused fund for others that s not always the case candriam s cleome index europe equities is another article 8 product it tracks the msci europe index but excludes companies that don t comply with the u n principles critics say such exclusions are very limited when asked for an example candriam did not point to any company expelled from the u n list that is also part of msci europe the candriam fund s top 10 holdings replicate the index a candriam spokesperson said it also applies exclusions on companies materially involved in controversial weapons tobacco and thermal coal and the cleome equity fund uses proprietary esg analysis relative to the benchmark justifying article 8 morningstar analysis shows one in four article 8 funds has exposure to companies involved in controversial weapons and one in five to tobacco a third of article 8 and 9 funds have more than a 5 exposure to fossil fuel firms nasty esg demand for funds with a sustainable label is soaring there is a clear commercial opportunity said eric borremans head of esg at switzerland s pictet asset management which classes 57 of its assets as article 8 or 9 borremans said pictet had no index tracking article 8 funds but planned to apply the label to some after incorporating more exclusions u s investment giant blackrock told reuters it expected to exceed a target of putting 70 of its new or rebranded products this year under articles 8 or 9 some funds use esg thresholds to justify sustainable labels jpmorgan asset management says 51 of the securities in its article 8 range must carry an esg score in the top 80 these are scores fund firms or third party providers give companies based on esg metrics such as carbon usage governance or human rights in supply chains critics say such thresholds are too weak you have funds saying most of our holdings are not nasty and therefore i m esg said pedersen at nordea which requires 100 of its article 8 holdings be above a minimum esg score the jpmorgan threshold for example also means 49 of companies in its funds could rank in the bottom 20 for esg goals although the funds exclude sectors such as tobacco controversial weapons and coal miners jpmorgan asset management did not respond to questions about esg scores a spokesperson said the firm remained focused on a thoughtful and thorough approach to the implementation of sfdr pictet s borremans said funds interpreting the rules loosely now can get away with it but strategies sailing close to the wind will eventually be exposed by next year the eu will flesh out its taxonomy a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities and from july 2022 funds must detail how they meet sustainability criteria based on the eu s regulatory technical standards rts that will clarify disclosure requirements it could hurt the reputation of an asset manager to offer financial products as falling under article 8 and 9 or as taxonomy aligned if this cannot subsequently be backed when the rts enters into application the european commission spokesperson said in emailed comments amundi s head of cross border product florian schneider said sfdr rules made clear products with minimal exclusions were article 8 the danger is everyone blindly assuming all article 8 funds offer the same level of esg integration when there are very different shades of green 1 0 7274 pounds additional reporting by simon jessop editing by sujata rao alexander smith and david clarke
