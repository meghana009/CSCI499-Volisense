oil prices are showing signs of overheating as traders anticipate a severe shortage of petroleum this year inventories are already low and there is little spare capacity to raise production in the short term spot prices are climbing rapidly and the futures market has moved into one of the most extreme backwardations in the last three decades a classic signal the market is expected to become very tight front month brent futures prices have risen by more than 20 over the last two months as fears about an omicron driven slowdown in consumption have been replaced by concern about the slow increase in production brent s six month calendar spread has surged into a backwardation of more than 6 per barrel which puts it in the 99th percentile for all trading days since 1990 put another way brent s backwardation has only been more extreme on 80 out of the last 8 000 trading days or in less than four months in the last 30 years the front month futures contract for deliveries in march expires on monday so it is not necessarily very representative anymore but the results do not change significantly if the analysis is shifted to the second month contract for deliveries in april the combination of escalating spot prices and a rampaging backwardation is a classic signal the market is severely under supplied pressure building by restricting output saudi arabia and its allies in opec have drained all the excess inventories accumulated during the first wave of the epidemic and lockdowns in the second quarter of 2020 at the same time u s shale producers have transformed from insurgents disruptors and revolutionaries into incumbents focused on limiting output growth enjoying higher prices and maximising the return of cash to shareholders as a result petroleum stocks in the united states and the other countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development have fallen well below the pre pandemic five year average for 2015 2019 global spare capacity is predicted to fall to less than 2 million barrels per day by the middle of the year according to private sector forecasters oil market faces rocky road as shock absorbers wear thin reuters jan 27 global consumption is still growing rapidly as a result of the robust recovery from the pandemic induced recession with much of it focused on energy intensive manufacturing and freight transport into this tight market the escalating confrontation between russia and nato has the potential to disrupt oil exports while the easing of quarantines is likely to boost aviation related consumption prices are escalating to encourage faster production growth force slower consumption growth and rebuild inventories and spare capacity back to more comfortable levels unless there is a relatively rapid production response prices will continue rising until they weigh on business and consumer spending or the increase in inflation draws a response from the major central banks rising living costs and accelerating inflation have already forced their way up the agenda to become the top concern for households businesses and policymakers in north america and europe petroleum derived fuels are one of the largest and most visible items of expenditure for households and many businesses so the rise in oil prices is heightening anxiety about inflation more generally u s consumers have become gloomier about their own finances and the state of the economy than at any time since 2011 according to the university of michigan s monthly consumer survey in january the consumer sentiment index has fallen to just the 10th percentile for all months since 1980 down from a recent peak in the 47th percentile in april 2020 if something cannot go on forever it will stop said herbert stein who had been u s president richard nixon s chief economist in 1986 if oil prices continue escalating the major consuming economies will eventually slow of their own accord or their central banks will be forced to raise interest rates sharply to bring inflation back under control source reuters editing by louise heavens
as severe weather continues to plow through northeast ohio this winter emergency departments in the cleveland and akron areas are seeing an uptick in injuries related to shoveling falling on ice and dangerously cold temperatures cleveland clinic akron general s emergency rooms are seeing more patients with winter related injuries this year than in the last few years said dr thomas rench a physician in the hospital s level 1 trauma center the last couple years have been a little bit lower because people tended to be inside more with covid going around rench said we still are seeing quite a bit and it s definitely ramped up from last year doctors are treating patients for hip and wrist injuries due to falling on ice as well as chest pain from shoveling snow rench said shoveling can be a trigger for heart attacks he said we do see people that come in with chest pain or a heart attack from the exertion of pushing snow around and lifting it especially the heavier wetter snow is classic for causing that rench added if you re shoveling snow and start to have chest pain please immediately stop and contact at the very least your doctor with another major snowstorm predicted to hit later this week rench advises patients stock up on day to day necessities such as groceries and medications beforehand to minimize the times they need to leave their house and head out on the icy roads and sidewalks once the snow falls and it s time to shovel dr sarah tehranisa medical director of the emergency department at university hospitals in cleveland suggests people take breaks every so often to let their heart rate come down and warm up inside more than a foot of snow pummeled much of the region over the martin luther king jr dayholiday weekend at that time uh s emergency department saw a spike in patients having heart attacks from shoveling the heavy snow tehranisa said emergency rooms are also seeing more cold related injuries such as frostbite and hypothermia than in years past tehranisa added i don t know if that is unfortunately related to people not being able to heat their homes and things like that with the economic situation but it does seem like we ve seen a few more of those tehranisa said we ve also had incredibly cold temperatures more so than i think we see on an average year and that may also be contributing tehranisa recommends dressing warmly and appropriately for the temperature if heading outside and being mindful of the wind chill which can make it feel even colder she also suggests staying away from alternative heating methods such as ovens and gas heaters as those can cause house fires if not tended to properly both tehranisa and rench have treated patients with house fire related burns and carbon monoxide poisoning this year it s something that sometimes people forget about keeping their furnaces and heat supply well maintained so it s less likely to cause a problem rench said if an individual needs additional heat sources such as space heaters and electric blankets remember to turn them off and unplug them after using she added just really being aware of your surroundings and what you can do to minimize your risk is really important tehranisa said if an injury does occur and is severe both tehranisa and rench recommend going to the emergency department to get checked out staffing shortages and an increase in covid 19 and flu patients have overwhelmed emergency departments at times this winter rench said we do have to triage the worst cases first we always take the life and limb threatening emergencies first he said unfortunately sometimes people wait a long time and we all take that as a personal goal to keep that down as long as much as we possibly can while providing appropriate and good care to everyone however covid 19 cases are dropping significantly now in the area he added and tehranisa said emergency departments have capacity to treat any injuries that arise in the upcoming snowy weather we are always busy but we are always here tehranisa said
credit suisse released a new report leo disruption a starlink in the making which takes a deep dive into the prospects of low earth orbit leo satellite operators and compares the prospects with stocks credit suisse traditionally covers such as eutelsat and ses ben lyons lead analyst on the report said credit suisse forecasts a total addressable market of 27 billion annually for leo constellations he added in the research note we expect that actual revenues will be 9 3 billion due to competition from terrestrial broadband in the consumer space and geo satellites in the other key verticals combining the more than 30 billion currently earmarked for first generation leo constellations we estimate the internal rate of return irr to be about 8 percent on the total capital deployed and therefore market leading leo operators have an opportunity to make outsized returns lyons said credit suisse expects geo to retain a monopoly in direct to home dth video due to the economics of the business and the fact that video distribution is not latency sensitive likewise credit suisse believes medium earth orbit meo will remain the key technology for large maritime vessels as the combination of higher throughput and lower latency are best suited for cruises and other large vessels that provide entertainment and have to service a large number of devices lyons added we expect ngso satellites to take a large share of the sector s revenue growth as the market expands into more latency sensitive end markets we also expect some cannibalization of revenues that have been serviced historically via traditional operators the report detailed the main issue facing satellite broadband providers that peak data traffic tends to increase 20 to 30 a year in order to maintain the same quality of service for customers fully loaded operators could have to reduce year over year the number of customers the constellation can service he adds this has tended to be handled with data limits and throttling download speeds by satellite operators after a certain data limit is reached in our view this is one of the main reasons satellite broadband has struggled to gain share despite offering higher maximum speeds than alternatives rurally some relatively poor rural fixed line coverage has resulted in some markets having a high degree of fwa penetration e g austria finland lyons said if satellite broadband particularly leo is being used to provide fiber like broadband alongside fwa and possibly fixed line alternatives it must match that performance or remain a service of last resort although some things can be done about constellation capacity satellite operators are powerless to control user data traffic growth which spiked during the pandemic he wrote this leads us to conclude that at today s average data traffic consumption leo constellations could supply a considerable amount of broadband customers but this is likely to reduce significantly by the time these constellations are fully operational and will be reserved only for premises in sparsely populated areas credit suisse expects business to consumer broadband to be the largest leo revenue contributor with 2 7 billion of revenues in the united states and 2 billion in europe which equates to around 5 5 million subscribers across both geographies we expect the total addressable market to be split between geo and leo satellite services we do not expect leo to service the entire 15 million premises we identified earlier in the report lyons said within mobility credit suisse forecasts leo to account for half of all growth in in flight connectivity ifc and maritime vsat over the next decade which is a total revenue contribution of about 1 8 billion annually we also expect leo to offer lower latency products than geo in the mno services segment and assume leo takes 50 of that market which accounts for 1 6 billion annually lyons said we still expect governments will retain many of the services they currently use from existing infrastructures but will supplement these networks with leo alternatives we forecast government revenues to be 1 2 billion by 2030 on leo networks at the end of the decade credit suisse expects growth in business to consumer broadband to slow considerably as the networks become fully penetrated and coverage with next generation network reaches a maximum credit suisse also expects that ifc and maritime vsat will be closer to full penetration one of the big questions surrounding leo constellations is how many the market has room for the report takes a shot at answering this question we believe there is economically only room for about three large scale leo constellations which typically cost around 10 billion to deploy if more leo constellations continue to be deployed we could see destruction of value within the sector which could have a significant impact for the stocks we cover market leading leo constellations that achieve above average market share have an opportunity to make outsized returns certainly above cost of capital lyons wrote
via birch gold group it looks as though the next few years will be a bumpy ride for retirement savers not welcome news considering the fact that today s stubbornly persistently high inflation looks like it will stick around even worse some projections we ve seen forecast a negative annual return on stocks for the next decade with news like that it s easy to just give up and change your retirement savings strategy to die at my desk with the right knowledge we re confident americans can successfully navigate their way through the mess it ll most certainly be more challenging not impossible first we ll start with an important update to retirement laws then we re going to cover two expected hurdles and finally discuss the advantages of fine tuning your retirement savings updates to required minimum distribution rmd schedule one challenge will be dealing with a slew of new life expectancy tables and rules at the irs which guide a retiree s required minimum distribution rmd each year according to the age of the retiree and their account balance s for example as cnbc reported on the latest irs change before the secure act taking effect in 2020 rmds were generally required once a person hit age 70½ now for anyone who reached that age in 2020 or will reach it later rmds kick in at age 72 in other words if you were born july 1 1949 or later you can wait until age 72 slott said the same article proceeded to explain one example of a potential change that retirees might face under the new rules and tables under the new uniform life table for example a 75 year old would use 24 6 as their factor if the account balance is say 500 000 dividing the amount by that factor results in an rmd of about 20 325 under the old table the factor for a 75 year old was 22 9 or 21 834 for a 500 000 account with thousands of pages of tax code that changes constantly year after year it can be hard to keep up you ll want to keep a close eye on your retirement account balance and the timing of your first rmd that way you can come away from it in the best shape possible and avoid the penalties associated with accidentally violating the rules really these changes in rmds are small potatoes compared to what s up next if you re planning on retiring in the next ten years read this if rising inflation and new irs hoops to jump through weren t enough there is also a potential for a prolonged market downturn in the near future that s worrisome because of something called sequence risk defined by investopedia as the danger that the timing of withdrawals from a retirement account will damage the investor s overall return account withdrawals during a bear market are more costly than the same withdrawals in a bull market a diversified portfolio can protect your savings against sequence risk in other words if there s a downturn early on it can derail a whole retirement plan according to wade pfau a professor of retirement income at the american college of financial services in the words of certified financial planner avani ramnani if there s a big loss in the market and you re taking withdrawals you could be taking more from your portfolio than what it can make up for obviously this doesn t matter so long as we can rely on stable returns on our assets frankly that isn t looking too likely we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us hedge fund manager and long time stock bull john hussman is now convinced that retirement savers are looking at years of low to negative returns from stocks thanks to the fed sponsored everything bubble we are fully convinced that these historic valuation extremes have removed decades of investment returns from the future and strongly suspect that the fed has amplified future downside risk as well i believe investors have placed themselves in a position that is likely to be rewarded by a very long interesting trip to nowhere over the coming 10 20 years he also hinted at the possibility the fed may not have the tools to bring the market back if it does collapse it s also worth noting that when investors are inclined toward risk aversion as they were in 2000 2002 and 2007 2009 even persistent and aggressive fed easing may not support stocks what about bonds the other half of the traditional 60 40 retirement savings portfolio bad news there too even treasury inflation protected securities tips have negative yields the combination of a near zero federal funds rate and 40 year high prices has created an economic situation where traditional conservative investments just don t work consider real after inflation yields on all treasuries from four week bills to 30 year bonds are negative that means buying a bond today guarantees after inflation losses for as long as 30 years in fact every single bond index the wall street journal tracks currently offers guaranteed after inflation losses with a single exception the most speculative ccc rated junkiest of junk bonds fortunately the treasury department developed a special investment to sell to americans concerned about rising prices the treasury inflation protected securities tips bond sounds good one small hiccup as charles schwab succinctly puts it all tips yields are negative today that s simply astonishing isn t it so if you re thinking about retiring within the next decade or so it s quite possible you ll need to make sure your savings can ride out the storm and you ll probably need to look beyond the traditional retirement savings assets can your savings endure the next decade and beyond one way to hedge against rising inflation the potential for a prolonged market correction and other challenges that could take place over the next decade is to consider diversifying some of your paper assets into a safe haven investing legend jeremy grantham agrees he summarized their recommendations to help ride out the coming storm a summary might be to avoid u s equities and emphasize the value stocks of emerging markets and several cheaper developed countries most notably japan speaking personally i also like some cash for flexibility some resources for inflation protection as well as a little gold and silver that safe haven could be an asset like physical gold or silver which typically don t lose their purchasing power because of inflation they re also good stores of value some investors diversify with physical precious metals in order to give themselves some dry powder to reallocate when the stock market reaches sane levels others enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing their savings can t be inflated away hacked or defaulted on whether you re planning to retire in the next few years or decades you should feel confident your financial future diversification with physical precious metals may be what you need add resilience to your nest egg

over ukraine and said the u s had brought pure nazis to power in kyiv as the u n security council held a stormy and bellicose debate on moscow s troop buildup near its southern neighbor u s ambassador linda thomas greenfield shot back that russia s growing military force of more than 100 000 troops along ukraine s borders was the largest mobilization in europe in decades adding that there has been a spike in cyberattacks and russian disinformation and they are attempting without any factual basis to paint ukraine and western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack she said linda thomas greenfield u s ambassador to the united nations addresses the united nations security council before a vote monday jan 31 2022 ap photo richard drew the harsh exchanges in the security council came as moscow lost an attempt to block the meeting and reflected the gulf between the two nuclear powers it was the first open session where all protagonists in the ukraine crisis spoke publicly even though the u n s most powerful body took no action hours later the russian government sent a written response to a u s proposal aimed at deescalating the crisis according to three biden administration officials the officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity a state department official declined to offer details of the response saying it would be unproductive to negotiate in public and that they would leave it up to russia to discuss the counterproposal although more high level diplomacy is expected this week talks between the u s and russia have so far failed to ease tensions in the crisis with the west saying moscow is preparing for an invasion russia denies it is planning to attack it demands pledges that ukraine will never join nato a halt to the deployment of nato weapons near russian borders and a rollback of the alliance s forces from eastern europe nato and the u s call those nonstarters russian ambassador vassily nebenzia accused the u s of interfering in his country s internal affairs and seeking a classic example of megaphone diplomacy thomas greenfield countered that the u s has held over 100 private meetings in the past few weeks with russian officials and european and ukrainian colleagues and it s now time for a discussion in public to russia s assertion that the u s called the meeting to make all council members feel uncomfortable she retorted imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100 000 troops sitting on your border after the council gave a green light for the meeting nebenzia accused the biden administration of whipping up tensions and rhetoric and provoking escalation you are almost pulling for this he said in his speech to the council looking at thomas greenfield you want it to happen you re waiting for it to happen as if you want to make your words become a reality he blamed the u s for the 2014 ouster of a kremlin friendly president in kyiv saying it brought to power nationalists radicals russophobes and pure nazis and created the antagonism that exists between ukraine and russia nebenzia pointedly left the council chamber as the ukrainian ambassador sergiy kyslytsya started to speak how long russia will pressure will pursue a clear attempt to push ukraine and its partners into a kafka trap kyslytsva asked the vote on holding an open meeting passed 10 2 with russia and china opposed and

the council including china after all 15 council members spoke the u s and russia sparred again with thomas greenfield saying she was disappointed in nebenzia s comments stressing that russian threats of aggression are provocative u s president joe biden said in a statement that the meeting was a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice to reject the use of force and seek military de escalation at the start of a white house meeting with the ruling emir of qatar biden said the u s continues to engage in nonstop diplomacy but we are ready no matter what happens ukraine s

bob menendez said that in the event of an attack lawmakers want russia to face the mother of all sanctions that includes actions against russian banks that could severely undermine the russian economy

burdett ny 01 31 2022 readmedia on monday gubernatorial candidate jumaane williams joined local business owners finger lakes residents and advocates to urge governor hochul to place a moratorium on climate killing bitcoin mining nys now hosts nearly 20 of the country s rapidly growing crypto mining industry to the detriment of small businesses pandemic depressed local economies the environment and the climate this event comes days after a group of federal lawmakers including sen elizabeth warren demanded details from the largest bitcoin miners about their contributions to climate change and impact on local power prices watch the press conference here bitcoin mines that use a proof of work process are known to cause significant damage to the environment and local economy which is why many countries have completely banned the practice unfortunately new york has fallen behind allowing nearly 20 of the country s mines to operate in our state without any oversight or regulation we need to ask questions now rather than dealing with the fallout later that s why governor hochul must declare a moratorium on this type of mining so our state can first create the right infrastructure to protect seneca lake and all of new york state from harmful economic and environmental impacts said gubernatorial candidate and nyc public advocate jumaane williams after being banned in china outside speculators are flocking to new york to take advantage of the nonexistent regulatory structure in order to mine what amounts to a tanking stock reform groups common cause ny and nypirg have criticized the crypto mining industry for exploiting public resources and straining the energy grid for private gain in doing so bitcoin mining operations raise energy costs for everyday new yorkers one study estimates the power demands of cryptocurrency mining operations in upstate new york push up annual electric bills by about 165 million for small businesses and 79 million for individuals the bitcoin mining industry is extremely energy intensive and will make it impossible for new york to meet the zero emission goals outlined by the climate leadership and community protection act its co2 emissions aren t just harmful for the climate this industry s air pollution includes the same type of particulate matter that the epa just found responsible for the preventable deaths of 143 000 elderly people in addition to calling for a moratorium williams joined locals to demand the department of environmental conservation deny greenidge generation s title v air permit renewal located on the shores of seneca lake greenidge generation a once mothballed power plant is using grandfathered in air permits to run 24 7 as a bitcoin mine greenidge operates 15 300 bitcoin mining machines with plans to expand pumping dirty fossil fuels into the air 24 7 and poisoning the lakes that the region s 3 billion tourism economy depends on greenidge sucks 139 million gallons of water each day from seneca lake and dumps it back in at 108 degrees causing toxic algal blooms that make the water source of 100 000 people non potable bitcoin is a fake currency that experts have called a ponzi scheme but that hasn t kept wealthy tech bros from invading new york state to destroy our natural resources kneecap local businesses and keep us from meeting the crucial climate goals outlined by the clcpa repowering or expanding coal and gas plants to make fake money in the middle of a climate crisis is literally insane we need governor hochul to impose a moratorium on proof of work crypto mining like fracking which new york state banned crypto mining poses a serious threat to the health and safety of all new yorkers said joseph campbell president of seneca lake guardian crypto mining is not a long term sustainable industry with any significant regional benefits the social costs far outweigh any benefits to our region the miners are mining for something that doesn t exist with its true value being called into question almost daily the ny wine industry generates over 6 billion per year with nearly 72 000 direct jobs resulting in 2 8 and growing direct wages and tourists alone spend in the neighborhood of 2 billion dollars these are industries creating real things with real value they are not speculative at their core the costs are simply not worth the return said rick rainey managing partner and conductor of forge cellars the greenidge plant has nothing to offer our community they are using our environmental resources for their personal gains fishing on seneca lake is on the decline due to various reasons and the last thing we need now is 130 million gallons being put back in the lake at 108 degrees every day said kees stapel fisherman and vineyard manager of boundary breaks winery at waterloo container we have always believed that our land lakes scenery and quality of life significantly contribute to who we are businesses that detract from our natural resources businesses that threaten our environment and endanger our way of life and our very existence have no place in the finger lakes we cannot in good faith allow greenridge s subtle erosion of our natural resources to continue we stand with seneca lake guardian and are committed to protecting our environment said mark pitifer special projects manager for waterloo container background more than 1 000 organizations businesses environmental activists concerned residents wine makers elected officials and more have taken action over the last year in opposition to crypto mining in new york state in letters to governor cuomo last year opposing greenidge generation s expansion from an emergency peaker plant to a 24 7 bitcoin mining operation organizations businesses and finger lakes residents demanded gov cuomo revoke greenidge s permits due to its massive greenhouse gas emissions poisoning of the finger lakes and noise pollution with no economic benefit to the community greenidge generation is still operating in dresden ny under grandfathered in permits granted for use as a peaker plant not 24 7 bitcoin mining greenidge has applied for an air permit renewal and is awaiting a decision from the department of environmental conservation similar fights have occurred in plattsburgh and niagara falls which resulted in local moratoriums seneca lake guardian is urging governor hochul to place a moratorium on proof of work crypto mining with dozens of environmental organizations in the stop proof of work crypto coalition including earthjustice nypirg sierra club and food and water watch there is a bill before both houses of the state legislature that would place a statewide moratorium on proof of work crypto mining s6486c and a7389b proof of work cryptocurrency is an extremely energy intensive process that requires thousands of machines whirring 24 7 to solve complex equations the more machines that are running the faster a coin is mined each one of these machines requires energy to run plus more energy to run cooling technology globally proof of work bitcoin mining uses the same amount of energy each day as the entire country of argentina it produces 30 700 metric tons of e waste each year comparable to the yearly it equipment waste of the netherlands there are 49 decommissioned or underutilized power plants across the state phasing out as new york reduces its greenhouse gas emissions that could again guzzle fossil fuels this time for their own private interests without any public benefit if left unregulated the industry will wreak irrevocable harm on the entire state of new york making it impossible to reach new york s crucial climate goals as outlined in the climate leadership and community protection act clcpa the clcpa commits to an 85 reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 and 100 zero emission electricity by 2040 crypto mining is also at odds with the overwhelmingly popular amendment to the state constitution guaranteeing every new yorker the right to clean air clean water and a healthful environment revitalizing old polluting power plants for private financial gain with drastic consequences for our air and water and causing huge amounts of noise pollution is now unconstitutional crypto mining privatizes access to the grid for private gain and sets a dangerous precedent wherein anyone with the resources to do so can burn fossil fuels and strain the grid in order to make a profit when crypto miners rely on the public grid they stick everyday new yorkers with the bill a 2021 study estimates the power demands of

by simon black on december 21 1789 just as france was in the very early days of its chaotic revolution the country s brand new constituent assembly passed a desperate decree aimed at preventing economic disaster france was already on the brink of financial ruin the national debt was so large that the annual interest payments were more than the government s entire tax revenue politicians knew that default was imminent and they needed to figure out a way to raise cash quickly so they hatched a new version of a very old idea create lots and lots of paper money france was primarily using gold silver and copper coins up to this point their main currency for example was the livre which contained about 0 6 grams of silver but with the stroke of a pen the assembly created a form of paper money called assignats the first decree in late 1789 authorized the printing of 400 million livres worth of the new paper money enough to give the government some financial breathing room but they first had to convince the public that these new assignats were actually valuable and not just worthless paper so the politicians then decreed that all the land owned by the catholic church in france would be confiscated by the government they valued this land at 2 billion livres or roughly 5x the amount of assignats that were being printed this was enough to convince the peasants that the paper money was backed by something of value and so the printing commenced naturally it didn t take long for the government to blow through the first batch of assignats so by august 1790 not even a year later the assembly authorized another round of printing worth 1 9 billion livres they promised of course that it would be the last time they issued new paper money yet the very next month in september 1790 they authorized another 800 million this farce continued until the french government had issued billions of assignats yet all along the way there were politicians and bankers who insisted that their constantly expanding paper money system was beneficial to the french economy they commissioned fancy reports and hired lofty experts who testified how successful their paper money system was but the real results were obvious the assignat experiment had triggered hyperinflation the government had to impose strict price controls which naturally led to shortages and french peasants were once again rioting in the streets over the lack of bread this chaos continued throughout france s revolutionary period until finally in the the year 1800 napoleon created a new central bank to stabilize the economy and prevent inflation that mission hasn t changed in more than two centuries even to this day the entire reason that central banks around the world even exist is to provide economic stability and prevent inflation they just always seem to forget about that second part and perhaps nowhere is this more obvious than in the united states even the official us government statistics show inflation at more than 7 it s been rising steadily for nearly a year yet the federal reserve has consistently downplayed inflation whenever anyone brought up the risk of inflation back in early 2021 fed officials would just gaslight them and insist that inflation did not exist by the summer of 2021 when inflation was obvious the fed changed its approach and started telling everyone that it was transitory and would go away with inflation accelerating into the end of 2021 the fed changed its approach once again and told us that they might maybe possibly eventually do something to fight inflation last week the fed issued a statement saying that the economy has improved and that economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us they cited the strong labor market and an easing of supply constraints this is all good news and a clear signal that the fed doesn t need to prop up the economy with 0 interest rates any longer yet then despite acknowledging that inflation is well above their target goal of 2 duh the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent wow so even though everything else in the economy looks fine they re still not yet going to lift a finger to do anything about inflation the fed might as well say suck it up america we ll get to inflation when we re damn well ready it s important to point out that these all seeing all knowing all powerful experts completely missed inflation precisely zero members of the fed s open market committee predicted last year that the us would be suffering 7 inflation they are also many of the same people who were trading the stock market and profiting from their own policy decisions during the pandemic yet we re still supposed to have unquestioning confidence that they have the situation under control and know what they re doing inflation really isn t difficult to understand it started with covid when the federal state and local governments created absurd anti productive economic conditions in the name of public health they paid people to stay home and not work they literally put free money in people s bank accounts they constantly published irrational fear propaganda and convinced tens of millions of people that they would all die if they left the house they forcibly shut businesses down and then once they graciously allowed businesses to open back up they tried requiring companies to fire nearly 100 million workers flush with cash consumers spent more money but businesses didn t have enough capacity or workers to keep up especially in critical sectors like trade and transportation whose challenges ripple through the entire economy so supply has been severely diminished at a time when demand is rising prices have naturally risen as a result but then the fed stepped in and shoveled trillions of dollars more into the economy sending prices even higher they also dumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the housing market and shocker home prices soared to all time highs like i said inflation is really not so complicated neither is fixing it allow people to work let businesses do business and stop playing god with interest rates and the money supply yet hunter biden s dad has come up with a different reason for inflation greed he seems to believe that these rising prices are because evil corporations are colluding to screw their customers obviously it has nothing to do with ridiculous anti competitive policies marxist legislation or idiotic public health regulations the fed meanwhile is blaming inflation squarely on supply chain difficulties to them it has nothing to do with them shoveling trillions of dollars into the economy over the past two years and just like the french in the 1790s their experts and fancy reports claim that all the money printing has been a good thing so the fed thinks that inflation will miraculously subside once the supply chain improves and the white house thinks the supply chain will improve by passing more regulations and by sending government agencies to harass private businesses neither recognizes that they are responsible for creating these conditions they failed to foresee the risks of their decisions and they ve totally misdiagnosed the problem that s why there s very little reason to believe they can fix it

united nations ap russia accused the west on monday of whipping up tensions over ukraine and said the u s had brought pure nazis to power in kyiv as the u n security council held a stormy and bellicose debate on moscow s troop buildup near its southern neighbor u s ambassador linda thomas greenfield shot back that russia s growing military force of more than 100 000 troops along ukraine s borders was the largest mobilization in europe in decades adding that there has been a spike in cyberattacks and russian disinformation and they are attempting without any factual basis to paint ukraine and western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack she said the harsh exchanges in the security council came as moscow lost an attempt to block the meeting and reflected the gulf between the two nuclear powers it was the first open session where all protagonists in the ukraine crisis spoke publicly even though the u n s most powerful body took no action although more high level diplomacy is expected this week talks between the u s and russia have so far failed to ease tensions in the crisis with the west saying moscow is preparing for an invasion russia denies it is planning to attack it demands pledges that ukraine will never join nato a halt to the deployment of nato weapons near russian borders and a rollback of the alliance s forces from eastern europe nato and the u s call those nonstarters russian ambassador vassily nebenzia accused the biden administration of whipping up tensions and rhetoric and provoking escalation you are almost pulling for this he said looking at thomas greenfield you want it to happen you re waiting for it to happen as if you want to make your words become a reality he blamed the u s for the 2014 ouster of a kremlin friendly president in kyiv saying it brought to power nationalists radicals russophobes and pure nazis and created the antagonism that exists between ukraine and russia if they hadn t done this then we to date would be living in a spirit of good neighborly relations and mutual cooperation nebenzia said however some in the west just don t clearly like this positive scenario what s happening today is yet another attempt to drive a wedge between russia and ukraine nebenzia pointedly left the council chamber as the ukrainian ambassador sergiy kyslytsya started to speak how long russia will pressure will pursue a clear attempt to push ukraine and its partners into a kafka trap kyslytsva asked the vote on holding an open meeting passed 10 2 with russia and china opposed and india gabon and kenya abstaining nine yes votes were needed for the meeting to go ahead china s ambassador zhang jun said he voted against the public meeting because what is urgently needed now is quiet diplomacy not megaphone diplomacy the u s and its allies had pressed to hold the meeting monday the last day of norway s rotating presidency of the council before russia takes over tuesday for the month of february any statement or resolution by the security council is extremely unlikely given russia s veto power and its ties with others on the council including china after all 15 council members spoke the u s and russia sparred again with thomas greenfield saying she was disappointed in nebenzia s comments stressing that russian threats of aggression are provocative i say to russia simply this your actions will speak for themselves the u s envoy said nebenzia shot back everything that we wanted to say is in our statement today however we really just don t understand what threats and provocations and escalation by russia is being talked about u s president joe biden said in a statement that the meeting was a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice to reject the use of force and seek military de escalation at the start of a white house meeting with the ruling emir of qatar biden said the u s continues to engage in nonstop diplomacy but we are ready no matter what happens russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and u s secretary of state antony blinken did not make any visible progress in easing the tensions at their meeting in geneva earlier this month they are expected to speak by phone tuesday according to the russian foreign ministry a senior state department official confirmed the russian account biden warned ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy in a phone call thursday that there is a distinct possibility russia could begin an incursion in february but the ukrainian leader sought to play down the war fears saying western alarm over an imminent invasion has prompted many investors in the country s financial markets to cash out zelenskyy said friday that we aren t seeing any escalation bigger than before and charged that the russian buildup could be an attempt by moscow to exert psychological pressure and sow panic british prime minister boris johnson will visit ukraine on tuesday for talks with zelenskyy and will also speak with russian president vladimir putin to urge him to step back johnson s office said johnson says he is considering sending hundreds of british troops to nato countries in the baltic region as a show of strength speaking sunday on abc s this week thomas greenfield said of russia we re going into the room prepared to listen to them but we re not going to be distracted by their propaganda she said last week that council members must squarely examine the facts and consider what is at stake for ukraine for russia for europe and for the core obligations and principles of the international order should russia further invade ukraine on friday china s ambassador zhang said both sides have shown willingness to continue negotiations and should be allowed to continue on sunday the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee sen bob menendez said that in the event of an attack lawmakers want russia to face the mother of all sanctions that includes actions against russian banks that could severely undermine the russian economy and increased lethal aid to ukraine s military the sanctions under consideration would apparently be significantly stronger than those imposed after russia annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014 those penalties have been seen as ineffective menendez also raised the prospect of imposing punishments preemptively before any invasion white house press secretary jen psaki said monday the administration was encouraged by the bipartisan effort in congress to hold russia accountable the administration has previously expressed concern that preemptive sanctions could diminish their leverage on russia but the white house sounded warmer to the prospect as the foreign relations committee moves to act our view is that sanctions can be an effective tool of deterrence and the deepening sell off in russian markets reflects our message to russia psaki said ___ associated press writers vladimir isachenkov in moscow aamer madhani and matthew lee in

joe rogan has waded into yet another controversy surrounding his spotify podcast resulting in music legends neil young and joni mitchell removing their music from the platform as a form of protest against rogan if this is your first time hearing about the joe rogan spotify controversy allow us to fill you in but first let s start at the beginning in 2020 spotify struck an exclusivity deal with rogan for his podcast the joe rogan experience the deal allegedly cost the platform more than 100 million according to the wall street journal the podcast its guests and host have been criticized for plugging controversial opinions about a variety of topics including spreading misinformation about the covid 19 pandemic in december 2021 270 doctors physicians and science educators wrote an open letter to spotify in it they called out several conspiracy theories aired on the joe rogan experience and urged the platform to implement some sort of misinformation policy the move came after rogan welcomed dr robert malone onto his dec 31 episode malone has been suspended from twitter for spreading covid misinformation while on the show the controversial scientist promoted the theory that people have been hypnotized into believing certain things about covid rogan s podcast has an estimated 11 million listeners per episode according to the letter the medical professionals who signed the open letter pointed out the inherent risk of allowing misinformation to be spread unchecked to so many neil young took a stand first iconic musician neil young took a stand against joe rogan and the misinformation being shared on his podcast in doing so the artist set himself up for a stand off with spotify last week the rock legend demanded that his management team and record label remove his discography from spotify in a since deleted letter according to rolling stone i want you to let spotify know immediately today that i want all my music off their platform he wrote they can have rogan or young not both most of young s music has since been removed from the platform he explained his decision and hit back against claims that he was a proponent of censorship in an open letter on his website i support free speech young wrote i have never been in favor of censorship private companies have the right to choose what they profit from just as i can choose not to have my music support a platform that disseminates harmful information i am happy and proud to stand in solidarity with the health care workers who risk their lives every day to help others young also voiced his support other streaming platforms such as amazon and apple music as well as claimed that spotify reduces the quality of sound since then other celebrities have voiced support for young joni mitchell also removed her music from spotify perhaps the most notable celebrity to support neil young is joni mitchell the living legend voiced her agreement with young in an open letter on her website i ve decided to remove all my music from spotify she wrote irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives i stand in solidarity with neil young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue the los angeles times notes that e street band musician nils lofgren and podcaster brené brown followed young s lead too others including the foo fighters were also rumored to join young but have not yet done so as of publishing time prince harry and meghan markle expressed concerns about misinformation in a statement shared with cnn a spokesperson for prince harry and meghan markle s archewell organization had something to say about the risk of covid misinformation being shared on platforms like spotify last april our co founders began expressing concerns to our partners at spotify about the all too real consequences of covid 19 misinformation on its platform they said we have continued to express our concerns to spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis it s important to note that the statement does not directly address rogan however it was released following young and mitchell s respective decisions to remove their music from spotify spotify finally weighed in after a week in the news on jan 30 spotify s ceo daniel ek published a letter on the company s for the record blog addressing the controversy ek acknowledged that the platform hosts individuals and views that he disagrees with strongly he also stressed the importance of balancing creator expression with listener safety it is important to me that we don t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them he wrote ek also confirmed that the platform would take several steps to combat disinformation for starters he shared spotify s long standing platform rules ek also revealed plans to highlight the platform rules so that creators are better aware of them as well as add content advisory alerts to any podcast episode that discusses covid the move comes after spotify reportedly suffered some pretty severe losses at the stock market datebook reports that the platform took a hit of around 4 billion to its market value in the week after young put them on blast however wall street journal notes that the app apparently has no plans to remove any of rogan s controversial podcast episodes rogan released his own statement that takes us to where we re at today jan 31 the latest person to wade into the controversy is joe rogan himself rogan took to instagram to address the situation in a nearly 10 minute long video in it he apologized and claimed he was not trying to promote misinformation or be intentionally controversial i think there s a lot of people that have a distorted perception of what i do maybe based on sound bites or based on headlines of articles that are disparaging he mused rogan also defended some of his controversial guests as being very highly credentialed very intelligent very accomplished people he also noted that they have an opinion that s different from the mainstream narrative i wanted to hear what their opinion is i had them on and because of that those episodes in particular were labeled as being dangerous they had dangerous misinformation he added variety notes that rogan takes issue with the term misinformation since opinions on topics such as the efficacy of cloth masks have changed over time the cdc currently recommends wearing a mask that has two or more layers of washable breathable fabric and fully covers the nose mouth and chin the podcast host speculated about how he could address the controversy moving forward a possible solution he floated includes bringing people with different views onto his podcast so that both sides can voice their opinions his video has since been viewed more than 4 9 million times watch rogan s lengthy video for yourself below

joe rogan has waded into yet another controversy surrounding his spotify podcast resulting in music legends neil young and joni mitchell removing their music from the platform as a form of protest against rogan if this is your first time hearing about the joe rogan spotify controversy allow us to fill you in but first let s start at the beginning in 2020 spotify struck an exclusivity deal with rogan for his podcast the joe rogan experience the deal allegedly cost the platform more than 100 million according to the wall street journal the podcast its guests and host have been criticized for plugging controversial opinions about a variety of topics including spreading misinformation about the covid 19 pandemic in december 2021 270 doctors physicians and science educators wrote an open letter to spotify in it they called out several conspiracy theories aired on the joe rogan experience and urged the platform to implement some sort of misinformation policy the move came after rogan welcomed dr robert malone onto his dec 31 episode malone has been suspended from twitter for spreading covid misinformation while on the show the controversial scientist promoted the theory that people have been hypnotized into believing certain things about covid rogan s podcast has an estimated 11 million listeners per episode according to the letter the medical professionals who signed the open letter pointed out the inherent risk of allowing misinformation to be spread unchecked to so many neil young took a stand first iconic musician neil young took a stand against joe rogan and the misinformation being shared on his podcast in doing so the artist set himself up for a stand off with spotify last week the rock legend demanded that his management team and record label remove his discography from spotify in a since deleted letter according to rolling stone i want you to let spotify know immediately today that i want all my music off their platform he wrote they can have rogan or young not both most of young s music has since been removed from the platform he explained his decision and hit back against claims that he was a proponent of censorship in an open letter on his website i support free speech young wrote i have never been in favor of censorship private companies have the right to choose what they profit from just as i can choose not to have my music support a platform that disseminates harmful information i am happy and proud to stand in solidarity with the health care workers who risk their lives every day to help others young also voiced his support other streaming platforms such as amazon and apple music as well as claimed that spotify reduces the quality of sound since then other celebrities have voiced support for young joni mitchell also removed her music from spotify perhaps the most notable celebrity to support neil young is joni mitchell the living legend voiced her agreement with young in an open letter on her website i ve decided to remove all my music from spotify she wrote irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives i stand in solidarity with neil young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue the los angeles times notes that e street band musician nils lofgren and podcaster brené brown followed young s lead too others including the foo fighters were also rumored to join young but have not yet done so as of publishing time prince harry and meghan markle expressed concerns about misinformation in a statement shared with cnn a spokesperson for prince harry and meghan markle s archewell organization had something to say about the risk of covid misinformation being shared on platforms like spotify last april our co founders began expressing concerns to our partners at spotify about the all too real consequences of covid 19 misinformation on its platform they said we have continued to express our concerns to spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis it s important to note that the statement does not directly address rogan however it was released following young and mitchell s respective decisions to remove their music from spotify spotify finally weighed in after a week in the news on jan 30 spotify s ceo daniel ek published a letter on the company s for the record blog addressing the controversy ek acknowledged that the platform hosts individuals and views that he disagrees with strongly he also stressed the importance of balancing creator expression with listener safety it is important to me that we don t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them he wrote ek also confirmed that the platform would take several steps to combat disinformation for starters he shared spotify s long standing platform rules ek also revealed plans to highlight the platform rules so that creators are better aware of them as well as add content advisory alerts to any podcast episode that discusses covid the move comes after spotify reportedly suffered some pretty severe losses at the stock market datebook reports that the platform took a hit of around 4 billion to its market value in the week after young put them on blast however wall street journal notes that the app apparently has no plans to remove any of rogan s controversial podcast episodes rogan released his own statement that takes us to where we re at today jan 31 the latest person to wade into the controversy is joe rogan himself rogan took to instagram to address the situation in a nearly 10 minute long video in it he apologized and claimed he was not trying to promote misinformation or be intentionally controversial i think there s a lot of people that have a distorted perception of what i do maybe based on sound bites or based on headlines of articles that are disparaging he mused rogan also defended some of his controversial guests as being very highly credentialed very intelligent very accomplished people he also noted that they have an opinion that s different from the mainstream narrative i wanted to hear what their opinion is i had them on and because of that those episodes in particular were labeled as being dangerous they had dangerous misinformation he added variety notes that rogan takes issue with the term misinformation since opinions on topics such as the efficacy of cloth masks have changed over time the cdc currently recommends wearing a mask that has two or more layers of washable breathable fabric and fully covers the nose mouth and chin the podcast host speculated about how he could address the controversy moving forward a possible solution he floated includes bringing people with different views onto his podcast so that both sides can voice their opinions his video has since been viewed more than 4 9 million times watch rogan s lengthy video for yourself below

members of congress use privileged information to make money on the stock market while they re supposed to be working for you make no mistake it s legalized corruption btw if you d like my daily analyses commentary and drawings please subscribe to my free newsletter robertreich substack com there s no good reason for elected officials to trade individual stocks at all unless you have special insider knowledge buying and selling individual stocks is a terrible way to get rich it s gambling plain and simple that s why many americans with retirement accounts prefer to invest in index funds which are tied to the performance of the entire stock market but many members of congress continue to invest in individual stocks and some do quite well how do they do it can congress really use insider information to trade stocks robert reich www youtube com consider this just before the economy crashed in 2008 several lawmakers frantically shifted their holdings to safer investments this frenzy came just after private meetings with treasury officials who had warned that an economic disaster was imminent i imagine most of you weren t invited to these meetings i certainly wasn t but those lawmakers were and likely chose to act on that information when this story came to light people were naturally outraged after immense public pressure congress passed the stock act in 2012 the act required lawmakers to disclose their stock sales and those of their spouses within 45 days by forcing these transactions to be public the hope was that lawmakers would stop making questionable trades and it worked well partially in january 2020 a handful of senators including richard burr dianne feinstein and kelly loeffler all made significant trades after receiving a classified briefing on covid 19 well before the public knew the full extent of the threat few if any lawmakers have faced serious consequences for violating the spirit or the letter of the law as insider trading is notoriously difficult to prove in 2021 alone news outlets identified 43 lawmakers who failed to properly disclose their trades their punishment nothing lawmakers are supposed to face a paltry 200 fine for failing to report on time but congressional ethics officials usually waive it there is an obvious solution to all this bar members of congress from trading individual stocks the proposed ban conflicted trading act does just this lawmakers would have six months after being elected to sell their individual holdings transfer them to a blind trust over which they have no control or hold onto them until they leave office without trading them but congress has yet to hold a vote on this bill even though 67 percent of americans agree it s a good idea to prevent members of congress from trading individual stocks as usual follow the money a majority of lawmakers are millionaires who likely get a sizable chunk of their wealth from investments and trades so they won t support this bill unless there s enough public outcry to make them that s where you come in with distrust in government near an all time high even the appearance of a conflict of interest hurts our democracy members of congress are elected to represent the interests of the people not the money in their brokerage accounts banning members of congress from trading individual stocks is a no brainer let s get it done robert b reich is chancellor s professor of public policy at the university of california at berkeley senior fellow at the blum center for developing economies and writes at robertreich substack com reich served as secretary of labor in the clinton administration for which time magazine named him one of the ten most effective cabinet secretaries of the twentieth century he has written fifteen books including the best sellers aftershock the work of nations and beyond outrage and his most recent the common good which is available in bookstores now he is also a founding editor of the american prospect magazine chairman of common cause a member of the american academy of arts and sciences and co creator of the award winning documentary inequality for all he s co creator of the netflix original documentary saving capitalism which is streaming now

edith m lederer the associated press united nations ap russia accused the west on monday of whipping up tensions over ukraine and said the u s had brought pure nazis to power in kyiv as the u n security council held a stormy and bellicose debate on moscow s troop buildup near its southern neighbor u s ambassador linda thomas greenfield shot back that russia s growing military force of more than 100 000 troops along ukraine s borders was the largest mobilization in europe in decades adding that there has been a spike in cyberattacks and russian disinformation and they are attempting without any factual basis to paint ukraine and western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack she said the harsh exchanges in the security council came as moscow lost an attempt to block the meeting and reflected the gulf between the two nuclear powers it was the first open session where all protagonists in the ukraine crisis spoke publicly even though the u n s most powerful body took no action hours later the russian government sent a written response to a u s proposal aimed at deescalating the crisis according to three biden administration officials the officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity a state department official declined to offer details of the response saying it would be unproductive to negotiate in public and that they would leave it up to russia to discuss the counterproposal although more high level diplomacy is expected this week talks between the u s and russia have so far failed to ease tensions in the crisis with the west saying moscow is preparing for an invasion russia denies it is planning to attack it demands pledges that ukraine will never join nato a halt to the deployment of nato weapons near russian borders and a rollback of the alliance s forces from eastern europe nato and the u s call those nonstarters russian ambassador vassily nebenzia accused the u s of interfering in his country s internal affairs and seeking a classic example of megaphone diplomacy thomas greenfield countered that the u s has held over 100 private meetings in the past few weeks with russian officials and european and ukrainian colleagues and it s now time for a discussion in public to russia s assertion that the u s called the meeting to make all council members feel uncomfortable she retorted imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100 000 troops sitting on your border after the council gave a green light for the meeting nebenzia accused the biden administration of whipping up tensions and rhetoric and provoking escalation you are almost pulling for this he said in his speech to the council looking at thomas greenfield you want it to happen you re waiting for it to happen as if you want to make your words become a reality he blamed the u s for the 2014 ouster of a kremlin friendly president in kyiv saying it brought to power nationalists radicals russophobes and pure nazis and created the antagonism that exists between ukraine and russia if they hadn t done this then we to date would be living in a spirit of good neighborly relations and mutual cooperation nebenzia said however some in the west just don t clearly like this positive scenario what s happening today is yet another attempt to drive a wedge between russia and ukraine nebenzia pointedly left the council chamber as the ukrainian ambassador sergiy kyslytsya started to speak how long russia will pressure will pursue a clear attempt to push ukraine and its partners into a kafka trap kyslytsva asked the vote on holding an open meeting passed 10 2 with russia and china opposed and india gabon and kenya abstaining nine yes votes were needed for the meeting to go ahead the u s and its allies had pressed to hold the meeting monday the last day of norway s rotating presidency of the council before russia takes over tuesday for the month of february any statement or resolution by the security council is extremely unlikely given russia s veto power and its ties with others on the council including china after all 15 council members spoke the u s and russia sparred again with thomas greenfield saying she was disappointed in nebenzia s comments stressing that russian threats of aggression are provocative i say to russia simply this your actions will speak for themselves the u s envoy said nebenzia shot back everything that we wanted to say is in our statement today however we really just don t understand what threats and provocations and escalation by russia is being talked about u s president joe biden said in a statement that the meeting was a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice to reject the use of force and seek military de escalation at the start of a white house meeting with the ruling emir of qatar biden said the u s continues to engage in nonstop diplomacy but we are ready no matter what happens russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and u s secretary of state antony blinken did not make any visible progress in easing the tensions at their meeting in geneva earlier this month they are expected to speak by phone tuesday according to the russian foreign ministry a senior state department official confirmed the russian account biden warned ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy in a phone call thursday that there is a distinct possibility russia could begin an incursion in february but the ukrainian leader sought to play down the war fears saying western alarm over an imminent invasion has prompted many investors in the country s financial markets to cash out zelenskyy said friday that we aren t seeing any escalation bigger than before and charged that the russian buildup could be an attempt by moscow to exert psychological pressure and sow panic british prime minister boris johnson will visit ukraine on tuesday for talks with zelenskyy and will also speak with russian president vladimir putin to urge him to step back johnson s office said johnson says he is considering sending hundreds of british troops to nato countries in the baltic region as a show of strength on sunday the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee sen bob menendez said that in the event of an attack lawmakers want russia to face the mother of all sanctions that includes actions against russian banks that could severely undermine the russian economy and increased lethal aid to ukraine s military the sanctions under consideration would apparently be significantly stronger than those imposed after russia annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014 those penalties have been seen as ineffective menendez also raised the prospect of imposing punishments preemptively before any invasion white house press secretary jen psaki said monday the administration was encouraged by the bipartisan effort in congress to hold russia accountable the administration has previously expressed concern that preemptive sanctions could diminish their leverage on russia but the white house sounded warmer to the prospect as the foreign relations committee moves to act our view is that sanctions can be an effective tool of deterrence and the deepening sell off in russian markets reflects our message to russia psaki said associated press writers vladimir isachenkov in moscow aamer madhani and matthew lee in washington and jill lawless in london contributed to this report

this article is more than 2 years old big things 1 the next big software buyout neither elliott management nor vista equity partners is any stranger to massive acquisitions but the two had to team up to find their most massive deal yet elliott and vista revealed plans today to buy cloud software specialist citrix systems for 16 5 billion in cash the biggest buyout announced yet this year and one of the biggest transactions of any kind to emerge from the pandemic deal boom the two firms plan to merge citrix with tibco software an existing vista portfolio company to create a massive new provider of remote access tools virtualization software and a wide range of other enterprise offerings getty images the story of citrix and elliott is a long and winding one elliott first took a stake in the company in 2015 and promptly embarked on an activist push to transform its operations judging by the stock price it was a rousing success citrix shares were trading for less than 60 when elliott revealed its investment by the time elliott managing partner jesse cohn left the company s board of directors in april 2020 the stock was nearing 150 it didn t last however citrix s business boomed after the onset of the pandemic when its remote access offerings were all the rage among its corporate clients citrix thought that robust growth would continue in 2021 it didn t as a result the florida based company missed its earnings target in three straight quarters and its share price plunged nearly 50 since its 2020 high for elliott the thinking is apparent enough the firm helped add billions of dollars to citrix s valuation during its first stint as an investor now it will try to do so again elliott and vista will pay 104 per share for citrix a 29 premium to the company s share price as of dec 7 the day before reports of a potential deal first emerged but also about 37 lower than its recent pandemic high vista is also familiar with citrix last march citrix bought fellow enterprise software developer wrike for 2 25 billion easily its biggest acquisition ever the seller vista which had bought wrike for a reported 800 million in 2018 between citrix tibco and wrike that s three different software companies with close ties to elliott and vista the two firms are betting that combining them all into one entity will be the best way to reverse citrix s recent plunge before today vista s largest buyout ever occurred in 2015 per pitchbook when it took solera private for 6 5 billion elliott and its evergreen coast capital private equity affiliate have conducted a handful of billion dollar deals over the past few years including the 2018 purchase of athenahealth for 5 7 billion but none has yet come close to the size of today s deal as fate would have it athenahealth was also the subject of the biggest buyout of the past several months in november elliott and co owner veritas capital agreed to sell the healthcare software specialist to hellman friedman and bain capital for 17 billion the software sector has been home to a handful of other recent 11 digit deals a half dozen investors clubbed up to buy mcafee for some 14 billion in november and thoma bravo closed its 12 3 billion buyout of proofpoint in august all those deals came when tech stocks were still running wild but new signs of bearishness have emerged in january will that scare off some investors or will these sorts of massive software transactions continue to proliferate in the months to come it s a question worth watching elliott and vista though are moving confidently into the future with their new look software colossus sometimes having five years of familiarity pays off getty 2 cvc s succession it s shaping up to be a year filled with major changes for cvc capital partners reports have swirled that the firm is getting ready for an ipo sometime in 2022 and over the weekend the european investor announced that cofounder and co chair steve koltes

joe rogan has waded into yet another controversy surrounding his spotify podcast resulting in music legends neil young and joni mitchell removing their music from the platform as a form of protest against rogan if this is your first time hearing about the joe rogan spotify controversy allow us to fill you in but first let s start at the beginning in 2020 spotify struck an exclusivity deal with rogan for his podcast the joe rogan experience the deal allegedly cost the platform more than 100 million according to the wall street journal the podcast its guests and host have been criticized for plugging controversial opinions about a variety of topics including spreading misinformation about the covid 19 pandemic in december 2021 270 doctors physicians and science educators wrote an open letter to spotify in it they called out several conspiracy theories aired on the joe rogan experience and urged the platform to implement some sort of misinformation policy the move came after rogan welcomed dr robert malone onto his dec 31 episode malone has been suspended from twitter for spreading covid misinformation while on the show the controversial scientist promoted the theory that people have been hypnotized into believing certain things about covid rogan s podcast has an estimated 11 million listeners per episode according to the letter the medical professionals who signed the open letter pointed out the inherent risk of allowing misinformation to be spread unchecked to so many neil young took a stand first iconic musician neil young took a stand against joe rogan and the misinformation being shared on his podcast in doing so the artist set himself up for a stand off with spotify last week the rock legend demanded that his management team and record label remove his discography from spotify in a since deleted letter according to rolling stone i want you to let spotify know immediately today that i want all my music off their platform he wrote they can have rogan or young not both most of young s music has since been removed from the platform he explained his decision and hit back against claims that he was a proponent of censorship in an open letter on his website i support free speech young wrote i have never been in favor of censorship private companies have the right to choose what they profit from just as i can choose not to have my music support a platform that disseminates harmful information i am happy and proud to stand in solidarity with the health care workers who risk their lives every day to help others young also voiced his support other streaming platforms such as amazon and apple music as well as claimed that spotify reduces the quality of sound since then other celebrities have voiced support for young joni mitchell also removed her music from spotify perhaps the most notable celebrity to support neil young is joni mitchell the living legend voiced her agreement with young in an open letter on her website i ve decided to remove all my music from spotify she wrote irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives i stand in solidarity with neil young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue the los angeles times notes that e street band musician nils lofgren and podcaster brené brown followed young s lead too others including the foo fighters were also rumored to join young but have not yet done so as of publishing time prince harry and meghan markle expressed concerns about misinformation in a statement shared with cnn a spokesperson for prince harry and meghan markle s archewell organization had something to say about the risk of covid misinformation being shared on platforms like spotify last april our co founders began expressing concerns to our partners at spotify about the all too real consequences of covid 19 misinformation on its platform they said we have continued to express our concerns to spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis it s important to note that the statement does not directly address rogan however it was released following young and mitchell s respective decisions to remove their music from spotify spotify finally weighed in after a week in the news on jan 30 spotify s ceo daniel ek published a letter on the company s for the record blog addressing the controversy ek acknowledged that the platform hosts individuals and views that he disagrees with strongly he also stressed the importance of balancing creator expression with listener safety it is important to me that we don t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them he wrote ek also confirmed that the platform would take several steps to combat disinformation for starters he shared spotify s long standing platform rules ek also revealed plans to highlight the platform rules so that creators are better aware of them as well as add content advisory alerts to any podcast episode that discusses covid the move comes after spotify reportedly suffered some pretty severe losses at the stock market datebook reports that the platform took a hit of around 4 billion to its market value in the week after young put them on blast however wall street journal notes that the app apparently has no plans to remove any of rogan s controversial podcast episodes rogan released his own statement that takes us to where we re at today jan 31 the latest person to wade into the controversy is joe rogan himself rogan took to instagram to address the situation in a nearly 10 minute long video in it he apologized and claimed he was not trying to promote misinformation or be intentionally controversial i think there s a lot of people that have a distorted perception of what i do maybe based on sound bites or based on headlines of articles that are disparaging he mused rogan also defended some of his controversial guests as being very highly credentialed very intelligent very accomplished people he also noted that they have an opinion that s different from the mainstream narrative i wanted to hear what their opinion is i had them on and because of that those episodes in particular were labeled as being dangerous they had dangerous misinformation he added variety notes that rogan takes issue with the term misinformation since opinions on topics such as the efficacy of cloth masks have changed over time the cdc currently recommends wearing a mask that has two or more layers of washable breathable fabric and fully covers the nose mouth and chin the podcast host speculated about how he could address the controversy moving forward a possible solution he floated includes bringing people with different

united nations ap russia accused the west on monday of whipping up tensions over ukraine and said the u s had brought pure nazis to power in kyiv as the u n united nations ap russia accused the west on monday of whipping up tensions over ukraine and said the u s had brought pure nazis to power in kyiv as the u n security council held a stormy and bellicose debate on moscow s troop buildup near its southern neighbor u s ambassador linda thomas greenfield shot back that russia s growing military force of more than 100 000 troops along ukraine s borders was the largest mobilization in europe in decades adding that there has been a spike in cyberattacks and russian disinformation and they are attempting without any factual basis to paint ukraine and western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack she said the harsh exchanges in the security council came as moscow lost an attempt to block the meeting and reflected the gulf between the two nuclear powers it was the first open session where all protagonists in the ukraine crisis spoke publicly even though the u n s most powerful body took no action hours later the russian government sent a written response to a u s proposal aimed at deescalating the crisis according to three biden administration officials the officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity a state department official declined to offer details of the response saying it would be unproductive to negotiate in public and that they would leave it up to russia to discuss the counterproposal although more high level diplomacy is expected this week talks between the u s and russia have so far failed to ease tensions in the crisis with the west saying moscow is preparing for an invasion russia denies it is planning to attack it demands pledges that ukraine will never join nato a halt to the deployment of nato weapons near russian borders and a rollback of the alliance s forces from eastern europe nato and the u s call those nonstarters russian ambassador vassily nebenzia accused the u s of interfering in his country s internal affairs and seeking a classic example of megaphone diplomacy thomas greenfield countered that the u s has held over 100 private meetings in the past few weeks with russian officials and european and ukrainian colleagues and it s now time for a discussion in public to russia s assertion that the u s called the meeting to make all council members feel uncomfortable she retorted imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100 000 troops sitting on your border after the council gave a green light for the meeting nebenzia accused the biden administration of whipping up tensions and rhetoric and provoking escalation you are almost pulling for this he said in his speech to the council looking at thomas greenfield you want it to happen you re waiting for it to happen as if you want to make your words become a reality he blamed the u s for the 2014 ouster of a kremlin friendly president in kyiv saying it brought to power nationalists radicals russophobes and pure nazis and created the antagonism that exists between ukraine and russia nebenzia pointedly left the council chamber as the ukrainian ambassador sergiy kyslytsya started to speak how long russia will pressure will pursue a clear attempt to push ukraine and its partners into a kafka trap kyslytsva asked the vote on holding an open meeting passed 10 2 with russia and china opposed and india gabon and kenya abstaining nine yes votes were needed for the meeting to go ahead the u s and its allies had pressed to hold the meeting monday the last day of norway s rotating presidency of the council before russia takes over tuesday for the month of february any statement or resolution by the security council is extremely unlikely given russia s veto power and its ties with others on the council including china after all 15 council members spoke the u s and russia sparred again with thomas greenfield saying she was disappointed in nebenzia s comments stressing that russian threats of aggression are provocative u s president joe biden said in a statement that the meeting was a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice to reject the use of force and seek military de escalation at the start of a white house meeting with the ruling emir of qatar biden said the u s continues to engage in nonstop diplomacy but we are ready no matter what happens the state department on monday ordered the departure of families of american diplomats in belarus where russia is deploying troops tanks and other materiel in what moscow says is a military exercise western officials fear russia s troop buildup could use belarus as a jumping off point to invade neighboring ukraine especially its capital kyiv from the north tens of thousands of other russian troops already are staged elsewhere along ukraine s borders belarus officials already have pushed most u s embassy staff out of the country leaving fewer family members to be affected by monday s order the u s has also drawn down its diplomatic presence in ukraine russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and u s secretary of state antony blinken are expected to speak by phone tuesday according to the russian foreign ministry a senior state department official confirmed the russian account british prime minister boris johnson will visit ukraine on tuesday for talks with president volodymyr zelenskyy and will also speak with russian president vladimir putin to urge him to step back johnson s office said johnson says he is considering sending hundreds of british troops to nato countries in the baltic region as a show of strength democrats and republicans in the u s congress said monday they were still divided over some of the timing in draft sanctions legislation against russia a republican push to impose sanctions on a russian natural gas pipeline to germany nord stream 2 even before any new russian push into ukraine was a main sticking point lawmakers said the biden administration argues for waiting after any invasion saying sanctioning nord stream now could alienate an ally germany and remove the deterrence power of that sanctions threat on sunday the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee sen bob menendez said that in the event of an attack lawmakers want russia to face the mother of all sanctions that includes actions against russian banks that could severely undermine the russian economy and increased lethal aid to ukraine s military white house press secretary jen psaki said monday the administration was encouraged by the bipartisan effort in congress to hold russia accountable the administration has previously expressed concern that preemptive sanctions could diminish their leverage on russia but the white house sounded warmer to the prospect as the foreign relations committee moves to act our view is that sanctions can be an effective tool of deterrence and the deepening sell off in russian markets reflects our message to russia psaki said ___ associated press writers vladimir isachenkov in moscow aamer madhani matthew lee and ellen knickmeyer in washington and jill lawless in london contributed to this report ___ follow ap stories on the crisis in ukraine at edith m lederer the associated press
what are the differences between a cpa a bookkeeper and an accountant while all three of these professionals handle the finances for their employer they each have different scopes of work bookkeepers record every company transaction involving money accountants provide a more in depth analysis of financial transactions cpas are state approved accountants who need to pass exams to be able to use that title many people think of cpas as accountants who work with numbers but the truth is that they are not just accountants they are also professionals who give advice to individual taxpayers and businesses on tax matters you may be wondering what las vegas cpa professionals do or how cpa for medical professionals differs from other types of cpas read this blog post to find out 1 what is a cpa also known as certified public accountants a cpa earns 10 15 more than a bookkeeper or an accountant the process of becoming a cpa is tough and in most places you ll need a bachelor s degree they need to follow certain regulations regarding their experience and continuing education before passing the certified public accountant examination cpa professionals take on more obligations and duties when compared with bookkeepers and accountants they also audit and oversee the company s financial information and may work with an organization s accountants and bookkeepers the professionals cpa offer a range of tax financial and auditing services 2 what is a bookkeeper once upon a time a bookkeeper was the one who was in charge of keeping accounts in a hard copy form nowadays bookkeepers are more prone to using software programs and applications but the end goal is the same keep track of the money moving in and out of the company a bookkeeper focuses more on recording the transactions made by a company whether they are big or small because of this bookkeepers do not deal with financial analysis and tax related concerns aside from recording purchases and sales a bookkeeper also adjusts the books which includes updating accounts and reconciling ledgers bookkeepers track accounts receivable and accounts payable so the company is aware of how much it owes and what consumers owe to them they settle the accounts for payable bills they maintain and process the payroll system bookkeepers do not require a college education some bookkeepers have only a high school diploma 3 what is an accountant unlike a bookkeeper or a cpa an accountant is someone who provides a more in depth analysis of financial transactions bookkeeping is just a section of accountants accounting is a far more complicated and analytical job role they evaluate financial data to produce financial forecasts as well as advise on elements that may have an impact on the company s growth accountants can work for either public or private companies and they may also be referred to as an auditor an accountant s main goal is to offer more complex services than bookkeeping for clients but not so much as cpa professionals who have additional responsibilities such as providing tax related advice or auditing companies financial statements 4 how are they different only cpas can produce an audited financial statement such as a balance sheet or an income statement whereas any accountant may do so on the stock market firms that offer shares must give audited statements to investors so they can evaluate the stock s value small businesses without a public offering may get by with a non cpa accountant the main difference between these two professions comes down to one s scope of work while cpas focus their attention on audits and taxes accountants provide services like preparing returns for individuals and small business owners the key differences between a cpa bookkeeper and an accountant are the level of detail in which financial transactions are recorded the type of analysis an accountant provides and the authority to provide a company s official financial statement bookkeepers keep track of all the money going in and out of a company accountants go beyond that to analyze what it means financially and cpas can give companies an official statement of their finances certified by the state so if you re looking for someone to help you manage your business money make sure you know what kind of professional you need 5 which one do you need so which one do you need if you just need someone to keep track of what s going in and out a bookkeeper is a right person for you but if you want someone who can give you an in depth analysis of your company s financial situation then you need an accountant and if you re looking for someone with the authority to officially say how healthy your company finances are then you need a cpa in conclusion picking las vegas cpa professionals can be a daunting task but the three main differences between the professions can help you make the best decision don t forget to analyze your businesses needs and you ll be one step closer to choosing cpa for medical professionals and other cpa professionals that will help your business story by joseph j hall

are these stocks too cheap to pass up or are they destined for more declines when a stock goes public there s often a flurry of investors rushing out to buy its shares but even if you place an order odds are you won t get it for the price you hoped you would however with many ipos struggling after the initial hype you can sometimes get their shares at lower prices later on if you re patient enough american well amwl 3 11 and robinhood markets hood 4 34 are a couple of stocks that jumped in their early trading days but have fallen hard of late they re both trading below the prices they opened at on their first day but are they worth adding to your portfolio today 1 american well american well better known as amwell is a telehealth stock that went public in september 2020 at an opening price of 25 51 even alphabet owned google invested 100 million in the promising company shares of amwell would end up rallying to more than 41 a few weeks later in october but the rally didn t last and investors who bought then likely cringe at the sight of the stock price today well below 5 per share it s not hard to find reasons to be down on the stock amwell isn t generating much growth and its losses over the trailing 12 months topped 179 million it has also burned through 121 million in cash just from its day to day activities its total visits for the period ending sept 30 2021 totaled 1 4 million and were up a modest 8 from 1 3 million that it reported in the previous quarter however with strong competition from teladoc and mdlive which cigna owns amwell s future growth prospects are questionable but all hope isn t gone for investors the company is pivoting toward being a provider of digital care delivery which means it will rely less on telehealth visits for revenue growth its new converge platform combines multiple health apps in one place for patients with amwell stating that it is designed to serve the full care spectrum across physical virtual and automated modalities health systems companies offering health plans and innovators designing products pay subscriptions for access to amwell s platform enabling them to offer telehealth solutions to their patients and members but the proof will be in the numbers last quarter amwell s revenue of 62 million was flat from the prior year period and sales from its platform subscription totaled 26 7 million rising by a modest 3 5 year over year amwell could be a promising healthcare stock to own this year but investors might want to wait until it releases its latest numbers which may not be until late march to see just how well the adoption of its platform is going 2 robinhood robinhood is a newer stock than amwell it went public in july of last year its opening price of 38 would end up doubling and hitting a high of 85 on aug 4 2021 but as with amwell the hype and excitement died down and today shares of robinhood are around 12 the fintech company offers commission free trading and the app has been popular with new investors getting them excited about stocks unsurprisingly the hype of cryptocurrencies has played a big part in that too the company said for the period ending sept 30 2021 transactions related to dogecoin doge 0 46 accounted for 40 of all of its crypto transactions and that was down from 62 a quarter earlier while robinhood s stock has suffered more significant losses than the digital currency over the past several months the two have largely moved in similar directions as this chart shows it also doesn t help that in 2021 the company reported a net loss of 3 7 billion more than double the 1 8 billion in revenue that it generated during that time the company spent just under 1 4 billion on general and administrative expenses 75 of revenue and over 1 2 billion on technology and development 68 of revenue with expenses that high there s little chance for the company to turn a profit anytime soon the positive is that robinhood says it is developing more products to help drive growth such as crypto wallets which it hopes to officially launch in the first quarter of 2022 in october 2021 management said more than a million people were on the waiting list for its crypto wallet robinhood also reported that its monthly active users as of december 2021 totaled 17 3 million rising 48 from the month a year earlier that growth has helped fuel the company s 89 year over year increase in revenue there are some promising growth opportunities with robinhood particularly if you re a fan of cryptocurrencies especially dogecoin but the risks might be too significant to take a chance on the stock with such massive overhead weighing down its financials the company is in rough shape while it is growing its operations and user base that may not be enough to keep investors happy as it may be a long time before robinhood gets out of the red if at all and with the stock initially down more than 10 in after hours trading after the release its fourth quarter results on thursday it s clear that investors share those concerns

joe rogan has waded into yet another controversy surrounding his spotify podcast resulting in music legends neil young and joni mitchell removing their music from the platform as a form of protest against rogan if this is your first time hearing about the joe rogan spotify controversy allow us to fill you in but first let s start at the beginning in 2020 spotify struck an exclusivity deal with rogan for his podcast the joe rogan experience the deal allegedly cost the platform more than 100 million according to the wall street journal the podcast its guests and host have been criticized for plugging controversial opinions about a variety of topics including spreading misinformation about the covid 19 pandemic in december 2021 270 doctors physicians and science educators wrote an open letter to spotify in it they called out several conspiracy theories aired on the joe rogan experience and urged the platform to implement some sort of misinformation policy the move came after rogan welcomed dr robert malone onto his dec 31 episode malone has been suspended from twitter for spreading covid misinformation while on the show the controversial scientist promoted the theory that people have been hypnotized into believing certain things about covid rogan s podcast has an estimated 11 million listeners per episode according to the letter the medical professionals who signed the open letter pointed out the inherent risk of allowing misinformation to be spread unchecked to so many neil young took a stand first iconic musician neil young took a stand against joe rogan and the misinformation being shared on his podcast in doing so the artist set himself up for a stand off with spotify last week the rock legend demanded that his management team and record label remove his discography from spotify in a since deleted letter according to rolling stone i want you to let spotify know immediately today that i want all my music off their platform he wrote they can have rogan or young not both most of young s music has since been removed from the platform he explained his decision and hit back against claims that he was a proponent of censorship in an open letter on his website i support free speech young wrote i have never been in favor of censorship private companies have the right to choose what they profit from just as i can choose not to have my music support a platform that disseminates harmful information i am happy and proud to stand in solidarity with the health care workers who risk their lives every day to help others young also voiced his support other streaming platforms such as amazon and apple music as well as claimed that spotify reduces the quality of sound since then other celebrities have voiced support for young joni mitchell also removed her music from spotify perhaps the most notable celebrity to support neil young is joni mitchell the living legend voiced her agreement with young in an open letter on her website i ve decided to remove all my music from spotify she wrote irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives i stand in solidarity with neil young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue the los angeles times notes that e street band musician nils lofgren and podcaster brené brown followed young s lead too others including the foo fighters were also rumored to join young but have not yet done so as of publishing time prince harry and meghan markle expressed concerns about misinformation in a statement shared with cnn a spokesperson for prince harry and meghan markle s archewell organization had something to say about the risk of covid misinformation being shared on platforms like spotify last april our co founders began expressing concerns to our partners at spotify about the all too real consequences of covid 19 misinformation on its platform they said we have continued to express our concerns to spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis it s important to note that the statement does not directly address rogan however it was released following young and mitchell s respective decisions to remove their music from spotify spotify finally weighed in after a week in the news on jan 30 spotify s ceo daniel ek published a letter on the company s for the record blog addressing the controversy ek acknowledged that the platform hosts individuals and views that he disagrees with strongly he also stressed the importance of balancing creator expression with listener safety it is important to me that we don t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them he wrote ek also confirmed that the platform would take several steps to combat disinformation for starters he shared spotify s long standing platform rules ek also revealed plans to highlight the platform rules so that creators are better aware of them as well as add content advisory alerts to any podcast episode that discusses covid the move comes after spotify reportedly suffered some pretty severe losses at the stock market datebook reports that the platform took a hit of around 4 billion to its market value in the week after young put them on blast however wall street journal notes that the app apparently has no plans to remove any of rogan s controversial podcast episodes rogan released his own statement that takes us to where we re at today jan 31 the latest person to wade into the controversy is joe rogan himself rogan took to instagram to address the situation in a nearly 10 minute long video in it he apologized and claimed he was not trying to promote misinformation or be intentionally controversial i think there s a lot of people that have a distorted perception of what i do maybe based on sound bites or based on headlines of articles that are disparaging he mused rogan also defended some of his controversial guests as being very highly credentialed very intelligent very accomplished people he also noted that they have an opinion that s different from the mainstream narrative i wanted to hear what their opinion is i had them on and because of that those episodes in particular were labeled as being dangerous they had dangerous misinformation he added variety notes that rogan takes issue with the term misinformation since opinions on topics such as the efficacy of cloth masks have changed over time the cdc currently recommends wearing a mask that has two or more layers of washable breathable fabric and fully covers the nose mouth and chin the podcast host speculated about how he could address the controversy moving forward a possible solution he floated includes bringing people with different views onto his podcast so that both sides can voice their opinions his video has since been viewed more than 4 9 million times watch rogan s lengthy video for yourself below

what the compression of the yield structure suggests is that bond investors see and are pricing in an uncharacteristically aggressive response from the fed to inflation at 7 per cent a 40 year high the fed could smother both inflation and the robust economic growth the us is experiencing its economy grew 5 7 per cent last year with both receding to or below their pre pandemic levels the us federal reserve has been criticised for being slow to act on soaring inflation credit bloomberg samuel corum there is a potential inversion of the yield curve in prospect the pre cursor to most post war us recessions but in any event bond investors are betting on the fed s actions causing a significant economic slowdown once the tighter monetary conditions it has foreshadowed have had time to bite in effect the bond market is signalling that while the fed might have badly misjudged the persistence and the extent of the surge in us inflation its original thesis that the spike in inflation as the economy bounced back from the pandemic amid continuing supply chain disruptions would be transitory wasn t that far off the mark it s just that the transition like the supply chain issues might be far more elongated than it originally thought the fed was late to recognise that inflation was raging out of control and could be and has been criticised for waiting until next month to start the process of raising rates while also continuing to buy bonds and mortgages quantitative easing even as its stance turned decisively hawkish the reserve bank announced the end of its own quantitative easing program after its board meeting today although with an inflation rate less than half that of the us and an unemployment rate still materially higher than america s 3 9 per cent it s not under the same pressure yet to start lifting the cash rate the outlook for markets and economies is clouded and the markets at least this year are likely to be more volatile with investors switching from risk on to risk off mindsets much as they did during the initial aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis the other major central banks are in a similar position to australia s although they will be mindful of the implications for their currencies capital flows and inflation rates if they fall too far out of step with the world s most influential central bank it was the fed s response to the pandemic and its impact on global financial settings that pushed a reluctant rba to embark on its unconventional for the rba monetary policies the different economic settings implied by the divergence of short and longer term rate in the us will make for a bumpy and unpredictable environment for investors over the next couple of years while the fed has said it will be nimble in responding to inflation it is unclear how aggressive it will have to be to stamp out excess inflation in an environment where supply chain disruptions persist labour market conditions in the us are at historically low levels and where wages are rising at rates not seen in decades there is risk in both directions that it isn t aggressive enough initially and has to belatedly apply more draconian and growth throttling measures or that it is too aggressive and kills growth quickly even as the pandemic and the supply chain disruptions remain threats relatively minor misjudgments could drive the us into recession either way the long end of the bond market seems to have the probable outcome a significant slowdown or something more severe priced in while the direction of the fed s actions might be clear the uncertainties within the backdrop will make for volatile conditions in sharemarkets it s not unprecedented for sharemarkets to rise even as interest rates increase but the fed is embarking on a policy u turn as dramatic as anything it has attempted since the late 1970s and early 1980s and doing so even as the massive fiscal splurges the us and other major economies embarked on in response to the pandemic are being wound back rapidly loading there was a novel set of responses to the pandemic and therefore unchartered territory as those responses are withdrawn thus the outlook for markets and economies is clouded and the markets at least this year are likely to be more volatile with investors switching from risk on to risk off mindsets much as they did during the initial aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis
the foundation of chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code and similar legislation enacted by other countries to govern cross border bankruptcy cases is comity and cooperation among u s and foreign courts the importance of these concepts was recently illustrated by a ruling handed down by the u s bankruptcy court for the southern district of florida in in re varig logistica s a 2021 wl 5045684 bankr s d fla oct 29 2021 the court dismissed an adversary proceeding commenced in the chapter 15 case of a bankrupt brazilian air carrier due to the pendency of litigation in a brazilian bankruptcy court in varig the brazilian debtor s foreign representative sued the debtor s former private equity owners in the brazilian bankruptcy court for among other things veil piercing and breach of fiduciary duty the defendants sought to enjoin the foreign representative from prosecuting those claims arguing that the debtor released them from liability after the brazilian bankruptcy court entered an order stating that it should adjudicate the release issue the florida bankruptcy court determined as a matter of comity that the brazilian bankruptcy court was the better forum for the litigation procedures recognition and relief under chapter 15 chapter 15 was enacted in 2005 to govern cross border bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings it is patterned on the 1997 uncitral model law on cross border insolvency model law which has been enacted in some form by more than 50 countries both chapter 15 and the model law are premised upon the principle of international comity or the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative executive or judicial acts of another nation having due regard both to international duty and convenience and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws hilton v guyot 159 u s 113 164 1895 section 1501 a of the bankruptcy code states that the purpose of chapter 15 is to incorporate the so as to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of cross border insolvency with the objectives of among other things cooperation between u s and foreign courts greater legal certainty for trade and investment fair and efficient administration of cross border cases to protect the interests of all stakeholders protection and maximization of the value of a debtor s assets and the rehabilitation of financially troubled businesses section 1508 requires u s courts interpreting chapter 15 to consider its international origin and the need to promote an application of this chapter that is consistent with the application of similar statutes adopted by foreign jurisdictions under section 1515 the foreign representative of a foreign debtor may file a petition in a u s bankruptcy court seeking recognition of a foreign proceeding section 101 24 defines foreign representative as a person or body including a person or body appointed on an interim basis authorized in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganization or the liquidation of the debtor s assets or affairs or to act as a representative of such foreign proceeding foreign proceeding is defined in section 101 23 of the bankruptcy code as collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign country including an interim proceeding under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation more than one bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding may be pending with respect to the same foreign debtor in different countries chapter 15 therefore contemplates recognition in the united states of both a foreign main proceeding a case pending in the country where the debtor s center of main interests comi is located see 11 u s c 1502 4 and 1517 b 1 and foreign nonmain proceedings which may be pending in countries where the debtor merely has an establishment see 11 u s c 1502 5 and 1517 b 2 a debtor s comi is presumed to be the location of the debtor s registered office or habitual residence in the case of an individual see 11 u s c 1516 c an establishment is defined by section 1502 2 as any place of operations where the debtor carries out a nontransitory economic activity upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding section 1520 a provides that certain provisions of the bankruptcy code automatically come into force including section 362 which imposes an automatic stay preventing creditor collection efforts with respect to the debtor or its u s assets if the bankruptcy court recognizes a foreign proceeding as either a main or nonmain proceeding section 1521 a authorizes the court to grant a broad range of provisional and other relief designed to preserve the foreign debtor s assets or otherwise provide assistance to the court or other entity presiding over the debtor s foreign proceeding section 1506 sets forth a public policy exception to any of the relief otherwise authorized in chapter 15 providing that othing in this chapter prevents the court from refusing to take an action governed by this chapter if the action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the united states varig são paulo brazil based varig logistica s a debtor operated an international cargo airline from 2000 to 2012 in 2006 a network of private equity companies acquired the debtor through a special purpose entity called volo logistics llc volo whose subsidiaries held 100 of the debtor s stock volo its direct subsidiaries and the private equity companies are collectively referred to as the mp entities in 2006 and 2007 the mp entities loaned approximately 250 million to the debtor through a series of intercompany loans however the debtor s financial condition worsened in february 2008 aircraft lessor pegasus aviation ii inc and certain affiliates collectively pegasus sued the debtor in florida state court for nonpayment of aircraft lease amounts in october 2008 pegasus also sued the debtor and the mp entities under a veil piercing theory in new york state court for breach of contract ny state action in december 2008 the debtor and the mp entities entered into two debt assumption agreements daas whereby certain mp entities transferred the debtor s obligation to repay more than 250 million in debt to other mp entities in exchange for the debtor providing the mp entities with a general release from all claims held by the debtor for any act omission transaction event or other occurrence taking place on or prior to december 2008 the daas included a new york state or federal court forum selection clause but provided that volo and its direct subsidiaries could bring suit to enforce the daas in a brazilian court the daas also included a new york choice of law provision in march 2009 the debtor filed for the brazilian equivalent of chapter 11 relief in brazil after the brazilian bankruptcy court entered an order for relief volo provided the debtor with 7 5 million in debtor in possession financing as part of the financing transaction the debtor released volo and the other mp entities from any claims arising from transactions with the debtor on march 31 2009 the debtor s foreign representative filed a petition in the u s bankruptcy court for the southern district of florida florida bankruptcy court seeking recognition under chapter 15 of the debtor s brazilian bankruptcy case he also commenced an adversary proceeding seeking to enjoin pegasus from commencing or continuing any u s litigation against the debtor and the mp entities however the debtor agreed to permit pegasus to proceed with the ny state action after which the florida bankruptcy court dismissed the pegasus adversary proceeding without prejudice and granted pegasus relief from the automatic stay the florida bankruptcy court entered an order recognizing the debtor s brazilian bankruptcy case as a foreign main proceeding under chapter 15 in may 2009 in september 2012 the brazilian bankruptcy court converted the debtor s reorganization proceeding into a liquidation proceeding and appointed a new foreign representative fr to liquidate the debtor s assets the parties settled the ny state action in september 2017 for 41 million in 2017 and 2018 the fr sought discovery in the chapter 15 case from the mp entities regarding their relationship and loan transaction history with the debtor in 2019 the fr also sought discovery from pegasus of relevant information provided to pegasus by the mp entities in connection with the ny state action he requested discovery of the same information from volo in 2020 in may 2020 the fr filed a breach of fiduciary duty and veil piercing action against the mp entities in the brazilian bankruptcy court alleging that the defendants looted the debtor and forced it into bankruptcy brazilian action the mp entities responded in june 2020 by commencing an adversary proceeding mp adversary proceeding in the florida bankruptcy court seeking i a determination that the claims asserted in the brazilian action were released by the debtor in the daas mp claim release ii an injunction barring the fr from continuing the brazilian action and iii in the alternative relief from the automatic stay to file an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the ny court in july 2020 volo sought an order from the florida bankruptcy court quashing the fr s discovery requests the fr then filed a motion seeking dismissal or abatement of the mp adversary proceeding the fr also asked the brazilian bankruptcy court to enjoin the mp entities from prosecuting the mp adversary proceeding arguing that the brazilian bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the impact of the releases in the daas in july 2021 the mp entities including volo filed for chapter 11 protection ny bankruptcy case in the u s bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york ny bankruptcy court at the request of both the fr and the mp entities the brazilian bankruptcy court stayed the brazilian action however although the parties acknowledged that volo s pending motion to quash was stayed by the chapter 11 filing the fr argued that the automatic stay did not prevent the florida bankruptcy court from ruling on his motion to dismiss the mp adversary proceeding the florida court agreed reasoning that its ruling albeit not determinative on issues that might impact the parties in the mp entities chapter 11 cases might provide guidance regarding the issues that would be useful to the ny bankruptcy court in september 2021 the brazilian bankruptcy court ruled that the claims asserted by the mp entities in the mp adversary proceeding violated its absolute jurisdiction and that the validity and impact of the releases should be adjudicated in brazil however the brazilian bankruptcy court denied the fr s request for injunctive relief because such relief would end up unduly intervening in another country s jurisdiction the bankruptcy court s ruling bankruptcy judge robert a mark denied volo s motion to quash the fr s subpoena as moot due to the automatic stay that arose upon the filing of the ny bankruptcy case however his ruling was without prejudice to renewal of the motion if the fr obtained relief from the stay judge mark then held that comity considerations warranted dismissal of the mp adversary proceeding and denial of the mp entities alternative request for relief from the automatic stay according to judge mark the fundamental issue presented in the proceeding was which court the brazilian bankruptcy court the florida bankruptcy court or the ny state court should determine whether the claims asserted in the brazilian action were barred by the release in the daas because the brazilian bankruptcy court found that i it had absolute and exclusive jurisdiction to hear the brazilian action ii the mp adversary proceeding violated the brazilian bankruptcy court s absolute and exclusive jurisdiction and iii the impact of the mp claim release should be determined by the brazilian bankruptcy court as a defense to the brazilian action judge mark as an exercise of comity concluded that the brazilian bankruptcy court was the appropriate forum to adjudicate the brazilian action judge mark stated that he was exercising discretion out of respect for the brazilian bankruptcy court s sovereign interpretation of the claims and defenses that are pending before it in so ruling judge mark reiterated the emphasis that section 1501 a 1 of the bankruptcy code places on the importance of cooperation between courts in cross border bankruptcy cases and the directive in section 1525 a that u s bankruptcy courts shall cooperate to the maximum extent possible with a foreign court finally judge mark ruled that the mp entities alternative request for relief from the automatic stay was moot and therefore must be denied outlook varig is an interesting case and one that is emblematic of the challenges confronted by courts presiding over cross border bankruptcy and restructuring cases it involves four different courts in the united states and brazil and bankruptcy filings in the united states not only on behalf of the foreign debtor but also by its private equity sponsors it also involves a more than decade long chapter 15 case that lay relatively dormant for many years until a then liquidated debtor s foreign representative sought discovery from entities alleged to have looted the company varig highlights that chapter 15 cases are increasingly being relied upon as an effective mechanism to facilitate a foreign debtor s discovery into the assets or affairs of the debtor in the u s parties must be aware of the entire litigation landscape and be prepared to appear in multiple jurisdictions to protect and assert their rights varig also illustrates the importance of cooperation and coordination among parties and courts involved in complex cross border restructurings chapter 15 was designed to make such efforts possible particularly when coupled with cross border protocols that are agreed upon by parties and endorsed by the courts involved the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter

u s securities and exchange commission sec chair gary gensler made remarks on jan 24 2022 at northwestern university pritzker school of law s annual securities regulation institute regarding the sec s work to improve the cybersecurity posture and resiliency of the financial sector consistent with holland knight s recent second opinions blog post highlighting the sec s more aggressive cyber posture in 2021 gensler indicated that the sec will consider updating existing cybersecurity disclosure and reporting rules and requirements in 2022 for entities regulated by the sec and expanding cybersecurity requirements on those entities falling outside the agency s direct regulatory regime as detailed below gensler teased out possible new cybersecurity disclosure and reporting rules for 1 regulated entities such as broker dealers investment companies registered investment advisers and other market intermediaries 2 public companies and 3 service providers that work with sec registrants but are not necessarily registered with the sec themselves the contemplated changes could lead to increased sec cybersecurity enforcement actions which have been rare to date in addition to unpacking gensler s remarks this second opinions post also highlights some important takeaways for each of these parties expected 2022 sec cyber actions under the biden administration there has been a shift from voluntary to mandatory cybersecurity reporting and other requirements as well as an increased focus on cybersecurity more broadly 1 for more specifics please see this recent holland knight alert in line with this trend we are likely to see increased focus on cybersecurity and data security from the sec in 2022 although gensler acknowledged that the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa and fbi remain the tip of the spear for cybersecurity policing he emphasized the key role that the sec has to play as part of team cyber specifically gensler highlighted that hackers often target the financial services industry to steal data intellectual property or money lower confidence in our financial system disrupt economies or just demonstrate their capabilities during his remarks gensler focused on cyber hygiene incident reporting and disclosure to the public for different sec registrants public companies and service providers 2 first gensler foreshadowed changes coming for different types of regulated entities gensler stated that he would like to freshen up regulation systems compliance and integrity reg sci a rule that covers a subset of sec regulated entities such as stock exchanges and self regulatory organizations 3 in addition he stated that the commission may seek to apply reg sci to some of the largest market makers and broker dealers and discussed consideration of a 2020 rule proposal that would apply reg sci to large u s department of the treasury trading platforms for investment companies investment advisers and broker dealers gensler stated that he has asked sec staff to make recommendations to strengthen cybersecurity cyber hygiene and incident reporting separate and apart from reg sci and with consideration of cisa guidance for financial sector registrants generally gensler stated that he has asked staff for recommendations on how to modernize regulation s p known as the safeguards rule which requires registrants to protect customer records and information with the aim of providing customers and clients notifications when their data has been accessed importantly gensler hinted at the possibility of changes on the timing and substance of notifications currently required by the safeguards rule second for public companies gensler s remarks focused on disclosure and cybersecurity practices he stated that he has asked staff for recommendations regarding companies cybersecurity practices and cyber risk disclosures as well as whether and how to update companies disclosures to investors when cyber events occur gensler made clear however that companies are already subject to certain cyber related disclosure requirements under existing federal securities laws citing the recent sec enforcement actions in this area third for service providers gensler s comments were more broad focusing on seeking recommendations on how to address cybersecurity risks that come from service providers including requiring registrants to identify service providers that could pose risks or holding registrants accountable for service providers cybersecurity measures gensler added that new cybersecurity rules could extend to such entities as fund administrators custodians and other parties not registered with the agency 4 how to prepare without specific rule proposals to evaluate it is unclear exactly how the sec plans to extend disclosure and reporting obligations on these various entities however entities can anticipate that the sec will be more aggressive on cybersecurity issues going forward in preparation entities can take steps now to ensure that their cyber risks policies and procedures are appropriately designed and tailored to avoid some of the landmines that have subjected others to sec enforcement actions below are some quick abcs for all sec registrants to consider and evaluate assess cybersecurity risks entities should identify and document their criteria for evaluating risks and the risk assessment should include input and analysis from information technology security compliance and legal teams entities should identify and document their criteria for evaluating risks and the risk assessment should include input and analysis from information technology security compliance and legal teams build policies and procedures specifically tailored to address identified risks and train employees accordingly upon identifying risks entities should evaluate how to mitigate those risks through administrative physical or technical safeguards to mitigate these risks employees should be appropriately trained on these safeguards the sec s 21 a report of investigation on business email compromises highlights that implementation of policies without proper employee training can result in significant financial consequences for companies upon identifying risks entities should evaluate how to mitigate those risks through administrative physical or technical safeguards to mitigate these risks employees should be appropriately trained on these safeguards the sec s 21 a report of investigation on business email compromises highlights that implementation of policies without proper employee training can result in significant financial consequences for companies correct and periodically test vulnerabilities identified through monitoring continual monitoring and testing of company

decision makers establish an incident response plan irp and test the irp through tabletop exercises as far back as 2015 the sec s division of examinations found that a majority of broker dealers 88 percent and investment advisers 74 percent reported that they experienced cyberattacks directly or through their vendors nearly seven years later ransomware attacks are happening multiple times every minute with cybersecurity incidents costing companies trillions of dollars annually 5 as important as it is for companies to be proactive it is critical that entities consider how to respond when not if a cyber incident occurs to ensure among other things business continuity damage mitigation and proper compliance with various regulatory notification requirements as the sec advances some of the

to focus on protection of sec data and to evaluate its data collection process to ensure it collects only data needed to fulfill its mission 3 reg sci aims in part to ensure that these entities have sound technology programs and data backups to improve the resiliency of technological systems 4 notably gensler also foreshadowed the possibility that congress could consider providing the sec

what the compression of the yield structure suggests is that bond investors see and are pricing in an uncharacteristically aggressive response from the fed to inflation at 7 per cent a 40 year high the fed could smother both inflation and the robust economic growth the us is experiencing its economy grew 5 7 per cent last year with both receding to or below their pre pandemic levels the us federal reserve has been criticised for being slow to act on soaring inflation credit bloomberg samuel corum there is a potential inversion of the yield curve in prospect the pre cursor to most post war us recessions but in any event bond investors are betting on the fed s actions causing a significant economic slowdown once the tighter monetary conditions it has foreshadowed have had time to bite in effect the bond market is signalling that while the fed might have badly misjudged the persistence and the extent of the surge in us inflation its original thesis that the spike in inflation as the economy bounced back from the pandemic amid continuing supply chain disruptions would be transitory wasn t that far off the mark it s just that the transition like the supply chain issues might be far more elongated than it originally thought the fed was late to recognise that inflation was raging out of control and could be and has been criticised for waiting until next month to start the process of raising rates while also continuing to buy bonds and mortgages quantitative easing even as its stance turned decisively hawkish the reserve bank announced the end of its own quantitative easing program after its board meeting today although with an inflation rate less than half that of the us and an unemployment rate still materially higher than america s 3 9 per cent it s not under the same pressure yet to start lifting the cash rate the outlook for markets and economies is clouded and the markets at least this year are likely to be more volatile with investors switching from risk on to risk off mindsets much as they did during the initial aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis the other major central banks are in a similar position to australia s although they will be mindful of the implications for their currencies capital flows and inflation rates if they fall too far out of step with the world s most influential central bank it was the fed s response to the pandemic and its impact on global financial settings that pushed a reluctant rba to embark on its unconventional for the rba monetary policies the different economic settings implied by the divergence of short and longer term rate in the us will make for a bumpy and unpredictable environment for investors over the next couple of years while the fed has said it will be nimble in responding to inflation it is unclear how aggressive it will have to be to stamp out excess inflation in an environment where supply chain disruptions persist labour market conditions in the us are at historically low levels and where wages are rising at rates not seen in decades there is risk in both directions that it isn t aggressive enough initially and has to belatedly apply more draconian and growth throttling measures or that it is too aggressive and kills growth quickly even as the pandemic and the supply chain disruptions remain threats relatively minor misjudgments could drive the us into recession either way the long end of the bond market seems to have the probable outcome a significant slowdown or something more severe priced in while the direction of the fed s actions might be clear the uncertainties within the backdrop will make for volatile conditions in sharemarkets it s not unprecedented for sharemarkets to rise even as interest rates increase but the fed is embarking on a policy u turn as dramatic as anything it has attempted since the late 1970s and early 1980s and doing so even as the massive fiscal splurges the us and other major economies embarked on in response to the pandemic are being wound back rapidly loading there was a novel set of responses to the pandemic and therefore unchartered territory as those responses are withdrawn thus the outlook for markets and economies is clouded and the markets at least this year are likely to be more volatile with investors switching from risk on to risk off mindsets much as they did during the initial aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis

san diego jan 31 2022 globe newswire ensysce biosciences inc ensysce or the company nasdaq ensc otc enscw a clinical stage biotech company with two novel technology platforms designed to provide relief for those suffering with severe pain while protecting against abuse and overdose announced today the company has engaged international investor relations specialists mz group mz to lead a comprehensive strategic investor relations and financial communications program across all key markets mz group will work closely with ensysce management to develop and implement a comprehensive capital markets strategy designed to increase the company s visibility throughout the investment community the campaign will highlight how ensysce is seeking to improve the safety of prescription drugs by applying its two breakthrough proprietary drug technology platforms taap and mpar that are designed to prevent opioid abuse and overdose ensysce s lead taap opioid pf614 which has been developed as abuse resistance and phase 1 data demonstrated as safe without compromising on efficacy is expected to be the company s first product commercialized and generating revenue for ongoing programs ensysce has secured fda fast track designation and is using the 505 b 2 regulatory pathway which could substantially reduce the trial regulatory risk and potential time and cost to market mz has developed a distinguished reputation as a premier resource for institutional investors brokers analysts and private investors the firm maintains offices worldwide and was recently ranked no 7 in the world in business communication shannon devine managing director at mz north america will advise ensysce in all facets of corporate and financial communications including the coordination of roadshows and investment conferences across key cities and building brand awareness with financial and social media outlets ted haberfield chairman president of mz group north america commented ensysce s revolutionary abuse resistant opioids are designed to combat prescription drug abuse an epidemic and one of the fastest growing drug problems in the u s the global opioids market is anticipated to grow to 29 8 billion in 2023 with more than one third of the u s population and 20 30 of the world population reporting chronic pain this is driven in part by an aging population as the prevalence of chronic pain increases with a higher incidence of age related diseases including cancer cardiovascular disorders obesity and diabetes at the same time the expanding use of opioids has caused a rise in their abuse stemming from the desire to increase the onset of euphoria its intensity and its duration over the last year more than 200 people died in the u s daily after overdosing on opioids ensysce s new class of pain products create untapped value which presents an exciting opportunity and we look forward to sharing this with our network of institutional family offices and retail investors shannon devine added the taap and mpar platforms created by ensysce combine anti abuse and anti overdose technology to create new classes of prescription drugs that are expected to be powerful and safe for everyone taap opioids are designed with a 2 step verification mechanism that cannot be cracked like abuse deterrent formulations thus delivering a highly effective solution to combat drug abuse taap is only activated by trypsin a digestive enzyme that exists only in the gut therefore crushing inhaling or injecting it will not cause the opioid to be released faster to produce pleasure or euphoria it also chemically modifies the opioid thereby eliminating the potential abuse by the patient through physical means mpar is a smart anti overdose platform that is designed to protect patients from overdosing when it is combined with taap opioids mpar inhibits trypsin when too much taap opioid is swallowed inhibiting full activation and opioid release and therefore preventing overdose related deaths mpar is only triggered by an overdose blocking the additional doses consumed taken together these drug platforms help meet the unmet need of safer opioid options for individuals suffering from severe pain our pipeline of pain addiction and adhd candidates developed using taap and mpar continue to progress said dr lynn kirkpatrick ceo of ensysce biosciences most recently we announced a critical step in our path towards fda approval the first dosing in the bioequivalence be trial of the novel trypsin activated abuse protected taap opioid pf614 additionally in the fourth quarter of 2021 we successfully completed a financing of 15 million that provided us with the necessary proceeds to continue advancement of our lead clinical trial programs we re continuing to develop the next generation of innovative solutions to combat the potential for opioid abuse and we look forward to working with shannon and the entire team at mz group to communicate the value of our technology for building long term value for our shareholders concluded kirkpatrick for more information on ensysce please visit the company s website at www ensysce com to

joe rogan has waded into yet another controversy surrounding his spotify podcast resulting in music legends neil young and joni mitchell removing their music from the platform as a form of protest against rogan if this is your first time hearing about the joe rogan spotify controversy allow us to fill you in but first let s start at the beginning in 2020 spotify struck an exclusivity deal with rogan for his podcast the joe rogan experience the deal allegedly cost the platform more than 100 million according to the wall street journal the podcast its guests and host have been criticized for plugging controversial opinions about a variety of topics including spreading misinformation about the covid 19 pandemic in december 2021 270 doctors physicians and science educators wrote an open letter to spotify in it they called out several conspiracy theories aired on the joe rogan experience and urged the platform to implement some sort of misinformation policy the move came after rogan welcomed dr robert malone onto his dec 31 episode malone has been suspended from twitter for spreading covid misinformation while on the show the controversial scientist promoted the theory that people have been hypnotized into believing certain things about covid rogan s podcast has an estimated 11 million listeners per episode according to the letter the medical professionals who signed the open letter pointed out the inherent risk of allowing misinformation to be spread unchecked to so many neil young took a stand first iconic musician neil young took a stand against joe rogan and the misinformation being shared on his podcast in doing so the artist set himself up for a stand off with spotify last week the rock legend demanded that his management team and record label remove his discography from spotify in a since deleted letter according to rolling stone i want you to let spotify know immediately today that i want all my music off their platform he wrote they can have rogan or young not both most of young s music has since been removed from the platform he explained his decision and hit back against claims that he was a proponent of censorship in an open letter on his website i support free speech young wrote i have never been in favor of censorship private companies have the right to choose what they profit from just as i can choose not to have my music support a platform that disseminates harmful information i am happy and proud to stand in solidarity with the health care workers who risk their lives every day to help others young also voiced his support other streaming platforms such as amazon and apple music as well as claimed that spotify reduces the quality of sound since then other celebrities have voiced support for young joni mitchell also removed her music from spotify perhaps the most notable celebrity to support neil young is joni mitchell the living legend voiced her agreement with young in an open letter on her website i ve decided to remove all my music from spotify she wrote irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives i stand in solidarity with neil young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue the los angeles times notes that e street band musician nils lofgren and podcaster brené brown followed young s lead too others including the foo fighters were also rumored to join young but have not yet done so as of publishing time prince harry and meghan markle expressed concerns about misinformation in a statement shared with cnn a spokesperson for prince harry and meghan markle s archewell organization had something to say about the risk of covid misinformation being shared on platforms like spotify last april our co founders began expressing concerns to our partners at spotify about the all too real consequences of covid 19 misinformation on its platform they said we have continued to express our concerns to spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis it s important to note that the statement does not directly address rogan however it was released following young and mitchell s respective decisions to remove their music from spotify spotify finally weighed in after a week in the news on jan 30 spotify s ceo daniel ek published a letter on the company s for the record blog addressing the controversy ek acknowledged that the platform hosts individuals and views that he disagrees with strongly he also stressed the importance of balancing creator expression with listener safety it is important to me that we don t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them he wrote ek also confirmed that the platform would take several steps to combat disinformation for starters he shared spotify s long standing platform rules ek also revealed plans to highlight the platform rules so that creators are better aware of them as well as add content advisory alerts to any podcast episode that discusses covid the move comes after spotify reportedly suffered some pretty severe losses at the stock market datebook reports that the platform took a hit of around 4 billion to its market value in the week after young put them on blast however wall street journal notes that the app apparently has no plans to remove any of rogan s controversial podcast episodes rogan released his own statement that takes us to where we re at today jan 31 the latest person to wade into the controversy is joe rogan himself rogan took to instagram to address the situation in a nearly 10 minute long video in it he apologized and claimed he was not trying to promote misinformation or be intentionally controversial i think there s a lot of people that have a distorted perception of what i do maybe based on sound bites or based on headlines of articles that are disparaging he mused rogan also defended some of his controversial guests as being very highly credentialed very intelligent very accomplished people he also noted that they have an opinion that s different from the mainstream narrative i wanted to hear what their opinion is i had them on and because of that those episodes in particular were labeled as being dangerous they had dangerous misinformation he added variety notes that rogan takes issue with the term misinformation since opinions on topics such as the efficacy of cloth masks have changed over time the cdc currently recommends wearing a mask that has two or more layers of washable breathable fabric and fully covers the nose mouth and chin the podcast host speculated about how he could address the controversy moving forward a possible solution he floated includes bringing people with different views onto his podcast so that both sides can voice their opinions his video has since been viewed more than 4 9 million times watch rogan s lengthy video for yourself below

aaron keck s live local top 100 countdown continues and concludes with the best of the best you can check out the complete series here only on chapelboro com and finally we come to the end our local music scene has produced thousands of phenomenal songs over the years and dozens of them could stake a claim to being number one but these are our picks for the all time top ten always subject to change though chapel hill s music reputation was probably stronger in the 90s but if you ve been following this series over the last nine weeks you might have noticed a pretty heavy emphasis on songs from the last decade and our top ten isn t going to be much different i d argue that today s local music scene is as buzzing and dynamic and productive as it s ever been with more great artists and a wider range of genres than we ve ever had before so don t be surprised when new songs emerge to challenge the ten we re honoring here it s the hallmark of any great music scene the future is always brighter than the past reminder of the ground rules orange durham and chatham based artists only no more than three songs per artist there were two bands who hit that limit in case you re wondering covers are allowed but originals are preferred and the songs have to be radio friendly here we go 10 shirlette the dynamite brothers f justin robinson daniel hart adrian duke kissin and cussin 2011 tell me pretty baby do you think you re too sweet to die in the last waltz levon helm described rock as an amalgamation of great disparate genres country bluegrass blues music show music all coming together from far away and blending into a new perfect form if it mixes there with rhythm he said and if it dances then you ve got rock and roll by that standard kissin and cussin might be the most perfect rock and roll song ever made we need a history with this one it first appeared on the carolina chocolate drops grammy winning 2010 album genuine negro jig written by the ccds justin robinson it s technically an original but robinson drew on decades of american music some of the most memorable lyrics like too sweet to die came from the early 20th century bluesman richard rabbit brown while the chorus and the title were inspired by an ike tina turner hit called cussin cryin and carryin on so robinson s original song was in fact nearly a century in the making building on traditions ranging from blues to bluegrass to r b and all that was before spoken word poet hip hop artist shirlette ammons and chapel hill rockers the dynamite brothers decided to cover it with robinson on their breathtaking 2011 collaboration and lovers like by the time they all went into the studio there was hardly a single significant tradition of american music that wasn t represented in some way and what they produced from that melting pot is an apocalyptic masterpiece an epic seven minute roller coaster of a song about a toxic relationship full of lust and sex and blood and drugs and money and possibly murder that opens with an ominous inscrutable riff before ammons plunges in your kiss is fist violent is her very first line and then just builds and builds and builds from there the drums kick in at 90 seconds laying down an insistent beat reminiscent of when the levee breaks while ammons and robinson do their vocal battle i don t know who brought the orchestra in but there it is at the four minute mark rising to a crescendo that sounds like charlie daniels devil covering the end of a day in the life and there are still three minutes left to go kissin and cussin is the most ambitious blow your mind song the local music scene has produced it s one of the few songs i ve ever heard that s clearly trying to surpass everything that came before it did it succeed that s up for debate but at the very least it comes damn near close 9 ben folds five mess 1999 and i don t believe in god so i can t be saved now i put brick at number 91 and that s obviously the bigger hit so if you re a purist feel free to swap these two around but i ll go to my grave insisting mess is the far better song and beyond that it also does a far better job capturing ben folds five s vibe of jaunty peppy piano driven melodies ironically supporting the bitter lyrics of a hopeful protagonist who s battling depression full of regrets but hellbent on overcoming and powering through see also army off the same album 1999 s the unauthorized biography of reinhold messner but again mess is better fight me mess opens with one of folds catchiest piano riffs and we ll get a nice bouncy tambourine in the chorus but we know what s coming oh this mess i have made he sings repeatedly castigating himself for his many mistakes the same mistakes over and over again the things i said i d never do least of all to you that drove his lover away into someone else s arms he s found someone else and he s trying to be a better man i want to be for her what i could never be for you but he also knows the only way to do that is to close off a part of himself maybe forever to be all alone even in someone else s arms there are rooms in this house that i don t open anymore very gothic aarik danielsen writes that mess is the definitive expression of the album s thesis statement the idea that to truly live is to know thyself and own every ounce of your cowardice failure and disappointment well said like all of folds best work mess is complex and tragic and heartbreaking and optimistic and fun all at once like life if you re lucky 8 phatlynx gravy 2016 gravy well it wouldn t be our top 100 without this one right if you listen to live local regularly you know gravy is our signature song jonathan byrd s mama at number 13 is the one that got me interested in local music in the first place but gravy is far and away our favorite hopefully it s one of yours too fast and gleeful clocking in under two minutes it s definitely one of the funnest songs the local scene has ever produced and one of the funniest too without a whole lot of effort but a novelty song in our top ten a thousand times yes without hesitation there s not much to gravy on the surface it s literally just two minutes of instrumental rockabilly surf music occasionally punctuated by the band shouting gravy at regular intervals but if you wanted to encapsulate the history of chapel hill s music scene in as small a frame as possible this is that capsule right here phatlynx draws its inspiration from link wray the same north carolina surf music icon who also begat the flat duo jets their fun irreverent stage presence is akin to the squirrel nut zippers and of course you can t hear their down home pork loving state fair style of psychobilly punk without thinking of southern culture on the skids a band phatlynx s crispy bess played in for years gravy ties all those threads together into one fast catchy tasty package and it s a pretty well crafted song besides phatlynx s appeal is undeniable the four guys in the band originally got together with the idea of doing a single show at the cave playing link wray s rumble with as many people as they could gather together and they were so popular that they ve stayed together ever since and no wonder because how can you say no to gravy there is no way to listen to this song and not feel better by the time it s done these days we need as much of that as we can get 7 the future kings of nowhere let s be pirates 2012 that s the life that they re selling but baby we don t have to buy it so here s the story behind let s be pirates fkon had this song in their repertoire in the late 2000s but they broke up without ever recording it shayne miel moved to new york mike hacker opened pie pushers everyone got on with their lives and that was going to be the end and then in 2009 miel got diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma a cancer that threatened his life he moved back to durham to be close to the people he loved and decided to head back into the studio one more time reunited with his old bandmates to record the few songs he still had banging around in his head i thought i would die he said and i didn t want the songs to die with me and that s why we still have let s be pirates an utterly joyous defiant celebration of love and life in the face of a reactionary money driven society that values the stock market over the soul sick of bills and debts and undead end day jobs what a great line miel s working class hero paints a vivid dream of rebellious freedom i dream all day of an easier life with the wind in my hair and the sun in my eyes singing and dancing a bottle of rum in the young moonlight it s an impulse we ve all felt somewhere along the way to just get in the car and take off and leave it all behind and miel captures it perfectly i ll be blackbeard you be bonnie and we ll both be pirates and bonus points for the now thankfully anachronistic line about homophobia let s get married or just not bother if our friends can t then we shouldn t either because now this gets complicated is the song s anarchic screw it all and leave it behind message undercut by the fact that people stayed and fought and won and were actually able to make the world a better place is it irresponsible to hop on a ship and just sail away not in the i ve got work tomorrow sense but in the we can fight back if we stay sense are you a hero if you walk away from omelas or are you just capitulating or is sailing away still a meaningful act of rebellion in itself is it enough just to say no to the powers that be even if you don t say anything else you can write a dissertation just on that one line alone for what it s worth when i m singing this song to myself which is frequent i just switch up the line in the last chorus let s get married it s no trouble grab our friends and we ll make it a double victory oh and just one more thing shayne miel beat cancer he s still here double victory 6 reese mchenry detroit 2019 i m gonna bring him back home and hey speaking of great artists who nearly died and then made staggeringly triumphant comebacks reese mchenry shook off multiple strokes and roared back to release 2019 s no dados arguably the best local album of the decade the whole album is full of gritty garage rock awesomeness magnolia tree bye bye baby fever summer sheets but nothing nothing holds a candle to detroit mchenry s towering ode to an almost certainly toxic relationship we ve had a lot of those this week that starts at 11 and only escalates from there this is the hardest chapel hill has ever rocked the best pure rock and roll song our local scene has ever produced superchunk pipe archers of loaf reese mchenry blows em all away in three minutes and just in case you weren t sure she saves the absolute best for last one final explosive howl of pure wild obsessed desperate passion that ll knock your brain right out of your head don t just take my word for it here s what other writers have had to say reese mchenry is a force of nature singing with depth and passion holding nothing back and reveling in the joyful catharsis oh man mchenry s voice is just this force a modern day piece of art mchenry sings i m going to detroit to bring you back home and she s isn t dreaming it she s shouting as a command to herself it s all deserved every review you ll ever read of no dados compares reese mchenry to janis joplin but no that s not correct once you hear detroit you ll be comparing janis joplin to reese mchenry crank up the volume and stand the f back 5 squirrel nut zippers ghost of stephen foster 1997 camptown ladies never sang all the doo dah day same disclaimer as with ben folds five hell was the bigger zippers hit so if you re a purist feel free to put that one here and drop stephen foster to number 21 they make a good pair either way and including both also lets us recognize both of the zippers main songwriters tom maxwell on hell jimbo mathus on foster but stephen foster is the winner for me manic and hilarious and nightmarish from its trippy string prologue to its bouncing oompah beat to its gleefully deranged lyrics to the delightfully ominous violin solo and horn riff that wraps it all up in the end ghost of stephen foster is the apex of the zippers amazing late 90s run the lyrics make no sense at all ships were made for sinking whiskey made for drinking if we were made of cellophane we d all get stinking drunk much faster ha ha ha but it s all so memorable and the music is so catchy and fun that it ll have a place inside your head forever nonetheless and in this case that s a good thing bonus points here for the video directed by matthew nastuk and raymond s persi a flawless homage to the fleischer studios 1930s black and white betty boop and bimbo cartoons outside of maybe sabotage i can t think of a music video that complements its song as perfectly as this one does at any rate it s easily the best music video the chapel hill scene has ever produced fittingly because ghost of stephen foster is also one of its very best songs 4 mandolin orange of which there is no like 2015 hold me tight tonight my darling out of the dark dark night emily frantz and andrew marlin or their pr reps at least describe themselves like this mandolin orange s music radiates a mysterious warmth their songs feel like whispered secrets one hand cupped to your ear if that s the sound they re aiming for they ve never hit the bullseye more perfectly than they do right here in this closing track from their 2015 album such jubilee the album s title is a phrase from this song frantz and marlin s voices have never blended more beautifully their instruments have never sounded more sweet and yet the most overwhelming sound here is the silence you hear around them as if the entire world has disappeared and they re the only two beings left which is appropriate because that s what of which there is no like is all about marlin s character a wandering nomad who s always been lured out to sea by the excitement and adventure of the cacophonous world finally drawn back home out of the dark dark night into the arms of real love which he s never believed in before but undeniably believes in now there are many mandolin orange songs that could go in this spot there s a reason i instituted a three songs per artist limit and there s a reason i called it the mandolin orange rule if you re not a fan of this one feel free to swap in old ties and companions or golden embers or the wolves or any of a dozen others when it comes to radiating a mysterious warmth they almost always succeed i had the good fortune to host them in the wchl studio for carrboro s freight train blues series earlier this year and it was wonderful of which there is no like will forever be my favorite though it s that rare love song that truly understands what love can be the wolves does make a nice companion piece though come to think of it if no like is about a wanderer who s finally drawn home for keeps the wolves is about a wanderer who s still being pulled away not sure which character is closer to the real andrew marlin both equally most likely 3 tift merritt bramble rose 2002 just a real good woman nobody knows grammy nominee tift merritt is a profoundly gifted songwriter and her albums have always been best when the band steps back and lets her shine bramble rose her 2002 debut is still my favorite for exactly that reason and thank goodness because the title track is also one of the most beautiful transcendent songs i ve ever heard merritt wrote the song after seeing a wild rose and feeling an inexplicable affinity i was probably twenty five or twenty six years old and i was really trying to become the person i wanted to be she told indyweek this wild rose wasn t really polished it wasn t perfect it was on some level self sufficient and determined there was some grace in that we ve had our share of gut wrenching songs in this list but bramble rose will wreck you a thousand times merritt s protagonist is a woman who s been hardened by life steely and determined and rugged but suspicious and secretive sharp and hard and dark as a storm as much in need of love and companionship as anyone but damned always to remain distant and apart a real good woman nobody knows though who knows what the future may hold after all andrew marlin s protagonist in of which there is no like was the same way once don henley covered bramble rose a few years ago with mick jagger and miranda lambert in tow but the three of them together great as they all are can t match merritt s original part of that is due to merritt s gorgeous voice better than henley s and that s saying something but the secret star of the record may be producer ethan johns who not only knew enough to hold the band in check and give merritt the spotlight but also personally contributed that simple heartbreaking mandolin riff that took an already magnificent song and launched it into the stratosphere you ll notice henley s cover kept the mandolin we don t usually get calls into the studio we re not that kind of show but the first time i played bramble rose on the air the phone rang seconds later what was that beautiful song somebody wanted to know i m still trying to answer that one myself 2 superchunk everything at once 2010 oh the minutes and the months the feedback and the drums the feeling noise becomes some of the songs on this list hit me right away kissin and cussin for instance the first time i listened to it it took me a full half hour because i just had to hear it three more times in a row everything at once is not one of those songs it s the closing track off 2010 s majesty shredding a spectacular late period superchunk album that also contains rosemarie crossed wires and the opening track digging for something almost the album s highlight featuring the mountain goats john darnielle on backup vocals because why not it s not easy for a single song to stand out on an album like that and everything at once doesn t at first but listen again and again and the layers will slowly reveal themselves the music builds imperceptibly to a powerful climax seemingly disjointed images of ticking clocks and music and hazy childhood memories suddenly fit together like puzzle pieces and eventually you start to believe the premise this really is a song about nothing and everything at once each contained within and defined by the other technically the beatles put out one more album after abbey road but i think we ve all collectively agreed that the end is their last song chronology be damned it s the best most apt conclusion to their story the perfect summary of their purpose and their message likewise i know superchunk has put out two more albums after majesty shredding three if you count acoustic foolish but again chronology be damned everything at once is their last song their final summation a bittersweet buddhist melancholy sad joyful tribute to the passage of time and the meaning and meaninglessness of life delivered by the most influential band onstage and off in chapel hill s music history it s also a pretty banging rocker besides superchunk wouldn t have it any other way and finally 1 the connells stone cold yesterday 1990 don t it make you wonder man was this your pick too we ve covered 99 tracks on this list including two already by the connells and there are plenty more deserving songs and phenomenal artists that we weren t able to include we re blessed to have one of the most vibrant music communities in the nation it s been that way for decades and nothing has changed and there have been dozens of great songs over the years that can make a strong case for number one but we never had any doubt about this one stone cold yesterday is iconic catchy fun nostalgic melancholy and uplifting all at once it s the culmination of the jangle pop tradition that defined the local scene s early years from arrogance to let s active to the db s and it placed the connells on the vanguard of the exploding chapel hill scene of the early 90s that grabbed national attention and produced some of the decade s most beloved monster hits and besides it s just a great great song no more words needed just listen and enjoy and then maybe listen again and again nobody s judging what do you think about our top 100 what did we miss what did we overrate or underrate listen to all the songs for yourself and comment chapelboro com does not charge subscription fees you can support local journalism and our mission to serve the community

breitbart news senior contributor and government accountability institute gai president peter schweizer s latest investigative exposé red handed how american elites get rich helping china win reveals how 23 former u s senators and congressman have lobbied for chinese military or intelligence linked companies after leaving office many lawmakers cash in after leaving office by becoming lobbyists for corporations and other special interests but one would hope that they would not become advocates for america s primary economic and political adversary communist china by lobbying for outcomes that run counter to the united states long term interests however schweizer s book reveals that many former congressional leaders committee chairman and rank and file members are lobbying for chinese intelligence and military linked companies the following 23 former members of congress the majority of whom are republicans have lobbied for chinese military or intelligence linked companies speaker of the house john boehner r oh boehner s advocacy for china began right as he became speaker of the house and republicans gained a historic majority in 2011 congress was in the midst of passing a currency manipulation bill the currency exchange oversight reform act to hold china accountable for keeping its currency artificially low thus making it easier to boost its exports china subsequently hired squire patton boggs spb one of d c s most influential law firms for 35 000 per month to block the bill spb registered as a foreign agent of the chinese embassy in washington dc after decades of close ties to the chinese government the chinese currency manipulation bill sailed through the senate with a 63 35 vote featuring strong bipartisan support however boehner would not allow the bill to come to the house floor for a vote even though half of the house republican conference and an overwhelming number of democrats supported the bill it s a pretty dangerous thing to be moving legislation through the u s congress forcing someone to deal with the value of a currency boehner said he even argued that the bill would lead to a trade war schweizer said it should be no surprise that when boehner retired from public office in 2015 he joined spb as a strategic adviser to american and foreign clients spb advised and helped beijing navigate issues that will threaten their interests according to schweizer this includes guidances on the defense appropriations process the 2020 general elections and american policy on hong kong taiwan xinjiang human rights immigration trade and sanctions legislation boehner s firm has also advised for chinese government linked corporations such as chemchina china railway stock corporation huawei and wanhua chemical group chinese state owned media often quotes spb attorneys who are often critical of trade and technology restrictions on chinese firms working in the united states spb also has strong ties to the highest echelons of the chinese government nick chan a senior partner for spb in china is also a member of the ruling national people s congress npc the npc is the highest organ of state power in people s republic of china spb explained recently sen tim hutchinson r ar rep rodney frelinghuysen r nj and rep albert wynn d md sen tim hutchinson r ar a former member of the senate armed services committee lobbies for alibaba

security threat rep jack kingston r ga kingston served in the house from 1993 to 2015 and even served as the vice chairman of the house republican conference from 2002 to 2006 in congress he served as a leading member of the house appropriations committee chairman of the agriculture labor health and human services education and legislative branch subcommittees the georgia republican also was a long time member of the defense appropriations subcommittee despite his accolades as a guardian of small business kingston has lobbied for chemchina the chinese state owned chemical company sen david vitter r la rep toby moffett d ct and rep rick boucher d va vitter and moffett received 70 000 per month from hikvision a chinese surveillance company largely owned by a government controlled conglomerate known as the china electronics group the chinese government uses hikvision s surveillance cameras to monitor uyghurs in the chinese communist party s prison camps vitter voted against the currency exchange oversight reform act boucher s firm received 1 75 million in 2019 for lobbying on behalf of hikvision sen barbara boxer d ca boxer who represented california as a democrat from 1993 to 2017 and was a ranking member of the senate committee on foreign relations later signed on to advise hikvision and registered as a foreign agent with the department of justice she claimed that she merely wanted to help create american jobs by providing advice to the chinese surveillance company when i am asked to provide strategic advice to help a company operate in a more responsible and humane manner consistent with u s law in spirit and letter it is an opportunity to make things better while helping protect and create american jobs she said in relation to her lobbying for hikvision boxer later stopped lobbying for the company after facing public outcry perhaps ironically boxer voted in favor of the 2011 currency exchange oversight reform act that boehner blocked rep charles boustany r la boustany who served 12 years in congress and was a member of the powerful house ways and means committee became the co chair of the u s china working group a bipartisan caucus for members of congress interested in issues related to china when leaving office in 2016 boustany tried to become a trade representative for the donald trump administration when he failed to get that job he joined capitol counsel a washington dc lobbying firm capitol counsel registered with the department of justice as a foreign agent to represent the china united states exchange foundation cusef as part of this contract with cusef capitol counsel provided political intelligence gathering and substantive advice on china related legislation including arranging meetings on capitol hill boustany at the same time became a spokesman for an organization called tariffs hurt the heartland which argued that the trump administration s proposed tariffs against china s abusive trade practices would actually hurt working class americans capitol counsel was also hired to lobby for an entity called the u s china transpacific foundation uctpf as schweizer notes the uctpf according to its filings with the justice department is funded by the chinese government the organization s ostensible purpose is to sponsor trips for politicians and their staff to visit mainland china sen william cohen r me after cohen served in the senate he became the secretary of defense during the bill clinton administration he established the cohen group in 2001 after leaving the department of defense dod the cohen group has touted its deep ties to the chinese government including cohen s first visit to china as a congressman in 1978 when he met chinese communist leader deng xiaoping has been a constant presence in the u s china relationship including commercial development and security cooperation according to the cohen group s website the cohen group also extends its consulting for chinese state owned enterprises which schweizer says are often used as tools of the chinese state the former defense secretary also served as the vice chairman of the u s china business council a lobbying group for american companies to do business in china when the federal government deemed huawei a security threat because of its close ties to the chinese intelligence apparatus the company hired the cohen group to negotiate with the u s director of national intelligence to find a way to sell its hardware in the united states conclusion in red handed how american elites get rich helping china win schweizer calls for a ban on lobbying on behalf of chinese military and intelligence linked companies he writes that although not all lobbying is bad that right does not extend to lobbying linked to the chinese military intelligence apparatus too many former politicians are making bundles of money representing these interests in the corridors of washington power schweizer charged sean moran is a

the third quarter during the quarter centric sold a 16 6 million pool of ppp loans which contributed 1 2 million of the total ppp income compared to fourth quarter 2020 net interest income increased 1 7 million and is due to higher ppp income along with increased interest on cre lending of 740 thousand this resulted in an increase to the net interest margin of 83 basis points the major influences were organic loan growth of 66 million and a reduction in the cost of funds noninterest income totaled 802 thousand for the fourth quarter decreasing 9 from the third quarter 2021 and 32 from the fourth quarter 2020 the quarter was impacted by a loss of the sale of ppp loans of 104 thousand and a loss on the sale of equity securities of 93 thousand which were offset somewhat by increased gains on sale of sba loans by 120 thousand compared to fourth quarter 2020 noninterest income declined 379 thousand which is largely the result of gains and losses on investments with fourth quarter 2020 producing a gain of 295 thousand noninterest expense of 6 4 million for the fourth quarter 2021 increased from the third quarter by 294 thousand this was driven by an increase in loan expenses of 257 thousand and increased sba mortgage servicing amortization expense of 98 thousand which were offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits expense of 171 thousand compared to fourth quarter 2020

over the prior year this was driven by a 6 1 million increase in interest and fees on loans which included an increase in ppp income of 4 5 million and 1 6 million in core lending income interest expense on deposits decreased 1 7 million due to the decline of 27 basis points in average cost net interest margin ended the year at 4 11 a 46 basis point improvement from the 3 65 achieved during

when ali faruk a father of two from richmond virginia took his sons to their local library earlier this month he noticed a unique computer workstation and he couldn t resist snapping a photo of what he was seeing a wooden desk with an attached playpen area i m staring at it and i m like this is so brilliant faruk told good morning america it was just so simple and intuitive and it s one of those things where you stare at it and you re like how is this not everywhere faruk shared the picture on twitter in late january and in a little over a week his tweet garnered over 27 000 retweets 241 000 likes and sparked a debate about paid leave and the state of child care in the united states a solution for a virginia community the fairfield area library s desk and crib combo also known as the fairfield parent child carrel is the brainchild of a team led by henrico county public library director barbara weedman who saw a need in the fairfield area which is a predominantly black community according to july 2021 census data we ve seen parents and caregivers who would need to do adult work like apply for a job or create a document for community college and so on and if they had little infants and toddlers we saw that it was very tricky to do weedman explained to gma the idea really was for customer service to provide access librarians love to help and we love to give access to people and it can be tricky when you have little ones she said and i think this has resonated with many people because they can relate juggling all these things in our busy lives a custom carrel at a virginia library features a play area for babies and toddlers at henrico county s fairfield area library ali faruk weedman said the library system gathered feedback from the neighborhood s residents and came up with the carrel design with the help of quinn evans architects and tmc furniture four of the carrels were added to the second floor of fairfield library which moved to its current location and opened to the public in october 2019 the community had given us a lot of input and we wanted that whole floor of the library to be extremely easy for families to use and the play stations were a pilot idea from having seen that issue for so long weedman said janelle witcher 35 a mom of four and aspiring entrepreneur recently brought her 2 year old son and 1 year old daughter with her to fairfield and said she s thankful for the workstation my kids sat in there for about 20 minutes i had time to get my own business card done and then everything else that i was working on but not a solution for america s child care woes the work and play workstations at fairfield are primarily intended for kids 2 and under and though he didn t use it himself since his kids are older faruk said he appreciated that it was available for fellow parents and that s why he wanted to tweet about it his viral tweet has mostly been met with positive responses but at the same time coverage of his tweet struck a negative chord as well witcher s one year old child takes a look at a picture book in the carrel s play area a custom carrel at a virginia library features a play area for babies and toddlers at henrico county s fairfield area library janelle goode lauren smith brody author of the fifth trimester and an advocate of paid family and medical leave commented on an instagram post that shared a photo of the desk carrel in action writing i adore libraries and librarians they are the heroes we need but let s be clear this is not childcare in an interview with gma brody said that though she does applaud the library s innovative workstation she felt more needed to be addressed because this is not the solution that we re all looking for when you see an organization step in and create a solution that could potentially help a lot of people you want to be supportive of it but it doesn t solve the larger question of like why is this even needed why do american families not have access to affordable child care she said according to a 2018 analysis from progressive think tank center for american progress more than 51 of americans live in so called child care deserts areas where there are an insufficient number of licensed child care centers we re at our breaking point and it s just really unsustainable brody said faruk who works as the director of public policy at the nonprofit families forward virginia agreed that access to child care is a big problem in the u s there s no universal child care there s no universal health care a lot of families don t even have paid sick leave which is a real shame and it s not that we can t afford these things the stock market keeps hitting record highs we have the money it s just not a priority he said in the meantime as the push for more access to child care continues public institutions such as the fairfield area library hope to continue addressing their communities needs in the interim
