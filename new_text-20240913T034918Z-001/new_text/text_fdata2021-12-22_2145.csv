biden to pledge 500m free covid 19 tests to counter omicron file president joe biden speaks about the covid 19 variant named omicron during a visit to the national institutes of health on dec 2 2021 in bethesda md biden plans to stress in a dec 21 speech the importance of getting vaccinated to protect from a wave of covid 19 infections tied to the new omicron variant as christmas approaches ap photo evan vucci file washington ap with the omicron variant on the march president joe biden plans to announce 500 million free rapid tests for americans increased support for hospitals under strain and a redoubling of vaccination and boosting efforts in a speech scheduled for tuesday afternoon biden is detailing major changes to his covid 19 winter plan his hand forced by the arrival of the fast spreading variant whose properties are yet not fully understood by scientists the world is confronting the prospect of a second straight holiday season with covid 19 as families and friends begin to gather scientists don t yet know whether omicron causes more serious disease but they do know that vaccination should offer strong protections against severe illness and death the white house provided details on the proposals biden will announce in his speech a cornerstone of the plan is biden s decision for the government to purchase 500 million coronavirus rapid tests and ship them free to americans starting in january people will use a new website to order their tests which will then be sent to them by u s mail at no charge the white house said it marks a major shift for biden who earlier had called for many americans to purchase the hard to find tests on their own and then seek reimbursement from their health insurance for the first time the u s government will send free covid 19 tests directly to americans after more than a year of urging by public health experts experts had criticized biden s initial buy first get paid later approach as unwieldy and warned that the u s would face another round of problems with testing at a critical time testing advocates point to countries like the u k and germany which have distributed billions of tests to the public and recommend people test themselves twice a week the federal government will also establish new testing sites and use the defense production act to help manufacture more tests the first new federally supported testing site will open in new york this week the new testing sites will add to 20 000 already available white house officials said they re working with google so that people will be able to find them by searching free covid test near me still biden s testing surge would fall far short of the levels needed for all americans to test at the recommended rate of twice weekly the u s would need 2 3 billion tests per month for everyone 12 and older to do that according to the nonprofit kaiser family foundation that s nearly five times more than the half billion tests biden will deploy currently the u s can conduct about 600 million tests per month with home tests accounting for about half according to researchers from arizona state university in another prong to biden s amped up plan he is prepared to deploy an additional 1 000 troops with medical skills to assist hospitals buckling under the virus surge additionally he is immediately sending federal medical personnel to michigan indiana wisconsin arizona new hampshire and vermont there are also plans to ready additional ventilators and protective equipment from the national stockpile expanding hospital resources as a backstop the federal emergency management agency will deploy hundreds of ambulances and paramedic teams so that if one hospital fills up they can transport patients to open beds in other facilities ambulances are already headed to new york and maine and paramedic teams are going to new hampshire vermont and arizona but vaccination remains the main defense since it can head off disease in the first place the government will stand up multiple vaccination sites and provide hundreds of personnel to administer shots new rules will make it easier for pharmacists to work across state lines to administer a broader range of shots for those who are already fully vaccinated a booster shot has been shown in lab tests to provide strong protection against omicron although reports of breakthrough cases abound data show that vaccinated people who become infected are much less likely to suffer serious disease leading to hospitalization or death to the unvaccinated biden plans to deliver a stern admonition that they re risking their lives and the lives of their loved ones in a preview of biden s speech white house press secretary jen psaki said at monday s press briefing that the democratic president doesn t plan to impose any lockdowns and will instead be encouraging people to get inoculated and if they re eligible to get their booster shot this is not a speech about locking the country down this is a speech about the benefits of being vaccinated psaki told reporters biden has found himself in the delicate position of both alerting the country to the dangers posed by omicron and reassuring americans that the vaccines will protect them white house officials are looking to ease the nation back toward accepting the reality of an endemic virus with far lower stakes for the vaccinated this has meant setting a difficult balance as cases rise and as deaths and serious illness among the unvaccinated dominate headlines there are 40 million eligible but unvaccinated american adults efforts to increase vaccination rates have struggled to overcome a series of political social and cultural divides psaki said the president plans to appeal to survival instincts our health experts assess that you are 14 times more likely to die of covid if you have not been vaccinated versus vaccinated she said monday scientists say omicron spreads even easier than other coronavirus strains including delta it accounted for nearly three quarters of new u s infections last week underscoring the reach of the virus the white house said late monday that biden had been in close contact with a staff member who later tested positive for covid 19 the staffer spent about 30 minutes around the president on air force one on friday on a trip from orangeburg south carolina to philadelphia the staffer who was fully vaccinated and boosted tested positive earlier monday psaki said psaki said biden has tested negative twice since sunday and will test again on wednesday citing guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention psaki said biden didn t need to quarantine and would continue with his regular schedule in new york city nearly 42 600 people citywide tested positive from wednesday through saturday compared with fewer than 35 800 in the entire month of november the city has never had so many people test positive in such a short period of time since testing became widely available the latest outbreak reflects the global challenges of stopping the coronavirus pandemic the dutch government began a tough nationwide lockdown on sunday to rein in sharply rising infections but many european leaders have opted for something less british prime minister boris johnson said officials have decided against imposing further restrictions at least for now france and germany have barred most british travelers from entering and the government in paris has banned public concerts and fireworks displays at new year s celebrations stock markets in asia europe and the u s fell on monday

warning the following article contains spoilers about the sex and the city reboot i started watching sex and the city after the hbo series wrapped in 2004 the show s zeitgeist rippled through conversations about sex fashion and relationships but i didn t know what the buzz was all about as a phd student in the mid 2000s with no cable subscription my visual entertainment consisted of renting vhs tapes and snuggling my cats on a navy futon my friends couldn t stop talking about the four main characters who wanted a lot from life especially in terms of love and relationships i often heard debates over whether someone was a carrie samantha charlotte or miranda from the first episode i was hooked by the edgy banter and sexual situations they got into they were also hashing out big issues like work friendship lgbtqia rights and most of all what sex means these issues have woven their way into my career as a sexuality scholar and as a women who identifies with the sexual verve of samantha miranda s biting humour and carrie s writerly profession but i m aghast at sex and the city s bougie whitewashed and sexless reboot called and just like that which debuted on dec 9 new york times television critic james poniewozik describes it as being like two shows what can we take away from this epic fail as a society that continues to undervalue women and shun open discussions of age class race and sex the peloton effect in the first episode big dies in carrie s arms after an intense peloton exercise bike session in their massive upper east side apartment this rather dark scene foreshadows the decline of the smart and saucy social commentary that once defined sex and the city the characters seem stuck in the past and confused about who they are as older women instead of unpacking these tensions they re glossed over given that very few characters over 50 in mainstream film and tv are women as few as one in four we need shows that feature women s complex lived experiences instead of those that bend to the whims of the male driven entertainment industry fingers crossed that the show bounces back with some fun anti ageist narratives like peloton did after its stocks descended following the opening episode miranda miranda still has the best lines like when she describes accidentally touching her son s used condom over brunch i stepped on my son s semen before coffee but she s also framed as chronically unwoke and offensive to everyone how is that comedic in another scene miranda contemplates dying her silvering hair going or staying grey is a hot topic among hollywood actors including andie macdowell who calls staying grey a power move many if not all women grapple with this issue which can make them feel like they must choose between feeling authentic and looking competent miranda decides not to dye which may encourage other women to resist dominant beauty trends that are designed to mask the ageing process we ve also seen miranda partake in several morning drinks when middle age women drink excessively we either laugh about it mummy wine memes or pathologize it this is a topic of growing concern and bringing it out of the shadows on primetime could help women who have a problematic relationship with alcohol charlotte charlotte resumes her role as the well meaning emotional and out of touch musketeer her character is shown parenting two very different daughters one who may be non binary the challenges that this presents are worth examining given the increasing visibility of transgender and gender diverse children in the public sphere charlotte is also depicted pressuring carrie to attend one of her daughter s piano recitals at the prestigious manhattan school of music she repeats the name of the musical academy so many times it s no longer a semi funny classic charlotte move but a bloated display of class privilege her new friendship with lisa todd wexley played by accomplished black actor nicole ari parker is also problematic instead of exploring the dynamics of racialized friendships wexley s character is lauded for being on vogue s best dressed list she s even called black charlotte which is racist and drains the character of any attributes of her own carrie seeing carrie behind the computer screen reminds me that she has an occupation other than being on a podcast beyond her generational reach she s the white cis woman on the podcast amongst a team of racialized and non binary hosts carrie appears to be there to represent white women but the idea that such a representation is needed smacks of dated racialized privilege or what feminist scholars call political whiteness when carrie is asked to join sexy confessional dialogue in a meaningful way on the podcast she is shocked but how could someone be shocked who decades earlier called out the orgasm gap way before anyone else it was pretty revolutionary as jordin wiggins founder of the pleasure collective discusses in her book the pink canary women in mid life don t need pearl clutching when it comes to talking about sexuality we need to see women owning their desire and using their erotic voice closets to climb back into as i watched miranda charlotte and carrie stroll around in expensive clothes with beautifully coiffed hair and music school memberships i was struck by the stain of their white richness i used to relate to them when they were struggling in their careers and relationships but now in their palatial new york city apartments with massive walk in closets it doesn t feel right the uptake of shows like maid i may destroy you and sex education demonstrate what viewing audiences want to see they want to see themselves in their socio economic racialized and embodied diversity just like the crumbling patriarchy the reign of the white cis hetero woman is coming to an end as the predominant representation of women it s far from the only kind of show that sells the old version of satc not only reflected our society at the time but it also helped change it in a lot of ways will the ladies of the upper east side ever step up their blahniks author treena orchard associate professor school of

weigh economic risks and opportunities in 2022 within the pandemic context the audience surveys offered a glimpse into investor sentiments as the year draws to a close jens waechter senior global macro and research analyst at franklin templeton fares benouari senior portfolio manager of swiss and global equities at ubp and neelam verma vice president and head of investments at the continental group were the key speakers and the webinar was moderated by abhishek datta associate vice president at the continental group the global financial markets have remained largely resilient in 2021 in the face of continued pandemic impact defying early projections although economic recovery remains uneven due to new virus strains disparities in vaccine rollouts between nations and distinctive market forces the growth outlook for 2022 is expected to be positive characterized by effective fiscal management increased digitalization and risk mitigation the panelists mentioned the key drivers for this year s market performance were a strong rebound in growth earnings upgrades increased productivity gains and continued support from governments and central banks globally headwinds for the year ahead are seen to be less fiscal spending tighter monetary policy and inflation the experts touched on inflation having an impact on both equity and fixed income portfolios ubp s economists see inflation peaking early next year in developed economies and later in the year for developing economies stabilising by h2 2022 in a poll conducted during the webinar a resounding 74 of respondents said they expect inflation to increase in 2022 the current inflation is driven by both demand and supply disposable income has increased during the pandemic as people couldn t spend following the reopening however spending has increased but supply chains are unable to meet the high demand so prices are rising especially in service sectors that have been disrupted the hardest by the pandemic with deflationary policies expected soon the situation could improve by the second half of 2022 said jens waechter next year higher levels of inflation as well as monetary tightening could have a pronounced impact on both equity and fixed income markets however a gentle rise in rates will not elicit a dramatic response especially in equity markets the fixed income securities could be off to a sluggish start the economic outlook is subject to multiple variables including new strains spells and administrative responses but there are structural tailwinds to factor in too businesses have made productivity gains pivoting to digital operations increasing efficiencies and reducing costs there is an emphasis on value creation and businesses that can generate good revenues and accurately

washington dc president joe biden aimed to reassure americans that if they are vaccinated they can still proceed with their holiday plans without fear of becoming seriously ill i know some americans are wondering if you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends the answer is yes you can if you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated particularly if you ve gotten your booster shot biden said in a white house speech tuesday conversely he warned those who have not yet received shots of the potential for severe illness or death in the coming months all these people who have not been vaccinated you have an obligation to yourselves to your family and quite frankly to your country get vaccinated now it s free it s convenient and it saves lives he said biden announced tuesday the purchase of a half billion at home rapid covid 19 tests one of a series of new steps he unveiled in a speech that came as the country faces a potentially crippling wintertime surge of infections the 500 million new tests will be made available next month and will reach americans through the mail the official said the administration is still working to determine how many tests each household may request in a call on tuesday senior administration officials were unable to provide any new details about exactly when the website to request the tests will launch and how quickly tests will be shipped out we re working through all the details and we ll have those in the coming weeks a senior administration official said during a briefing with reporters the official said the first deliveries of those tests will happen in january and that the website will launch in january or around january as well the official also said the white house is working through all the details when asked how americans without internet access could secure tests the new test shipment scheme came during remarks meant to underscore the white house s plan to confront what is expected to be a large spike in cases driven by the now dominant omicron variant in the coming weeks already cases are rising rapidly in areas around the country and hospitals are nearing capacity among the president s new initiatives is a plan to prepare 1 000 military service members to deploy to overburdened hospitals across the country in january and february administration officials said those service members will include doctors nurses medics and other military medical personnel an official said god willing the full 1 000 wouldn t be needed but if we do they are ready and they re mobilized the president will tell the american people if they re vaccinated and follow the precautions we all know well especially masking while traveling they should feel comfortable celebrating christmas and the holidays as they planned a senior administration official said ahead of time previewing a speech that biden hopes will reassure anxious americans ahead of the festive season by contrast biden warned the tens of millions of americans who have so far declined to get shots that they run a high risk of becoming ill or hospitalized as the highly transmissible omicron variant spreads rapidly across the country biden also announced new vaccination sites and increased vaccine access and will deploy hundreds of additional federal vaccinators who will help add thousands of appointments each week the official said though demand for vaccines has dwindled in recent months the surge caused by the delta variant earlier this year did lead to increased demand for vaccinations in some of the hardest hit areas biden also addressed fema efforts to expand hospital capacity and to pre position medical supplies in places where stocks may run low in the coming weeks the speech coming just days before christmas reflects biden s renewed focus on the coronavirus pandemic as anxiety rises around the country at the potential for new restrictions and lockdowns lines for testing centers have stretched for blocks in certain areas including the northeast leading the white house to develop plans to open new federal testing sites in new york city before christmas distributing free at home tests to all americans was written off by the white house as recently as this month press secretary jen psaki scoffed earlier this month when asked if tests should be free and given out available everywhere should we just send one to every american she asked while the white house plan announced tuesday does not ship test to every american people would request the tests online instead those who utilize them will not have to report their results to public health agencies officials said pressed on that shift a senior administration official insisted that the new plan builds on the administration s previous testing initiatives and pointed to increased supply for the first time in the course of this pandemic because of all the actions we ve taken because of fda authorizing a lot of tests because we created the market because we ve used the defense production act consistently for the last 11 months we have the ability to make this purchase we have the manufacturing capacity for a massive purchase like that starting in january the official said if there s more we can do we will do it the official also pointed out that demand for tests has spiked now amid the omicron surge and the holiday season and said that the government s purchase of 500 million tests is an extra layer on top of existing commercial supply the administration had already announced a plan requiring health insurance providers to reimburse plan holders for the cost of at home tests that initiative remains in place next year in his remarks biden acknowledged a likely rise in cases including among vaccinated people but emphasized the drastically different outcomes for those with shots and those unprotected by vaccines biden and his team have been adamant that federal lockdown recommendations aren t in the cards this time and in his remarks biden will focus on steps primarily to forestall a crippling of the us public health system than on efforts to fully stop the spread of the virus

cnn president joe biden aimed to reassure vaccinated americans that they can still proceed with their holiday plans without fear of becoming seriously ill announcing a number of new efforts to combat a surge of covid 19 cases in the united states i know some americans are wondering if you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends the answer is yes you can if you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated particularly if you ve gotten your booster shot biden said in a white house speech tuesday the speech which came just days before christmas reflects biden s renewed focus on the coronavirus pandemic as anxiety rises around the country at the steep spike in cases and concerns about whether new restrictive measures will be needed to limit the spread biden emphasized repeatedly throughout the speech that the current moment is different than march 2020 when the coronavirus solidified its grip on the us the other question folks are asking is are we going back to march 2020 the answer is absolutely no no biden said the president told vaccinated americans they should feel comfortable celebrating the holidays as they planned if they take the proper precautions but he also warned the tens of millions of americans who have so far declined to get shots that they run a high risk of becoming ill or hospitalized and he also invoked the name of his predecessor to encourage americans to get their booster shot i got my booster shot as soon as they were available the president said and just the other day former president trump announced he had gotten his booster shot it may be one of the few things he and i agree on biden added people with booster shots are highly protected join them join us testing under scrutiny during his speech biden announced the purchase of a half billion at home rapid covid 19 tests one of a series of new steps he unveiled as the country faces a potentially crippling wintertime surge of infections the 500 million new tests will be made available next month and will reach americans through the mail according to the white house to be clear we re not sending a test to every single home in the country white house press secretary jen psaki said during tuesday s white house press briefing we are providing an opportunity another opportunity or ability for people to go on a website and request a test if their preference is to get that test to their home not everybody will do that but we want people who want to do that who want to get tested who want to request test that way to have that ability to do it the president told reporters after his speech that the current shortage of covid 19 tests in the us is not a failure but rather a reflection of a dramatic surge in cases no it s not he said because covid is spreading so rapidly the alarms are going off the president said adding i don t think anybody anticipated this would be as rapid at spreading as it did then all of the sudden it was like everybody rushed to the counter was a big big rush i knew that was coming biden insisted so what i tried to do was meet with the companies to use the defense production act to get a half a billion more tests asked by another reporter what took so long to ramp up production of tests biden seemed irritated at the question come on what took so long he asked what took so long is it didn t take long at all details on program still being worked out the administration is still working to determine how many tests each household may request senior administration officials were unable to provide any new details about exactly when the website to request the tests will launch and how quickly tests will be shipped out psaki said tuesday that the expectation is that the website will be able to sustain a surge of incoming web traffic and a senior administration official said during a briefing with cnn tuesday morning that the administration is still working through all the details and we ll have those in the coming weeks the official said the first deliveries of those tests will happen in january and that the website will launch in january or around january as well the official also said the white house is working through all the details when asked how americans without internet access could secure tests the new test shipment scheme came during remarks meant to underscore the white house s plan to confront what is expected to be a large spike in cases driven by the now dominant omicron variant in the coming weeks already cases are rising rapidly in areas around the country and hospitals are nearing capacity lines for testing centers have stretched for blocks in certain areas including the northeast leading the white house to develop plans to open new federal testing sites in new york city before christmas distributing free at home tests to all americans was written off by the white house as recently as this month press secretary jen psaki scoffed earlier this month when asked if tests should be free and given out available everywhere should we just send one to every american she asked but on tuesday in the briefing room psaki expressed some regret about her earlier comments there s not a day that goes by that i don t leave this podium and wish i would have said something with greater context or a more precision or additional information psaki said there was a lot of good questioning on testing and during that briefing i conveyed a lot of information about our expansion of testing about the 15 million tests that we were making available about the 20 000 free testing sites she continued should i have included that additional context yes going back i wish i would have done that new federal covid 19 efforts among the president s new initiatives is a plan to prepare 1 000 military service members to deploy to overburdened hospitals across the country in january and february administration officials said those service members will include doctors nurses medics and other military medical personnel an official said god willing the full 1 000 wouldn t be needed but if we do they are ready and they re mobilized biden also announced new vaccination sites and increased vaccine access and will deploy hundreds of additional federal vaccinators though demand for vaccines has dwindled in recent months the surge caused by the delta variant earlier this year did lead to increased demand for vaccinations in some of the hardest hit areas biden also addressed fema efforts to expand hospital capacity and to pre position medical supplies in places where stocks may run low in the coming weeks in his remarks the president acknowledged a likely rise in cases including among vaccinated people but emphasized the drastically different outcomes for those with shots and those unprotected by vaccines biden and his team have been adamant that federal lockdown recommendations aren t in the cards this time and in his remarks biden focused on steps primarily to forestall a crippling of the us public health system than on efforts to fully stop the spread of the virus the white house plan announced tuesday does not ship tests to every american instead people would request the tests online instead those who utilize them will not have to report their results to public health agencies officials said pressed on that shift a senior administration official insisted that the new plan builds on the administration s previous testing initiatives and pointed to increased supply the official also pointed out that demand for tests has spiked now amid the omicron surge and the holiday season and said that the government s purchase of 500 million tests is an extra layer on top of existing commercial supply the administration had already announced a plan requiring health insurance providers to reimburse plan holders for the cost of at home tests that initiative remains in place next year this story has been updated with additional details the cnn wire

apichatpong weerasethakul memoria 2021 35 mm color sound 136 minutes jessica tilda swinton first we see a room it is dark too dark to make out details or even the colors hinted at in various shades of gray there seems to be a bed and perhaps a person asleep under the covers just when your eyes are intent on the little that can be seen you hear could it be a sonic boom a sound so loud and dense that it vibrates through your entire body when we say a film is kinetic we are usually describing the effect of its images on the viewer but the kineticism of apichatpong weerasethakul s memoria is auditory so overwhelming is its impact that it would be ridiculous to say we watched or saw this movie no we listened to it and the listening was accompanied by seeing i cannot think of another film in which this is the case from beginning to end except perhaps ken jacobs s blonde cobra 1963 or derek jarman s blue 1993 but what we hear in those movies are primarily words not the flutter of bird wings the cranking of a gearshift the hum of a refrigerator the hundreds of everyday noises that we pay no mind to in films or our lives but are alert to in memoria because less than a minute after the first image appears we hear a sound later described by jessica tilda swinton the person sleeping in the darkened room as that of a concrete ball dropped into a metal container in perhaps the ocean in a beautiful and useful book about the making of memoria apichatpong describes jessica as being like a character from jacques tourneur s i walked with a zombie 1943 transported to colombia jessica is indeed wraithlike and troubled by this mysterious sound which no one else can hear recently widowed she is in bogota to visit her sister who has been hospitalized for an undefinable illness she believes may have to do with a dog in a dream or with her anthropological investigations of a group of indigenous people who do not wish to share their secrets jessica will later see a dog in the street that may be following her but stray animals are everywhere she will meet an archaeologist jeanne balibar who takes her to a dig where construction of a tunnel has been halted by the discovery of six thousand year old human bones in all these situations fragments of a narrative about a woman in a place undergoing changes that could obliterate the past she intermittently hears the sound of an explosion inside her skull which no one else in the film experiences except an audio engineer named hernán juan pablo urrego who replicates jessica s big bang by doctoring a track from a file of stock movie sound effects apichatpong anchors memoria in cinema history by shooting the image in 35 mm but the sound recorded and mixed digitally is of the present moment and the future i thought of michael snow s wavelength 1967 where the 16 mm image of a loft as dusty and dilapidatedly furnished as most of the interiors in memoria is kineticized not by the slowly changing perspective of the zoom lens but by the sine wave on the audio track which over some forty minutes gradually ascends from a low rumble to a car alarm pitch the sound stripe on 16 mm film prints never fully captures original analog sound recordings and so the interplay of image and sound constructed by filmmakers like snow and even jean luc godard who worked in sonically superior 35 mm cannot compete with the sensory richness of memoria lucky apichatpong to live in two technological worlds eventually jessica travels from the city to a forest where she meets another man named hernán elkin díaz who like the much younger title character in the borges story funes the memorious remembers every detail of everything that has happened in his lifetime more than that hernán can hear in inanimate objects the voices of people who lived and died ages ago he describes himself as a hard disk and when jessica begins to channel words and sounds from his past that she at first thinks are her own memories he tells her she is an antenna by then they ve drunk a lot of hernán s home brew and as they sit together and listen apichatpong leaves them to show us the forest which has been a haven for something that i won t give away except to say that it could be a tribute to latin american magic realism the mountains the slow moving clouds and the sky images that like jessica s ear piercing sound now miraculously vanished bring us near the condition we call transcendence the credits roll accompanied by a deluge of rain memoria will play in theaters forever screening in one city at a time for one week at a time it will not be streamed in the immediate future as very few people own the high end sound bars that would do it justice and those who do could be charged with disturbing the peace the film runs at ifc center in new york from december 26 to january 1 this review appears in artforum s january 2022 issue

state dining room 2 42 p m est the president good afternoon i promised when i got elected that i d always give it to you straight from the shoulder the good the bad the truth so as we head into christmas weekend i want to answer your questions about the rising number of covid cases covid 19 cases and i want to start by acknowledging how tired worried and frustrated i know you are i know how you re feeling for many of you this will be the first or even the second christmas where you look across the table will be an empty kitchen chair there tens of millions have gotten sick and we ve all experienced an upheaval in our lives but while covid has been a tough adversary we ve shown that we re tougher tougher because we have the power of science and vaccines that prevent illness and save lives and tougher because of our resolve so that let me answer some questions that lay out the steps the vice president and i are taking to prepare for the rising number of cases experts tell us we could expect in the weeks ahead first how concerned should you be about omicron which is now the dominant variant in this country and it happened so quickly the answer is straightforward if you are not fully vaccinated you have good reason to be concerned you re at a high risk of getting sick and if you get sick you re likely to spread it to others including friends and family and the unvaccinated have a significantly higher risk of ending up in a hospital or even dying almost everyone who has died from covid 19 in the past many months has been unvaccinated unvaccinated but if you re among the majority of americans who are fully vaccinated and especially if you ve gotten the booster shot that third shot you re much you have much much less reason to worry you have a high degree of protection against severe illness and because omicron spreads so easily we ll see some fully vaccinated people get covid potentially in large numbers there will be positive cases in every office even here in the white house among the unv among the vaccinated among the vaccinated from omicron but these cases are highly unlikely to lead to serious illness vaccinated people who get covid may get ill but they re protected from severe illness and death that s why you should still remain vigilant according to our doctors even if you re fully vaccinated you should wear a mask when indoors in public settings wearing a mask provides extra protection for you and those around you and i know some americans are wondering if you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends the answer is yes you can if you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated particularly if you ve gotten your booster shot if you are vaccinated and follow the precautions that we all know well you should feel comfortable celebrating christmas and the holidays as you planned it you know you ve done the right thing you could enjoy the holiday season and thanks to the progress on vaccinations this fall we ve gone from nearly 90 million adults in july who had not even started their vaccination process to fewer than 40 million today still too many but down from 90 to 40 all these people who have not been vaccinated you have an obligation to yourselves to your family and quite frankly i know i ll get criticized for this to your country get vaccinated now it s free it s convenient i promise you it saves lives and i honest to god believe it s your patriotic duty another question folks are asking is what can you do to make yourself and your family feel safer and be safer the answer is simple get your booster shot wear a mask our doctors have made it clear booster shots provide the strongest of protections unfortunately we still have tens of millions of people who are eligible for the booster shot who have not yet gotten it they ve gotten the first two shots but they ve not gotten the booster folks the booster shots are free and widely available over 60 million americans including 62 percent of eligible seniors our most vulnerable group have gotten their booster shots i got my booster shot as soon as they were available and just the other day former president trump announced he had gotten his booster shot it may be one of the few things he and i agree on people with booster shots are highly protected join them join us it s been six months or more since my second shot if it s been six months or more for your second shot when i got my booster you can get yours today if you ve been six months or more since your second shot another question that folks are asking is are we going back to march 2020 not this last march 2021 but march 2020 when the pandemic first hit that s what i keep getting asked the answer is absolutely no no here are three big differences between then and now one number one the first one more than 200 million americans have been fully vaccinated in march of 2020 no one was fully vaccinated what that means is today as cases a case of covid 19 for a fully vaccinated and boosted person will most likely mean no symptoms or mild ones similar to the common respiratory viruses over 200 million americans should have the peace of mind that they did not have in march of 2020 they re protected from hospitalization and they re protected from death second point we re prepared today for what s coming in march of 2020 we were not ready today we ve spocktiled enough we ve stockpiled enough gowns masks and ventilators to deal with the surge of hospitalizations among the unvaccinated today we re ready and as i ll explain in a few minutes we re going to be reinforcing our hospitals helping them number three we know a lot more today than we did back in march of 2020 for example last year we thought the only way to keep your children safe was to close your close our schools today we know more and we have more resources to keep those schools open we can you can get 5 to 11 year olds vaccinated a tool we didn t have until last month today we don t have to shut down schools because of a case of covid 19 now if a student tests positive other students can take the test and stay in the classroom if they re not infected rather than closing the whole school or having to quarantine we can keep our k through 12 schools open and that s exactly what we should be doing so folks let me summarize we should all be concerned about omicron but not panicked if you re fully vaccinated and especially if you got your booster shot you are highly protected and if you re unvaccinated you re at higher risk of getting severely ill from covid 19 getting hospitalized and even dying so the best thing to do is get fully vaccinated and get your booster shot and no this is not march of 2020 two hundred million people are fully vaccinated we re prepared we know more we just have to stay focused so that s where we stand now let me tell you about the additional steps i m ordering today to take on what is coming i know you ve heard a lot of this in the news already this morning three weeks ago i laid out a covid 19 action plan for this winter that prepared us for this moment today we re making the plan even stronger first we re setting up our vaccination and booster efforts we re stepping it up significantly in the past two weeks we ve seen the highest vaccination rates since last spring and we aren t as vaccinated as a country as we should be though that s why we have added 10 000 new vaccination sites on top of the 80 000 sites that are already we had we already had in place and even more will open in january i know there are some parts of this country where people are very eager to get their booster where it s harder to get an appointment excuse me coughs so starting this week i ll be deploying hundreds more vaccinators and more sites to help get the booster shots in people s arms i ve ordered fema the federal emergency management agency to stand up new pop up vaccination clinics all across the country where you can get that booster shot we ve opened coughs excuse me we ve opened fema vaccination sites in washington state and new mexico recently as cases have increased and today i m directing fema to stand up new sites in areas where there is high demand these steps are going to help us add more more and more booster appointments in over just over the next few weeks i also want to say a word to parents if your children are not vaccinated please get them vaccinated if you re a parent understandably who waited to see how the first shots went with other kids before getting your own kid vaccinated you can stop waiting six million children in our country ages 5 to 11 are vaccinated get your children protected today now and for those parents out there who have a child that s too young to be vaccinated that is under the age of five i know this can still be a scary time but one thing one thing you can and must do while we await vaccines for children under five get yourself fully vaccinated and boosted as well as those around you your children your caregivers your siblings it s critical to mask up in public indoor places we know that our youngest children have only rarely been impacted by serious covid cases covid 19 cases but they can be further protected if they re surrounded by vaccinated people and again to folks who are not vaccinated you may think you re putting only yourself at risk but it s your choice your choice is not just a choice about you it affects other people you re putting other people at risk your loved ones your friends neighbors strangers you run into and your choice can be the difference between life or death the longer the virus is around the more likely variants form that may be deadlier than the ones that have come before let me say again and again and again and again please get vaccinated it s the only responsible thing to do and those who are not vaccinated are causing hospitals to overrun become overrun again i just spoke to the governor of new york every covid 19 hospital means someone with a heart attack cancer or other serious illness may not get that bed and that lifesaving care they need in the hospital look let me give it to you straight again omicron is serious potentially deadly business for unvaccinated people let me be clear thanks to the prior administration and our scientific community america is one of the first countries to get the vaccine and thanks to my administration and the hard work of americans we led a rollout that made america among the world leaders in getting shots in arms but uptake slowed this summer as vaccine resistance among some hardened look the unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices but those choices have been fueled by dangerous misinformation on cable tv and social media you know these companies and personalities are making money by peddling lies and allowing misinformation that can kill their own customers and their own supporters it s wrong it s immoral and i call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation to stop it stop it now one of the other things that we know that has to be done is more testing because omicron spreads easily especially among the unvaccinated it s critically important that we know who s infected that means we need more testing and on that score we are now where we should be yes we have over 20 000 free testing sites yes we ve used the defense production act and spent 3 billion to greatly expand the number of at home tests available for purchase online and at your local pharmacy and yes we ve made sure insurance covers the pcr tests you get in a hospital or at your doctor s office but starting next month private insurance will all cover also cover at home testing so you can order a test online and get reimbursed we re providing access to free at home tests for those who may have insurance as well may not have insurance i should say as well but it s not enough we have to do more we have to do better and we will starting this week the federal government will set up emergency testing sites in areas that need additional testing capacity before christmas the first several of these federal testing sites will be up and running in new york city with many more to come this free testing is going to help reduce the waiting lines the time you have to stand there and and sometimes it s an hour or more we re going to continue to add federal testing sites where needed so that if you want an immediate test there will be a place where you can go get it we also need to do better with at home testing so i m announcing today the federal government will purchase one half billion that s not million billion with a b additional at home rapid tests with deliveries starting in january we ll be getting these tests to americans for free and we ll have websites where you can get them delivered to your home we have arranged for it to be easier for you to find a free covid testing site near you on google just enter covid test near me in the google search bar and you can find a number of different locations nearby where you can get tested and we re going to continue to use the defense production act as we did earlier this month to make sure we re producing as many tests and as quickly as possible the bottom line is it s a lot better than it was but we re taking even more steps to make it easier to get tested and get tested for free next we are preparing hospitals for what s coming those 40 unvaccinated adults have a good chance of getting covid 19 and some of you will get very sick that will mean hospitals are going to get extremely stressed extremely stressed again both in terms of equipment as well as personnel to care for those who get sick that s why my administration has stockpiled and pre positioned millions of gowns gloves masks and ventilators we used to call it ppp we re ready to send them immediately to any state that needs more in addition i have directed the pentagon to mobilize an additional 1 000 troops to be deployed to help staff local hospitals and expand capacity that s 1 000 military doctors nurses and medics we ve already started moving military excuse me medical teams they ve already landed in wisconsin and indiana this week and this is on top of 300 federal medical medical personnel that are now on the ground having deployed since we learned about omicron look while we know staffing is the biggest need for our hospitals some may need more beds as well we re prepared i ve directed fema to activate the national response center and begin deploying teams now to provide additional hospital beds we ll begin to construct emergency capacity near hospitals in parking garages and nearby buildings to be ready if needed and the fuderal the federal government is paying for all of this period all of it further fema will deploy hundreds of ambulances and ems crews so that if one hospital fills up we can transport patients to beds elsewhere this week we will send dozens of ambulances to new york and maine because of the because the covid is spreading very rapidly to help transport patients our doctors nurses hospital staffs have gone above and beyond during this pandemic the strain and stress is real i really mean it it s real and we ll have their backs though we have to let them know we have their backs finally we re making sure that covid 19 no longer closes businesses or schools last week the federal court reinstated my administration s vaccination or test the vaccination or test rule for businesses with more than 100 employees the rule requires employers with 100 or more employees to protect their workers who are on site and indoors with a requirement that they be vaccinated or tested each week or go home these rules are going to keep workers safe and keep workers safe will help keep businesses open if people are vaccinated or tested they are much less likely to get sick and less likely to spread it to others customers are more likely to come in and shop because they know it s a safe environment i know vaccination requirements are unpopular for many they re not even popular for those who are anxious to get them but my administration has put them in place not to control your life but to save your life and the lives of others over 400 000 americans died from covid this calendar year and almost all were unvaccinated almost all were preventable the rule is legal and effective and it s going to save thousands of american lives we must also keep our k 12 schools open look the science is clear and overwhelming we know how to keep our kids safe from covid 19 in school k through 12 schools should be open and that safety is increased if schools require all adults who work in the schools to get vaccinated and take the safety measures that cdc has recommended including masking i got congress to pass billions of dollars in school improvements ventilation and social distancing schools should be safer than ever from covid 19 and just friday the cdc issued test to stay guidelines so schools can stay open and kids can stay in class even if a classmate tests positive covid 19 is scary but the science is clear children are as safe as are as safe in school as they are anyplace assuming the appropriate precautions have been taken and they ve already been funded let me close with this i know you re tired i really mean this and i know you re frustrated we all want this to be over but we re still in it and this is a critical moment but we also have more tools than we ve ever had before we re ready we ll get through this as we head into the holidays i want us to all keep the faith i want to sincerely thank you for your perseverance your courage your countless acts of kindness love and sacrifice during these last two years throughout our history we ve been tested as a people and as a nation through war and turmoil we had to ask whether we d be safe whether we d be okay whether we d be get back to who we are we ve always endured because we remember there is no challenge too big for america i mean this from the bottom of my heart no challenge we ve come through better and stronger because we stay together as the united states of america that s what we have to keep doing today we can do this together i guarantee you may god bless you all and may god protect our troops and happy holidays god love you all thank you q mr president on testing sir you said we have to do better but public health officials have been saying for months you need to surge rapid test for just this moment is it a failure that you don t have an adequate amount of tests for everyone to be able to get one if they need one right now the president no it s not because covid is spreading so rapidly if you notice it just just happened almost overnight just in the last month and q what s your message the president i m going to answer his question q mr pres the president and so no it s not a failure but the alarm bell went off i don t think anybody anticipated that this was going to be as rapidly spreading as it did and so the question is we had a lot of people who have access to a test who could order them could could have their insurance pay for them et cetera but it all started all of a sudden it was like everybody rushed to the counter there was a big big rush and i knew that was coming so what i tried to do is meet with the companies and use the defense production act to get a half a billion more tests and figure out how to get them to their homes get them on the shelves in the store i mean so that that s what it s all about yes q mr president what s your message to americans who are trying to get tested now and who are not able to get tested and who are wondering what took so long to ramp up testing the president come on what took so long q that s what i m hearing that from people who are trying to get tested now before the holidays the president well what took so long is it didn t take long at all what happened was the omicron virus spread even more rapidly than anybody thought if i had told you four weeks ago that this would spread by a day to day basis it would spread by 50 100 percent 200 percent 500 percent i think you would have looked at me and say biden what are you drinking but that s what it did now we don t know what s going to happen from here it looks there s some evidence that in south africa where a lot of this started that it s dropping off quickly too we don t know but i do know that we re not going to be in a position like i said when we remember we were having a problem with masks and gowns and the like i said i promise you remember the critici i got questions from some of you why are you still paying for all these masks and gowns why you stockpiling this because we don t know it turns out we re going to need them in the back and then q do travel bans work sir and will you reverse the travel ban now that omicron is so prevalent here in the u s the president i m considering reversing i m going to talk with my team in the next couple of days look remember why i said we put the travel ban on it s to see how much time we had before it hit here so we could begin to decide what we needed by looking at what s happening in other countries and but we re past that now and so it s something that is being raised with me by the docs and i ll have an answer for that soon q mr president you often talk about the importance of keeping your word of trust do you believe senator manchin kept his word to you and how do you rebuild trust with progressives in your party to advance your legislation now the president you know i told you before you ve heard me say this before some people think maybe i m not irish because i don t hold a grudge look i want to get things done i still think there s a possibility of getting build back better done what i don t want to do is get into and joe went on tv today and i don t know if it was tv or not i m told he was speaking to the liberal caucus in the house and said joe biden didn t mislead you i misled you and so look i m not i m not looking for let me say something you saw what happened yesterday all the talk about how my build back better plan was going to increase inflation was going to cause these debts and all the like what happened goldman sachs and others said if we don t pass build back better we re in trouble because it s going to grow the economy and without it we re not going to grow and what happened stock prices went way down it took a real dip if you take a look the va i wasn t everybody thinks because i quoted 17 nobel laureates saying this is going to help inflation think about it in terms of if you re a hardworking person and you re making 60 grand if you re alone if you re mom or just on her own or if you re making 80 grand a mom and dad 90 grand like a lot of people do and you re worried about inflation you should be worried about it because it s a devastating thing for people who are working class and middle class folks it really hurts where is most of the cost now the cost is finding it in gasoline even though i ve put even though i was able to bring it down 12 cents a gallon and will come down more i believe we talked about what the cost in food prices going up et cetera but look what s in look what s in build back better childcare you can reduce it by up to 70 percent that will be the difference between 20 million women who go aren t back in the workforce being able to go back if you pass it we re talking about we re talking about healthcare insulin we re in a situa we got we got 200 000 kids with type 1 diabetes you know what it s costing it cost somewhere between 10 cents and 10 dollars to come up with a formula okay a while ago all right you know what it s costing on average 560 640 a month up to 1 000 a month what do you do if you re a mom and a dad working with minimum wage busting your neck and you look at your kid and you know if you don t get that vaccine for them i mean that excuse me if you don t get that drug for them if you don t get that that that be able to take that what happens they re like to go into a coma and maybe die not only do you put the kid s life at stake you strip away all the dignity of a parent looking at their child i m not joking about this imagine being a parent looking at a child and you can t afford you have no house to borrow against you have no savings it s wrong but all the things in that bill are going to reduce prices and cost for middle class and working class people it s going to reduce their costs what s inflation having to pay more than the money you have because things have gone up well it ll bring down all those costs across the board from childcare to a child care tax credit but i m not supposed to be having this press conference right now q mr president did senator manchin break his commitment to you when you announced the framework the white house says

however gandel s not about to throw back the curtain of privacy over several months of will she or won t she negotiations the order of australia recipient finally agreed to this lunch but with a few strict conditions one was that we not talk business that was an undertaking made easier when the venue was moved at the last minute from the spiritual home of the gandel group the chadstone complex which is only 15 minutes down dandenong road from the gandels 80 million toorak mansion we ended up at the ngv because straight after lunch gandel had to attend the state funeral of former victorian governor james gobbo at st patrick s cathedral she tells me she had known the queen s counsel for 50 years back when gobbo was a humble town planner and clearly relished the success of a fellow first generation migrant whom she calls a beautiful and gentle human being as it happens gandel will soon have familial ties to the current victorian governor linda dessau gandel s granddaughter lauren thurin got engaged to dessau s son oliver howard at a privately funded reception on the government house lawns in may but i can t ask gandel how she feels about that the personal lives of herself and john to whom she has been married for more than 60 years and their four children are taboo beyond whatever she is prepared to reveal in the context of what is up for discussion her art collecting and her philanthropy the philanthropy has made the john and pauline gandel foundation give away more than 100 million to a multitude of causes since its formation in 1978 pauline gandel s name graces everything from a children s learning space at the state library of victoria to a magnetic resonance imaging centre at melbourne s royal women s hospital often the art and the philanthropy intertwine gandel sees the kai awase set as a gift to the nation as much as a consummation of her 30 year love affair with japanese lacquerware i think australia can learn so much from the respect for tradition and craftsmanship among the japanese that s embodied in this project she says as we immerse ourselves for a moment in staring at those beautiful shells advertisement the family who collected the raw shells for instance that of lacquer artist kitamura tatsuo have been at it for 10 generations they painstakingly narrowed their stock of more than 3000 shells to the 360 pairs required by the kai awase set with each having to be between 85 millimetres and 97 millimetres wide and of uniform shape the allegory to gandel s hopes for her family s longevity and focus on purpose is clear if unspoken her tone has turned reverential and continues to be as she shares other memories from the project for which she and john flew back and forth to japan seven times between 2013 and 2015 we went to the factory where the gold leaf was being cut and they were hammering it so thin it was floating in the air she says pauline and john gandel we ve never bought a piece we didn t both like we bought what we thought we needed but then we learnt every shell requires seven pieces of gold leaf stuck to the shell with the lanolin from lambswool so we kept going back for more and of course the price went up every year we pause by a spectacular new pair of kai oke the octagonal lacquered boxes in which the shells are traditionally kept they look far too small to fit 360 shells apiece but there s a layering trick for squeezing them all in which is the domain of yet another family of artisans see the concave top of the boxes that took three months to get right the master wouldn t accept it until it was perfect she says gandel s love affair with japanese lacquerware began in the 1980s when she stumbled across some in a small shop in a melbourne laneway while looking for a birthday present for john i purchased a suzuribako a pencil box hoping to organise john s desk but instead i found myself immersed in exploring this art form further and delving into its historical context she says the box was lost in a house fire the couple suffered in the early 1990s but gandel kept on collecting lacquerware although it irked her that the holy grail of kai awase eluded her advertisement i would see pairs of shells come up for sale but never complete sets she says i figured if you re going to do something do it properly so i asked john we ve never bought a piece we didn t both like and i got his blessing to commission one we head downstairs to eat where gandel generously offers the interstate visitor the seat looking out to the ngv s sculpture garden she tells me she just bought a sculpture by american street artist kaws for her family s sculpture garden at their point leo retreat only to take delivery and realise it couldn t be kept outside luckily there s enough room in the homestead for it to be displayed inside as soon as a bespoke cabinet is made for it pauline gandel in 1996 sebastian costanzo but it s japanese art that is gandel s abiding passion it all started with her father wolf brown a polish jewish emigre who fled the pogroms of europe to land in melbourne in 1933 he juggled odd jobs while he learnt english then worked in the fashion trade to provide for the four daughters that came along gandel remembers her two elder sisters going to state schools but by the time it was her turn there was enough money to send her to methodist ladies college that s progress but of course kids today want instant progress she says what brown lacked in disposable income he made up for with what gandel calls a keen eye and an astounding ability to select eminent pieces of art among all the arthur boyds the ancient kai oke or trending street artists in gandel s collection it is three small satsuma bowls given to her by her father on his deathbed that she treasures most advertisement the house i grew up in had japanese screens chinese bowls things dad found in melbourne and liked the look of she says they just clicked into our way of life and have ever since sushi would be the best food match for this conversation but garden s french inspired offerings look as lavish as any gold lacquered clamshell i opt to start with another mollusc the braised burgundy snails followed by a venison loin while gandel chooses the goat s cheese souffle no garnish please and a daily special a risotto with chorizo she shares that another of her art mentors was perhaps the ultimate mentor her father s brother joseph brown a trained artist who in 1967 opened an eponymous gallery on collins street and built what at the time was australia s finest collection of colonial art he donated 160 works worth 35 million to the ngv before his death in 2009 the ritualised process of the tea ceremony has had a profound influence on the history of japanese art and craft and on me says pauline gandel arsineh houspian but aside from her father s amateur eye for the orient the initial draw for gandel to japan was her father s first cousin michael braun he was a lawyer sent to tokyo by the us government to defend accused war criminals during america s post war occupation of the vanquished axis power braun stayed in japan establishing one of its first foreign owned law firms and in 1961 gandel and john went to visit just four years into their enduring marriage having taken over the management of sussan from his parents in 1950 alongside brother in law marc besen john was still investing profits back into the businesses to build them up and gandel recalls there wasn t much spending money left after airfares we did it on a shoestring but even the cheap hotels had tv which i remember was an eye opener she says advertisement john and i would watch rin tin tin in japanese gandel experienced her first traditional tea ceremony on that trip and rates its impact on her as second only to building her lacquerware collection the ritualised process of the tea ceremony has had a profound influence on the history of japanese art and craft and on me she says she became a long term melbourne chapter president of the japanese urasenke tea society on a subsequent visit to kyoto a descendant of 17th century tea master furuta oribe did the gandels the honour of inviting them to each paint a tea bowl this revelation invites the unlikely image of john gandel the hard nosed landlord last seen butting heads with solomon lew over pandemic rents daubing away at a piece of volcanic clay but one needn t imagine it the gandel bowls apparently remain on display at the museum to this day next to one painted by former us secretary of state henry kissinger the tea ceremony is everything that s great about japan the importance of respect and the valuing of tranquillity and stability she says although i do worry that the thing holding it all together is the emperor and what happens as the young people there change their attitude to the royal family advertisement one senses another allegory to explore but with our meals dispatched there s no time to order a pot of tea and talk further gandel has a state funeral to get to golden shells and the gentle mastery of japanese lacquer is at the national gallery of victoria until april 18 next year the bill

most voters think that president joe biden and democrats have accomplished less than expected in their year in power a new poll found the poll conducted by morning consult and politico found that 42 of registered voters believe president biden has accomplished less than expected while 41 think congressional democrats have accomplished less than they expected in contrast 11 think president biden accomplished more than expected and 10 think that of democrats on capitol hill and 38 said biden was right about where they expected him while 32 said that of democrats the poll came as senator joe manchin effectively killed biden s signature build back better legislation saying on sunday he was a no vote in the 50 50 senate biden needs every democratic vote for his 1 75 trillion package of social safety net programs biden and his democrats did rack up two major legislative victories they passed a 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief package in march and a 1 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package last month most voters think that president joe biden and democrats have accomplished less than expected in their year in power a new poll found meanwhile biden insisted on tuesday that he and manchin would get something done on his build back better bill but he didn t go into details and insisted he didn t hold a grudge against the west virginia senator for sounding the death knell to his signature legislation senator manchin and i are going to get something done biden said on tuesday at the white house after his remarks on the omicron variant and the covid pandemic some people think maybe i m not irish because i don t hold a grudge but i want to get things done said biden when asked whether the west virginia democrat broke a commitment to him i still think there s a possibility of getting build back better done manchin in a shocking announcement on fox news sunday said he was a no on biden s social safety net legislation leading to an uproar of the administration and democrats on capitol hill some of whom accused the senator of betraying them biden also indicated manchin took fault for what happened the president said that had been told manchin was speaking to the liberal caucus in the house and said joe biden didn t mislead you i misled you it was unclear what meeting biden was referring to the white house later clarified biden s remarks the president was underlining that constructive and respectful conversations are happening in good faith between himself senator manchin and other lawmakers said spokesman andrew bates however the president wanted to clarify that senator manchin did not characterize himself as having been misleading the president looks forward to continuing to work together with senator manchin and his colleagues in the senate and house to address shared priorities based on common values he added manchin did call rep pramila jayapal the chairwoman of the house progressive caucus on monday morning where she claims she laid into him i do believe the president when he said to us and to me personally that he got a commitment from senator manchin or would have to go back on his word jayapal told reporters on monday afternoon and obviously yesterday the senator took the latter path and went back on this word that lack of integrity is stunning in a town where people say the only thing that you have is your word she added she said essentially the same to the west virginia senator when he called her there is nothing i have said here that i didn t say to him jayapal said and you will remember that i have not said anything against him all these months because i believed he was negotiating in good faith president joe biden insisted that he and joe manchin would get something done on his build back better bill president biden said he does not hold a grudge against senator joe manchin above biden meanwhile on tuesday launched an impassioned defense of his 1 75 trillion package of education health and climate programs he said it would help the economy and drive down inflation all the talk about how my build back better plan was going to increase inflation causing debts and the like what happened goldman sachs and others said if we don t pass build back better we re in trouble because it s going to grow the economy without it he said and what happened stock prices went way down he said his plan would help bring down the costs for the working class and middle class helping with childcare costs and prescription drug costs i m not joking about this he said all the things in that bill are going to reduce prices and costs for middle class and working class people it s going to reduce their costs what s inflation having to pay more than the money you have because things have gone up well it bring down all those costs across the board he said manchin said one of the reasons he couldn t support biden s bill is he was worried about inflation biden s hopeful words on his legislation came a day after white house press secretary jen psaki offered a dramatic change in tone when speaking about manchin calling him a longtime friend of biden s and saying the administration is ready to work like hell to pass the president s signature legislation her friendly words were a 180 from 24 hours earlier when psaki slammed manchin following his shocking announcement on fox news sunday that he would not vote for biden s 1 75 trillion build back better legislation psaki essentially called manchin a liar who had betrayed the white house in a statement on sunday afternoon but on monday she said the president and his team were moving forward and i think senator manchin had a strong statement yesterday and we had a strong statement as well and we re ready to move forward and get this done and work like hell to do that with senator manchin with members of the democratic caucus across the democratic party and that s our focus psaki said at the daily white house press briefing she called her harsh sunday statement a statement of facts of the events of what happened over the last few weeks and it was simply an effort to make that clear to the american people president biden sees the west virginia senator as a longtime friend she said he considers senator manchin a longtime friend and our focus is on moving forward and getting this done she declined to say if biden and manchin have spoken since the two men spoke sunday night politico reported and their talk ended with the sense that negotiations would resume in january white house press secretary jen psaki on monday offered a dramatic change in tone when speaking about senator joe manchin manchin did not inform biden of his decision to vote no less than 30 minutes before his announcement one of his aides was told to give the white house and congressional leadership a heads up politico s playbook reported we tried to head him off a senior white house official said claiming manchin refused to take a call from white house staff before the interview manchin was also said to be furious at a thursday statement from the white house where biden conceded his legislation was stalled in the senate and named manchin three times he hinted at his fury when reporters on capitol hill asked if he agreed with the statement that was his statement he said thursday of biden the senator was given a head s up by the white house on the statement and that his name would be in it but he asked he not be called out because of the continual harassment he and his family have been receiving from protesters politico reported but the statement went out with his name in it manchin snapped at white house aides and told them that he was done negotiating which the administration interpreted as talks would resume in the new year instead of manchin went on fox news and announced his no vote psaki also wouldn t comment on reports that manchin made the administration a counter offer on biden s legislation i m just not going to assess or give you an update on specifics from here she said manchin reportedly told the white house he could support a 1 8 trillion package that included universal pre kindergarten for 10 years an expansion of obamacare and hundreds of billions of dollars to combat climate change the washington post reported but manchin could not support an extension of the expanded child tax credit which biden and many democrats support seeing it as a way to raise children out of poverty the huffington post reported that manchin told several of his fellow democrats that he thought parents would waste the money on drugs instead citing two sources familiar with the senator s comments manchin s communications director sam runyon told dailymail com that the senator supports the child tax credit senator manchin has made clear he supports the child tax credit and believes the money should be targeted to those who need it most he has also expressed support for a paid leave program that has a dedicated sustainable funding mechanism runyon said he did not address the allegations in the huffington post report meanwhile manchin tore into white house staff and his fellow democrats on monday blaming them for his decision not to support biden s build back better legislation he accused democrats of badgering him and beating the living crap out of him as they tried to get his vote and he said white house staff know the real reason he said he wouldn t vote for biden s 1 75 trillion package of social safety net programs they know the real reason what happened they won t tell you and i m not going to manchin told west virginia radio host hoppy kercheval about biden s staff psaki in her press briefing didn t offer her thoughts on what manchin meant in his comments about white house staff saying the senator should answer that in the radio interview the senator from west virginia was careful not to blame president biden who had spoken personally to manchin several times last week but his strong words about biden s staff indicate relations are not good between him and the white house it s not the president manchin said it s the staff and they drove some things and they put some things out that were absolutely inexcusable they know what it is and that s it he said he was at his wit s end but he didn t specify what exactly drove him to that point manchin also had tough words for democratic leaders senate democratic leader chuck schumer and speaker nancy pelosi had personally negotiated with him they figured surely to god we can move one person sure that we can badger and beat one person up surely we can get enough protestors to make that person uncomfortable enough they ll just say okay i ll vote for anything just quit he said referencing protesters who swarmed his houseboat on the potomac river and waited for him outside the capitol building i m from west virginia i m not from where they re from and they can t just beat the living crap out of people and think they ll be submissive period he added

as montana s tally of new covid 19 cases neared 1 000 each day in september shelly stanley lehman worried about when the virus would reach her day care in billings she wanted to have covid tests on hand to help prevent an outbreak from sweeping through her business but stores were sold out she spent days making calls and searching online when stanley lehman finally got her hands on a box of tests later that month it was too late a child s family member unknowingly infected had exposed the day care to covid the virus quickly spread to four others including kids and staffers we got the tests just in time to close down stanley lehman said rapid antigen tests for covid have emerged as a public health tool that can help keep schools and businesses open they are less accurate than polymerase chain reaction tests known as pcr tests which must be sent to a laboratory for results however the rapid tests turnaround time of as little as 15 minutes can spot cases early and through quarantines and isolation prevent infected people from spreading the virus at schools businesses and other workplaces but a box containing two at home binaxnow tests made by abbott laboratories costs 24 at a retail pharmacy and they are often in short supply the tests are much more accessible for those who are part of montana s state run free rapid test distribution program which gives away at least two types of binaxnow rapid antigen tests and a third non antigen test called abbott id now from the same manufacturer abbott this fall the state delivered as many as 113 000 antigen tests to hospitals health clinics government offices local health departments and others but communication on how to access tests has been inconsistent such as with certain detention centers and child care providers while some jails are screening symptomatic inmates with tests from their local public health department other law enforcement officials hadn t heard of the availability of the state s rapid tests at all tina bets his medicine assistant to the sheriff in roosevelt county said jail staffers there had not received rapid tests from the state or been trained on how to use them we re definitely interested she said that would eliminate some problems for us because we certainly don t want people sick in our jail the state has communicated with schools and local health officials about the program but it hasn t been more broadly publicized in the past two years of the state s covid 19 public service announcements none advertise a supply of rapid binaxnow tests or explain how to apply for shipments eligibility requirements for the free tests can be complex some school districts are ordering recurring shipments of tests for students and staff members but private child care centers and private employers have to obtain a federal waiver to administer certain kinds of tests and others who are eligible either don t know about the tests don t want them or are stretched too thin to add another burdensome covid task the result is an uneven distribution of the state s free tests state officials cited several reasons for that including the federal waiver restrictions a limited national supply chain also means officials must prioritize recipients but some public health officials see the gaps in test distribution as another indicator of an overwhelmed and under resourced public health system drenda niemann lewis and clark county s public health officer said many children and families in her county can get tested through school districts while other residents have few options when pharmacies sell out it s really hit or miss and we re just doing the best with the resources that we have niemann said there s no consistency it s really hit or miss and we re just doing the best with the resources that we have montana s department of public health and human services said it distributed nearly 550 000 binaxnow rapid tests from october 2020 through this october dphhs sent 45 of those to hospitals and health clinics according to a montana free press and khn analysis of the state s data an additional 13 or about 73 000 tests went to assisted living and long term care facilities but only 5 or 26 500 tests went to a category titled other which includes group homes services for people with disabilities and child care centers that comes to slightly more than 70 tests a day for that entire category statewide during the same period fewer than 2 of all tests distributed approximately 11 000 went to dozens of state corrections facilities and jails other states comparatively have swung open the gates to testing tennessee created a program for interested businesses to obtain covid test kits free of charge with guidelines on how to qualify colorado is shipping binaxnow rapid tests directly to homes free of charge around the washington d c region libraries offer them at no cost both the trump and biden administrations have encouraged widespread distribution of rapid tests the biden administration aims to boost testing by increasing supplies to 200 million rapid tests a month in an ideal world you would have readily available testing much like we see in countries in europe where families can get 10 tests a day for their home said michael osterholm director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota in ordering abbott binaxnow tests montana is careful not to stockpile more than it can deliver before the tests expire after 12 months it sent 51 200 tests to colorado in may that were close to their expiration date the state doesn t track how many tests go unused after they ve been distributed montana gov greg gianforte spokesperson brooke stroyke said that testing is an important component of the state s pandemic response and that the state distributes tests to eligible vulnerable and underserved populations based on local health officials input after all local leaders know the needs of their communities best stroyke said missoula county is using rapid abbott id now tests the third kind of rapid covid test the state is distributing the abbott id now is not an antigen test but a molecular test similar to pcr tests the state has distributed an average of 3 120 of those tests a month those tests can be more reliable county officials said brian chaszar its covid 19 operations section chief said his county has access to plenty of tests and is able to get the word out about what s available he said some businesses and groups are bound to get missed in a large county and not every place will opt to receive tests whether it s because of the workload or potential backlash against covid precautions particularly in some school districts i have no envy for principals of those schools chaszar said some parents really want masking and testing other parents want to have nothing to do with it and refuse to participate in it with the rise of the contagious delta variant this fall the state increased distribution of tests to public and private k 12 schools that asked for them we would like as many k 12 schools to tap into these resources to help schools to stay open and be safe todd harwell the state health department s public health and safety administrator wrote in a september email to local and tribal health officials but dphhs spokesperson jon ebelt said supplying rapid tests directly to private businesses is complicated by federal regulations that require each business to receive a waiver to administer them ebelt said most of the state distributed tests are tethered by those federal rules which he said offer better reporting and quality control and are less expensive one of the two types of antigen tests the state receives from abbott doesn t need a federal waiver but it has a far more limited supply of them since june the state has doled out about 18 000 of those at home tests ebelt said the state s limited stock of the less regulated at home tests has been prioritized for other entities such as local health departments we were very concerned that we would not be able to secure enough tests from our supplier to expand distribution ebelt said although some businesses such as child care providers could apply for federal waivers to access more tests ebelt said dphhs did not think that was the best route because of the additional work for those already understaffed groups one former dphhs official disagreed with the department s interpretation of federal rules jim murphy formerly the state s lead epidemiologist said the state could find a way to distribute tests to day cares and other businesses if it provided proper training and oversight ideally murphy said the public health philosophy for navigating the pandemic should be focused on solutions rather than hurdles we shouldn t find obstacles here he said we should find ways to get these tests in the right hands one workaround offered by health officials in montana has been to connect child care centers with a federal pcr testing initiative operated through the u s department of health and human services the same program stanley lehman of billings used to order tests for her child care facility ebelt said the department knew of nine montana child care providers that had signed up to work with that program by early november as of this year montana had nearly 1 200 licensed child care facilities montanans access to tests varies by county partly because of how many tests local officials request and how they are used joe russell health officer for the flathead city county health department said that he knows people are struggling to find tests but that it s not all on the state to advertise that tests are available sometimes it will fall to us the county and sometimes it s the responsibility of the business you know to push forward and ask russell said

on july 8 1999 i announced the launch of dick smith foods with a full page advertisement in the australian financial review newspaper i said that i wanted to set up a food company which used only australian food that was processed in australia creating jobs for australians and keeping profits in australia and paying full tax in australia about this time i noticed paul newman s own salad dressing in our pantry the label said 100 of profits go to charity i thought well i ve done pretty well and i don t really need to make any more money so why not do the same my plan was to start with an aussie version of vegemite which i decided to call ozemite then move on to other products where i could support australian manufacturers and growers in fact ozemite took many years to perfect it was so difficult to get the taste similar to vegemite in fact i wanted it to taste like the vegemite that i knew as a kid as kraft had changed the formula several times without telling anyone dick smith peanut butter was made by the small aussie company green s foods virginia star while working on the ozemite formula i decided to go ahead with other products the first one being peanut butter australia s bestseller kraft peanut butter was owned by kraft in the usa and every cent of the wealth creation headed off to the northern hemisphere hayley came and worked for me in getting dick smith foods going it was great to have her ideas and i really enjoyed working with her i managed to get a small aussie company called green s foods to make a special peanut butter for dick smith foods it used australian grown peanuts from kingaroy and was produced by aussie workers in the green s factory in the western suburbs of sydney i really enjoyed going to the factory with hayley to watch the peanut butter being produced and then flying to kingaroy to talk to the farmers who grew the peanuts it gave me immense satisfaction within two years we had quite a range of products from peanut butter to cordial canola oil cheese helicopter jelly biscuits tomato and barbecue sauce jam and even ice cream all under the dick smith foods name i was proud to be supporting australian farmers and giving jobs to australians i thought that if we could get just 5 per cent of australians to buy our locally made and locally owned foods it would make a huge difference we could employ tens of thousands of australians and fight back against global food companies that were sending their profits overseas extreme capitalism dick smith foods was able to give australian farmers and producers business at a retail level of nearly 500 million most importantly we were able to donate over 11 million to charity including the country women s association the salvation army st vincent de paul and mission australia in the end i was forced to close down dick smith foods because we simply couldn t compete with foreign owned companies like aldi and costco these companies are incredibly shrewd but i don t understand their greed for example aldi is owned by two super secretive german billionaires who are worth more than 40 billion why would they want any more money i am sure they haven t come to australia for charitable reasons but here they are in australia with an incredibly successful german formula advertisement basically they employ half as many staff as traditional australian food retailers whereas the australian owned woolworths and coles supermarkets spend about 8 per cent of their turnover in paying aussie wages with aldi it is about 4 per cent in effect if woolworths and coles want to compete on price they will have to sack half of their staff that s over 150 000 australians losing their jobs our peanut butter produced in australia from aussie peanuts was selling for over a dollar more than aldi s peanut butter why were they so cheap they were really astute i call it extreme capitalism aldi grew its peanuts in argentina and made its peanut butter there too as farm and factory workers receive very low wages i couldn t believe that even some of my wealthy friends loved and supported aldi in fact aldi was voted as the most trusted brand in australia even ahead of qantas while being at the same time the most profitable supermarket as well as the cheapest there is no doubt in my mind that they are the smartest and most ruthless retailers in the world but with the advantage of the cheaper prices globalisation offers you also get the disadvantage that our wonderful aussie owned and made products and the jobs they create will disappear dick smith announced in july 2018 that he would be closing down his eponymous food company james brickwood to keep our products on the shelves the supermarkets said we had to have at least a 3 per cent market share but when aldi started selling everything cheaper we didn t even have that and the writing was on the wall for us i do wonder how the aussie owned companies will ever compete in the long term at least woolworths and coles are on the stock exchange so australians can share in their wealth creation you can t do that with aldi in 2017 there was a ray of sunshine when bega cheese bought vegemite from kraft bringing the iconic brand back home i was delighted when i heard the news after all kraft s ownership of vegemite had triggered my move to start dick smith foods i hoped that my publicising the fact that vegemite was foreign owned played a part in bringing it back to australia i felt as if things had come full circle finally in july 2018 i announced that i would be closing down dick smith foods i held a press conference to announce the closure and found it impossible to hold back the tears well it s terrible on a personal level i said because even though i m glad to have done 19 years of business i failed i said i would keep your jobs i couldn t it s beyond me wealth disparity two years later as the covid 19 pandemic swept around the globe the importance of retaking control of australia s food security was clear hopefully new energetic entrepreneurs will take on the challenge and bring food production back home despite dick smith foods closing down or maybe because of it i found myself getting more and more concerned about the wealth disparity in australia i wasn t alone advertisement in april 2017 bernie fraser the former governor of the reserve bank had said australia is approaching a danger point where the gap between rich and poor becomes so vast it could have awful far reaching consequences at every level in australian society oxfam released a report saying that australia s wealthiest 1 per cent owned more than the 17 million aussies 70 per cent who were the least wealthy almost 5 million of the poorest were living from pay cheque to pay cheque without any savings at all i found this very worrying i d been brought up believing that australia was the country of the fair go not just for the wealthy but for everyone though i d started out with little i was now one of the wealthiest 1 per cent that didn t make me feel good in 2018 i set up the dick smith fair go group the aim was simple to work towards an economy that benefits everyone not just the 1 per cent enabling more young aussies to have a full time career and so older aussies can afford to keep warm in winter despite a major television and radio campaign which encouraged 62 000 people to join us we had little effect on the political parties dick smith electronics was liquidated in 2016 with the loss of 2460 jobs jason south one of my failed ideas was that the wealthiest 1 per cent should pay 15 per cent more tax which would be used to assist the less well off not one politician dared show any support for my idea i believe that we have to do something about the impossibility of endless economic growth it won t be easy because all public companies are under pressure from their investors to grow exponentially in fact it was this very pressure that eventually destroyed dick smith electronics after i sold dse to woolworths they ran it for over 29 years making good profits and ultimately generating in annual turnover of 1 6 billion and employing thousands of aussies dse s original success was based on selling high margin but low cost products to electronic enthusiasts given our population i always thought it had the potential to open a maximum of 100 shops in australia but because the woolworths board was under continuous pressure to grow the business they eventually opened 350 stores and started selling low margin products like tv sets in so called dick smith powerhouse superstores but ultimately the business no longer generated a never ending growth in profits in 2012 dse was sold to anchorage capital a private equity firm for 115 million but it appears that anchorage only ever stumped up 10 million in cash in what the media called the greatest equity heist of all time anchorage floated the company two years later at a market value of 520 million it soon became unprofitable and after two years the public company went into liquidation shedding 2460 workers and owing creditors 260 million so sad and so unnecessary i thought on the positive side i know it employed and trained many thousands of australians some still stop me in the street and tell me it was the start of their successful career that makes me feel good advertisement what s a philanthropit when i was young sir edward hallstrom was always in the news he was a public benefactor and ran a company making silent knight refrigerators he was called a philanthropist my mother told me years later that one day i said to her what s a philanthropit not being able to say it correctly because of my speech defect she said oh that s a person who has done well and gives money away to important causes she said that i replied if ever i do well i m going to become one of those i made my first donation when i was at the dick smith building at gore hill i had received a letter from a dr tony kidman who was across the road at the place where i d trained for my electronics certificate the year after i left school he was doing research into muscular dystrophy and i think i gave about 10 000 towards it tony s letter seeking support inspired me and i was pleased to help over the coming years looking back i m certain my scout training had ingrained in me the importance of helping others when you can pip and i have gained much happiness through sharing our good fortune with others but in truth my philanthropy has always been for quite selfish reasons that is it is self satisfying it makes me feel good and allows me not to feel too guilty about the wealth i have compared with many people we have a family foundation that gives money away at least 1 million a year to important charities like the muscular dystrophy association of new south wales the salvation army and life education it s quite separate from the dick smith foods donations while i look on the charitable donations as fulfilling an obligation i m not opposed to having fun while raising money for a worthwhile cause one of the best money raising ideas i have ever had was the bourke to burketown bash car trial when i was young and living in roseville chase the redex trials went through roseville i remember going with my cousin bob to watch the cars screaming through along the pacific highway i thought one day i am going to go on the redex trial by the time i got my driving licence the redex trials were no more so i came up with the idea of starting a type of redex trial but with a fun twist cheating lying and conniving would be allowed and encouraged to stop my wealthy friends from showing off with the latest in expensive four wheel drives i said that all vehicles must be of low value and at least 20 years old and any entrants who were judged by me to be taking the trial too seriously would have points deducted points would also be deducted for cheating however the entrant judged the greatest cheat at the finish would be given extra points as with my antarctic flights i decided that the trial should raise money for charity and chose variety australia which helps underprivileged children the first bourke to burketown bash started from the sydney opera house on june 1 1985 it included a bbc film crew and famous people like john newcombe john singleton and his wife ex miss world belinda green as drivers we had a total of 52 cars altogether i was the chief judge scrutineer and mischief maker anyone could bribe me to come first on a particular section as long as the cheque was written out to variety on that first bash we raised over two hundred thousand dollars tony hasham the chief barker at variety at the time took on the idea and organised that the bash would continue there have now been over 30 bashes and they have raised over 200 million for this important children s charity i m surprised that with some honourable exceptions many wealthy australians are reluctant to be involved in charitable work from what i can see wealthy australians lack the tradition of many successful americans who feel an obligation to openly give back to society i have attempted to get the publishers of the rich lists to show the record on charitable giving for each entry they have refused claiming it will offend too many people this is an edited extract from my adventurous life by dick smith allen unwin

it relied on some of the biggest brands in global finance hsbc citi ubs nomura and pimco and even australia s infrastructure giant ifm investors however the financial regulator and the police claim that behind the brands are several local identities who appear to be linked to a uk based operation that has taken more than 100 million from victims in the past two years for the purposes of this story some victims names have been changed among the australians under suspicion are an american born consultant who lives in sydney s woolloomooloo a greek food importer in melbourne an iraqi born builder in western sydney and a victorian barrister a page from the bogus ifm prospectus showing the company s chief risk officer outlining consumer protections working out how the whole operation fits together turned into a six month chase by a team of investigators at the australian securities and investments commission one that ended in urgent efforts to arrange travel bans and dramatic dawn raids but it began with an email to the australian financial review newsroom in the slow days of january between new year and australia day at the start of this year anatomy of a scam have you seen this read the january 13 email from one of our market sources attached was a 27 page prospectus issued by big australian asset manager ifm investors for a high yield fixed rate corporate bond that promised excellent returns they ranged from 4 62 per cent over one year up to 9 34 per cent if you invested for 10 years advertisement the professional looking documents were replete with ifm s branding the company s correct australian business number address and infographics identical to those used on the asset managers website the forms listed the ways you could complain to regulators including the australian prudential regulation authority and the australian financial complaints authority suncorp it said would provide further insurance if the defaulted amount could not be covered by ifm furthermore it claimed up to 250 000 a person was covered under the financial claims scheme it even included a picture of chief executive david neal the former head of australia s future fund and his signature next to a note for readers we understand how important it is in these challenging times to source the safest and most profitable investments for our clients with our world class leadership teams and focus on sustainable investments we are confident we are at the forefront of investing for the australian people ifm chief executive david neal appears in the fraudulent documents at the same time the financial review was reviewing the documents sarah a prospective retail investor across town in sydney had been speaking to her accountant about investing in the ifm bond after receiving the prospectus by email sarah s accountant however was sceptical he knew that union and employer backed industry fund ifm managed money on behalf of big superannuation and pension funds not on behalf of mum and dad punters he suggested sarah should ring ifm directly using the phone number listed on the public website rather than the number attached to the prospectus after talking to the ifm security team who were alarmed they were being used as a front for frauds sarah shared a copy of the prospectus with the company allowing them to confirm it was indeed a fake as ifm alerted asic and the australian cyber security centre to the discovery and began drawing up an online warning one that remains on the company s website to this day the ifm public affairs team was on the phone to the financial review fielding the same questions their security team had been asked by sarah advertisement we soon realised that ifm was not alone going global we began to discover similar bogus prospectuses purporting to have been issued by some of the biggest global names in institutional finance some were sent by victims who read our stories others were passed to us by confused fund managers here was one from citi if you looked hsbc had just issued a consumer alert pimco had been hit too if it was a trusted brand it was likely that criminals were about to exploit it just recently suncorp issued a warning that members of the public were being asked to invest in fake suncorp bonds and urged victims to contact asic it may seem far fetched that millions can be magnetised to crooks via investment prospectuses that can be debunked by a rudimentary review but the bogus bond scam has flourished at a time when retirees and other investors are awash with money and have diminishing options to get a yield on their cash it s a cataclysm supercharged by the 30 per cent of australians who are functionally illiterate on financial matters a well oiled superannuation system that delivers enormous lump sums at the end of the accumulation process and the growing dearth of cheap and reliable personal financial advice unwitting investors have turned en masse to the internet to see where they should park their life savings when covid 19 struck big economies and as interest rates plummeted around the world more consumers sought better returns outside the risk free term deposit market where rates are lower than inflation australian securities and investments commission deputy chairman karen chester has warned consumers to be wary of incredible promises alex ellinghausen a few weeks after we reported on the fake ifm prospectus australian securities and investments commission deputy chairman karen chester issued a public warning that the bogus bond funds scam had raised millions in a matter of months asic said at the time it had identified two imposter operations targeting investors in australia and the uk offering returns that were obviously too good to be true advertisement the same day the uk s financial conduct authority fca sounded the klaxon on the attack of the clone firms more than 78 million 145 million had been stolen over the 2020 calendar year by scammers impersonating big financial institutions it said at the time chester said prospectuses offering incredible returns in the prevailing economic environment were likely to be just that incredible despite these warnings novice punters were being lured into financial markets between march and april last year clone firm investment scams in the uk surged 29 per cent here according to the australian competition and consumer commission losses to scams nearly doubled to 211 million over the past year the confidence of investors does not match their abilities although 75 per cent felt confident enough to spot a scam only one in five could identify a clone firm scam according to the fca authorities are hamstrung by the mobility of the criminal syndicates that operate these networks of fake comparison websites produce fraudulent documentation and coax unsuspecting investors into handing over their savings it is whack a mole writ large and the victims are continuing to pile up compliance department a day before we discovered the fake ifm prospectus rodrigo garcia was speaking to jordan vice president of fixed income and electronic trading at global investment bank nomura garcia had looked up jordan s public linkedin profile while on the phone jordan s british accent was a little strange given the asian face looking back at him on the linkedin profile but he didn t completely suspect the man on the other end of the line was not the real jordan yes well i was brought up in the uk jordan explained i went to high school and university in the uk my wife is australian she is from adelaide in hong kong most of the team there is british and many of them don t want to go back to the uk so some come to australia they don t want to go back to the wet and rain a slide from the fake nomura prospectus that day january 12 this year he was running garcia through the protections offered to investors in nomura s high yield fixed income bond advertisement in terms of life insurance we have to make sure that we are legally obligated to pay out to our investors if anything happens to our company jordan told his customer funds in your own investments stay in australia to make sure you are covered as an investor he said after explaining that garcia would have to nominate a beneficiary if anything were to happen to his health and detailing the flexibility nomura offered with several investment options due to the ongoing volatility in the global economy the imposter banker described how he would soon transfer garcia to an internal compliance officer to go through the application process that ensured all client funds were protected just for recorded line purposes jordan continued because we report to asic to make sure we adhere to all of our regulatory and legal requirements the main reason you must speak to an internal compliance officer is just to make sure that i haven t pressured you or misinformed you about the product ok scammers promised unrealistically high returns foreshadowing the rest of the process garcia was told that once the compliance officer was happy with his proof of identification a photocopied driver s licence or passport proof of address within the last three months and proof that the money in garcia s bank account to be invested was actually his it would take between two hours and 24 hours to open the segregated bank account into which his deposit would be made it sounded like a tool of legitimacy but in reality the segregated account was a ruse i don t know if you remember what happened with the 2008 financial crash do you jordan asked maybe you can remind me garcia responded well what happened with the mortgage financial crisis when the markets completely fell if you remember lehman brothers was that they were taking client funds with their own legal banking account jordan explained advertisement so when lehman brothers went bust client funds went up in smoke ever since then the fcs has put in protections so that you re covered by our segregated adi account which is valued up to 10 million those rules are put in place by our financial institution so that all client funds regardless of the amount must be kept separate from our operating company account hence why you are insured up to 10 million but also by the fcs for up to 250 000 we ve got to make sure we put in security twice there jordan transferred garcia to his internal compliance colleague nigel and hold music played over the phone line for what seemed like an interminable four minutes is that you mr garcia you ve come through to nigel in our compliance department a different british accented voice came over the phone i hear you re looking to move forward with one of our fixed rate bonds is that right excellent before they got started nigel who is not the same real life nigel who is a compliance officer in nomura s hong kong office told garcia that all calls to the compliance department were recorded and monitored follow the money garcia came to the fake compliance department as the other victims did with a simple google search for fixed rate bonds or high yield investments such an internet search returned top results for google adwords supported comparison websites such as compare investments com au or investmentcompare com au which claim to offer investors unusually high yields fraudulent websites such as compareauinvestments com au have exploited the powerful reach of search engines allowing scammers to commit identity theft on an industrial scale although the websites claim to be registered to generic company names a cursory background check shows these corporate names are unrelated to the websites the pty ltd names have been hijacked just like the brands of nomura and others the stated locations offered as the headquarters for these websites are also real world locations but calls to building managers reveals the companies were never tenants advertisement google has proven an effective way for crooks to attract investors fund promoters have paid google about 7 a click to run digital campaigns targeting small investors when a consumer enters their contact details into a comparison website fraudsters have a handy email list to which they can send professional looking prospectuses armed with copies of identity documents scammers have all they need to open a bank account in the name of their victim all without their knowledge depositing funds into these supposed segregated bank accounts through a normal bpay transfer the money can then be accessed immediately by the fraudsters and transferred to a safe haven putting it beyond the reach of australian authorities another fake investment comparison website fin astra com that acts as a front door to shunt prospective investors into fraudulent products through fintech payment companies aside from garcia dozens of victims who lost money on fake nomura bonds or fake pimco bonds have been detailed in a charge sheet submitted by strike force tallagandra in sydney s downing centre court late last month allegations submitted to the local court show the desperation of the mainly retired victims michael s 50 000 bet on nomura on january 22 kathleen punting 90 000 on february 8 ray dropped 500 000 on nomura on february 19 alan the same day invested 200 000 in pimco a week later stephen sank 500 000 into pimco these transactions police allege in court documents are tied to richard emile ayoub who was arrested last month by nsw police which raided his apartment and seized electronic devices and documents he was charged with 13 counts of obtaining benefit by deception and 13 counts of recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime and has been refused bail after he did not enter a plea advertisement that followed a joint investigation between state and federal police forces and asic which began in march this year less than two weeks after the financial review detailed the intricate workings of the fake bond scam according to his sworn affidavit in separate civil proceedings asic senior investigator michael bridge discovered mid way through this year that among the bank accounts suspected of moving money in the scam were a number of accounts operated by bassilios bill floropoulos a little known melbourne based greek food importer and dimitrios james podaridis a victorian barrister these accounts appeared to be taking money from investors seeking high yield bond funds and shifting that cash into cryptocurrency platforms with so many accounts tied to so many different names is it any wonder that at first bridge believed that these men were also victims perhaps floropoulos and podaridis had also had their identities hijacked after investigating further bridge soon discovered that both men were probably directly dealing in the proceeds of crime the asic investigator recounted in a federal court affidavit lodged last month as far as the financial review can ascertain the duo have not been arrested but were expected to be interviewed by asic this month to continue the investigation asic sought emergency orders preventing their departure from australia the melbourne connection the global nature of the scam is a key matter in the case judging by the co ordinated warning issued by asic and its british counterpart in late january this year as well as the concerns raised by asic last month that podaridis and floropoulos could flee the country to prevent that happening an emergency travel ban was placed on both men last month podaridis was already well known to the regulator before he was suspected of involvement in the clone scam he was the sole director of pramana capital until may this year when he was disqualified by asic due to his involvement in two collapsed companies that owed as much as 1 7 million among the bank accounts suspected of moving money in the scam were accounts operated dimitrios james podaridis a victorian barrister in its decision to disqualify podaridis just a month before he became a suspect in the regulator s investigation of the bond scam asic said he breached record keeping obligations did not act with due care or diligence failed to monitor the companies affairs and does not adequately understand a director s duties advertisement but two months after his asic disqualification podaridis is believed by asic to have signed up as a director to pramana under a reversed name podaridis dimitrious podaridis lodged an appeal against his disqualification in august with the administrative appeals tribunal but no hearing date has been set according to the affidavit lodged by bridge in mid november asic found a bank account tied to a company owned by podaridis called pramana capital pty ltd that took in about 1 16 million from suspected bond scam victims in a period of just two weeks in early january of which almost half was immediately transferred through crypto platform protrade to an account in belgium the affidavit outlines that podaridis had also set up in september 2018 an account with foreign exchange operator afex under the pramana capital name which allegedly received multiple deposits last year from suspected victims of a separate fake bond scam run out of the uk internal afex emails seen by asic and referred to in court documents show that 145 000 270 000 that flowed into the pramana capital afex account was injected by suspected victims who believed they were making investments in high performing but safe bond funds victims who had tried to get their funds back from afex caused the company to question podaridis about why he was receiving the money although he told afex it was for bond purchases the melburnian later failed to produce adequate documentation when requested by afex the company then shut his account according to court documents however podaridis is alleged to have then remitted the remaining money to his pramana account held with national australia bank this account then transferred 800 000 1 5 million to a sterling denominated pramana account asic suspects this account may be connected to the uk bonds scam according to asic bank records indicate podaridis sent four parcels of 40 000 each to a recipient in the uk known as antonis antoniades and four payments totalling 18 000 to a cyprus company called d c and marchs ltd criminals are leveraging the cryptocurrency ecosystem to launder money ap it is alleged a further 420 000 was siphoned to belgium through crypto platforms and a further 300 000 has been shipped out of australia via foreign exchange firms advertisement the money coming in and money going out looked eerily familiar to bridge who had been chasing the bond scam for almost a year floropoulos a one time associate of podaridis also showed signs he was involved in the scam asic says after monitoring floropoulos for more than 150 days this year bridge and his team now believed they had learnt almost all there was to know about the melbourne based businessman they knew the 44 year old had been married to his wife nicky since november 2001 they knew he drove a 2021 nissan x trail and didn t own any property in his own name as well as floropoulos personal commonwealth bank account the investigators were also aware of a business account they say he held in the name of one of his former companies no moo floropoulos had resigned as a director of no moo pty ltd in january 2019 but on that same day his wife replaced him and took over as the authorised signatory for the company s transaction account asic makes no mention of nicky s involvement in any part of the alleged scam they also say floropoulos had curiously opened a series of accounts with cryptocurrency exchange operators such as binance on january 18 and bit trade a fortnight later on february 2 it was not long after these accounts were set up that investigators allege the no moo business transaction account received a parcel of funds worth 160 000 on february 25 from someone who later identified themselves to their bank as a victim of an investment scam two days after this money hit the no moo account parcels worth 50 000 and 85 000 were then moved to floropoulos personal account and then immediately into his bit trade account owned by us based crypto exchange kraken over the next two months asic says this pattern of transactions was repeated more than 1 4 million came through the front door of which 980 000 was washed through crypto platforms advertisement because asic s investigation is at an early stage we don t know how or if these men are connected to the british crooks working the phone lines but asic suspects both men may be connected to the global ring asic believes the scam that was set up to target people in the uk expanded to australia in september last year the financial review contacted the men or their legal representatives but has not received any responses alarm bells on april 13 this year darren from melbourne s glen waverley was contacted by sarah representing global bank hsbc and offering the high yield bond fund two days later john hsbc s australian head of global liquidity and cash management called darren to discuss the documents six days later darren had photocopied his identity document and bank details and transferred 200 000 to his segregated account the bank account into which darren transferred the money was not linked to any official hsbc investment it was the no moo transaction account this was how asic s bridge according to his affidavit discovered floropoulos could be involved in the scheme the melbourne based greek food importer was an extensive traveller he had travelled overseas seven times in both 2016 and 2017 and many times before that but after september 2017 floropoulos had not left the country after observing the man for some time asic was alarmed when floropoulos on october 19 this year booked a flight from melbourne to los angeles scheduled to leave the following month on sunday november 21 advertisement a fortnight later bridge was watching as floropoulos brought forward the date of his flight a week earlier but then just days out from his planned qantas flight he inexplicably canned the trip completely that was on november 8 and bridge held growing suspicions that floropoulos could try to leave australia at any moment putting the entire investigation in jeopardy the next day on tuesday november 9 asic applied for search warrants for several properties across victoria and nsw at 5 04pm on wednesday bridge raced to file an urgent ex parte application in the federal court seeking to prevent floropoulos and podaridis from leaving australia due to the latter s suspected centrality to the scam the regulator alleges podaridis and floropoulos operated or formed part of a criminal syndicate operating the bonds scam a sophisticated financial investment scam asic and the australian federal police were quietly planning a raid that friday morning on floropoulos property and property linked to podaridis about 1000 kilometres away on the same day nsw police arrested ayoub in his finger wharf apartment a week later fairfield police arrested claudyos isaac in edensor park in sydney s western suburbs isaac has since pleaded not guilty to recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime in for the kill two days after his first call rodrigo garcia was back on the phone to nigel in the compliance department having sent off his documentation overnight when he asked if nomura s office in melbourne was open for in person customer queries nigel told garcia that unlike the sydney office that was on skeleton staff the melbourne branch was closed i m not sure how long that will last because obviously it s a lot easier with everyone in the office he said we ll just see how it goes advertisement you haven t been caught up in the northern beaches lockdown garcia asked oh well everyone s been caught up in it but you can t have any financial institution just close completely a financial lockdown isn t going to be in anyone s interest garcia also wanted to press nigel over a strange document he had received overnight it was accompanied by a call from someone purporting to be from nomura but these nomura prospectus documents he received were in a different font and style to the ones he had earlier been sent it didn t look to be real and i was very much worried about talking to the guy and whether he was representing the real thing garcia told nigel after sending the document to nigel for immediate review nigel agreed with garcia that the document looked like a fake i ll find out more through our legal team nigel told him after garcia s apprehensions were assuaged nigel helped him navigate the bsb transfer to the segregated bank account that had been opened in his name with australian minnow lenders bnk bank and cuscal ltd a series of trading accounts were also opened with upstart payments and cryptocurrency services firms acce australia pty ltd trading as mine digital zerocap pty ltd and nebula payments pty ltd garcia s 200 000 was probably whisked away as soon as it hit the account advertisement but garcia was unaware of the invisible theft when less than a month later jordan from nomura had phoned garcia back with another enticing offer inter bank lending rates driven by the benchmark interest rate libor were about to be lowered even further jordan told garcia and if he wanted to protect more of his capital he could lock in a deal withhigher rates if he acted quickly when i ve got news coming across my desk i ve got to share it with all my clients and you re one of them rodrigo jordan said when interest rates are getting cut across the board libor rates won t stay at these levels forever after garcia quickly discussed the matter with his wife he agreed to another 200 000 deposit it wasn t until 10 days later on february 18 garcia noticed an advisory notice on the official nomura holdings website noting an unauthorised use of the nomura brand the extensive list of websites nomura identified in an attempt to fraudulently represent themselves as part of or linked to the nomura group worryingly included the one that was displayed on the prospectus garcia had used to invest garcia jumped on the phone to katy a woman with an upbeat british accent i work alongside nigel katy told garcia have you sent it to nigel already i m directly under him so i have access to his system it obviously sounds very worrying but by all means send it through we ll take a look and get back to you ok katy who was assuming the identity of the real life katy a compliance officer based in nomura s us office never got back to garcia and it s possible katy and her colleagues nigel and jordan were not in britain at all advertisement there is plenty of evidence of british backpackers working phones in scamming boiler rooms operating out of bangkok or hong kong in the late 1990s dozens of fast talking geezers were among about 80 people arrested in thailand in 2001 for cheating hundreds of investors out of about 200 million selling stocks that didn t exist to customers in anglophone countries members of the clone firm syndicate could be calling from anywhere in the world plenty of victims garcia wasn t the only victim the financial review spoke to dan a 31 year old salesman with a wife in early childhood education lost 140 000 representing most of the proceeds from the sale of their melbourne flat guided by the wisdom of the barefoot investor he researched long term investments on the internet dan also spoke to nigel from nomura who rang numerous times asking when the settlement from the apartment sale would come through a comparison website that acts as a trap for unsuspecting investors when dan s three month interest period lapsed without an interest payment he became panicked he d invested all his savings and his wife was pregnant there were also near misses marie was helping her elderly father from regional nsw squirrel away his savings but after talking to james from ubs asset management she started suspecting something was amiss after contacting the real ubs she discovered her father had fallen under the spell of a conman advertisement end game in his affidavit bridge says the bond scam continues to this day new fraudulent comparison websites continue to be promoted by google bogus prospectuses are continuing to find their way into inboxes across australia asic is continuing to identify new suspects and fraudulent bank accounts which have not been fully investigated garcia said he is ashamed to have fallen for the conmen but yeah they sure know what they are writing in those prospectuses he says suggesting the scammers have convincing familiarity with the financial sector and its jargon what he finds most troubling however is the fragmented investigation by authorities sometimes he hears back from the police or regulators other times he does not i guess at this stage it is unlikely i will see any form of recovery of what i have lost he told the financial review it also seems like these bad actors in the market remain very much alive and active i just got another call today
at first glance there isn t anything wrong with it the white paint finish looks very clean and so do the wheels brakes two tone black and red interior and engine everything lines up perfectly too so why is it accompanied by a salvage certificate the answer lies in the title because it has been flooded as usual copart couldn t be bothered with releasing any details about its damages stating only that it drives on its own or at least it did so when they took possession of it when the unfortunate incident happened the muscle car which was made in the second half of 2015 had a little over 14 600 miles 23 500 km under its belt the ad claims now if you re brave enough know your way around a car s electronics and are not afraid of a lot of elbow grease then maybe you could bring it back to its initial shine nevertheless before placing a bid we d recommend getting in touch with the vendor to find out whether it has been damaged by fresh water or salty water and maybe take a closer look at it in person to do so you will have to take a trip to houston texas as that is where you will find it alternatively you could get yourself a brand new challenger srt hellcat from dodge that works just fine from 61 850 excluding destination and handling the widebody version starts at 67 850 for the latest model year and for the redeye and redeye widebody you will have to pay at least 73 450 and 79 850 respectively the srt super stock sits at the top of the range with an msrp of 82 850

ford wants to be no 2 in evs within two years is that even possible ford motor company f 3 30 ceo jim farley has said he wants ford to be the second largest electric vehicle maker in the u s in two years behind only tesla tsla 2 03 is that realistic particularly in light of archrival general motors gm 1 73 plan to go very big on electric vehicles in this motley fool live video recorded on dec 9 industry focus host nick sciple and motley fool senior auto specialist john rosevear consider that question and whether ford might have or might not have set its sights unrealistically high 10 stocks we like better than ford when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and ford wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 16 2021 nick sciple they said earlier this week they have plans to become the no 2 ev maker there has been some reports globally some reports that they meant the u s but anyway within the next two years they want to become the no 2 ev maker obviously behind no 1 tesla what do you make of how this fits into ford s ev ambitions and i guess the prospects of them achieving that goal john rosevear well they re not going to become the no 2 ev maker in the world i don t think anybody thinks that for one thing volkswagen is ramping pretty aggressively in europe and china but it is possible that they could become the no 2 ev maker in the u s or in north america that would be more aggressive than ford has let on until recently they say now they want to make 600 000 evs a year in a couple of years that is significant i think what jim farley was saying when he first said this is we re getting out in front of gm which has of course gotten a lot of plaudits for its very ambitious ev plans i think farley s saying well we might outsell them in a couple of years or at least for a little while while they continue to ramp because ford looked for a long time like they were lagging gm on ramping up to aggressive levels of ev production but under farley over the last year and a couple of months they ve really changed that tune a bit it s just from what they re seeing in their own demand they ve got almost 200 000 reservations for the electric f 150 now they re saying now they re not going to take any more reservations or they may close them soon and now start you want one go to your dealer place an order sciple scarcity mindset rosevear let s do this properly somebody at ford i think it might have been jim farley himself said the other day we are frantically trying to figure out how to make twice as many f 150 lightnings as we had planned because the demand is just so high this is all part of that again i don t think they re going to outdo vw or whoever globally but if they can sell more evs in the united states than tesla does and we know tesla will be making more evs but a lot of those are sold elsewhere then that will be a small feather in ford s cap and that s what i think they re realistically aiming at
i n all the world there was nothing as beautiful as a goat as she sat among them on the steep wooded slopes of the valle di felice watching them tussle and shimmy in the tall weeds agitu gudeta rejoiced in their long shoulders and strong legs their compactness and the grace of their horns curving back like swords when they came close for they loved crowding round she fondled their ears and kissed their noses stroked their fine hair and basked in the sight of their faces gazing down on her against the clear italian sky listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element these were not just any goats but pezzata mochena the ancient piebald race of the high alpine region near the austrian border they came in all goat colours but mostly streaked and patched with black or warm red brown in 2010 when she bought 15 they were almost extinct within a decade she had 180 and knew the names and characters of every one of them so she would chide cinnamon as she gently cleaned her udder for sitting in muck again and rebuke kay for trying to climb into her car and as she led them all out to pasture she would shush them like a congregation of children blithely twirling her stick in her slim black hands yes she was black the goats did not notice as they also paid no attention to her tall african hat but people certainly did the mochena region was a closed place still inhabited by descendants of bavarians who ate dumplings lived in chalets and spoke a dialect of german they distrusted all strangers including the regular pedlars who sold fabric out of their vans and they had never seen a black face except on shrove tuesday when carnival was led by the betscho and betscha one in a skirt one with a tall goatskin hat and a false hump made of straw both in blackface who clowned to bring prosperity now here among them was a real black woman an ethiopian refugee living in the mountains alone with her goats well she thought as she worked away herding and milking and scrubbing she could bring in prosperity too her parents had gone to california she had come here she had fled from ethiopia in 2010 with nothing determined to leave nostalgia behind and reinvent herself her work back there menaced by trigger happy police and a warrant for her arrest had been to defend nomadic herders whose grazing lands were being grabbed and leased to corporations by the government neo colonialism in a word but in italy too land was being squandered good green land as people left so she did what her herding grandparents would have done put her goats on communal pastures that had been abandoned and let their munching and manuring gradually restore them the mochena breed were not abundant milkers but she soon had milk and yogurt to sell then came cheese eventually 15 different kinds adapted to local tastes of which her special treasures were the primo sale the first fresh salted ones which tasted completely different in a week her dairy in frassilongo the nearest village was in a building once intended as a primary school when there were still enough children in the valley there she stirred the big vats of curds just as joyfully as she led her goats up the valley and taught local girls to make cheese as she had learned it on courses in france nothing pleased her more than hearing people say her cheese was good it won prizes in trento the main town of the region she ran a stall on market day and in 2020 opened a shop called la capra felice the happy goat which served ethiopian coffee alongside all the dairy stuff happiness was her watchword happy goats happy customers a happy place filled with local activity she called it her philosophy of community it was a crazy life up at 6am to milk then to the dairy or the shop then up to the pasture milking again dairy again paperwork bed it used all her strength she adored it and her sheer energy won the locals over journalists from around the world came to see her in her jeans cami top and ethiopian hat a symbol of integration for all of italy for the first eight years she could tell them with her joyous smile that there had never been any trouble suspicion yes at first but actual trouble no and she had been lucky after high school she had studied sociology in rome and trento on a scholarship so she already spoke good italian and though she had returned to ethiopia afterwards her italian residency papers were still in order in trento she still had friends during last year s lockdown friends old and new passed word that she had a lot of perishable stock to clear and everything was sold yet there had always been more difficult neighbours bears and wolves which she scared away with bangers and a few thugs fans of hard right politicians who rode motorbikes among the goats or set their dogs on them in 2018 a man came into the barn as she cleaned the milking machine seized her by the shoulder and told her to go back home another sliced the udder from one of her loveliest pure white goats she had blamed wolves at first it felt safer now to move down from her secluded mountain shelter to plankerhof a hamlet near frassilongo to a flat beside the church the intruders said her goats had damaged their property they also objected to the african refugees and migrants she took on to help when she was busiest that was her latest project to use a fine resource that was being wasted just like the land she would find young men with permission to stay but no work and teach them to look after goats naturally they could handle it they were refugees local jobless lads might want to join in too and they could even form co operatives her teeming mind running ahead of itself as usual she began by taking on one young man at a time from ghana or mali hoping to transform them into goat lovers as fervent as herself from the start as they climbed up to pasture she would ask them are you happy they had to be she felt but it was not so for suleiman from ghana who just after christmas argued with her about unpaid wages and ended by killing her evading the police he fled up to the barn and tried to lose himself among the goats but they were hungry and agitated by the absence of their mistress and did not welcome him once he was taken away the good neighbours of frassilongo trudged through the snow to feed them

propublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they re published when covid 19 started sweeping across america in the spring of 2020 irene bosch knew she was in a unique position to help the harvard trained scientist had just developed quick inexpensive tests for several tropical diseases and her method could be adapted for the novel coronavirus so bosch and the company she had co founded two years earlier seemed well suited to address an enormous testing shortage propublica get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter thanks for signing up if you like our stories mind sharing this with a friend copy link for more ways to keep up be sure to check out the rest of our newsletters see all defend the facts support independent journalism by donating to propublica donate now e25bio named after the massive red brick building at mit that houses the lab where bosch worked already had support from the national institutes of health along with a consortium of investors led by mit within a few weeks bosch and her colleagues had a test that would detect coronavirus in 15 minutes and produce a red line on a little chemical strip the factory where they were planning to make tests for dengue fever could quickly retool to produce at least 100 000 covid 19 tests per week she said priced at less than 10 apiece or cheaper at a higher scale bosch s prototype attracted a top silicon valley venture capital firm which pitched in 2 million we are excited about what e25bio is capable of shipping in a short amount of time a test that is significantly cheaper more affordable and available at home said firm founder vinod khosla disclosure khosla s daughter anu khosla is on propublica s board on march 21 when the u s had recorded only a few hundred covid 19 deaths bosch submitted the test for emergency authorization a process the food and drug administration uses to expedite tests and treatments a green light from the fda could have made a big difference for the many americans who were then frantically trying to find doctors to swab their noses with results if they were lucky coming back only days later but the go ahead never came in the months that followed bosch responded to repeated requests from fda reviewers for data and studies when the agency finally put out guidance that summer about the performance over the counter home tests needed to meet officials required that such tests be nearly as sensitive as the lab tests used to definitively determine whether a patient has covid 19 that standard proved difficult to meet rapid tests are usually sensitive enough to detect viral antigens when someone has enough of them to be able to spread the disease such tests are not as good at picking up cases in either earlier or later stages of infection when viral loads are lower bosch s tests missed the fda s high bar it wasn t until the spring of 2021 that much larger companies were able to design similar tests relatively inexpensive over the counter rapid tests that the agency found acceptable you could have antigen tests saving lives since the beginning of the pandemic said bosch sitting in her lab at mit that s the sad story as propublica recently detailed many companies with at home tests have been stymied by an fda review process that has flummoxed experts and even caused one agency reviewer to quit in frustration while e25bio s test didn t catch quite as many cases as those now on the market it could have been used to catch superspreaders with warnings that a negative result wouldn t rule out infection experts told us that the test could have been a vital public health tool had it been produced in the millions in 2020 just as covid 19 was racing across the country undetected since we didn t have other options it would have been a very good test said michael mina an epidemiologist who followed e25bio s early progress if we were going to war and somebody was invading us and we had a bunch of revolver pistols and we didn t yet have the shipment of machine guns hell yeah you re going to pick up the revolver pistol you do what you can when you need to in an emergency three other experts reviewed bosch s submissions at propublica s request and agreed that her test approached what is now considered acceptable for over the counter tests mina and others have been calling for an embrace of rapid testing since the pandemic s early days saying that tests should be ubiquitous and cheap enough that people could stock them in their medicine cabinet like aspirin or band aids although not a panacea rapid tests can slow the spread of covid 19 when used repeatedly and when the infected follow instructions to isolate many studies suggest after not showing urgency on the issue for much of the past year the biden administration has moved recently to boost production and lower prices facing a huge new wave of cases and an increasing outcry about shortages of tests biden announced tuesday that 500 million more at home tests would be distributed by mail starting in january david paltiel a professor at the yale school of public health said a significant part of the problem is that the fda created a detailed roadmap for tests that give patients a close to definitive answer on whether they have covid 19 but never created a separate framework for rapid tests that serve a different purpose helping people get frequent fast evidence of whether they may be contagious the former are tests of infection the latter are tests of infectiousness paltiel said they both share the same regulatory pathway a pathway that was designed with diagnostic testing in mind and is littered with requirements that make no sense for the purpose they serve he added it s an outrage that rapid tests aren t dirt cheap and plentiful on grocery store shelves the fda declined to comment on individual test submissions but said in a statement that it has worked to authorize accurate and reliable home tests since the beginning of the pandemic unfortunately many submissions the fda has received for home tests include incomplete or poor data and it is the fda s responsibility to protect the public health by declining to authorize poorly performing tests or those without complete data the agency said we have also worked interactively with many developers to resolve concerns when data was incomplete or unclear or to find solutions to issues that arose during review if the fda received a home test that the data and science supported in early to mid 2020 we would have quickly authorized it bosch has since moved on to start a new venture focused on helping other test developers conduct trials that meet the fda s standards this winter she s working with the housing authority in the high poverty boston suburb of chelsea to conduct a trial using several tests that have been authorized in other countries but not america the goal to demonstrate that such tests can be effective when deployed for free in conjunction with education and outreach the next thing is frequent testing for communities that need it bosch said how do we flood the market with a 2 test that is as good as a 20 we re doing it in chelsea we should be an example for the whole country american medical device regulators have never been enthusiastic about letting people test themselves in the 1980s the fda banned home tests for hiv on the grounds that people who tested positive might do harm to themselves if they did not receive simultaneous counseling in the 2010s the agency cracked down on home genetic testing kits concerned that people might make rash medical decisions as a result but the fda wasn t an obstacle to bosch s work on tropical diseases since the tests were mostly needed in places like the brazilian amazon where infected mosquitoes are hard to escape the national institutes of health thought bosch s tests had enough potential to give e25bio 1 8 million for the project so when the pandemic struck the small company decided to use its expertise for the new threat within a few weeks bosch and her colleagues developed antibodies that could detect the presence of proteins attached to the new coronavirus in her previous work bosch had found that tests of this type could be validated in the lab so she ordered up some samples of the sars cov 2 virus and ran two different types of antigen tests on them she found that both worked fairly well and packaged up all her evidence and sent it to the fda with little guidance on what would pass muster shortly after an fda reviewer told her she d need to conduct a clinical trial which would take months my first huge surprise was when they said nope none of your validations are going to pass for an eua bosch said the next challenge was that the accuracy of antigen tests would be measured by how they compared to a different type of diagnostic the polymerase chain reaction or pcr test which is considered the gold standard for finding coronaviruses many see that as an unproductive comparison given the fact that pcr detects remnants of the virus which may persist for many days after the infection ceases to be a threat when you re pcr testing you re testing for the presence of viral genetic material said hannah mamuszka the ceo of alva10 a company that helps diagnostics manufacturers prove their value for insurers when you re antigen testing you re testing for presence of a protein on the surface of the virus she said those are obviously not the same thing so it s really confounding that the fda has had such a hard time communicating what they need and defining what a test would need to look like to be used at home nevertheless by april 2020 e25bio had lined up a trial with three hospitals in florida they found the test identified 80 of the swabs that a pcr test had shown to be positive known as sensitivity and 94 of the negatives known as specificity the fda wanted to see fewer false positives even though people who test positive on an antigen test are usually advised to confirm it with a pcr and while the overall sensitivity of e25bio s test was lower than other tests would later demonstrate it measured 100 for people with higher viral loads those most likely to be infectious bosch was in frequent contact with her assigned reviewer at the fda and even talked to tim stenzel the head of the agency s office that vets diagnostic tests the bill melinda gates foundation gave e25bio another 500 000 to continue research and development but at the end of july 2020 the fda came out with a template that laid out the expectation that tests available for home use without a prescription would reach 90 overall sensitivity that is antigen tests would pick up nine out of ten positive tests that a pcr identified bosch knew her tests couldn t meet that standard and without an eua for home use they wouldn t be able to serve their intended function already plenty of models had illustrated the importance of frequent testing including one co authored last year by yale s paltiel with rochelle walensky now head of the centers for disease control and prevention in september 2020 as chief of infectious diseases at massachusetts general hospital walensky argued that antigen tests were actually most useful for pinpointing people at their most infectious in fact the utility of that approach was being tested at bosch s own former workplace beginning in the late summer of 2020 a coworking lab space in cambridge where e25bio had launched started a trial with 257 of its users who agreed to take both the antigen rapid test at home and a pcr test twice a week this was also closer to a home use scenario than the florida hospitals study in which covid 19 was more prevalent and tests were administered by medical professionals an e25bio trial credit lindsey crockett labcentral a peer reviewed paper based on the results showed overall sensitivity of 79 and that the rapid test picked up nearly all of the positives later detected by a pcr in the first few days after symptoms appeared allowing infected people to stay out of the office as soon as they knew but the fda does not consider test performance data broken out by how much virus the subjects have in their systems saying the typical method for measuring it is inconsistent nor did the agency initially authorize tests on the condition that they be sold in packs of more than one with instructions to use them sequentially to catch any fast moving infections bosch wasn t the only one to be tripped up by the new standard in mid september 2020 stenzel said on his weekly town hall call with test developers that his office had received zero applications for home use tests a month and a half after putting out the template despite his insistence that the agency was willing to be flexible meanwhile a 666 million nih program to accelerate the approval and production of new covid 19 tests funded mostly pcr tests in 2020 the antigen tests that did make it into the nih program in the first three funding rounds including one made by quidel a public company that multiplied its profits by tenfold in 2020 over the previous year generally had to be processed in labs or required expensive analyzers one of few simple antigen tests to win government support made by maxim biomedical still hasn t submitted an eua application according to chief operating officer jonathan maa another grantee ellume was authorized for nonprescription home use in december 2020 but it took months to go into widespread production and still costs 39 if you can find it toward the end of october 2020 bosch received a 48 hour ultimatum from the fda for a response to a request for additional data she had answers to the agency s questions but didn t quite make that deadline by the time she replied the fda had already closed her application you call and they say oh sorry the clock started and we can t stop it she said soon after the company s leadership asked her to resign the company continues to operate but hasn t obtained fda authorization for any tests as we commercialize our covid 19 rapid tests internationally we are also focused on developing the next generation of rapid tests for consumer diagnostics an e25bio spokesperson said while declining to comment on bosch s departure or its current product pipeline all our life day in and day out went to make antigen tests bosch said it was tragic because it was all because the fda decided to be so harsh in their responses that investors said oh there s no way she will pull it out e25bio s travails with the fda didn t stop bosch from putting her expertise to use in early 2021 she started talking to the city of chelsea about running a trial that could show how rapid antigen testing even with the types of tests that the fda had rejected could be rolled out in a high risk community in the spring when infection rates in chelsea were among the highest in the nation many residents had had a difficult time accessing pcr tests because the places administering them often dissuaded immigrants by requiring identification chelsea officials agreed and bosch secured donations of tests from five manufacturers that had been authorized in britain germany india or korea but none yet in the u s they can still be used here for research purposes she said she has validated them in her lab and found them to be about as accurate as binaxnow the fda authorized home test made by medical device giant abbott laboratories if they have a budget for next year to do frequent testing this will be an accomplishment bosch said i wanted to show to the world that an experimental device is just as good as any other already approved fda test left a study participant looks on as bosch right and another evaluator go over the project consent form right a chelsea resident self administers a rapid covid 19 test while members of the project guide her through the process credit kayana szymczak for propublica so for the past few months bosch has canvassed three buildings owned by the local housing authority bosch who is from venezuela puts on salsa music and explains in spanish how the program will work the trial began in earnest last week with study administrators walking newly enrolled subjects through using the tests in a building reserved for elderly and disabled people residents entered with walkers and in flip flops to learn how to swab their noses put the swabs in a vial of solution squeeze a few drops onto a pad and wait anxiously for the single line to appear that would indicate a negative result a chelsea resident is guided through entering his test information credit kayana szymczak for propublica most were able to take a picture of the results with their phones and upload them using a special app which they ll continue to do in their homes each week the fda frowns upon this kind of instruction in trials for at home tests users are supposed to be able to execute the test without training but in reality many need support for the nonprofit that helped launch the effort the center of complex interventions the important part is demonstrating that rapid tests can work when used as part of a coordinated testing regime to address specific situations right before people gather indoors or after an exposure to an infected person for anyone in a high risk job for people in crowded living situations or for those who have health risk factors people in all of those situations are concentrated in chelsea s housing authority buildings it s a lot different than saying let s roll it out to everybody said karthik dinakar who is leading the project it all has to be connected in a way that makes people feel like they re participating the goal for us is to make the community safer and also shift the mindset to a new equilibrium amelia valesquez and other buckley apartment housing project residents self administer covid 19 tests valesquez checks on her results credit kayana szymczak for propublica joshua sharfstein a vice dean at johns hopkins university s bloomberg school of public health who used to be principal deputy commissioner of the fda said that rapid tests could have been authorized earlier with these kinds of protocols in mind there was no testing strategy sharfstein said outlining the opportunity that america missed to use a variety of tests for the purposes to which they were best suited what they could have done is to say here are the six uses of tests you re sick you re exposed you re trying to maintain people on a campus what s the performance of test that you would need just think how amazingly helpful that would be he finished wistfully meanwhile the cdc and nih have been studying similar programs in a handful of communities using quidel s at home test governors have been catching on to the utility of rapid tests too last week the state of massachusetts bought millions of rapid test kits made by ihealth laboratories the company s chief operating officer jack feng told national public radio that the price was higher in the u s because of the expense of clinical trials that aren t required elsewhere propublica read more after decades of imprisoning patients idaho approves secure mental health facility and since rejecting bosch s submissions the fda has been coming around to her way of thinking in march the agency published a template for tests that would be used serially and sold in packages of two or more allowing the kind of frequent testing she had advocated for and last month it published a new template that lowered the sensitivity standard for single use over the counter tests to 80 bosch had tests a year and a half ago that missed that bar by 1 do you have a tip for propublica help us do journalism got a story we should hear are you down to be a background

the electric vehicle boom is in full swing and though company valuations have already skyrocketed in the past couple of years this new market trend has legs think about this passenger electric vehicle sales are set to grow by more than 80 to 5 6 million units in 2021 and it s clear to see why the world is racing towards a potentially catastrophic climate event and only a reduction in emissions can prevent it that s why bnef the strategic research arm of bloomberg predicts that there could be as many as 677 million zero emission vehicles on the road by 2040 the race for emissions free transportation has seen companies grow by leaps and bounds over the past two years take nio limited nyse nio for example since the beginning of 2020 it has surged by as much as 684 and of course tesla nasdaq tsla has grown even faster skyrocketing by nearly 1000 in the same amount of time though those gains are impressive this revolution is just getting started that s why we ve put together a list of our favorite electric vehicle companies for 2022 and beyond 1 tesla motors after having peaked at almost 1250 per share on nov 4 of this year ev maker tesla nasdaq tsla has seen its share price fall back below 900 effectively wiping out all gains since the carmaker closed a huge deal with car rental company hertz the 4 2 billion deal which was revealed on october 25 was the start of yet another major rally in tesla shares as markets read the deal as a signal that evs are going mainstream the hertz rally sent tesla s market capitalization soaring well above the astronomical 1 trillion figure while some analysts were quick to predict some sort of a correction in share prices others re adjusted their bullish predictions for tesla wedbush securities analyst dan ives has put a price target of 1 400 on tesla s stock according to ives the energy transition will create a massive 5 trillion market opportunity over the next decade and tesla is set to retain its market leadership on the other side of the spectrum is tesla bear jpmorgan the investment bank continues to say that tesla is woefully overvalued and before the hertz rally the bank expected tesla to fall back to 250 per share in december 2022 while the omicron selloff in equity markets has certainly weighed on tesla the real catalyst was the decision of its ceo elon musk to sell off a large number of shares after polling the public on twitter musk sold almost 13 6 billion in stock with some of the bids already entered before the poll 2 li auto li auto nasdaq li is an up and comer to watch in the chinese electric vehicle space and while it may not be a veteran in the market like tesla or even nio it s quickly making waves on wall street backed by chinese giants meituan and bytedance li has taken a different approach to the electric vehicle market instead of opting for pure electric cars it is giving consumers a choice with its stylish crossover hybrid suv this innovative vehicle can be powered with gasoline or electricity taking the edge off drivers who may not have a charging station or a gas station nearby while it just hit the nasdaq in july of last year the company has already seen its stock price nearly triple since its debut the company s forward thinking approach to the industry and promising financials have hit a nerve with analysts with as many as 15 buy ratings out on the company and a potential price reaching 64 within the next 12 months according to cnn forecasts 3 ford ford motors nyse f is a detroit veteran and it certainly hasn t ignored the dramatic rise in electric vehicles in addition to brand new electric versions of its best sellers the f 150 and iconic mustang it s also carving out its own position in the hydrogen race as well in fact it recently even unveiled the world s first ever fuel cell hybrid plugin electric vehicle the ford edge hyseries this vehicle offers ford the ultimate in flexibility in researching advanced propulsion technology said gerhard schmidt vice president of research and advanced engineering for ford motor company we could take the fuel cell power system out and replace it with a down sized diesel gasoline engine or any other powertrain connected to a small electric generator to make electricity like the fuel cell does now thanks in large part to its green pivot ford s stock price has soaredthis year since the beginning of 2021 the company s share price has climbed from 8 52 to today s price of 19 representing a more than 100 increase in value 4 rivian last month california based electric vehicle maker rivian automotive inc nasdaq rivn became the latest ultra hyped ev manufacturer to hit the market rivian s ipo was another hit after the company managed to raise about 13 5 billion by selling 175 95 million shares at 78 a pop the company s shares would go on to hit an intra day high of 179 47 six days later before falling back to earth though currently trading at just under 100 share due to renewed omicron concerns which have dragged much of the market down the company is starting to see some upward momentum once again why has rivian captured the imagination of wall street exactly well that s largely thanks to its robust pre orders and deal making ford for example paid a total of 820 million for rivian s series b and d offerings and also bought 415 million of the ev maker s convertible debt offering those early investments are now worth over 13 billion meaning ford owns a 12 stake in rivian and 10 5 of the voting power amazon inc nasdaq amzn also jumped on board participating in no less than four rounds in rivian s fundraising paying 1 35 billion and also bought 490 million in convertible debt before buying 2 56 million shares worth 200m at the ipo overall amazon owns an 18 5 stake in rivian after the ipo and holds 16 9 of the voting power 5 apple inc we ve all heard the rumors in fact it very well may be one of the worst kept secrets ever the apple car and the rumors are finally becoming a reality apple nasdaq aapl has reportedly set a goal to produce a fully self driving car by 2025 though it s yet to announce a production partner anytime soon for the self driving car project nothing has delivered us a more impressive wealth generation story in the past couple of years like tesla it s certainly with that in mind that apple which has gone back and forth over the apple car appears to have turned things up a notch in the autonomous driving arena earlier this year tim cook ceo of apple finally opened up about the project and though a lot of details remain fuzzy cook did note that he has great admiration for tesla the trillion dollar question however is who will apple be partnering with in its potentially market breaking pivot to electric transit the rumor mill has been flooded with guesses hyundai was among the first to be mentioned however in early february it was revealed that the deal fell through since then other names have been dropped including taiwan semiconductor and lg even magna a canadian mobility technology company has been thrown into the pot and while nothing has been confirmed one thing is clear apple could be on track to upend markets once again it s already fast approaching a 3 trillion valuation but this could send it even higher in fact if apple were a country it would be the world s sixth richest and this could very well push it into the top 5 canadian companies are looking to capitalize on the ev boom as well greenpower motor company tsx gpv is an exciting company that produces larger scale electric transportation right now it is primarily focused on the north american market but the sky is the limit as the pressure to go green grows greenpower has been on the frontlines of the electric movement manufacturing affordable battery electric busses and trucks for over ten years from school busses to long distance public transit greenpower s impact on the sector can t be ignored another way to get some indirect exposure to the booming tech ev and mineral industries is through autocanada tsx acq a company that operates auto dealerships through canada the company carries a wide variety of new and used vehicles and has all types of financial options available to fit the needs of any consumer while sales have slumped this year due to the covid 19 pandemic autocanada will likely see a rebound as both buying power and the demand for electric vehicles increases as more new exciting evs hit the market autocanada will surely be able to ride the wave magna international tsx mg was already making major moves in the battery market over a decade ago investing over half a billion dollars in battery production while the market was still in its infancy at the time electric vehicles as we know them had barely hit the scene with tesla launching its premiere car just two years prior magna s massive investment has paid off in a big way however since its battery bet the company has seen its valuation soar by tens of billions of dollars and it has solidified itself as one of the leaders in the business westport fuel systems tsx wrpt is an important company to watch in the global energy transition especially as the world races to leave behind traditional gasoline and diesel powered vehicles because it is a manufacturing play at heart it is a unique way to get in on the boom in the alternative fuel auto industry westport fuel has been making major moves in the market over the past year and its efforts are finally coming to fruition since february 2020 the company has seen its stock price rise by 348 and with more potential deals like the one it has just sealed with amazon to provide natural gas powered trucks to its fleet the stock has even more room to run in the coming

today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2022 results before discussing the results i would like to comment on the overall environment as you know we re now seeing the spread of the omicron variant which is resulting in government restrictions that are impacting commercial passenger traffic while the overall commercial passenger traffic market is recovering the delta variant and now the omicron variant highlight the best path to full recovery will not be a straight line despite this dynamic environment we have remained focused on our own execution and are proud of the multiple quarters of margin expansion and strong cash flows that we have delivered turning to this most recent quarter our sales increased 8 year over year from 404 million to 437 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 71 from 0 31 per share to 0 53 per share demand for our mro services has remained strong even as our mro customers deal with changes to the bookings and schedules they remain focused on keeping the maintenance supply chain running smoothly our customers have also been supportive in recent price negotiations as we look to address the tightness in the labor market together parts supply which is our highest margin activity had stable volumes throughout the quarter albeit down from the levels we saw early in q1 before the onset of the delta variant while overall the supply chain that supports our own operations that aar is functioning well we have seen extended turnaround times from some of our repair subcontractors as well as freight delays which did cause some sales to move from q2 to q3 regarding earnings we delivered another quarter of margin expansion as our adjusted operating margin was 6 1 for the quarter sequentially this is up from 5 5 in the first quarter despite a decline in sales even more importantly our margin exceeded pre covid levels even though our top line is still down significantly to illustrate this our adjusted margin this quarter increased from 5 6 to 6 1 compared to two years ago prior to the pandemic even though our adjusted revenue was down 127 million over that same period this year s this quarter s margin performance continues to validate the actions that we ve taken over the past two years to drive efficiency in our operations prioritize more profitable offerings and exit underperforming activities we expect continued margin expansion as our commercial parts demand fully recovers turning to cash we had another strong quarter as we generated 50 million from operating activities from continuing operations we also continue to reduce the usage of our accounts receivable financing program excluding the impact of the ar program our cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was 26 million over the last six quarters we have generated a total of 142 million of cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations regarding new business during the quarter we announced a five year renewal of flydubai with flydubai to provide power by the hour component support for its fleet of 33 737 engines we also announced a sustainability initiative with fortress transportation and infrastructure under which we will contribute a percentage of all usm sales from our cfm56 partnership to purchase carbon offset credits on behalf of our customers this initiative both reflects our commitment to helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and the fact that usm is a low cost green alternative to purchase the new parts finally subsequent to the end of the quarter we announced a 10 year 365 million contract with the u s air force to provide depot level maintenance and repair is primarily for the f 16 aircraft based in europe we have been supporting f 16 for decades but this program takes that support to a new level the complexity and duration of this contract is a meaningful step above our prior f 16 support and will build past performance that allows us to pursue other programs of a similar nature before turning it over to sean i would like to also comment on the share repurchase program that we announced earlier this afternoon as we said before our priorities for capital allocation are first organic investment in our business second the addition of synergistic capability via acquisition and third with the return of capital to our shareholders our consistent cash flow generation and the strength of our balance sheet allow us to pursue all three and this share repurchase program is part of our plan for driving long term shareholder value with that i d like to turn it over to our cfo sean gillen to discuss the quarter in more detail 10 stocks we like better than aar when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and aar wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 16 2021 sean gillen vice president chief financial officer thanks john our sales in the quarter of 436 6 million were up 8 2 or 33 million year over year sales in our aviation services segment were up 8 9 driven by a recovery in our commercial markets and sales in our expeditionary services segment were down 1 3 million our commercial sales were up 33 while our government sales were down 15 the decline in government sales was driven primarily by the level of activity on our program for the modification and sale of two c 40 aircraft to the u s marine corps in the year ago quarter sequentially our commercial sales declined 3 6 due primarily to the impact of the delta variant on our parts supply activities and our government sales declined 4 7 driven by the wind down of certain programs and the reduction of activity in afghanistan gross profit margin in the quarter was 18 versus 17 2 in the prior year quarter and adjusted gross profit margin was 16 7 versus 13 9 in the prior year quarter this significant margin expansion was driven by the efficiency improvement and portfolio refinement actions that we have taken and also reflects the benefit of closing out certain contracts in our commercial and government businesses gross profit margin in our commercial businesses was 17 3 and gross profit margin in our government businesses was 18 9 the adjustments in the quarter apply to both the commercial and government end markets but were more heavily weighted toward commercial sg a expenses in the quarter were 47 1 million or 10 8 of sales excluding adjustments of 1 1 million related to severance and investigation and remediation costs this would have been closer to 10 6 of sales in line with q1 despite the decline in sales sg a is still approximately 10 million below the pre covid amount from q2 of fy 20 going forward we do not expect sg a to grow in proportion to revenue as a result as the commercial demand environment recovers and we continue to win additional government business we expect to be able to drive sg a to 10 of sales or lower net interest expense for the quarter was 0 4 million compared to 1 3 million last year driven by lower borrowings average diluted share count for the quarter was 35 6 million versus 35 million for the prior year quarter as john indicated we generated cash flow from our operating activities from continuing operations of 15 9 million and also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by 10 million in the quarter during the quarter we repaid our canadian term loan of 24 7 million using our revolving credit facility which further simplifies our debt capital structure our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net debt of 61 8 million and net leverage of 0 4 times regarding the share repurchase program as indicated in our release earlier this afternoon it s a 150 million authorization to acquire shares at management s discretion during open trading windows and we intend to fully deploy the authorized amount over approximately in the next two years thank you for your attention and i will now turn the call back over to john john m holmes president chief executive officer great thank you sean turning to the quarter ahead as of now the omicron variant has not impacted our customers maintenance plan as such we expect mro activities to remain at the current levels which are near full capacity parts supply which is our most international activity is more likely to be impacted by the reinstatement of global travel restrictions which could further extend the timeline for full recovery that said we expect the impact of each new variant to diminish as we move forward although and although the timing is difficult to predict parts demand we expect will eventually return as operators move to restock their inventory further we expect to grow our business beyond just the scope of the recovery given the incremental interest in usm and as we continue to secure new long term exclusive distribution agreements on the government side the f 16 program demonstrates that our commercial best practices are resonating with the government customer and our pipeline is full and we expect to be able to continue to expand our government programs portfolio notwithstanding the uncertainty we feel good about our backlog and parts supply the loading in our hangars and our government pipeline as such we expect to see sequential growth in q3 with sales approaching the levels we saw in q1 we are now entering our eight quarter in a covid world we are very pleased with the performance that we ve been able to deliver over that time particularly our margin improvement and our ability to strengthen our balance sheet through consistent cash flow generation our launch of 150 million share repurchase program reflects our progress and our confidence and you can expect continued execution from us over the coming quarters and years and with that i ll turn it over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of ken herbert of rbc your line is now open kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst hey good afternoon john and sean and dylan nice quarter john m holmes president chief executive officer thank you ken good to hear from you kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst hey john yeah thanks i just wanted to start off the 33 growth in the commercial business can you it sounds like from your commentary the parts supply was maybe down sequentially or maybe not a big driver of that growth can you parse out that growth in the quarter from mro relative to maybe the parts distribution and the parts trading side of the business john m holmes president chief executive officer yeah it was actually spread fairly evenly we saw as we mentioned at the end of q4 and at the beginning of q1 a real uptick in activity in parts in general and then after delta took hold we saw that come down a little bit but it was relatively stable throughout this quarter which was up slightly from the prior quarter across both the distribution and trading and mro was relatively stable but and some of the growth actually come from the parts businesses kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst okay and obviously we keep getting these new vaiants and things seem to be pushing to the right in terms of the recovery but what s your thinking now as to when we might see a more meaningful inflection in either distribution or i guess more specifically parts trading and what are some of the indicators that you re tracking that are going to give you confidence or give you better visibility and when we expect that inflection to occur john m holmes president chief executive officer well i think you ve gone through a large that s a great question i think you ve gone through in large part the destocking around the world and parts demand for narrow body aircraft particularly here in north america has recovered the areas that we re waiting to see recover are the international markets and again parts is our most international business so once we have clarity on consistent borders being open and travel restrictions being lifted that s when we would expect to see more continued more consistent demand in the parts business and unfortunately the timing of that is obviously very difficult to predict but related to that because you ve seen the destocking largely complete and we ve seen a preference in the us toward usm material we believe that once you get more consistent demand as markets fully reopen there s going to be quite a run on used material because shelves are empty and airlines will have more confidence in consistent line so it s difficult to predict when that s going to occur but we do expect when it does it will be a pretty meaningful uptick kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst and just one final question on that as you think about the cycle maybe not just the next few quarters but the next couple of years how much do you model or how much do you assume usm demand could outpace broader sort of aftermarket parts demand john m holmes president chief executive officer i wouldn t want to get into specifics on that but we have seen both from a market standpoint i d say international markets such as asia as well as just legacy carriers here in north america a significant increase in interest in usm and so again it s difficult to predict the path and pace of that growth but we know that is there kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst great well thank you very much and happy holidays john m holmes president chief executive officer thanks ken you too operator thank you your next question comes from the line of michael ciarmoli from truist company securities sorry your line is now open michael ciarmoli truist securities analyst hey good evening guys thanks for taking the questions john maybe just on the omicron variant i mean i guess as we look back at delta and more specifically but the response maybe seemed a bit mild versus what we re seeing here now with travel restrictions and everything else going on how do we you said we ll see some growth sequentially back to in line with the fiscal first quarter i mean how do you guys just think about that in response to what you saw with delta and what we might see here on a go forward basis with omicron john m holmes president chief executive officer yeah great question the comments about sequential growth are based largely on as i mentioned we did have some sales went from q2 and now it will occur in q3 and so we re just looking at our backlog across the company which gives us confidence that you re going to see sequential growth there is no question i mean you said that the response to omicron definitely was more rapid and more broad than what you saw with delta but we tend to agree with what other airlines have said publicly is that the impact of these of each new variant will be shorter as society and as industry and as governments are able to respond more quickly and then hopefully relax restrictions more quickly delta was the first example of that obviously we re seeing something we re seeing the next generation here with omicron but we re hopeful that each one of these cycles if you will each one of these waves of the duration will be shorter than the prior but the comment specifically related to quarter over quarter growth are tied to what we see right now in current backlog michael ciarmoli truist securities analyst got it and what was the amount of revenue that slipped out of the current quarter john m holmes president chief executive officer if you go back to the guidance we previously provided we said that we would be between this quarter that we would be somewhere between q4 and q1 obviously around the lower end of that had that have those products shipped as planned we would have been right in the middle of that guidance michael ciarmoli truist securities analyst okay got it got it and then just one more maybe you kind of mentioned international travel recovering as we think about your parts business your distribution business is there a meaningful difference there in terms of narrow body wide body exposure i mean do we need to see the wide body utilization maybe not come all the way back but see some overall improvement is that going to be a big driver of some of that parts business for you john m holmes president chief executive officer some it will be some most of our wide body exposure in the parts business and i should say that we have more wide body exposure in the trading business than we do in the distribution business and most of the wide body exposure in the trading business is cargo related there are some commercial but that s less of impact what we re more interested in seeing is more sustained narrow body travel around the world that we fueled a few the full recovery of both the parts trading business as well as the parts distribution business michael ciarmoli truist securities analyst got it got it helpful all right great guys i ll jump back in the queue john m holmes president chief executive officer great thank you mike operator thank you your next question comes from the line of ken herbert from rbc your line is now open kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst yeah hey john just a follow up on the f 16 contract you announced how much does that ramp and how quickly and what s the sort of the fiscal 22 incremental contribution john m holmes president chief executive officer yeah great question i would view that as a fy 23 contributor the ramp up time for the contract is actually relatively compressed as these things go but there is the potential of the contract is protested we will go through that process that hasn t happened yet and we re going to pull visibility in that but once it s clear we would expect a fairly short ramp but at this point we wouldn t expect any meaningful revenue contribution until fy 23 kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst okay helpful and on the buyback authorization i mean you still identify organic growth and m a is higher priorities for uses of capital m a hasn t been much of a part of the mix for quite a while and i can appreciate maybe investment opportunities now organically maybe starting to increase but maybe limited as well how quickly do you expect to ramp on the buyback on the authorization and how much usage there should we expect or are there really some nice opportunities in terms of other investments we should be thinking about john m holmes president chief executive officer yeah great question and we as we mentioned the capital allocation priorities are first organic investment second inorganic investment and third return to capital to shareholders and given where the net leverage is in the company right now and the opportunity set that we see we believe that we re in a position to execute on all three and so there are a number of organic investment opportunities whether it s in the trading business or the distribution business that we re looking at right now m a is something that does remain a focus of ours and on the commercial side it s been a tricky environment to pursue deals but it is it does remain a part of our growth m a does remain a part of our growth strategy as it relates to the timing of this i mean we fully intend to fully authorize or utilize this authorization and at the pace as sean mentioned we re going to commence this quarter and then depending on market conditions as well as how opportunities unfold in the next few quarters that will determine the ultimate pace of employment our deployment but at this point we chose that amount because it fits relative to the other opportunities that we see and it s something that we think we can get done in a reasonable period of time kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst okay that s great and if i could just one final clarification i just wanted to confirm you indicated that as a result of omicron you haven t seen any change to your mro schedules or backlogs i just want to make sure i got that correctly john m holmes president chief executive officer that is correct that is correct kenneth herbert rbc capital analyst okay great all right thank you john m holmes president chief executive officer thanks ken operator and again we have a question coming from the line michael ciarmoli of truist securities your line is now open michael ciarmoli truist securities analyst hey guys thanks for taking the follow up john just as we think about labor in a tight labor market how are you guys feeling i mean we re going to get through the holidays here pretty quickly and then you re going to probably get into that busy kind of summer repair season i mean it seems like maybe i m an optimist that airlines globally would probably be looking even more aggressively to a hopefully close to back to normal 22 flying season do you feel comfortable with labor as you move into these potentially busy quarters john m holmes president chief executive officer yeah again a great question and the labor dynamics is something that we will pay an awful lot of attention to and the short answer to your question is it s really tight that because of the initiatives that we but if it s really tight and i would say it is definitely tighter than it was pre covid and i would characterize that as we re seeing pressure not just at the lower not just that the mechanic hourly labor but through up and down throughout the organization and so it s a bit a broader based in terms of tightness but because of the initiatives that we announced pre covid and have particularly through covid we think we re in a pretty good position the other thing i would say is that the customers have worked very closely with us it keeps the hangers and the loading in the hangars relatively consistent so what we used to experience was major dip during the summer and significant dip during the holiday season which resulted in up and down moves in the overall labor force the customers have worked with us to level loaded through those period which has allowed us to keep the labor force together and so it s a long answer to your question but sitting here today we feel good about the schedule that we have in our ability to meet the schedule and but it is a daily progress of ours michael ciarmoli truist securities analyst got it very helpful thanks guys operator there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call over back to john john m holmes president chief executive officer great thank you very much everybody we really appreciate the time and the interest and we wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season thank you operator duration 25 minutes call participants sean gillen vice president chief financial officer john m holmes president chief executive officer kenneth herbert rbc capital

warning the following article contains spoilers about the sex and the city reboot i started watching sex and the city after the hbo series wrapped in 2004 the show s zeitgeist rippled through conversations about sex fashion and relationships but i didn t know what the buzz was all about as a phd student in the mid 2000s with no cable subscription my visual entertainment consisted of renting vhs tapes and snuggling my cats on a navy futon my friends couldn t stop talking about the four main characters who wanted a lot from life especially in terms of love and relationships i often heard debates over whether someone was a carrie samantha charlotte or miranda from the first episode i was hooked by the edgy banter and sexual situations they got into they were also hashing out big issues like work friendship lgbtqia rights and most of all what sex means these issues have woven their way into my career as a sexuality scholar and as a women who identifies with the sexual verve of samantha miranda s biting humour and carrie s writerly profession but i m aghast at sex and the city s bougie whitewashed and sexless reboot called and just like that which debuted on dec 9 new york times television critic james poniewozik describes it as being like two shows what can we take away from this epic fail as a society that continues to undervalue women and shun open discussions of age class race and sex the peloton effect in the first episode big dies in carrie s arms after an intense peloton exercise bike session in their massive upper east side apartment this rather dark scene foreshadows the decline of the smart and saucy social commentary that once defined sex and the city the characters seem stuck in the past and confused about who they are as older women instead of unpacking these tensions they re glossed over given that very few characters over 50 in mainstream film and tv are women as few as one in four we need shows that feature women s complex lived experiences instead of those that bend to the whims of the male driven entertainment industry fingers crossed that the show bounces back with some fun anti ageist narratives like peloton did after its stocks descended following the opening episode miranda miranda still has the best lines like when she describes accidentally touching her son s used condom over brunch i stepped on my son s semen before coffee but she s also framed as chronically unwoke and offensive to everyone how is that comedic in another scene miranda contemplates dying her silvering hair going or staying grey is a hot topic among hollywood actors including andie macdowell who calls staying grey a power move many if not all women grapple with this issue which can make them feel like they must choose between feeling authentic and looking competent miranda decides not to dye which may encourage other women to resist dominant beauty trends that are designed to mask the ageing process we ve also seen miranda partake in several morning drinks when middle age women drink excessively we either laugh about it mummy wine memes or pathologize it this is a topic of growing concern and bringing it out of the shadows on primetime could help women who have a problematic relationship with alcohol charlotte charlotte resumes her role as the well meaning emotional and out of touch musketeer her character is shown parenting two very different daughters one who may be non binary the challenges that this presents are worth examining given the increasing visibility of transgender and gender diverse children in the public sphere charlotte is also depicted pressuring carrie to attend one of her daughter s piano recitals at the prestigious manhattan school of music she repeats the name of the musical academy so many times it s no longer a semi funny classic charlotte move but a bloated display of class privilege her new friendship with lisa todd wexley played by accomplished black actor nicole ari parker is also problematic instead of exploring the dynamics of racialized friendships wexley s character is lauded for being on vogue s best dressed list she s even called black charlotte which is racist and drains the character of any attributes of her own carrie seeing carrie behind the computer screen reminds me that she has an occupation other than being on a podcast beyond her generational reach she s the white cis woman on the podcast amongst a team of racialized and non binary hosts carrie appears to be there to represent white women but the idea that such a representation is needed smacks of dated racialized privilege or what feminist scholars call political whiteness when carrie is asked to join sexy confessional dialogue in a meaningful way on the podcast she is shocked but how could someone be shocked who decades earlier called out the orgasm gap way before anyone else it was pretty revolutionary as jordin wiggins founder of the pleasure collective discusses in her book the pink canary women in mid life don t need pearl clutching when it comes to talking about sexuality we need to see women owning their desire and using their erotic voice closets to climb back into as i watched miranda charlotte and carrie stroll around in expensive clothes with beautifully coiffed hair and music school memberships i was struck by the stain of their white richness i used to relate to them when they were struggling in their careers and relationships but now in their palatial new york city apartments with massive walk in closets it doesn t feel right the uptake of shows like maid i may destroy you and sex education demonstrate what viewing audiences want to see they want to see themselves in their socio economic racialized and embodied diversity just like the crumbling patriarchy the reign of the white cis hetero woman is coming to an end as the predominant representation of women it s far from the only kind of show that sells the old version of satc not only reflected our society at the time but it also helped change it in a lot of ways will the ladies of the upper east side ever step up their blahniks author treena orchard associate professor school of health studies western university

patients at home rapid tests can be purchased at a pharmacy and done at home with results available in minutes rapid tests typically identify antigens proteins on the surface of the coronavirus while

cnn president joe biden aimed to reassure americans that if they are vaccinated they can still proceed with their holiday plans without fear of becoming seriously ill i know some americans are wondering if you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends the answer is yes you can if you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated particularly if you ve gotten your booster shot biden said in a white house speech tuesday conversely he warned those who have not yet received shots of the potential for severe illness or death in the coming months all these people who have not been vaccinated you have an obligation to yourselves to your family and quite frankly to your country get vaccinated now it s free it s convenient and it saves lives he said biden announced tuesday the purchase of a half billion at home rapid covid 19 tests one of a series of new steps he unveiled in a speech that came as the country faces a potentially crippling wintertime surge of infections the 500 million new tests will be made available next month and will reach americans through the mail the official said the administration is still working to determine how many tests each household may request in a call on tuesday senior administration officials were unable to provide any new details about exactly when the website to request the tests will launch and how quickly tests will be shipped out we re working through all the details and we ll have those in the coming weeks a senior administration official said during a briefing with cnn the official said the first deliveries of those tests will happen in january and that the website will launch in january or around january as well the official also said the white house is working through all the details when asked how americans without internet access could secure tests the new test shipment scheme came during remarks meant to underscore the white house s plan to confront what is expected to be a large spike in cases driven by the now dominant omicron variant in the coming weeks already cases are rising rapidly in areas around the country and hospitals are nearing capacity among the president s new initiatives is a plan to prepare 1 000 military service members to deploy to overburdened hospitals across the country in january and february administration officials said those service members will include doctors nurses medics and other military medical personnel an official said god willing the full 1 000 wouldn t be needed but if we do they are ready and they re mobilized the president will tell the american people if they re vaccinated and follow the precautions we all know well especially masking while traveling they should feel comfortable celebrating christmas and the holidays as they planned a senior administration official said ahead of time previewing a speech that biden hopes will reassure anxious americans ahead of the festive season by contrast biden warned the tens of millions of americans who have so far declined to get shots that they run a high risk of becoming ill or hospitalized as the highly transmissible omicron variant spreads rapidly across the country biden also announced new vaccination sites and increased vaccine access and will deploy hundreds of additional federal vaccinators who will help add thousands of appointments each week the official said though demand for vaccines has dwindled in recent months the surge caused by the delta variant earlier this year did lead to increased demand for vaccinations in some of the hardest hit areas biden also addressed fema efforts to expand hospital capacity and to pre position medical supplies in places where stocks may run low in the coming weeks the speech coming just days before christmas reflects biden s renewed focus on the coronavirus pandemic as anxiety rises around the country at the potential for new restrictions and lockdowns lines for testing centers have stretched for blocks in certain areas including the northeast leading the white house to develop plans to open new federal testing sites in new york city before christmas distributing free at home tests to all americans was written off by the white house as recently as this month press secretary jen psaki scoffed earlier this month when asked if tests should be free and given out available everywhere should we just send one to every american she asked while the white house plan announced tuesday does not ship test to every american people would request the tests online instead those who utilize them will not have to report their results to public health agencies officials said pressed on that shift a senior administration official insisted that the new plan builds on the administration s previous testing initiatives and pointed to increased supply for the first time in the course of this pandemic because of all the actions we ve taken because of fda authorizing a lot of tests because we created the market because we ve used the defense production act consistently for the last 11 months we have the ability to make this purchase we have the manufacturing capacity for a massive purchase like that starting in january the official said if there s more we can do we will do it the official also pointed out that demand for tests has spiked now amid the omicron surge and the holiday season and said that the government s purchase of 500 million tests is an extra layer on top of existing commercial supply the administration had already announced a plan requiring health insurance providers to reimburse plan holders for the cost of at home tests that initiative remains in place next year in his remarks biden acknowledged a likely rise in cases including among vaccinated people but emphasized the drastically different outcomes for those with shots and those unprotected by vaccines biden and his team have been adamant that federal lockdown recommendations aren t in the cards this time and in his remarks biden will focus on steps primarily to forestall a crippling of the us public health system than on efforts to fully stop the spread of the virus
