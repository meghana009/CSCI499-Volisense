the pharmaceutical industry has yet to discover how nitrosamines occur in its drugs and how to mitigate the risk of that happening if you had bacon for breakfast you may have ingested some nitrosamines the organic compounds that were also found in sanofi s zantac and spurred a recall of the blockbuster heartburn treatment four years ago the recall created an opportunity for legal action by patients who had been taking the drug and the first court case is set to begin in february 2023 in california consequently the industry has been challenged with how to discover how nitrosamines occur in its drugs and how to mitigate the risk of that happening the fda has issued guidance on allowable amounts in drugs and physician and patients look to find alternative treatment if necessary all three stakeholders are trying to assess the risk of getting cancer from the nitrosamines and recent studies have shown the risk to be relatively low according to the fda nitrosamines are common in water and foods including cured and grilled meats dairy products and vegetables everyone is exposed to some level of nitrosamines zantac trial impact in the case of zantac more than 3 100 plaintiffs have filed suits against sanofi claiming that the company didn t warn of the potential danger of nitrosamines in the drug according to a recent bloomberg report the company is at risk of losing a ton of money trial judgments against sanofi could reach 45 billion sanofi has repeatedly denied any liability and analysts have stated they are doubtful the plaintiff s case has merit since 2019 the medical scientific and regulatory communities have extensively evaluated the safety of zantac s active ingredient ranitidine and the data shows there is no evidence of consumer harm from real world use of zantac sanofi said in a recent press release in the bloomberg report george gray professor at george washington university who specializes in health related risk analysis says it really is hard to say just how big the risk of these medications might be especially given the benefit they might confer on people sanofi s statement helped correct its stock price which fell on the news of the lawsuit both fda and the european medicines agency evaluated the available data and found no evidence that zantac causes cancer fda in collaboration with regulatory counterparts around the world has set internationally recognized acceptable daily intake limits for nitrosamines if drugs contain levels of nitrosamines above the acceptable daily intake limits fda recommends these drugs be recalled by the manufacturer as appropriate nitrosamine impurities may increase the risk of cancer if people are exposed to them above acceptable levels and over long periods of time but a person taking a drug that contains nitrosamines at or below the acceptable daily intake limits every day for 70 years is not expected to have an increased risk of cancer the fda states since the recalls and fda s tightened regulation the industry is still struggling with how to identify all the causes that create nitrosamine in medications and to prevent it from happening where and when the impurities may occur is a complicated problem caused by numerable factors ranging from something as straightforward as material used in blister packs to chemical interactions that occur before during and after the drug making process impact on physicians and patients the fda has offered guidance to physicians and patients recommending physicians continue to prescribe medications when clinically appropriate and educate patients about alternative treatment options both pharmacists and prescribers may be able to dispense the same medication from a manufacturing lot that has not been recalled patients can find medications that have been recalled due to potential nitrosamine impurities on the fda recalls webpage
u s equity markets tumbled on the week after the federal reserve delivered another supersized interest rate hike and chair jerome h powell signaled the economy will have to slow sharply for inflation to ease the s p 500 index dropped 4 6 percent in the five day period the benchmark gauge briefly sank past its bear market low of 3 666 set in june before a last hour bounce friday left it at 3 693 the dow jones industrial average fell 4 percent over the same period to its lowest since 2020 while the nasdaq plunged 5 1 percent the fed raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point for a third straight meeting and powell warned there is no painless way to get inflation down more than a dozen central banks around the world also tightened policy threatening a global slowdown that roiled assets from treasurys to the british pound advertisement signs are emerging that central bank tightening is tearing through the economy the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage climbed to 6 29 percent the highest level since 2008 wall street banks also issued warnings that further fed tightening will leave credit spreads vulnerable share this article share the danger is that the fed will raise rates to levels that are too high said chris gaffney president of world markets at tiaa bank confidence in the central bank has already been shaken he said i think pretty much everyone is nervous about where we re heading and question where and how the global economy is going to react to these higher interest rates gaffney said in an interview the fed s focus on inflation sent treasury yields surging with most benchmarks rising to their highest levels of the past decade the pound fell to its lowest level vs the dollar since 1985 advertisement oil suffered its longest stretch of weekly losses this year west texas intermediate dropped below 80 a barrel for the first time since january and posted a fourth straight week of declines market watchers will hear from powell again tuesday while a raft of other fed officials are scheduled to make public comments
on friday s broadcast of msnbc s hallie jackson reports white house communications director kate bedingfield responded to the stock market falling and how that squares with the white house s upbeat economic messaging by saying there are very encouraging signs that we re making significant economic progress like inflation being effectively flat over the last couple of months and that republicans want to take away voting and abortion rights host hallie jackson asked republicans kate are making clear they re going to run as you know partly on the inflation and the economy as we have this split screen now today for example with the markets falling down something like 800 points on those higher interest rates how do you square that with the optimism that the white house has projected about economic conditions ahead of the midterms bedingfield responded well look first of all there are very encouraging signs that we re making significant economic progress i mean under the biden presidency we ve created a historic number of jobs real wages are up over the last couple of months inflation has been flat or effectively flat over the last couple of months gas prices have fallen for 14 consecutive weeks in a row so we are seeing really encouraging signs here and i think what s important is and you heard the president talk about this today there is a real choice for people there s a choice between an agenda that congressional republicans are putting forward that is about taking us backward that is about stripping people of their rights stripping women of the right to choose stripping people of the right to vote and or the biden and congressional democratic agenda which is about lowering costs protecting your rights tackling the climate crisis pushing for an assault weapons ban i mean these are things that are going to make a difference in people s lives the choice could not be clearer here and i think you saw that laid out really clearly by both the president and by mr mccarthy today follow ian hanchett on twitter ianhanchett
i propose a simpler alternative check the buy and hold return of an average joe shareholder who bought stock on the grant date of ceo s stock option grant and sells such equity on the vesting date compare that return with reasonable benchmarks such as the s p 500 or the firm s cost of equity capital if the average joe loses money with reference to these benchmarks does the ceo deserve to be paid performance based compensation ceo pay for performance getty the sec just issued a set of final rules in its continuing effort to bring greater transparency to pay for performance for ceos in its latest instalment the sec requires companies to publish among other things fair value changes during the year for previously issued equity awards this is a good first step but does not really get to the heart of the debate on top of that there is whole scale confusion about how to think of pay for performance in the existing academic literature researchers run regressions of annual pay on either contemporaneous or lagged stock returns and or earnings and assume that higher explanatory power r squared in the jargon suggests more pay for performance some of this thinking is also reflected in the sec s rule here is what i would have proposed instead if i were the sec if ceo pay actually reflects shareholder performance the ceo needs to internalize the pain felt by the shareholder hence i would run the following thought experiment assume an average joe shareholder bought say ibm s stock on the same day as the day on which the ceo was granted stock options by the compensation committee further assume that the average joe shareholder sells ibm s stock on the day the option stock vests as a part of the ceo s package compute the return inclusive of dividends paid during this period that the average joe earned compare the return that average joe earned with some reasonable benchmark i a reasonable estimate of cost of equity capital or ii how the overall market index such as s p 500 or the sector index that the firm is closely affiliated with if the average joe did not earn a reasonable return relative to some agreed upon benchmark then institutional investors need to ask if the ceo deserved a vesting of the option equity grant let me explain using the concrete example of ibm the 2022 ibm proxy statement states on page 54 that arvind krishna ceo of ibm vested 151 030 shares valued at 20 2 million i could trace exact grant dates nature of the grant rsus or restricted stock units or psus or performance stock units or rrsu or retention restricted stock units or rpsu or retention performance share units for 145 312 of these shares valued at 18 6 million tracing these details takes a fair amount of detective work as i had to compare the unvested shares as reported in the 2022 ibm proxy covering year ended 12 31 21 with that of the 2021 ibm proxy covering year ended 12 31 20 consider the following table that summarizes the work ibm pay for performance shiva rajgopal to understand the calculations let us consider the first rsu grant in the table given out on 6 8 2017 it was not immediately obvious to me when that rsu grant actually vested in the calendar year 2021 so i have assumed all vesting dates in 2021 are set to 12 31 21 if our average joe had bought ibm stock on 6 8 2017 and had sold that stock on 12 31 21 he would have made 13 7 inclusive of dividends had average joe instead invested the same money in the s p 500 index he would have made 95 83 instead had he placed these funds in the s p it index he would earned a whopping 210 29 if you assume a modest 7 cost of equity capital for ibm the stock must have returned at least 24 5 over the three and half period under consideration for the 6 8 2017 grant despite such massive underperformance ibm s ceo vested that grant of 2 250 shares valued at 301 500 and pretty much all of 18 6 million package that is because the exact same intuition is repeated in grant after grant as seen from column 6 which computes buy and hold dividend adjusted return for many more average joe experiments for every grant that vested in 2021 column 6 shows the yawning gap between what average joe made relative to the alternatives such as the s p 500 and the s p it index it is hopefully clear that the entire package of 18 6 million i looked at is far from pay from performance the private equity folks that i have spoken to love my methodology directors and ceos of public companies as expected are not fans of this metric they often say things like oh we need to pay the guy otherwise he will simply quit that s fine call the 18 5 million payment a retention bonus and avoid referring to pay for performance in the proxy statement why is my method better than the one the sec proposes the sec s table only considers the fair value change of the stock or option awards for the year most option and stock awards vest between two and five years unless the buy and hold return of that entire vesting period spanning the grant date to the actual vesting date is considered and laid out in the manner i outline it is hard to perform the average joe calculations i propose the open question of course is whether institutional investors or at least state pension funds will press management harder on ceo compensation based on my average joe calculations we may then really move to a world where pay tracks performance in corporate america
area residents are facing larger water bills due to a may 8 regulatory ruling for the eagle river issued by the colorado water quality control commission vail daily archive the eagle river seems to have largely recovered from an aug 16 sediment flow the sediment flowing into the river from alkali creek just west of wolcott muddied the river almost to eby creek in eagle almost 10 miles downstream the sediment literally choked an untold number of fish and forced many others to swim downstream for safety kendall bakich an aquatic biologist with colorado parks and wildlife said it s impossible to know how many fish died in the incident since the river was running significantly lower than normal over the summer there was less water available from upstream to flush the sediment choked stretch of stream bakich said the sediment dump lasted a few hours with the discoloration also called turbidity lasting another week or so eagle river anglers owner bob nock saw the initial sediment flow into the river he also quickly saw fish gasping as silt filled their gills support local journalism donate bakich noted that other witnesses saw dying fish on the banks of the river nock said one of his customers has permission to fish on private property just east of eagle that customer saw perhaps 80 or so dead fish on the river s banks in addition to the immediate damage to the fish population bakich said silt from the flow has also settled into the bottom of the stream that in turn has affected populations of macroinvertabrates small bugs that provide much of the food source for fish while the loss of hundreds of fish is significant nock said the sediment flow wasn t catastrophic on a stretch of river that can have as many as 2 500 fish per mile bakish said bugs and fish will often leave an inhospitable stretch of river bugs usually travel downstream and fish will move upstream or downstream as they re able nock said that part of the eagle is now back to fishing as it usually does nock owns property on both the east and west sides of eby creek road between interstate 70 and u s highway 6 that bit of river isn t open for fishing and nock said he s seeing normal numbers of fish running through his property nock added that his customers are catching fish on the eagle about as successfully as usual still he added it was a disturbing thing to watch the tributary creeks between wolcott and eagle are well known for dumping sediment into the river during and just after downpours but something about the aug 16 storm was different she said with even more sediment than usual pouring into the river bakich and other state officials are talking to their counterparts from the bureau of land management about possible ways to mitigate future sediment flows but she said mitigation is difficult in that kind of natural terrain for instance sediment catch ponds or beaver ponds can be helpful but are only useful if they are emptied regularly bakich said colorado parks and wildlife will in 2023 stock additional fish in the eagle between wolcott and eagle the fish a whirling disease resistant strain of rainbow trout are aggressive feeders bakich said they jump and are very dramatic she said they re fun to catch
town planning director tony fields briefed the housing partnership at a recent meeting on a range of ongoing and proposed projects and policies that could expand bedford s inventory of affordable housing fields cited efforts to realize goals identified in a 2019 townwide housing study these include diversifying the housing stock to better serve the various types of households that have been identified he outlined current efforts by the planning board to ease the restrictions on two family dwellings explaining at some point the town decided it wanted to slow its pace of growth so it adopted a variety of zoning measures that made it harder to build and eliminated two family dwellings altogether the proposed zoning amendment will give the choice of a two family house effectively the same size as a new single family house on the same parcel the goal is to provide more middle housing types that become more affordable to a broader range of people he said among the other housing study areas fields addressed were accessory units a recent zoning change provides a homeowner a chance to build an accessory apartment in your house or as a freestanding detached unit co living and congregate housing now effectively prohibited almost throughout massachusetts fields said a wide ranging housing proposal for land off carlisle road dropped a co housing component because it didn t fit into the state law that would allow the project to bypass zoning you can create special rules that don t bypass zoning at the moment that s the only way you can do co housing mixed use housing the latest example is targeted for plank street off middlesex turnpike 52 one bedroom units plus 6 000 square feet of office space fields also addressed the continuing practice of teardown and rebuild we have quite a number of 1950s ranches and capes that are comparatively affordable when they hit the market he described builders are going to pay 600 000 for that house regardless of its condition because their intent is to knock it down and build something bigger in its place that s very difficult to overcome we are examining in case there are some strategies we can put forward fields also outlined the challenges faced by the town to comply with a new state multi family housing mandate that applies to cities and towns served by the massachusetts bay transportation authority required are at least 50 acres zoned for housing by right with a density of at least 15 units per acre he explained bedford s mixed use zoning promotes housing above or behind commercial uses and these regulations are sufficient to comply with the state density requirement but the state has now said you can t require the units to be part of a mixed use project he said the multi family must be allowed to build on its own that means we have to think about some other strategies fields told the partnership we don t want to put this on farmland or forest land on the edge of town where there are no services middlesex turnpike which is served not only by the mbta but also by a bus of the lowell regional transit authority has some potential he said the planning board is going to revisit that there are other properties along that corridor the penalty for non compliance is loss of eligibility for various funding sources he noted in answer to a question from jeff king the town s housing and economic development director fields said housing partnership advocacy would be especially helpful in support of zoning amendments at annual town meeting next spring

jamie lima a certified financial planner near san diego said he still has nightmares about studying for his series 7 license to sell general securities while at morgan stanley in the mid 2000s when you worked for morgan stanley then it was basically here s an office and here are the study materials lima said pass the test or you don t have a job so when he was looking to open his own financial advisory firms more than a decade later he was loath to lose his series 7 that allowed him to deal in stocks corporate and municipal bonds and similar products at the same time he didn t want to deal with the compliance burden that would come with keeping the license especially when he needed to devote his energy and time to his new business the advisory firm he eventually opened in ramona california in june 2020 woodson wealth management would not be trading in securities so there was no need for the series 7 license at least in the immediate future still he could hardly bear the thought of taking that exam again should he want that license at a later date fortunately for him as he later learned a finra policy taking effect on march 15 enabled him to regain his license again for as many as five years after it had lapsed as long as he completes continuing education courses once a year now two new model rules adopted by the north american securities administrators association on sept 19 aim to offer the same benefits to broker dealers and investment advisors registered with state regulators these rules are designed to provide flexibility for currently registered persons who due to various reasons may need to leave and then return to their positions nasaa president melanie senter lubin said in a statement the requirements in the rule to meet continuing education requirements will help ensure these individuals remain current on regulatory requirements and industry developments stephen bouchard chairman of nasaa s broker dealer section committee and associate commissioner of securities in the district of columbia department of insurance securities banking said nasaa s model rules are mainly meant to ensure state regulators policies mirror finra s it behooved the state to consider cooperating and coordinating with this in order to maintain what has been historical consistency bouchard said even with the opportunity to reclaim his series 7 license without taking another exam lima has no immediate intentions of dealing in stocks bonds and other securities but his firm is still growing so why shut off opportunities we are always looking for new strategies and trying to find advisors with other areas of expertise to bring on to the team lima said opening a new firm is only one of many reasons an advisor might want to allow a lapse with finra or state regulators to lapse for a bit for others it s the birth of a child the need to take care of an ailing relative or a serious illness before the adoption of finra s new policy brokers and advisors could let their licenses lapse for only two years before they d have to take an exam again federal regulators decided that was too short a period for people dealing with major life events finra s policy allows brokers and advisors whose registrations were terminated to sign up for continuing education through its so called maintaining qualifications program to qualify a person must have allowed their registration to lapse on or after march 15 must sign up for the program within two years of their registration s termination and not be subject to statutory qualification because of a criminal record or disciplinary matters finra offers continuing education courses on a wide variety of topics most of which are taught online since nasaa s model rules are only policy recommendations they still await official adoption by individual states lima said he can only welcome the rule change he estimated he already spends about 60 hours a year on continuing education to maintain the licenses he needs to be a financial advisor a few more hours a year is not too much to ask especially if that allows him to keep a license he had to work so hard to get in the first place i did work really hard for that license he said
politics government skokie approves 494 apartment development largest in over a decade village trustees approved a plan by the gidwitz family to build a pair of three story buildings at the corner of touhy and linder avenues a rendering shows plans for a mixed use development planned for a 6 2 acre site in skokie linder touhy llc via village of skokie skokie il the village board on monday approved plans to construct a three story mixed use development across the street from the village crossing shopping center it s largest residential development in the village since the completion of the optima old orchard woods project in 2010 the 6 2 acre site at the northeast corner of touhy and linder avenues has been owned by the gidwitz family for decades according to representatives of the developer scott gidwitz grandson of the founder of cosmetics and beauty products company helene curtis industries is now the principal of the real estate investment and development firm bissel street his father ron is a former candidate for the republican nomination for illinois governor and the state s finance chairman for 2016 presidential campaign of donald trump who in 2018 appointed the highland park native as ambassador to belgium and in 2020 named him acting representative of the u s to the european union at monday s skokie village board meeting the younger gidwitz told trustees the current commercial buildings at the site are functionally obsolete and so he has spent the past three and a half years working with village staff to come up with the two phase development plan in addition to 494 new apartment units 251 in one and 243 in the other the building will feature 30 000 square feet of retail space mostly on touhy avenue and another 5 000 square feet earmarked for a potential cannabis dispensary along linder avenue gidwitz said scott gidwitz a former executive at the john buck company and the son of former u s ambassador to belgium ron gidwitz appeared before the skokie village board on sept 19 2022 ahead of a vote on a planned 494 unit mixed use development in the village village of skokie via video we are striving to be the most environmentally sustainable project in skokie and hopefully the north shore gidwitz said we propose to finance the construction from private sources only and we are seeking zero public dollars and no tif dollars attorney steve elrod appeared at monday s meeting on behalf of the developer we really do believe that this is a terrific and much needed project for skokie it s a significant improvement over what is there now it s a state of the art development and it brings fresh housing stock into an area of skokie that will thrive from it he said elrod said he appreciated the good intentions of residents who have called for some units in the project to be set aside for affordable housing but he noted that the village has never required developers include affordable housing in projects despite that skokie ranks among the top towns in the region when it comes to the portion of housing units deemed affordable higher than nearby towns like arlington heights evanston and highland park that have ordinances mandating affordable housing units in new developments said elrod whose firm represents both developers and north shore municipalities elrod said the development would not have been proposed if the village had an ordinance on the books requiring the inclusion of affordable units it s just that the economics for this development would not work with that requirement he said a rendering shows an eye level view from the southwest of a planned mixed use development at the corner of touhy and linder avenues linder touhy llc via village of skokie village attorney mike lorge said he and village manager john lockerby had previously spoken to city officials in highland park about their affordable housing policies that investigation and that research did not ultimately lead to an ordinance in front of this board lorge said so we did have that discussion and it was looking to see at what highland park had done and how they had done it mayor george van dusen said the economic diversity of the village s housing market has long been one of the things attractive to homebuyers and expressed doubt that an inclusionary housing ordinance would help the market in our case has worked we have 19 7 percent affordable housing in the village of skokie and you don t disincentivize inclusionary zoning has been shown to disincentivize van dusen said our staff knows that where we possibly can we try to create low and moderate income housing and it has worked we are almost twice what the state of illinois has established as the standard 10 percent it s niles skokie evanston and then everybody else is below 10 percent he said suggesting if other towns followed skokie s suit it would help alleviate the state s housing affordability crisis but you don t solve it by putting straightjackets on developers the mayor said if you do developers simply go elsewhere several residents in attendance at the meeting questioned the board s decision to allow the development to proceed without requiring they include any affordable units creating close to 500 units of luxury housing will absolutely increase rents throughout skokie it will absolutely make skokie less affordable than it is now i would plead with you to consider an affordable housing ordinance ted smukler said evanston and highland park and arlington heights fairly wealthy communities they set aside units for affordable housing and the developers there are not saying that they could not complete the projects with any affordable units he added i think people who want to make money on our village should give something back

pros pect of giving more of their hard earned income to the government than they did the year before thanks to washington s irresponsible fiscal behavior in 199 1 as the result of presi dent george bush s 1990 budget deal with the congress americans paid over 20 billion in new taxes including higher income taxes higher medicare payroll taxes a 5 cents hike in the gasoline tax and other extra taxes in 1994 as the result of president bill clinton s 1993 budget deal with congress taxpayers are paying nearly 35 billion in new taxes in cluding higher income taxes higher medicare payroll taxes and the new 4 3 cent per gal ion gasoline tax among many other levies congress did not have to punish taxpayers to reduce the deficit however congressional republicans who recognized that the five year clinton plan looked remarkably similar to bush s unsuccessful 1990 budget deal but with almost twice the total amount of taxes pre sented alternative plans to cut the deficit that relied solely on spending cuts by all ac counts these plans would have made a substantial dent in the federal deficit without the sti fling effects of a new round of tax hikes but while these plans were admirable for their avoidance of new taxes and their focus on spending as the real fiscal problem they would not have corrected the long term damage due to previous tax increases what taxpayers and the economy need in addition to deficit reduction is a remedy from years of misguided tax increases that were intended to reduce the deficit and yet had the op posite effect those in particular need of tax relief are families with childmn who have seen an ever larger portion of their income go to un cle sam during the past four decades the federal income tax burden on a family of four has increased by over 300 percent as a share of family income senior citizens who are severely penalized for trying to supplement their social secu rity benefits by working and who now face a punitive surtax on their savings and pen sions 2 v investors entrepreneurs and risk takers whose incentive to start businesses and cre ate new jobs is dramatically reduced by excessive taxation of capital and income for instance an investor s profits if any are reduced by a plethora of taxes such as cor porate and personal income taxes the capital gains tax the double taxation of divi dends and depreciation allowances convinced that far more than spending reduction is needed to spur the economy create jobs and reverse the rising tax burden on american families a group of nearly eighty law makers in the house and twelve in the senate have proposed a unique alternative eco nomic plan called the family investment retirement savings and tax fairness act of 1993 h r 3645 and s 1576 the house members are led by rod grains r mn and tim hutchinson r ar and the senate sponsors by dan coats r in the families first plan as it is also known takes a giant step toward undoing the dam age wrought by washington s last two budget deals the grams coats plan channels nearly 200 billion now spent by the federal government back into the economy in tax re lief over five years 135 billion for families with children 26 billion for seniors who work and 38 billion for entrepreneurs and investors it stems the tide of washington s red ink by capping the annual growth of federal spending at two percent saving 542 bil lion over five years such a growth rate not only affords tax relief but also puts the budget toward balance by fiscal year 2001 while this plan may not return taxpayers to where they were before washington steered off course with damaging economic policies it is an important first step down the road of taking resources back from government and returning them to hardworking families and productive businesses a real alternative the families first plan the families first plan h r 3645 and s 1576 is based in large measure on a proposal developed in february 1993 by the staff of the heritage foundation 3 families first is based on the principle that prudent fiscal policy should do three things reduce government spending and borrowing stimulate new investment through tax incentives and reverse the growing tax burden on american families the plan outlined in h r 3645 and s 1576 is a five year 542 billion package that would v cut the deficit to 70 billion by fiscal 1999 and balance the budget by fiscal 200 1 v grant 135 billion in family tax relief v put 26 billion back in the pockets of the working elderly v provide nearly 38 billion in tax incentives for investment to stimulate economic growth and job creation to achieve these results h r 3645 and s 1576 contain six major policy components the measure would 4 1 cap the annual growth of total federal spending at two percent according to recent congressional budget office cb0 estimates made after the pas sage of clinton s deficit reduction bill baseline federal spending growth assuming no ad ditional changes in current law will average 4 5 percent per year over the next five fiscal years or 1 8 times the projected inflation rate 5 federal spending is expected to grow even faster over the long term averaging 5 0 percent per year through fiscal 2003 this growth rate will push total federal spending to some 2 3 trillion by that year the families first plan caps this annual growth rate of federal spending at two percent beginning in fiscal 1995 this would yield 542 billion in total program savings below the baseline growth rate over five years and 2 1 trillion through fiscal 2003 the table on the next page displays the annual savings resulting from this cap as calculated by the cbo the bill not only states that annual spending shall not grow faster than two percent above the previous year s level it also puts the dollar amount of the caps in law much like the federal debt ceiling is specified in law this means that congress and the president cannot adjust the caps upward for technical and economic reasons as the discretionary caps in current law permit capping total spending at two percent does not mean every program must grow at that rate it means that taken together programs cannot exceed that limit so if some programs grow faster than two percent others must grow slower and others may have to be termi nated the two percent cap would be enforced by a sequester this means there would be automatic across the board spending reductions if congress failed to lower spending on in dividual programs sufficiently below the targeted spending levels by making cuts in spe cific programs however the plan does exempt social security benefits from a sequester 2 give every working family in america a 500 tax credit for each child the plan uses 135 billion of the savings obtained from the spending cap to provide a 500 per child tax credit for every working family 7be plan indexes the credit to the infla tion rate raising its value to roughly 560 after five years the tax credit is non refund able this means that the total value of the credits a worker takes cannot exceed the worker s total tax liability income and payroll taxes combined if a truck driver with two children for example had a combined income and payroll tax liability of 900 this worker could deduct only 900 not l 000 from his taxes the parents of some 51 million american children are eligible for such a tax credit at 500 per child the fn st year revenue loss to the treasury due to the credit would be about 25 5 billion by fiscal 1999 indexation would push this revenue loss to an estimated 28 4 billion this portion of h r 3645 and s 1576 would not increase the deficit how ever because the plan more than offsets these lost revenues with reductions in government spending family tax relief is the centerpiece of the legislation

growth tax cuts the plan dedicates 38 billion of the savings over five years from the spending cap to fund tax cuts that will generate the new private investment needed to increase the produc tivity of american workers and thereby boost real wage growth as indicated in the table on the previous page there are three key components to the eco nomic growth portion of the plan each of these has been scored on the basis of a static economic model the type of model used by federal budget estimators 6 the net revenue loss of these three measures is some 38 billion over five years but as with the family tax cut the revenues lost to the treasury from these tax cuts are offset by an equal reduction in federal spending making this portion of the plan also deficit neutral tax cut 11 expand individual retirement accounts in what is called an ira plus plan 7 the joint committee on taxation estimates this element of families first raises 3 5 billion over five years individual retirement accounts ip as reduce the tax bias against savings by deferring taxes on income up to 2 000 per year placed into these special accounts however this income and the interest generated by these savings are taxed when retirees begin to with draw from their accounts the prudence of saving for retirement is now being punished even more following the passage of bill clinton s massive tax increase the new tax law contains a provision amending the internal revenue code section 86 to create a second bracket for the elderly surtax on pensions ira withdrawals interest from municipal bonds certificates of deposit and other income this new second bracket starts at 34 000 44 000 for married couples 8 although this elderly surtax has been called a tax on social security benefits it is actu ally a tax on the savings of those americans who have planned wisely for their retirement by supplementing their social security pension regardless of their level of income during their working years since even the maximum social security benefit is below the thresh old 20 304 for a married couple in 1993 and 13 546 for a single beneficiary the social security pension itself is not actually taxed the elderly surtax falls on other income from savings which punishes anyone who has prepared carefully for retirement the families first plan offers a way for taxpayers to avoid these punishing taxes in re tirement by creating a new individual retirement plus account ira plus contributions to the new ira plus account would be made from post tax income but the interest from such savings would not be taxed upon withdrawal if the contributions remained in the ac count for at least five years an eka plus account gives workers the incentive to save to day in order to reap tax savings in retirement initially contributions to the ira plus plan would be limited to 2 000 per taxpayer per year but this limit would be raised to 3 000 after 1996 in subsequent years the maxi many experts believe that reducing the tax rate on savings and investment would so stimulate economic growth that overall federal tax revenues would rise thus according to these analysts tax cuts on investment and savings would help reduce the deficit however this view is not shared by the congressional budget office or the joint committee on taxation of the congress according to the economic models employed by these organizations such tax cuts will lose money for the treasury thus these tax cuts must be paid foe by either increases in taxes elsewhere or via spending cuts while heritage analysts disagree with this latter view cbo revenue loss estimates are being assumed for the purposes of this plan tax cut 2 enact a neutral cost recovery plan for capital investments the joint committee on taxation estimates this plan will generate 11 6 billion over five years under current law businesses must write off capital investments from their tax liability over a number of years equipment purchases for example are written off over asset lives of between three and twenty years and plant or company buildings can be written off over periods as long as 31 5 years this policy is quite different from all other business ex penses which can be deducted in the year of purchase called full expensing the value of a long term write off is less than the original cost of the investment because the amounts deducted in later years lose their value due to inflation and the time value of money under current law for example a company that writes off a 1 000 machine over ten years may recover only 80 percent of the present value of the investment 9 the families first plan corrects these penalties in the tax code by indexing the deprecia tion schedules for business investments to inflation and the time value of money this ele ment of families first is patterned after the investment tax incentive act of 1993 h r 539 introduced earlier this year by representative nick smith r m such a change in the tax code would give businesses the present value equivalent of immediate expensing of any major investment in new plant or equipment 10 by correcting this flaw in the tax code washington would help ehcourage businesses to invest more heavily in america s future economic growth taxcut 3 lower the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15 percent and index the original cost of the investment to the rate of inflation i i the joint committee on taxation estimates this component of the plan will lose nearly 53 billion over five years the u s tax code unfairly and unwisely punishes capital investment by taxing invest ment income twice the first time through corporate and individual income taxes and the second time by taxing the earnings made by after tax investments the current tax rate on capital gains is 28 percent and these gains are not indexed to the inflation rate if in a given year for example the normal depreciation deduction for a prior investment was 100 under current law the new code would give a deduction of 106 6 ibis figure is equal to the 100 deduction times the inflation rate times the real rate of return on the investment the legislation is made revenue neutral by changing the double declining balance also called 200 percent declining balance method of depreciation in current law to a 150 percent declining balance method 11 wallop delay op cit 12 entin and bonilla op cit p 2 13 for most of this century capital gains were treated preferentially at a lower tax rate than ordinary income though as recently as 1978 the maximum capital gains rate was 48 3 percent this rate was reduced to 20 percent in 1982 and stayed at this level until 1986 but the 1986 tax reform act removed the preferential contrast most of america s major economic competitors such as japan and germany ex empt capital gains from taxation entirely or tax these gains at a greatly reduced rate while indexing the basis of the gains to inflation the families first plan lessens this penalty on investment in two ways first it reduces the top capital gains rate to 15 percent for individual and corporate taxpayers second the plan applies this lower rate to the capital gain only after the original cost of the asset has been adjusted for inflation ris widely recognized that the current system unfairly taxes gains without accounting for the effects of inflation on the price of an asset according to the house ways and means committee this means that tax may be paid on increase in the value of an asset even if the real value of the asset has not increased it is possible that the purchasing power represented by the asset s value may not have increased if the asset s value and general price inflation are the same however when sold the increase in value could generate taxable income by lowering the capital gains tax rate and indexing future gains to inflation the families first plan will reward new investment and risk taking and by unleashing billions of dol lars of new capital into the market american businesses will have easier access to re sources for purchase of better machinery tools and equipment for their workers as a re sult workers productivity will rise leading to greater real wage gains and increased stand ards of living for american families 4 repeal the earnings test on social security recipients ages 65 to 69 as mentioned above the cuffent tax code penalizes seniors for having the forethought to save and invest for their retirement by forcing them to pay a steep surtax on income from savings and pensions but the tax code punishes seniors in another way seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 who supplement their retirement income by working lose 33 cents in social security benefits for every 1 they earn over 10 560 this earnings test amounts to an additional 33 percent marginal income tax rate when this rate is added to the 15 per cent federal income tax rate and the 7 65 payroll tax rate a working senior faces a 55 6 per cent tax rate far in excess of the marginal tax rate paid by the wealthiest americans the families first plan repeals the punitive earnings test freeing elderly americans to work without fear of losing their benefits because of the peculiar nature of the earnings test it amounts to a benefit reduction for retirees its repeal is scored by washington budgeteers as an increase in spending not as a tax cut according to the joint committee on taxation repealing the earnings test will increase outlays from the treasury by 26 37 billion over five years but like the tax cut components of the families first plan these added expenditures are fully offset by an equal reduction in federal spending making them treatment of capital gains and raised the rate to 28 percent equal to the maximum rate for ordinary income the recent clinton tax increase raised the top income tax rate to 39 6 percent but the capital gains rate remains at 28 percent once again it must be emphasized that these estimates are based upon static economic models that do not account for the potential increase in tax revenues gener ated by greater numbers of seniors encouraged to reenter the work force 5 apply the remaining 343 billion of these total savings to cutting the deficit by two thirds in fiscal 1999 the plan dedicates the remaining 343 bihion of savings achieved by the spending cap to cut the deficit nearly two thirds in five years this means the fiscal 1999 deficit would fall from 223 billion the current baseline projection to just 70 billion thus the deficit produced by the families first spending caps will consume less than eight tenths of one percent of gross domestic product gdp in fiscal 1999 by contrast the deficits produced by the clinton plan will still consume 2 5 percent of gdp for the remainder of the decade if the two percent annual spending cap were extended for an additional five years the federal budget would be balanced by fiscal 2001 and 104 billion in surplus by fiscal 2003 this contrasts with the nearly 360 billion deficit produced by the clinton plan in that year 6 create a bipartisan commission to identify the specific savings to comply with the two percent cap and enforce the cap with an automatic sequester a key feature of h r 3645 and s 1576 is that each bill would create a bipartisan com mission to identify the policy changes necessary to meet the two percent annual spending caps though there are some differences in the relative design of each bill s commission both are largely modeled on the base realignment and closure commission supporters of the families first plan recognize that few lawmakers are willing to sup port specific spending cuts even if these cuts lead to reducing the deficit or to tax relief this is because lawmakers face severe political pressure if they vote for individual spend ing cuts particularly if their vote means fewer federal dollars for their state or congres sional district this political dynamic was clearly a factor in the recent defeat of the five year 90 billion spending cut plan forwarded by representatives timothy penny d mn and john kasich r oh although this proposal would have cut the growth of federal spending a modest one percent over the next five years that was sizable enough to gener ate considerable opposition from washington s defenders of higher spending special inter ests appropriations committee members and even the white house many members were threatened by committee leaders with the loss of local projects if they voted for the penny kasich plan for nearly a dozen years the same forces prevented the closure of obsolete military bases congress was unable to close a single obsolete military base from 1977 until the creation of the base closing commission as it is known in 1988 but the recommenda tions generated by the commission will lead to the eventual closure or reorganization of over 400 facilities with the minimum amount of political pain this has been made possi ble because the commission is an independent body largely impervious to political pres sure and congress and the president must either approve or reject the commission s rec ommendations in their entirety members of congress thus acquire significant political cover from the fallout accompanying a vote to close a base in their own congressional dis trict the commissions contained in h r 3645 and s 1576 would give similar protection for domestic program cuts the legislation also would allow sensible balanced cuts to be achieved rather than a program of cuts that is distorted by pressure from powerful commit tees and interest groups the commission proposed in the house version of families first would be made up of forty members of congress twenty representatives and twenty senators with an equal number of democrats and republicans the house plan also establishes an advisory coun cil composed of 150 private citizens to assist commission members twenty citizens would be selected at random by the internal revenue service with the remaining members ap pointed by the majority and minority 1 eaders in each chamber of congress the commis sion would have six months to develop its recommendations at which point congress would have seven legislative days to vote up or down on the package without amendment the senate bill s proposed commission is a modification of a deficit reduction cornmis sion outlined in s 119 1 sponsored by senator connie mack r fl and h r 2953 spon sored by representative kasich the commission would be composed of seven members appointed by the president four of these members would be chosen from a list submitted by the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader and the remaining three mem bers would be chosen from a list submitted by the house and senate minority leaders the senale sponsors offanfilies first want 1he commission to be a body of outsiders in title 5 sec 503 of the bill they state no current member of congress employee of the executive branch or current or former registered lobbyist may serve on the commission the goal of this provision is to make the commission as independent of the political proc ess as possible untainted by special interest pressures unlike the commission designed in the house version which has a fixed lifetime of six months to determine the needed spending cuts the senate bill creates an on going commis sion charged with submitting spending cut recominendations each year the original mack kasich bill charged the commission with submitting 65 billion in spending cuts per year until the budget is balanced this mission statement is modified slightly in families first it requires the commission to review all federal spending including entitlement programs in order to identify and recommend specific reduction in any federal project program or activity to assure that aggregate federal spending does not grow at a rate in excess of 2 percent per annum for any fiscal year beginning after 1 4 15 each bill contains a fail safe device if congress failed to approve the commission s rec ommendations or to take any other actions that would keep spending within the cap limita tions in such a circumstance an across the board sequester would take effect to lower spending to the required level social security benefits however would be exempt from the sequester conclusion the family investment retirement savings and tax fairness act of 1993 h r 3645 and s 1576 or families first bill charts a new course in washington s fiscal affairs by re warding americans with tax cuts jobs and economic growth for the inconvenience of lower federal spending growth by contrast the clinton tax biu passed last summer re warded families seniors and the business community with the pain of higher taxes fewer jobs and lower economic growth for accepting the pain of deficit reduction 15 s 1576 tide v sec 502 p 48 16 also excluded of course are prior obligations of the government such as interest payments on the federal debt families first is a solid first step toward undoing the devastating effects of the largest tax increase in american history h r 3645 and s 1576 offer taxpayers the prospect of real long term deficit reduction tax relief rather than tax hikes and economic growth rather than economic stagnation scott a hodge grover m hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs appendix based on census bureau data heritage foundation scholars have calculated the total value of a 500 per child tax credit for each state and congressional district nationally there are nearly 51 million children eligible for such a credit thus in the first year of the plan nearly 25 5 billion would be returned to american families these results are summarized in the first table in this appendix while the number of children in each congressional district varies greatly the average district has 117 000 children at 500 per child this means the average district will receive some 58 7 million in family tax relief each year the second table lists the congressional districts by state included in the table are the number of eligible children in the district the total amount of money the district will receive in family tax relief and the name of the member representing the district heritage analysts also have calculated the value of a 500 per child tax credit for

solid financials and a stable business model make hca an ideal option for risk averse investors a big challenge for investors right now is finding stocks that could potentially weather the storm during a recession if that happens share prices may only end up going lower in the months ahead giving investors little reason to buy stocks today however there are some investments that may not follow that pattern and their resiliency could make them good investments to hang on to even during a downturn one stock which fits those criteria is hca healthcare hca 0 06 which runs 182 hospitals and has 2 200 ambulatory sites of care in the u s and u k the hospital operator s stock has plummeted 19 this year which is only slightly worse than the s p 500 s decline of 18 while the temptation may be to wait out another dip here s why investors may be better off buying the healthcare stock right now recent legislation should help hca last month the government passed the inflation reduction act which will be a big help for low income individuals paying for health insurance the bill extends enhanced affordable care act subsidies which were included in the 2021 american rescue plan act for approximately 13 million people until 2025 without that bill some people may have seen their premiums rise by over 50 those subsidies won t just help the public they will also help add some stability for hca because it won t see a big drop off in patients who are able to afford its care now that the covid 19 public health emergency may be nearing an end people could lose access to medicaid and the enhanced subsidies will minimize that impact hca s business looks a bit safer as a result of the bill s passage as it could also help bolster revenue should a recession take place leading to greater unemployment earnings could get a whole lot stronger president joe biden recently stated that the pandemic is over in the u s regardless of whether it is technically over or not that s not the point for hca as long as the company s hospitals are no longer overrun with covid cases and it doesn t need to take on expensive temporary staff the business should be in much better shape moving forward its operating margins should be better and that will lead to a stronger bottom line even if a recession takes place the big risk for hospitals would be people losing their jobs and losing coverage for health insurance but with the enhanced subsidies still around that alleviates one of the company s largest risks and at the same time without an excessive need for nurses the rest of the company s financials should also be in better shape better profit numbers should also make the stock a much better buy than it is right now in the trailing 12 months the company generated 6 5 billion in profit on revenue of 60 1 billion for a profit margin of around 11 hca s stock is already cheap one more reason to buy hca s stock today is that it s trading at less than 11 times its future profits which is cheaper than the nearly 16 times forward earnings that healthcare stocks average hca s hospitals provide necessary and vital services to millions of people across the country and so the business should make for a stable investment and now with a brighter safer future ahead hca could make for an even better all around buy for long term investors

british chancellor kwasi kwarteng unveiled friday a mini budget in parliament comprised of a debt financed package of 45 billion 49 billion in tax cuts the biggest round in 50 years kwarteng told parliament his fiscal statement was one of the most significant interventions the british state has ever made and the package would turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth this is a new approach for a new era focused on growth he added saying it was based on three priorities reforming the supply side of the economy maintaining a responsible approach to public finances and cutting taxes to boost growth british prime minister liz truss won the recent conservative party leadership race with an explicit commitment to cut taxes friday s fiscal statement was the biggest tax cutting since 1972 the scale of the tax cuts funded through government borrowing while the government is already increasing spending also funded through government borrowing to deal with the energy crisis triggered concern among experts and financial markets kwarteng said the cost of the energy bailout plan would be 60 billion in government borrowing for the first six months alone starting in october tax cuts the headline tax cut announced was the abolition of the top rate of tax which was 45 for those earning more than 150 000 per year from april 2023 the top rate of tax for the highest earners will be 40 the same for those earning 50 271 at the other end of the tax spectrum the 1p cut in the basic rate income tax will be brought forward by one year and take effect in april this means the basic rate will be 19 rather than 20 the corporation tax will remain at 19 with a planned increase to 25 now scrapped a planned increase in alcohol duty was also scrapped stamp duty the tax paid when people buy property will be cut it will be done by doubling the exemption level the point above which it has to be paid from 125 000 to 250 000 and from 300 000 to 425 000 for first time buyers in another controversial move kwarteng announced a cap on bankers bonuses will be scrapped the cap which limited bonuses to twice a banker s salary was introduced in 2008 by the eu following the financial crisis we need global banks to create jobs here invest here and pay taxes here in london not in paris not in frankfurt and not in new york said the chancellor all the bonus cap did was to push up the basic salaries of bankers or drive activity outside europe it never capped total remuneration so let s not sit here and pretend otherwise so we re going to get rid of it from november national insurance contributions or social security payments will also be cut kwarteng announced his intention to create new low tax investment zones with lower taxes for businesses and looser planning rules to encourage investment those on unemployment benefits known in the uk as universal credit will have to take more proactive steps to find more and better paid work or face a reduction in benefits trade union legislation was also tightened with new legislation put forward to force unions to put pay offers to members to a vote vat free shopping was also introduced for overseas visitors nervous reaction the uk is facing multiple and growing economic woes inflation is surging interest rates are rising the country is thought to be tipping into recession and all those factors have contributed to and exacerbated an escalating cost of living crisis the bank of england warned thursday that the uk could already be in recession it also increased interest rates with the level now standing at 2 25 markets are expecting further interest rate hikes as a result of the announcement to keep inflation under control following kwarteng s announcement the pound sank to a 37 year low against the us dollar with the sterling falling below 1 10 for the first time since 1985 so far this year the pound has declined 17 against the greenback it also fell 1 1 against the euro and the ftse 100 share index dropped 2 3 following the announcement unlike margaret thatcher s tax cuts in the 1980s which were funded through public spending cuts kwarteng s package is funded through increased government borrowing which is an approach that has less in common with thatcher and more with former us president ronald reagan as a result of investors selling uk government bonds the cost of government borrowing has increased a year ago the two year cost of borrowing was 0 4 it is now 3 95 this huge fiscal event is a radical economic gamble a go big or go home gamble that will put uk debt on an unstable footing bethany payne a bond portfolio manager at janus henderson investors told the financial times paul johnson director of the institute for fiscal studies was ed by the newspaper as saying the plan seems to be to borrow large sums at increasingly expensive rates put government debt on an unsustainable rising path and hope that we get better growth labour shadow chancellor rachel reeves echoed those sentiments in her response to kwarteng s statement saying truss and himself were two desperate gamblers in a casino chasing a losing run the chancellor has made clear who his priorities are today not a plan for growth a plan to reward the already wealthy a return to the trickle down of the past back to the future not a brave new era said reeves she added the conservatives cannot solve the cost of living crisis the conservatives are the cost of living crisis and the country cannot afford them anymore

indigo books music is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year with a special collection of 28 limited edition books it published in september that includes important titles released in the past quarter century the collection includes canlit classics such as margaret atwood s the handmaid s tale lawrence hill s the book of negroes thomas king s the inconvenient indian alice munro s lives of girls and women and michael ondaatje s the english patient national nonfiction favorites such as chris hadfield s an astronaut s guide to life on earth and orr my story by bobby orr and a selection of contemporary hits such as anthony doerr s all the light you cannot see rupi kaur s milk and honey and tara westover s educated the hardcover books all feature blue endpapers that echo the bookstore s branding and are illustrated with covers created by emerging canadian artists nineteen of the books are canadian 15 are fiction and half are by bipoc writers says rania husseini senior v p for print books at indigo husseini is like many torontonians foreign born originally from palestine she emigrated to canada when she was 16 and eventually joined indigo working her way up through the chain s coles chapters and indigo stores to her position today that experience of having been a young immigrant working in the bookstores informs her buying philosophy when i first walked into a bookstore i did not see myself represented in the books she says now i want to elevate underrepresented voices whether they are indigenous black asian bipoc lgbtq so that everyone who comes into one of our stores from any community sees themselves in the books on the shelves in a further effort to make the experience of shopping at indigo more inclusive the books must also be attainable to buy for this reason the anniversary editions are all priced at c 28 a relatively low price for a hardcover in canada today with some hardcover books now priced as high as c 50 due to inflation we feel the c 28 price point offers customers great value husseini says print runs will be 4 000 6 000 copies each and a total of 115 000 units of the limited editions will hit the shelves when they are gone they are gone she adds yet another important aspect of the selection is that 19 of the books are heather s picks titles that have in the past been personally selected by indigo founder and executive chairman heather reisman for promotion in the stores reisman s imprimatur often bestows instant bestseller status on a book which then continues to sell far longer than is typical she only chooses books that she personally loves and when she picks a book it makes a difference and really extends sales husseini says husseini calls reisman an incredible leader one who is fully committed to canadian books culture and reading early in the pandemic reisman lobbied the canadian government to deem books an essential good saying at the time that reading is fundamental to the soul that point about reisman s commitment to canadian books is important because if there is one issue the store often faces says husseini it s that customers sometimes don t perceive it as being canadian despite the fact that indigo has 88 superstores under the names chapters and indigo and 84 small format stores under the names coles and indigospirit employs some 5 000 people across canada and has no competitor even close to comparable in size yes there is one indigo outpost in the united states in short hills n j but there have been no further plans announced to expand beyond this one location which provides enormous customer insight husseini says over the past decade the chain has gone through something of a reinvention adding a large array of sidelines ranging from beauty products and yoga mats to mugs and throw pillows but the focus husseini says is naturally on books which account for approximately 60 of overall revenue we are especially committed to working with smaller independent canadian publishers many of whom are local to their communities we want to stock our stores so that when a customer comes in they feel like the books were selected especially for them that said if customers don t find a title that speaks to them they can order from a selection of 15 million titles available on indigo s website which is being prepped for a full relaunch this fall the most important thing we did is update it to onix 3 0 husseini says referring to the digital cataloging and metadata standard in addition the redesign will offer more opportunities for the store to talk about books and merchandise products in ways that connect with readers for example books that are trending on tiktok can be front and center last year peter ruis was named president of indigo and on september 5 he was appointed ceo taking over from reisman ruis who is british has 30 years of experience in retail having worked helped turn around several companies including anthropologie and u k luxury department store john lewis indigo began celebrating its anniversary as it began to fully recover from the impact of the pandemic sales for the fiscal year ended april 2 were up 17 from fiscal 2021 to c 1 06 billion about 800 million the chain also posted an operating profit of c 29 million compared to a loss of c 31 9 million in fiscal 2021 indigo s online business had softened the financial blow when stores had to shut their doors to customers but in fiscal 2022 sales through its superstores increased 35 to c 595 5 million while small store sales increased 29 to c93 1 million the gains at the physical stores offset a 13 drop in online sales which fell to c 321 5 million despite that drop online revenue was 98 higher in fiscal 2022 than in fiscal 2020 a year that ended just as the pandemic was shifting into high gear indigo embraced its omnichannel approach to retailing years ago and the move continues to provide benefits the retailer said it saw consumer behavior change over the course of the pandemic with consumers increasingly beginning the discovery process on its digital platforms and buying books or other items at one of its stores as for the future husseini says that the chain s mission is simple to bring the broadest variety of books to the widest audience elevate underrepresented voices and foster inspiration and connection among readers husseini says indigo s philosophy comes down to one question for each customer how can we be a place where they can find inspiration and connect after that the store strives to offer something even more profound a sense of purpose and joy back to main

ottawa sept 23 korea bizwire south korean president yoon suk yeol wound up his second overseas trip amid embarrassment over the use of foul language caught on hot mic but the trip was marked by one unmistakable outcome the first summit with japan in nearly three years yoon began the trip with a stop in london to attend the state funeral of queen elizabeth ii an occasion that also provided the president with the opportunity to meet with new king charles iii and mingle with other leaders who had flown in from across the world despite the solemnity of the events surrounding the funeral yoon whose approval ratings tumbled to the 20 percent range in the summer took another hit from critics at home after he was forced to postpone signing a condolence book for the queen yoon s office said the signing was postponed from sunday to monday the day of the funeral per the instructions of the british royal family given traffic conditions in london that made it difficult for all the visiting foreign leaders to travel to westminster hall at the same time but critics claimed yoon had been snubbed by the british royal family and that leaders from the group of seven nations had received proper care in accordance with diplomatic protocol yoon s second stop was new york where the president spent the largest portion of his seven day trip to attend the u n general assembly hold a series of bilateral summits on the sidelines and meet with diverse groups of people including students korean american scientists and global business leaders in previewing the trip the presidential office had picked three highlights yoon s first address to the u n general assembly the first bilateral summit between south korea and japan in nearly three years and a second summit between yoon and u s president joe biden the south korea japan summit in particular raised hope of a breakthrough in relations badly frayed over wartime forced labor and other issues related to tokyo s 1910 45 colonial rule of the korean peninsula the summit with biden was also seen as an opportunity to deliver south korea s concerns about the u s inflation reduction act ira which is feared to put korean carmakers at a disadvantage in the american market and move forward discussions on a potential currency swap deal that could help stabilize financial markets what played out however was a tug of war between south korea and japan over whether the summit would be held at all with the end result being a 30 minute meeting described by south korea as informal talks the summit took place suddenly as the details had been kept under wraps for days in the form of yoon visiting the venue of an event hosted by japanese prime minister fumio kishida in new york yoon and kishida agreed on the need to improve bilateral relations by resolving pending issues south korea s readout of the meeting said the two agreed to instruct their diplomats to accelerate talks to that end yoon and kishida also shared serious concern about north korea s nuclear program including its recent legalization of nuclear arms and the possibility of a seventh nuclear test and agreed to cooperate closely with the international community to respond to it according to the readout a presidential official hailed the summit as the first step toward producing tangible results after two years and 10 months despite the existence of various disputes between south korea and japan the two leaders met and took the first step toward a resolution that is why it was highly significant the official told reporters in new york meanwhile the summit with biden did not materialize as planned due to scheduling issues caused by the u s president s unforeseen attendance at queen elizabeth s funeral and u s domestic political events according to yoon s office instead the two had three brief encounters at a reception hosted by king charles iii in london at a fundraiser hosted by biden in new york and again at a reception hosted by the u s president president yoon explained our businesses concerns about the u s inflation reduction act and asked that the u s administration cooperate closely with south korea in the process of enforcing the ira so as to resolve our concerns yoon s office said in a press release summarizing the three encounters in response president biden said he is well aware of our concerns and that south korea and the u s should continue to hold serious consultations it added on a potential currency swap deal the presidential office said the two leaders agreed to cooperate closely to implement liquidity facilities for financial stabilization if needed on security issues they assessed the consultations under way between south korea and the u s over extended deterrence and agreed to further strengthen bilateral cooperation to deter north korea s attacks and to come up with joint response plans against north korea s provocations it said the biggest news of the day however emerged after video circulated of yoon apparently using foul language during the global fund s seventh replenishment conference in new york in the clip yoon could be heard telling aides in vulgar language that it would be embarrassing if the national assembly did not approve of something unspecified it was initially thought that he was referring to biden s pledge to contribute another us 6 billion to the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and the embarrassment if congress refused to endorse it critics at home including the main opposition democratic party accused yoon of creating a diplomatic disaster sending the presidential office scrambling to come up with a plausible explanation he wasn t speaking publicly on the stage but in passing and although i don t know who recorded it and how i actually think it should be verified a senior presidential official told reporters in new york i think it s highly inappropriate to draw a link between private remarks and diplomatic accomplishments the official added hours later yoon s senior secretary for press affairs kim eun hye said the president made no mention of biden and that the actual word he used was the korean word for throw out because he was talking about how he would be embarrassed if the opposition controlled national assembly rejected his pledge to contribute 100 million to the global fund over the next three years the gaffe likely left an indelible stain on the president s trip which was planned around his mantra of freedom and solidarity with both concepts featuring prominently in his u n speech and sought to honor the three nations that sent the most troops to fight alongside south korea during the 1950 53 korean war on his final stop yoon visited canada to hold a summit with prime minister justin trudeau on securing stable supply chains for the production of electric vehicle batteries yonhap

the dow jones industrial average closed at its lowest point since 2020 friday washington stocks fell sharply worldwide friday on worries an already slowing global economy could fall into recession as central banks raise the pressure with additional interest rate hikes the dow jones industrial average fell 1 6 closing at its lowest level since late 2020 the s p 500 fell 1 7 close to its 2022 low set in mid june while the nasdaq slid 1 8 the selling capped another rough week on wall street leaving the major indexes with their fifth weekly loss in six weeks energy prices closed sharply lower as traders worried about a possible recession treasury yields which affect rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans held at multiyear highs european stocks fell just as sharply or more after preliminary data there suggested business activity had its worst monthly contraction since the start of 2021 adding to the pressure was a new plan announced in london to cut taxes which sent u k yields soaring because it could ultimately force its central bank to raise rates even more sharply the federal reserve and other central banks around the world aggressively hiked interest rates this week in hopes of undercutting high inflation with more big increases promised for the future such moves put the brakes on economies by design in hopes that slower purchases by households and businesses will deflate inflationary pressures but they also threaten a recession if they rise too far or too quickly besides friday s discouraging data on european business activity a separate report suggested u s activity is also still shrinking though not quite as badly as in earlier months financial markets are now fully absorbing the fed s harsh message that there will be no retreat from the inflation fight douglas porter chief economist at bmo capital markets wrote in a research report u s crude oil prices slid 5 7 to their lowest levels since early this year on worries that a weaker global economy will burn less fuel cryptocurrency prices also fell sharply because higher interest rates tend to hit hardest the investments that look the priciest or the most risky even gold fell in the worldwide rout as bonds paying higher yields make investments that pay no interest look less attractive meanwhile the u s dollar has been moving sharply higher against other currencies that can hurt profits for u s companies with lots of overseas business as well as put a financial squeeze on much of the developing world the s p 500 fell 64 76 points to 3 693 23 its fourth straight drop the dow which at one point was down more than 800 points lost 486 27 points to close at 29 590 41 the nasdaq fell 198 88 points to 10 867 93 smaller company stocks did even worse the russell 2000 fell 42 72 points or 2 5 to close at 1 679 59 more than 85 of stocks in the s p 500 closed in the red with technology companies retailers and banks among the biggest weights on the benchmark index the federal reserve on wednesday lifted its benchmark rate which affects many consumer and business loans to a range of 3 to 3 25 it was at virtually zero at the start of the year the fed also released a forecast suggesting its benchmark rate could be 4 4 by the year s end a full point higher than envisioned in june treasury yields have climbed to multiyear highs as interest rates rise the yield on the 2 year treasury which tends to follow expectations for federal reserve action rose to 4 20 from 4 12 late thursday it is trading at its highest level since 2007 the yield on the 10 year treasury which influences mortgage rates slipped to 3 69 from 3 71 goldman sachs strategists say a majority of their clients now see a hard landing that pulls the economy sharply lower as inevitable the question for them is just on the timing magnitude and length of a potential recession higher interest rates hurt all kinds of investments but stocks could stay steady as long as corporate profits grow strongly the problem is that many analysts are beginning to cut their forecasts for upcoming earnings because of higher rates and worries about a possible recession increasingly market psychology has transitioned from concerns over inflation to worries that at a minimum corporate profits will decline as economic growth slows demand said quincy krosby chief global strategist for lpl financial in the u s the jobs market has remained remarkably solid and many analysts think the economy grew in the summer quarter after shrinking in the first six months of the year but the encouraging signs also suggest the fed may have to jack rates even higher to get the cooling needed to bring down inflation some key areas of the economy are already weakening mortgage rates have reached 14 year highs causing sales of existing homes to drop 20 in the past year but other areas that do best when rates are low are also hurting in europe meanwhile the already fragile economy is dealing with the effects of war on its eastern front following russia s invasion of ukraine the european central bank is hiking its key interest rate to combat inflation even as the region s economy is already expected to plunge into a recession and in asia china s economy is contending with still strict measures meant to limit covid infections that also hurt businesses while friday s economic reports were discouraging few on wall street saw them as enough to convince the fed and other central banks to soften their stance on raising rates so they just reinforced the fear that rates will keep rising in the face of already slowing economies
by josh staloch correspondent brown county right now in this community there is a family with children ages 8 10 and 12 who are living out of their vehicle like other kids in school the children are trying to stay ahead of early semester assignments but unlike their classmates the worries of schoolwork pale in comparison to the concerns about staying warm and safe in the middle of the night while staring down the barrel of a fast approaching winter the 2022 point in time count a meticulous count of every unsheltered individual in the area conducted in late july found significant increases over last year s number paul van handel outreach coordinator for newcap s homeless outreach team inspects a pile of sopping wet clothing items left in the woods across from st john s park after a heavy rain on tuesday sept 20 josh staloch photo we began the unsheltered homeless season march and into april with 30 people said paul van handel a member of newcap s homeless outreach team hot you get into may when it s warm and we re starting to see this upward trend and almost a 150 200 increase as we head into june and july van handel said each new month of the unsheltered season in 2022 brought with it a doubling of the area s homeless population here s what this year s count shows in july of last year there were 26 people classified as unsheltered category 1 which means they are either literally homeless or living in a place not meant for human habitation in july of this year the number more than quadrupled to 123 by august the number had grown to 143 and as of sept 13 the number was up to 175 compared to 51 at the same time last year among the homeless in the most recent count are two veterans and six families including four children between the ages of 7 and 14 four families were trying to obtain hotel vouchers that may only last a week functional zero van handel partly attributes the increase to the simple fact that there is no available shelter housing in the area housing programs can t place people if we don t have the housing stock to place them into van handel said if we re not having openings not enough scattered site housing then you re log jammed he explained a term often used as a measuring tool in the fight against homelessness called functional zero to highlight how serious the problem is becoming for brown county functional zero is kind of a formula they use to say okay we don t want more new people entering the system than you have leaving the homeless system in a one year period of time van handel said you re trying to maintain an even level in the population and not have an increase what we re doing here we re growing our homeless population he said in order for functional zero to be achieved periods of homelessness for an individual should be rare brief and non recurring what s happening in brown county is the exact opposite what we re seeing now is that in this area instances of homelessness are frequent prolonged and recurring he said and contrary to popular belief that the issue is coming from outside of the area van handel said most people lived in northeast wisconsin when they became homeless this is in spite of real efforts by the city to address the issue roberto silva and carrie campbell from algoma make regular trips to st john s park to drop off food water and other essentials silva who experienced homelessness himself at one point said everyone deserves a little help once in awhile and that it s frustrating to see how many people choose to try to ignore the problem josh staloch photo van handel said groups like greater green bay community foundation and the blueprint have been teaming up with other organizations in the area to develop a strategy to turn the problem around out of that collaborative effort he said a model is being created for peer supported housing wherein people who have significant mental health or alcohol or substance abuse issues can get help in a non traditional environment what we re trying to do is put those folks in apartments where they can actually have their own life space van handel said have some time to self actualize and be with a peer someone who essentially has had the same kinds of problems they re having how to help while government officials struggle to get a grip on the homelessness problem private citizens are trying hard to help charitable individuals and groups stop by st john s park regularly with food and other items to hand out to those seeking shelter in the pavilion but oftentimes those donations are doing more harm than good van handel said we ask that people use specific points where those who need the items can have safe access to them van handel saisd shelters pantries st vincent depaul paul s pantry where they take in these hygiene items and all of this food so that they can be distributed to those who need them for those looking for ways to help advocates ask that you donate directly to one of the organizations listed above or bring gift cards gas cards which would be greatly appreciated by the families who are living out of their vehicles or grocery store gift cards directly to newcap on capitol drive in green bay where they can be distributed by van handel himself
two days ago as prime minister anthony albanese led a national day of mourning for queen elizabeth ii a handful of radical protesters took to the streets chanting obscenities and burning flags good in fact not only was it a good thing it was a great thing because no other act could better prove the freedom and security we enjoy in our democracy think about it for a moment on the very day especially marked for the solemn commemoration of the passing of our head of state we witnessed the desecration of our national symbol and expletive laden celebrations of her death and yet there was no rioting there were no deaths and no one was even arrested meanwhile the rest of the country some 25 million either respectfully marked the queen s legacy or peacefully passed the day with their colleagues friends and family indigenous activists attend a rally on september 22 2022 picture aston brown afp there could be no greater advertisement for both the stability and the liberty we enjoy in this nation we are indeed the lucky country and not just in the pejorative way donald horne first intended the phrase because it isn t just luck that got us here the modern multicultural and democratic state of australia is a miracle of both accident and design a tripartite product of constitution convention and common sense we inherited the best of the long evolved and convoluted british traditions of individual rights and married it to the democratic systems and safeguards of revolutionary america like all countries we have a history soaked in blood and laced with prejudice yet the actual formation of our nation was a remarkably peaceful affair indeed for the most part it was delightfully dull and of course our relationship to those we colonised or conquered depending on your version of history oscillated between ugliness and ignorance but it is undoubtedly better than what it was compare this to russia where 1300 people have just been arrested for protesting against putin s war on ukraine and his attempt to conscript 300 000 citizens more like subjects to his bloody cause the australian flag is defaced during a protest in melbourne picture asanka ratnayake getty images compare this to the global flagship of democracy the usa where poverty is rife and rioting is almost ritual compare it even to the home counties of england where riots torched the capital just a decade ago sure we have had a few cronulla redfern macquarie fields and more recently a bit of anti lockdown anger but we have had nothing on the scale that has visited other nations no citywide destruction or nationwide chaos has crippled us there is a pretty failsafe way to gauge the stock of a nation state and that is a tally of who is struggling to get in compared to who is struggling to get out australia consistently rates countless versus none indeed the only nations that spring to mind with similarly benign and peaceful societies are canada and new zealand and guess what we all have in common and that is the supreme irony of the protesters declamations of the crown and british history more generally for all its faults and myriad atrocities dating back centuries it has brought us to this place a place that is clearly imperfect but as good or better than any other on the earth queen elizabeth ii died on september 8 2022 picture royal household ranald mackechnie via getty and a place where they can today voice their anger protected by the rule of law and a tradition of freedom of expression including the freedom to express hatred of those very institutions but there is no doubt that many people overwhelmingly first nations people still suffer huge intergenerational disadvantage and poverty because of colonisation this is hardly the fault of elizabeth ii who in fact presided over mass decolonisation but that makes it no less true and so the task before us is to find a way to remedy these ills not by an absurd scheme of reparations that would reduce all of history to an arbitrary time travelling lawsuit but by directing all our national efforts towards those who are still disadvantaged and ensuring they have access to the same social educational and employment opportunities that the rest of us enjoy replacing our head of state substituting one ceremonial role with another will do precisely nothing to fix that while i am by tribe and inclination an irish catholic republican i cannot for the life of me conceive of a more useless cause at this juncture in our nation s history but what might just work is the establishment of a first nations voice to parliament that will ensure the policies of lawmakers and bureaucrats directed to the betterment of indigenous lives are actually informed by indigenous people themselves if radical protesters are genuinely concerned about making a difference and improving the lot of our indigenous brethren they should concentrate their energies on this simple and achievable step instead of screaming into the void whether it succeeds remains to be seen and whether it works we can only hope but i can assure you it will be far more effective than flag burning originally published as joe hildebrand flag burning queen elizabeth protesters show we really are a lucky country
when microsoft hired thomas moore in 2008 he joined the company as a software engineer but quickly noticed that he was the only black employee on his team later moore had the chance to attend a school career fair at florida a m university famu on behalf of microsoft after working with administrators students and his manager to create career prep events his efforts resulted in strong new hires at microsoft from a historically black college or university or hbcu last year at refactr a convention focused on diversity and inclusion in the tech industry moore shared the challenges he faced while recruiting black students and the solutions he came up with to better prepare them for rigorous job interviews at top tech companies i attended the convention and was impressed with his efforts to connect with students though moore did not mention the cybersecurity industry specifically in his talk there are now initiatives to fill positions in that field with students from hbcus i believe there are a few similarities between moore s work at florida a m and the new programs major tech companies and the us government have designed to attract and prepare recent graduates to enter the cybersecurity workforce according to the national science foundation almost 18 of black students with stem degrees graduated from hbcus and a third of all black students in the us who have earned doctorates got their bachelor s degrees from hbcus the schools are an underused resource for new talent that could solve the tech industry s struggles to fill open positions particularly in certain niches such as security closing the cybersecurity skill gap the demand for trained cybersecurity employees is massive despite cybersecurity being one of the best paid careers in tech according to a 2020 study from may 2021 through april 2022 the us had 180 000 openings for information security analysts cyberseek reported only 141 000 workers are currently employed in those positions resulting in an annual shortage of 39 000 employees at the same time a study from edweek revealed students in small and high poverty school districts are significantly less likely to be exposed to cybersecurity education that means lower income and minority students have fewer pathways to cybersecurity careers the national cybersecurity alliance nca a cybersecurity nonprofit launched the historically black colleges and universities career program in 2022 the initiative allows schools and tech companies such as dell technologies quanta services and proofpoint to work together to prepare students for careers in cybersecurity through mentoring programs in 2022 the us government expanded project reach this program connects k 12 schools to hbcu computer science and cybersecurity programs via campus visits classroom support and kid friendly cybersecurity activities this collaboration between universities and high schools will be critical to solving the cybersecurity workforce shortage and introducing students to cybersecurity careers at a young age said laurie salvail the director of cyber org the workforce development organization running project reach the pilot initiative launched with grambling state university in 2021 and project reach recently announced that ten additional hbcus intend to join the program how to prepare students for tech careers when thomas moore first visited famu s career fair to scout for microsoft career candidates project reach hadn t even started yet but in his case finding a talent pool wasn t the problem moore with microsoft hires gregory flowers and sebrenia coleman when they were students in fall 2017 credit thomas moore while many of the potential candidates he talked to were intelligent and ambitious they hadn t been prepared for the rigorous technical interviews that major tech companies are known for these are entirely different from standard job interviews with stock questions like where do you see yourself in five years moore connected with an outgoing student named jay at the career fair and organized a separate session with a small group of students to teach them how to approach technical interview questions during subsequent visits to famu moore was approached by administrators about their computer science curriculum and he worked with them to find ways to prepare students to interview for lucrative careers at big tech companies his advice eventually landed him a spot on the school s advisory board he also obtained funding for future interview prep breakout events with students the sessions moore created included interview preparation mock interviews and opportunities for students to have their resumes reviewed by industry professionals several famu students were hired at microsoft while moore was at the company if you re wondering how moore found the time to take several trips to a university campus in florida over the years he negotiated the time spent working on the company s diversity initiative into his job description specifically moore said he requested 10 of his work time to go toward his work with famu to train the future tech workforce which his manager at microsoft approved when he left the company to work for mozilla as a software engineer he made a similar pitch and his new manager also approved it create the tech workforce of the future currently moore is working again at microsoft this time as a senior software engineer he lamented that the pandemic kept him from visiting the famu campus for more than a year moore says he kept in contact with the university administrators and staff and is participating in online recruiting activities such as e mentoring until he can return to florida for an in person visit in his presentation s conclusion moore stressed that he didn t have a specific blueprint to follow for mentoring success that said i have turned what i consider to be some key points from his talk into a list of suggestions for anyone working with administrators at an hbcu to prepare black students for tech careers offer your expertise reach out to administrators or staffers and let them know you are interested in looking at the current curriculum and helping students find careers in tech stay consistent showing up on campus once every few years only to sit behind a table at a career fair just isn t enough to attract the job candidates the industry needs moore said he established trust with university staffers and students by consistently coming back to the school and talking to students about getting into the tech industry be flexible moore said he didn t plan to be on an advisory board at famu when he first visited the school for a career fair he built a solid mentoring and recruiting relationship between his companies and the school because he was willing to meet the students where they were in their burgeoning careers and then guide them into the tech industry some of the biggest tech companies have new training and recruitment programs up and running at thousands of educational institutions around the us such as microsoft s cybersecurity scholarship program in 2021 google launched the google career certificates to help tens of thousands of americans get job training and help with career placement ibm is making inroads in combatting the cybersecurity talent shortage with its recent partnerships with hbcus to develop solid cybersecurity curricula at participating schools if you re looking to make a career switch or if you hope to enter the tech workforce in the future check out pcmag s guide to training online for some cybersecurity skills

taiwan semiconductor manufacturing has a promising new business deal on the horizon nvidia is about to be very oversold after recent boom years investors in the semiconductor industry have experienced a rough year so far in 2022 you only need to look at the vaneck semiconductor etf nasdaq smh to see how punishing this year has been to chip investors a leading chip stocks fund with more than 6 billion in net assets the etf has been down 35 in the past ten months get the full henry singleton series in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more it wasn t always like this though in recent years semiconductor companies moved to actually expand their production capacity to address global chip shortages amid these shortages chip prices soared generating premium margins for semiconductor companies but investors have lately soured on chip stocks amid concerns that the expanded capacity could lead to a supply glut that would in turn damage prices hence the multi month sell off recession concerns have also scared off some investors from the semiconductor industry because of worries over the potential weak demand for chips moreover the u s government s recent decision to restrict the sale of certain chips to china has only increased uncertainty for semiconductor industry investors as a result chip stocks across the board have dropped sharply from their recent peaks but when there s chaos there s also opportunity and now may be the best time to go bargain hunting for oversold semiconductor stocks let s take a look at two such stocks that are worth considering for a rebound play taiwan semiconductor manufacturing nyse tsm the chip supply chain has many participants tsm participates in the production side as its name suggests the company is based in taiwan a global chip production capital where they handle contract chip production and are the world s leading provider in that space in fact nvidia recently tapped tsm to manufacture its latest generation of gaming graphic chips which is a big win for them as nvidia produced the previous generation of those chips at samsung factories the company has over the years invested in improving its manufacturing technology making them the easy choice manufacturer for advanced semiconductor components it s worth noting that the passing of the chips act caused some jitters among tsm investors many worried that the u s domestic semiconductor subsidy program could undercut taiwan s competitiveness in the chip manufacturing market and deal a blow to its companies like tsm but taiwan has gone out of its way to reiterate its position in the global semiconductor supply chain and argue that the chips act doesn t threaten its chip industry if anything tsm actually stands to benefit from the chips act the company is setting up a 12 billion semiconductor plant in arizona putting them in a position to benefit from the u s chip industry subsidy and tax credit program in the midst of all this though tsm shares recently fell to a new 52 week low but looking at the charts a bullish setup has started to emerge there s a strong argument that a low could soon be put in as the rsi reading of 35 now indicates the stock is extremely oversold nvidia is one of the better known semiconductor names out there and they design graphics processing chips that power a variety of gaming devices the company also makes artificial intelligence chips used in data centers and other applications nvidia recently unveiled a new and advanced generation of its flagship geforce graphics chips for the gaming industry and in a show of its market might they maintained high price tags on these there s a risk that the u s ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor components to china might hurt sales but in all likelihood the company s latest graphics chips won t be affected still its shares have been selling off since march in addition to the broader concerns around the industry s outlook and recession fears nvidia s mixed earnings report for the most recent quarter also caused investors heartburn this week they hit a new 52 week low of 125 but with the stocks rsi approaching the 20s you have to be thinking they ll soon be very oversold indeed it s around this level that they consolidated back in 2020 and 2021 so there s a fair chance the bulls will be stepping in again this time if you re a fan of the industry over the long term you might want to

for weekend reading gary alexander senior writer at navellier associates offers the following commentary let s review the last four weeks the twilight of summer at 10 am eastern time on friday august

full ray dalio series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on ray dalio in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more the market struggled to gain back 1 000 points but when a 0 1 monthly gain in the consumer price index was announced tuesday september 13 the dow lost another 1 200 points that day and 4 13 for the week in a case of one step forward two steps back and it all seems based on fear of two more rate increases i seldom see analysts look back at the last times we saw multiple rate increases so let s take a closer look at the 2004 06 and 2015 18 rate rising cycles for an indication of how little we need to fear the fed starting on june 30 2004 the fed raised interest rates 17 times in two years by 0 25 at each meeting of the fomc yet the stock market kept rising so did gold despite the warning we keep hearing that high interest interest rates are bad for gold the only market those rising rates killed was real estate and that led to the 2008 financial crisis based on some kinky mortgage derivatives here is a table listing the average 12 month fed funds rate from 2003 to 2007 vs the market s reaction positive each year from its march 2003 low of 789 the s p 500 almost doubled to 1 576 in october 2007 in the middle of that bull run the fed funds rate rose from 1 on june 29 2004 to a peak of 5 25 on june 29 2006 after the 2008 09 financial debacle the fed funds rate was lowered to zero to 0 25 for seven full years december 16 2008 to december 15 2015 if retired folks tried to live on 1 000 000 for a year at the going bank cd rate they would reap maybe 3 000 in interest lots of luck with that then from december 17 2015 to december 20 2018 the fed raised interest rates nine times by 0 25 each time to 2 50 or about where we were before the fed s rate increase this week in those three years the s p 500 rose 27 from 1 978 to 2 507 and that includes a brutal december 2018 when it was clear that powell had raised rates one time too many in a mid term election year this is a good time to remember the terrible mid term election years and their glorious fourth quarters so the last 15 mid term election cycles have delivered a net zero gain divided between a 6 2 loss in the first nine months offset by a 6 2 gain in the last three months a christmas bonus for patient investors i d love to omit the 2018 exception because that would bring the fourth quarter average up to 7 65 but 2018 is a cautionary tale of where the fed can go wrong on september 27 and december 20 of 2018 mr powell clearly raised interest rates one maybe two times too many perhaps as part of a personal spat with president trump who couldn t contain his tweeting thumbs from spraying out unkind challenges to the fed chairman mr biden for all his faults is not at war with the fed chair so maybe powell has learned the lesson not to raise interest rates too far too fast this time if he stops in time this market should recover well happy 235th birthday to the u s constitution that glorious template for blessed gridlock the u s constitutions is the most wonderful work ever struck off by the brain and purpose of man british prime minister william gladstone 1878 have you ever heard of constitution day how about citizenship day or i am an american day by whatever name all fall on september 17 the anniversary of our constitution s signing date in 1787 very few schools mention constitution day but maybe we the people should take time to read the most wonderful work ever struck off by the brain and purpose of man once a year maybe around now since any unbiased reading of the constitution reveals that it prohibits most of what our federal government is doing today when i campaigned for the virginia house of delegates in 1997 my punch line was the constitution may not be perfect but it beats the type of government we have in washington dc today the u s constitution demands great nobility of the human spirit it requires compromise and debate most people prefer to wield power not to be in a committee meeting late at night debating compromises the founders sought a balance of power or gridlock in today s terminology they were more concerned with what our federal government did not do than what it did do the french philosopher montesquieu 1689 1755 influenced many of our founders he wrote that when legislative power is united with executive power in a single person or in a single body of the magistracy there is no liberty echoing montesquieu james madison said the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and the judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and whether hereditary self appointed or elective may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny when one political party or the other controls all the levers of government the concentration of power has often come close to tyranny the democrats are currently displaying the swagger of controlling all levers of power in washington and if you are a republican you may remember that when the republicans controlled the white house and both houses of congress from 2000 to 2006 they started two long and costly wars ran up the deficits and launched more spending programs as i told karl rove in a panel in 2010 karl you broke our hearts perhaps that s why stocks tend to do better when we see more gridlock and less unity in washington and that s why all four of the last four presidents have been chastened by voters at mid term elections and so will mr biden in all likelihood as his party s plurality is lighter and his popularity is lower the current odds in vegas are about 9 to 2 that the republicans will take the house and 13 to 4 a little over 3 to 1 for the senate this expected return to gridlock in seven weeks should lift the market soon the best news is that this market boost usually continues through june of the following year
amidst a sell off tesla remains poised to see significant gains ford has raised prices to offset rising material costs will tesla the short ratio of tesla continues to be optimistically healthy indicating a future upswing tesla nasdaq tsla continues to remain resilient despite the broader market sell off despite predictions of demise by short shellers and despite these predictions the stock is up 16 for the year and continues to trade at relatively lofty valuations the stock was down 4 during early trading hours on friday get the full henry singleton series in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more sales should be back on track next quarter tesla should see significant gains in the latest quarter with august sales estimated to be over 100 percent yoy and with china sales expected to be around 77 000 vehicles in august things seem to be back on track after a small hiccup in the previous quarter meanwhile tesla is expected to have doubled its market share in the us to 4 with sales doubling for the month as well yoy tesla in general has seen strong uptake in many countries including the likes of australia although results in europe have been mixed should the next quarter s results come in strong again tesla could see its stock rise once again going against the general trend of tech stocks valuations have broadly retreated in the tech sector with many companies down over 50 but tesla remains one of the few companies that have triple digit valuations still with the current price to earnings still over 100 many remain skeptical still but considering that tesla s growth continues to remain very high and there seems to be little let up in terms of momentum valuations may not be that expensive especially considering margins have also remained sustainable until now the next couple of quarters will set the tone for where the price heads meanwhile ford recently announced that it was raising prices in order to overcome the rise in the price of parts which have gone up anywhere from 7 to 20 percent on the other hand ford projects increasing production by 10 going against the narrative that sales are about to turn for the worse it remains to be seen whether tesla will follow suit with price rises as the price of inputs such as lithium continues to rise as well tesla in previous years has raised prices on some of its models and may do again the previous price rises did not affect tesla s sales but continued increases may start to finally hamper the company tesla has been facing an onslaught of competition from multiple companies and many new electric vehicles are set to hit the market this year short sellers have pointed out that competition is slowly taking over tesla with numerous companies proving to have better mileage and others who have similar attributes but lower prices regardless the brand value and the brand loyalty towards tesla seem to have qualities that have kept the competition at bay for now while in places like europe competition has done better in north america china and australia new zealand tesla continues to be at the top should tesla continue to see the strong run of form that it has in recent times the forward price to earnings will fall to 52 and many may consider that not very expensive margins aside debt remains relatively manageable at 6 66 billion and with cash currently standing at 18 billion the company remains well capitalized to overcome the increasing rate environment tesla levered free cash flow currently stands at 6 billion the company s short ratio remains relatively healthy as well standing at 2 3 and the put call ratio remains around 1 indicating that investors remain relatively neutral on the fortunes of the stock considering tesla until now has managed to overcome a lot of the criticism there is less of an impetus to be overly bearish on the company tesla has had a few problems as well including the self driving program which has not lived up to expectations but clearly that is now what is driving customers to the vehicle brand loyalty has almost an iphone feel to it but in a few more years it will become more obvious whether or not the stickiness can remain the stock currently is not witnessing a major correction and despite the broader market retreating tesla continues to remain resilient rates will continue to rise for a few more quarters which should push discount rates higher but considering the rate at which earnings continue to grow it may not matter tesla could be in bubble territory or it could be the start of a multi year stock run for a stock that has already seen its price increase significantly should you

the dow jones industrial average closed at its lowest point since 2020 friday washington stocks fell sharply worldwide friday on worries an already slowing global economy could fall into recession as central banks raise the pressure with additional interest rate hikes the dow jones industrial average fell 1 6 closing at its lowest level since late 2020 the s p 500 fell 1 7 close to its 2022 low set in mid june while the nasdaq slid 1 8 the selling capped another rough week on wall street leaving the major indexes with their fifth weekly loss in six weeks energy prices closed sharply lower as traders worried about a possible recession treasury yields which affect rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans held at multiyear highs european stocks fell just as sharply or more after preliminary data there suggested business activity had its worst monthly contraction since the start of 2021 adding to the pressure was a new plan announced in london to cut taxes which sent u k yields soaring because it could ultimately force its central bank to raise rates even more sharply the federal reserve and other central banks around the world aggressively hiked interest rates this week in hopes of undercutting high inflation with more big increases promised for the future such moves put the brakes on economies by design in hopes that slower purchases by households and businesses will deflate inflationary pressures but they also threaten a recession if they rise too far or too quickly besides friday s discouraging data on european business activity a separate report suggested u s activity is also still shrinking though not quite as badly as in earlier months financial markets are now fully absorbing the fed s harsh message that there will be no retreat from the inflation fight douglas porter chief economist at bmo capital markets wrote in a research report u s crude oil prices slid 5 7 to their lowest levels since early this year on worries that a weaker global economy will burn less fuel cryptocurrency prices also fell sharply because higher interest rates tend to hit hardest the investments that look the priciest or the most risky even gold fell in the worldwide rout as bonds paying higher yields make investments that pay no interest look less attractive meanwhile the u s dollar has been moving sharply higher against other currencies that can hurt profits for u s companies with lots of overseas business as well as put a financial squeeze on much of the developing world the s p 500 fell 64 76 points to 3 693 23 its fourth straight drop the

72 points or 2 5 to close at 1 679 59 more than 85 of stocks in the s p 500 closed in the red with technology companies retailers and banks among the biggest weights on the benchmark index the federal reserve on wednesday lifted its benchmark rate which affects many consumer and business loans to a range of 3 to 3 25 it was at virtually zero at the start of the year the fed also released a forecast suggesting its benchmark rate could be 4 4 by the year s end a full point higher than envisioned in june treasury yields have climbed to multiyear highs as interest rates rise the yield on the 2 year treasury which tends to follow expectations for federal reserve action rose to 4 20 from 4 12 late thursday it is trading at its highest level since 2007 the yield on the 10 year treasury which influences mortgage rates slipped to 3 69 from 3 71 goldman sachs strategists say a majority of their clients now see a hard landing that pulls the economy sharply lower as inevitable the question for them is just on the timing magnitude and length of a potential recession higher interest rates hurt all kinds of investments but stocks could stay steady as long as corporate profits grow strongly the problem is that many analysts are beginning to cut their forecasts for upcoming earnings because of higher rates and worries about a possible recession increasingly market psychology has transitioned from concerns over inflation to worries that at a minimum corporate profits will decline as economic growth slows demand said quincy krosby chief global strategist for lpl financial in the u s the jobs market has remained remarkably solid and many analysts think the economy grew in the summer quarter after shrinking in the first six months of the year but the encouraging signs also suggest the fed may have to jack rates even higher to get the cooling needed to bring down inflation some key areas of the economy are already weakening mortgage rates have reached 14 year highs causing sales of existing homes to drop 20 in the past year but other areas that do best when rates are low are also hurting in europe meanwhile the already fragile economy is dealing with the effects of war on its eastern front following russia s invasion of ukraine the european central bank is hiking its key interest rate to combat inflation even as the region s economy is already expected to plunge into a recession and in asia china s economy is contending with still strict measures meant to limit covid infections that also hurt businesses while friday s economic reports were discouraging few on wall street saw them as enough to convince the fed and other central banks to soften their stance on raising rates so they just reinforced the fear that rates will keep rising in the face of already slowing economies

the government and the bank of ghana bog must collaborate to address the factors causing inflation to rise the institute of economic affairs iea has said according to the economic think tank the current inflation rate of 33 9 per cent in august 2022 was largely driven by supply and cost factors particularly food fuel transport and exchange rate in a statement issued by the iea in accra on monday and copied to the ghanaian times it said the supply and cost factors fueling inflation should be directly targeted with appropriate policy interventions inflation for diesel in august stood at 116 9 per cent petrol was 80 5 per cent and transport inflation embedding fuel costs stood at 45 7 per cent imported and food 34 4 per cent iea called for subsidies on basic staples and reinforcement of measures to ensure that food stocks were easily transported from farm gates to markets also reduction of fuel taxes or levies and the use of part of government s windfall gains from higher oil prices to cushion pump prices while expanding public transport and subsidizing fares to cushion the masses it said further iea urged the bog to enforce the foreign exchange laws including relating to forex carry on limits for travellers forex trading pricing of goods and services in forex and forex transfers through banks we call on the bog and the government to work to adopt additional targeted measures to fight the inflation crisis and also negotiate with foreign companies to stagger repatriation of their dividends and profits to reduce pressure on the exchange rate it stated iea said in countries including major economies where inflation tended to be mostly demand driven a more appropriate tool such as inflation targeting had resorted to interventions directed to the supply factors the economic think tank said some advanced countries had taken unorthodox and innovative measures to cushion their citizens and was time for the country s policymakers to be equally proactive the united states has passed the inflation reduction act where the new uk prime minister has imposed caps on energy prices for two years also france has capped fuel prices and limited electricity tariff increases to 4 per cent iea said adding that while the focus may now be on the immediate crisis it would take far reaching comprehensive measures to address the underlying vulnerabilities and policy lapses in order to achieve durable price stability in the country source ghanaiantimes com gh disclaimer opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of peacefmonline com peacefmonline com accepts no responsibility legal or otherwise for their accuracy of content please report any inappropriate content to us and we will evaluate it as a matter of priority featured video
the dow jones industrial average closed at its lowest point since 2020 friday washington stocks fell sharply worldwide friday on worries an already slowing global economy could fall into recession as central banks raise the pressure with additional interest rate hikes the dow jones industrial average fell 1 6 closing at its lowest level since late 2020 the s p 500 fell 1 7 close to its 2022 low set in mid june while the nasdaq slid 1 8 the selling capped another rough week on wall street leaving the major indexes with their fifth weekly loss in six weeks energy prices closed sharply lower as traders worried about a possible recession treasury yields which affect rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans held at multiyear highs european stocks fell just as sharply or more after preliminary data there suggested business activity had its worst monthly contraction since the start of 2021 adding to the pressure was a new plan announced in london to cut taxes which sent u k yields soaring because it could ultimately force its central bank to raise rates even more sharply the federal reserve and other central banks around the world aggressively hiked interest rates this week in hopes of undercutting high inflation with more big increases promised for the future such moves put the brakes on economies by design in hopes that slower purchases by households and businesses will deflate inflationary pressures but they also threaten a recession if they rise too far or too quickly besides friday s discouraging data on european business activity a separate report suggested u s activity is also still shrinking though not quite as badly as in earlier months financial markets are now fully absorbing the fed s harsh message that there will be no retreat from the inflation fight douglas porter chief economist at bmo capital markets wrote in a research report u s crude oil prices slid 5 7 to their lowest levels since early this year on worries that a weaker global economy will burn less fuel cryptocurrency prices also fell sharply because higher interest rates tend to hit hardest the investments that look the priciest or the most risky even gold fell in the worldwide rout as bonds paying higher yields make investments that pay no interest look less attractive meanwhile the u s dollar has been moving sharply higher against other currencies that can hurt profits for u s companies with lots of overseas business as well as put a financial squeeze on much of the developing world the s p 500 fell 64 76 points to 3 693 23 its fourth straight drop the

72 points or 2 5 to close at 1 679 59 more than 85 of stocks in the s p 500 closed in the red with technology companies retailers and banks among the biggest weights on the benchmark index the federal reserve on wednesday lifted its benchmark rate which affects many consumer and business loans to a range of 3 to 3 25 it was at virtually zero at the start of the year the fed also released a forecast suggesting its benchmark rate could be 4 4 by the year s end a full point higher than envisioned in june treasury yields have climbed to multiyear highs as interest rates rise the yield on the 2 year treasury which tends to follow expectations for federal reserve action rose to 4 20 from 4 12 late thursday it is trading at its highest level since 2007 the yield on the 10 year treasury which influences mortgage rates slipped to 3 69 from 3 71 goldman sachs strategists say a majority of their clients now see a hard landing that pulls the economy sharply lower as inevitable the question for them is just on the timing magnitude and length of a potential recession higher interest rates hurt all kinds of investments but stocks could stay steady as long as corporate profits grow strongly the problem is that many analysts are beginning to cut their forecasts for upcoming earnings because of higher rates and worries about a possible recession increasingly market psychology has transitioned from concerns over inflation to worries that at a minimum corporate profits will decline as economic growth slows demand said quincy krosby chief global strategist for lpl financial in the u s the jobs market has remained remarkably solid and many analysts think the economy grew in the summer quarter after shrinking in the first six months of the year but the encouraging signs also suggest the fed may have to jack rates even higher to get the cooling needed to bring down inflation some key areas of the economy are already weakening mortgage rates have reached 14 year highs causing sales of existing homes to drop 20 in the past year but other areas that do best when rates are low are also hurting in europe meanwhile the already fragile economy is dealing with the effects of war on its eastern front following russia s invasion of ukraine the european central bank is hiking its key interest rate to combat inflation even as the region s economy is already expected to plunge into a recession and in asia china s economy is contending with still strict measures meant to limit covid infections that also hurt businesses while friday s economic reports were discouraging few on wall street saw them as enough to convince the fed and other central banks to soften their stance on raising rates so they just reinforced the fear that rates will keep rising in the face of already slowing economies

it was 15 months ago when house minority leader kevin mccarthy first started talking publicly about rolling out a commitment to america agenda that should ve given the would be house speaker and other republican leaders plenty of time to prepare for a big rollout they have reason to be disappointed with how it s gone the first misstep was a couple of days ago when the house gop published its blueprint online only to remove it soon after without explanation and then republished the whole thing again a day later this morning things got a little worse the daily beast reported as he rolled out the first official republican party congressional platform in years house minority leader kevin mccarthy fittingly invoked the revered father of the gop abraham lincoln at the top of a letter to republican lawmakers thanking them for their contributions to the commitment to america the policy agenda they are launching near pittsburgh on friday mccarthy included a quote attributed to lincoln commitment reads the quote is what transforms a promise into reality it s a nice quote but there s literally no evidence that lincoln ever said it the phrase did appear in advertising however for lehman brothers a wall street giant that collapsed in 2008 and in case that weren t quite enough house republican leaders this morning also released a video to help promote their agenda though as huffpost noted it had one key flaw house republican leaders on friday unveiled their commitment to america agenda for 2023 and with it an inspirational video full of scenes presented as exceptional imagery of america that were actually stock footage from russia and ukraine in fact the house gop s video featured multiple shots from serg grbanoff a filmmaker based in russia as well as a slovakian store that was supposed to help capture american inflation to be sure the important thing about the republicans blueprint is its substance and on that front mccarthy s pitch is deeply flawed his platform i m using the word loosely is largely made up of vague platitudes in large part because the party likely fears a political backlash that would come if gop leaders went into more detail about their policy plans but it s also true that the minority leader and his team were hoping for a smooth rollout for their commitment and as today s developments make clear they didn t have one

warwick r i state regulators approved one of the largest electric rate hikes in decades on friday over the vocal opposition of advocates community members and several elected officials the rhode island public utilities commission which regulates all utilities in the state unanimously passed the 47 electric rate hike proposed by rhode island energy under the new rate which goes into effect oct 1 households will see their bills increase on average by 50 76 per month a proposed hike in gas bills which has yet to be considered by the puc would see an increase of around 15 starting in november puc chair ron gerwatowski who at one point temporarily recessed the meeting due to protests from the assembled crowd in the hearing room advised the public this might not be the final increase in utility prices i hope everyone understands we re looking at a future of rough waters not just for this winter said gerwatowski but the markets and price of power in this region from where we get our power is volatile and i think we re going to be facing lots of challenges in the region and here in rhode island advocates from the george wiley center the poor people s campaign sisters of mercy and the ri coalition to reduce poverty gathered for the second time in as many weeks friday morning to protest the major rate hike from rhode island energy the mood on the front steps of the puc building took on the tenor of a revival meeting as speakers implored the commission to deny the rate hike priests organizers and community members invoked scripture sang songs and chants and warned public officials of the poverty that would ensue under the new utility bills i do not think the people in that room heard us or understand the domino effect this will have said pamela poniatowski an organizer with the poor people s campaign she continued the only way some people are going to have the money to pay for that is if they win the lottery utilities are overseen by the state s public utilities commission which approves or denies proposed utility rate hikes chair ronald gerwatowski and commissioner abigail anthony wait for friday s meeting to start rob smith ecori news warren resident debbie krauss told the crowd how expensive it became when her home had a power outage estimating the value of food spoiled in her chest freezer at over 500 i didn t want to lose the contents of my chest freezer and the freezer attached to it and it happened every single time how about you pay me back first how about that activists had gathered the previous week to testify to commissioners that people would have to choose between heating and electricity or other basic necessities like food medicine or rent if the new rate was approved utility justice advocates are asking for reform demanding the puc cut the profit margin of rhode island energy from 10 down to 6 they also demanded a percentage income payment plan pipp where low income residents can pay a certain percentage of their income for their electric bill instead of a fixed rate and for commissioners to reject the hike it s the public utility commission not the corporate utility commission said rep david morales d providence protesters filed into the building around 11 30 a m friday shortly after commissioners began their meeting to vote on the electric rate hikes as commissioners began the formal process to vote on their agenda activists disrupted the meeting chanting for no new rate hikes the meeting was swiftly recessed while protesters expressed their concerns sometimes forcefully to the remaining commissioners john revens and abigail anthony commissioners stressed to the crowd they were ultimately limited in their powers to reject the hike revens said the opposing parties during the evidentiary process acknowledged the utility had acted properly when formulating the new rates they don t buy like when you go to the grocery store said revens gerwatowski re started the meeting around 12 20 p m police officers escorted half a dozen protesters out for continuing to disrupt the meeting but made no arrests morales was led out twice the second time shouting shame at the commissioners utilities in rhode island don t make a profit by selling electricity to ratepayers under state law the utility has to provide electricity under the prices they paid for it they legally cannot make a profit from selling electricity the costs are passed through onto the electric and gas rates themselves the profit instead is made on building out new infrastructure such as power lines natural gas mains or hooking up new gas lines into homes or businesses the puc sets what that profit can be every three to eight years the utility also proposes rate changes twice yearly for summer and winter with the summer rates typically being cheaper than the winter rates due to less demand for electricity and gas applying rate changes every six months provides some buffering against volatile natural gas prices because although roughly only half the state has a natural gas main for heat in winter all electric ratepayers essentially use natural gas according to iso new england the nonprofit that manages the northeast s electric grid 54 of all energy consumed in the region comes from natural gas plants increase in natural gas prices whether from supply shocks from the russian invasion of the ukraine or greater demand globally for the fossil fuel results in higher electric rate hikes rhode island energy s parent company ppl corporation reported in august its second quarter earnings of 119 million and will pay a small quarterly stock dividend in the fall commissioners did approve some relief for low income ratepayers on friday the puc gave the go ahead to rhode island energy to distribute 32 5 million in electric bill credits and another 17 5 million in gas bill credits the credits were part of the multi million dollar settlement agreement hammered out between the attorney general s office and the ppl corporation before it could buy rhode island s utility assets from national grid the bill credits are expected to be applied by the company sometime in november or december the puc also approved gov dan mckee s allocation of 3 8 million of regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi funds to provide relief to low income ratepayers the governor estimated the funds would provide direct rate relief to 39 000 rhode islanders we have effectively eliminated the impact for our most vulnerable constituents and they will not see an increase in their overall electric bills compared to last winter the governor said in a statement earlier this month rhode island energy got the go ahead from state regulators to forgive more than 47 million in arrearages the utility debt forgiveness was another part of the attorney general s settlement with ppl and the company expects to credit customers whose accounts were 90 days delinquent or more sometime in october activists remain undeterred when the session starts in january we need to increase the pressure to pass the percentage income payment plan said david veliz director of the ri interfaith coalition to reduce poverty the new electric rates go into effect oct 1 the proposed natural gas rates for the winter have yet to be scheduled for a hearing but are expected to go into effect nov 1 categories energy
by charles hugh smith some decades are easy and expansive others are painful but necessary to lay the foundations for future progress many people reject the idea of historical cycles due to their imprecision i understand the appeal of this objection but it is nonetheless striking that transformative decades tend to manifest in cycles rather than evenly over time compare the decades of the past 70 years 1952 to the present how different was the culture and economy of the u s between 1952 and 1959 while there was progress in civil rights and prosperity the zeitgeist the look feel values expectations beliefs outlook mood etc of 1959 was not much different from that of 1952 clothing films the cold war segregation etc were identifiably in the same era elvis chuck berry et al enlivened popular music but the overall impact of rock r b was limited to entertainment and youth culture now compare the zeitgeist of 1962 and that of 1969 the zeitgeist of 1969 was nothing like the zeitgeist of 1962 it wasn t just clothing and music that changed the values expectations beliefs outlook mood and the political social and economic structures had been transformed in ways that reverberated for decades to come the 1960s were not just tumultuous the decade was transformative the civil rights feminist and environmental movements changed laws values culture politics society and the economy economically the stagflation of the 1970s was a consequence of changes that occurred in the 1960s much of it beneath the surface in 1969 the popular music from fifty years before 1919 might as well have been the music of a previous century yet here in 2022 the music of the late 1960s and early 1970s is still listened to purchased and influential today 50 years later cycles are often the result of the interconnecting forces of wars economic turmoil energy food scarcities and large scale economic and social forces the transition from wood to coal for example or the mass immigration generated by crop failures and poverty the 1920s is another example of a decade of rapid transformation that laid the groundwork for the great depression of the 1930s new freedoms of personal expression made the 1920s different in look and feel from the immediate post world war i era of 1919 1920 the 1870s was another decade that transformed economies and societies globally the investment boom in railroads following the end of the american civil war the reparations imposed on france after the franco prussian war of 1870 the end of silver coinage in the u s a speculative stock market boom in europe that crashed in the panic of 1873 all these dynamics reinforced each other leading to a global depression that by some accounts lasted into the 1890s yet despite the failure of railroads and banks and widespread unemployment and suffering the second industrial revolution continued transforming economies as coal iron steel manufacturing transport and urbanization all changed the underpinnings of global economies the western powers industrial expansion drove colonization and reactions to colonization such as the meiji restoration of 1868 transformed japan we can of course detect change in every decade of human history but lenin s famous exaggeration there are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen speaks to the way various dynamics build up beneath the surface interact with other forces and then burst forth we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us could the world of 2030 look and feel completely different from the world of 2022 which is still coasting on the excesses of the waste is growth landfill economy of extreme financialization and globalization my guess is yes previous cycles emerged from financial excesses of either expansion or contraction the aftermaths of wars deep economic changes as energy sources expand shifts from wood to coal and then to oil or contract forests depleted and climate change the years without summer in the 1630s etc though many believe the next energy expansion is starting fusion or other nuclear power solar wind the practicalities of physics resource depletion and cost provide little support for these projections for example the u s would need to build hundreds of nuclear reactors in the next 20 years to make a dent in hydrocarbon consumption yet only two reactors have been built in the past 25 years there is no evidence that the resources material and financial and the political will required to build 500 reactors in the next 20 years are available if a massive quantity of wind and solar power is installed over the next 20 years all the systems that are 20 years old will need to be replaced because they re worn out these aren t renewable they re replaceable thus we face an energy contraction at the same time as the extremes of financialization and globalization that have driven expansion unravel this unraveling won t be linear i e gradual and predictable it will be non linear and unpredictable with apparently modest changes collapsing supply chains and speculative excesses extremes of inequality and repression act as pendulums once they reach the maximum endpoint of momentum they reverse and trace a line to the opposite extreme minus a bit of friction many of these dynamics are already visible what s not yet visible is the rapid acceleration and mutual reinforcement of these dynamics eras of expansion may be liberating and fun but there is no guarantee that the liberation and fun will be evenly distributed eras of contraction are rarely fun and the misery is widely distributed whether we like it or not the era of the waste is growth landfill economy is ending in what promises to be a non linear process but that doesn t mean the eventual result won t be positive tumultuous transformations can set the stage for more widely distributed prosperity and liberation some decades are easy and expansive others are painful but necessary to lay the foundations for future progress which will 2022 2030 be stay tuned the music of the late 1960s was remarkably different from the music of 1962 not to mention 1952 or the popular music of fifty years earlier in 1919

by lance roberts the massive debt levels provide the single most significant risk and challenge to the federal reserve it is also why the fed is desperate to return inflation to low levels even if it means weaker economic growth such was a point previously made by jerome powell we need to act now forthrightly strongly as we have been doing it is very important that inflation expectations remain anchored what we hope to achieve is a period of growth below trend that last sentence is the most important there are some important financial implications to below trend economic growth as we discussed in the coming reversion to the mean of economic growth after the financial crisis the media buzzword became the new normal for what the post crisis economy would like it was a period of slower economic growth weaker wages and a decade of monetary interventions to keep the economy from slipping back into a recession post the covid crisis we will begin to discuss the new new normal of continued stagnant wage growth a weaker economy and an ever widening wealth gap social unrest is a direct byproduct of this new new normal as injustices between the rich and poor become increasingly evident if we are correct in assuming that pce will revert to the mean as stimulus fades from the economy then the new new normal of economic growth will be a new lower trend that fails to create widespread prosperity as shown economic growth trends are already falling short of both previous long term growth trends the fed is now talking about slowing economic activity further in its inflation fight the reason that slowing economic growth and killing inflation is critical for the fed is due to the massive amount of leverage in the economy if inflation remains high interest rates will adjust triggering a debt crisis as servicing requirements increase and defaults rise historically such events led to a recession at best and a financial crisis at worst the problem for the fed is trying to avoid a recession while trying to kill inflation recessions are an important part of the cycle recessions are not a bad thing they are a necessary part of the economic cycle and arguably a crucial one recessions remove the excesses built up during the expansion and reset the table for the next leg of economic growth without recessions the build up of excesses continues until something breaks in the current cycle the fed s interventions and maintenance of low rates for more than a decade have allowed fundamentally weak companies to stay in business by taking on cheap debt for unproductive purposes like stock buybacks and dividends consumers have used low rates to expand consumption by taking on debt the government increased debts and deficits to record levels the assumption is that increased debt is not problematic as long as interest rates remain low but therein lies the trap the fed s mentality of constant growth with no tolerance for recession has allowed this situation to inflate rather than allowing the natural order of the economy to perform its darwinian function of weeding out the weak the chart below shows total economic system leverage versus gdp it currently requires 4 82 of debt for each dollar of inflation adjusted economic growth more debt doesn t solve problems over the past few decades the system has not been allowed to reset that has led to a resultant increase in debt to the point that it impaired the economy s growth it is more than a coincidence that the fed s not so invisible hand has left fingerprints on previous financial unravellings given that credit related events tend to manifest from corporate debt we can see the evidence below we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us given the years of ultra accommodative policies following the financial crisis most of the ability to pull forward consumption appears to have run its course such is an issue that can t and won t be fixed by simply issuing more debt of course for the last 40 years such has been the preferred remedy of each administration in reality most of the aggregate growth in the economy was financed by deficit spending credit creation and a reduction in savings in turn this surge in debt reduced both productive investments and the output from the economy as the economy slowed and wages fell the consumer took on more leverage decreasing the savings rate as a result increases in rates divert more of their disposable incomes to service the debt a long history of terrible outcomes after four decades of surging debt against falling inflation and interest rates the fed now faces its most difficult position since the late 70s the u s economy is more heavily levered today than at any other point in human history since 1980 debt levels have continued to increase to fill the income gap bigger houses televisions computers etc all required cheaper debt to finance them the chart below shows the inflation adjusted median living standard and the difference between real disposable incomes dpi and the required debt to support it beginning in 1990 the gap between dpi and the cost of living went negative leading to a surge in debt usage in 2009 dpi alone could no longer support living standards without using debt today it requires almost 7000 a year in debt to maintain the current standard of living the rise and fall of stock prices have little to do with the average american and their participation in the domestic economy interest rates are an entirely different matter since interest rates affect payments increases in rates quickly negatively impact consumption housing and investment which ultimately deters economic growth since 1980 every time the fed tightened monetary policy by hiking rates inflation remained well contained the chart below shows the fed funds rate compared to the consumer price index cpi as a proxy for inflation the current bout of inflation is entirely different and as the fed hikes interest rates to slow economic demand it is highly probable they will over tighten history is replete with previous failed attempts that created economic shocks the fed s challenge the fed has a tough challenge ahead of them with very few options while increasing interest rates may not initially impact asset prices or the economy it is a far different story to suggest that they won t there have been absolutely zero times in history the federal reserve began an interest rate hiking campaign that did not eventually lead to a negative outcome the fed is now beginning to reduce accommodation at precisely the wrong time growing economic ambiguities in the u s and abroad peak autos peak housing peak gdp excessive valuations that exceed earnings growth expectations the failure of fiscal policy to trickle down geopolitical risks declining yield curves amid slowing economic growth record levels of private and public debt exceptionally low junk bond yields such are the essential ingredients required for the next financial event when will that be we don t know we know that the fed will make a policy mistake as this time is different unfortunately the outcome likely won t be
