a sobering tone took over wall street after a rally that added us 7 trillion to the stock market with traders bracing for hawkish rhetoric from federal reserve officials at the jackson hole retreat later this week equities saw their worst rout in two months following a surge that drove the s p 500 to its best start to a third quarter since 1932 the nasdaq 100 underperformed as treasury 10 year yields topped 3 per cent the meme stock frenzy continued to unravel with other speculative corners of the market like bitcoin and profitless tech firms also getting clobbered the cboe volatility index or vix soared as the dollar gained the euro sank to an almost two decade low the furious runup in us shares from june lows showed signs of fatigue as the earnings season wrapped up with the threat of an economic recession still looming large amid warnings from fed officials that the fight against inflation is far from over that stance will likely be reinforced by jerome powell friday at the prestigious event in wyoming s grand teton mountains which has been used by fed chairs as a venue for making key policy announcements he may try to send a clear message that even if they have a slower pace of rate hikes that won t signal a lower peak rate or that they will be quick to cut rates wrote ed moya senior market analyst at oanda after this week wall street should not be surprised if fed fund futures start pricing in rate hikes for next year this could be the week many return from vacation and double down on their bear market rally calls in fact while the recent surge in stocks has triggered chatter about a new bull run history shows there may be more turbulence ahead looking back to the last six bear markets since the 1970s four of them have experienced an average of six or seven short lived up trends according to glenmede the study also showed that the 17 per cent surge from june lows was consistent with historical bear market rallies there may be further downside to the ongoing bear market justifying an underweight to risk assets wrote jason pride the firm s chief investment officer of private wealth investors are also waking up to the imminent acceleration of the fed s balance sheet reduction so called quantitative tightening kicks into top gear next month and will add to pressure on riskier assets which have benefited from ample liquidity strategists at bank of america corp last week said that the winding down of the central bank s balance sheet poses a risk to equity prices meantime hedge funds are rapidly positioning for higher rates in a key corner of the derivatives market the group has collectively placed a big short across futures referencing the official successor to london interbank offered rate known as the secured overnight financing rate this wager stands to benefit should powell effectively rule out a dovish pivot this week the debate for most investors has shifted from a focus on the odds of a recession to how the fed will impact markets according to lindsey bell chief money and markets strategist at ally who bets volatility will likely increase as investors look for catalysts with real rates still rising and prospects for 2023 rate cuts fading in the bond market stock valuations look extremely stretched especially if as we suspect policy driven economic slowing will prove an obstacle to currently optimistic 2023 earnings estimates lisa shalett chief investment officer at morgan stanley wealth management said in a note stocks are overbought sit it out for now stocks and bonds are set to tumble once more even though inflation has likely peaked according to the latest mliv pulse survey as rate hikes reawaken the great 2022 selloff ahead of the jackson hole symposium 68 per cent of respondents see the most destabilizing era of price pressures in decades eroding corporate margins and sending equities lower as investors wonder whether the selloff will get worse from here lori calvasina at rbc capital markets says it seems premature to call an end to the rebound just yet even with stocks set up for some choppiness in the second half of 2022 deeply depressed levels of investor sentiment which continue to show signs of healing have kept us out of the bearish camp she added elsewhere gold dropped for a sixth day as a stronger dollar and higher bond yields are bad for bullion as it pays

let s start the day with a bit of trivia shall we the lucas oil nationals joined the nhra tour in 1982 and the first pro champions were shirley muldowney top fuel frank hawley funny car and lee shepherd pro stock ironically all three went on to win championships that season the qualifiers for the first event include mark oswald and connie kalitta who are still active as crew chief and team owner respectively and both are in brainerd this weekend current pro mod crew chief frank manzo also won the inaugural event in top alcohol funny car just one of his 105 career victories the lucas oil nationals has been contested every year with the exception of 2020 and it has always been placed on the schedule in august ahead of the u s nationals in indianapolis the all time leader in wins is john force with 11 followed by manzo with 7 while ron capps joe amato and sportsman standout gary stinnett each have 6 wins at bir oh and the track is also famous for its campground affectionately known at the brainerd zoo the massive 200 acre campground is annually host to some of nhra s most animated and enthusiastic fans and it s a tradition that many nhra pro drivers join in the after hours fun on friday and saturday evening the first car down the track during sunday s final eliminations was josh hart s r l carriers dragster and he gave an indication of things to come with a solid 3 710 and a career best 334 73 mph top speed hart looking to clinch his spot in the countdown breezed into the second round since his opponent scott farley smoked the tires just off the starting line hart has advanced past round one at every event since bristol farley made just one qualifying run and did not have a representative elapsed time it took a couple of days but antron brown and his matco tools team finally found their way into the 3 6s with a strong 3 688 run and they needed it as opponent clay millican was in the hunt with a 3 721 brown hadn t run in the 3 6s since the 2019 season so it was a welcome relief to the team particularly co crew chief brian corradi we we ve been trying to do that all weekend said corradi it s a reminder to always stay humble because this is a tough sport as soon as you think you ve caught the tiger you get bit one of the most anticipated matches of the first round featured mike salinas and steve torrence two drivers that are battling for the top spot in top fuel what should have been a great side by side race turned into a one side affair after salinas pep boys dragster smoked the tires at mid track torrence got the win but he wasn t exactly dominant with a 3 755 at just 313 37 mph that being said a win is a win and the capco team is happy to get round wins whenever and however they can we got 100 percent lucky on that one noted car chief bobby lagana we weren t supposed to win but we did the seemingly endless stream of fireworks from the brainerd zoo campground have nothing on the fireworks that took place between doug kalitta and tony schumacher in their round one battle schumacher fresh off his first win of the season picked up another victory in the maynard family dragster but the run weas expensive for both teams kalitta destroyed an engine at half track in a ball of fire while schumacher s okuma themed dragster threw the connecting rods out at the finish line causing an oildown schumacher and kalitta have had many memorable battles over the years and this was just another chapter in their longtime rivalry can you get up for a race like this how can you not get up for it said schumacher it hiked the front end spun tires and i pedaled it it definitely blew itself up we hung the rods out i m sorry we re breaking stuff but we ve got to get this car to run quicker brittany is out there running 3 64 and we don t have a tune up for that we ve got work to do there are no gimme s in drag racing and bob tasca iii was remined of that when he took on dale creasy jr in the opening round of eliminations tasca s motorcraft quick lane ford ran the numbers that many expected with a 3 891 at over 330 mph but down track he wasn t exactly putting daylight between himself and creasy who solved an early clutch issue to run a career best 3 967 at 327 43 the run even surprised tasca s crew chief mike neff who has been around long enough to know not to take any opponent lightly it s neat to see those guys over there get so excited said neff pointing to creasy s crew for us we just need to keep on going this is a new day and we need to take this round by round and see if we can keep going another member of the we got away with one club is ron capps who advanced over rival john force but didn t exactly light up the scoreboards with a 3 931 force grabbed an early lead with his customary deep stage made his best run of the weekend but it was just a 4 022 so he finished well behind capps for the record capps and force have now raced seven times this year and capps now holds a 4 3 advantage we absolutely got away with one there said capps co crew chief dean guido antonelli i really thought we d run 3 89 or so we need to take a look at it and see what we can fix for the next round because that s not going to get it done today bobby bode went to the final in houston earlier this year and nearly beat matt hagan so it s probably not fair to call his round one win over cruz pedregon an upset but the 20 year old college student continued his impressive intro into the nitro funny car class with a strong 3 931 to defeat pedregon s 3 947 for the bode family brainerd int l raceway holds a special place in their hearts since bob bode won his lone national event there in 2010 this was just like a normally morning for me said the younger bode we have a lot of friends and family here and this is the place where dad won in 2010 a 3 93 is exactly what we wanted we knew we had it in the car said bode jr is so tough so it s a big deal for us to get by them i love brainerd this is the greatest race of the year tony schumacher must be living right after winning the opening round with an off pace 3 940 tony schumacher made it to the semifinals with a 4 22 after josh hart smoked the tires but wait there s more schumacher nearly missed the run after his team discovered an electrical issue in the pit area with just minutes left on the clock and the designated first pair the maynard okuma team made a mad dash through the pit area and arrived just in time to make the run schumacher won just five rounds in the first 12 events of the season but now has seven in the last three races including his 86th career win in seattle much has been made of brittany force s greatly improved reaction times this season but her performance in round two demonstrated the markings of someone who has become a complete top fuel driver force and opponent billy torrence both smoked the tires not far off the starting line and both quickly went into pedal mode in an effort to get the car to recover force squeezed the throttle at the right time and kept her monster energy dragster pointed straight downtrack to take a 4 39 to 4 58 victory and move to the semifinals for the eighth time in 15 events this season ironically force will have lane choice in the semifinals since opponent steve torrence also won a pedal fest against antron brown albeit with a slower 4 94 elapsed time all six cars ahead of them smoked the tires but traction didn t seem to be an issue for justin ashley or shawn langdon in their quarterfinal round langdon ran a 3 80 which was the second best run of the round but that wasn t nearly enough to stay with ashley who wheeled the phillips connect dragster to a very impressive 3 726 to secure the win and lane choice against tony schumacher in the semi s we saw guys having a hard time getting off the starting line but i think we were prepared for that before we got up here said crew chief mike green ashley noted that felt confident after watching assistant crew chief tommy delago make adjustments to the fuel and clutch timers before the car was fired the round two battle between robert hight and j r todd could easily have featured a pair of 3 8 second runs but that wasn t the case as they both smoked the tires early and the end result was a side by side pedal fest that ended with both the auto club camaro and the dhl toyota on fire in the shut down area hight won the battle 4 356 to 4 451 as todd s car quit and caught fire just before the finish line todd managed to slide the car to a stop and the fire was quickly extinguished seconds later the nhra safety safari went to work extinguishing a small fire in the engine diaper of hight s car hight will now take on bob tasca iii in a battle between the two hottest drivers in the funny car class this summer it spun the tires and i pedaled it and stuck with it said todd i knew robert was having problems over there when you pedal it it sometimes puts holes out and the next thing you know you re on fire i feel bad for my guys it s probably gonna be a late night i ll take the blame for that hight s recollection of the race happens to be remarkably similar to todd s whoever gets to finish line first wins so you ve got to stay with it said hight once i gathered mine up i didn t think i d catch him but i starting inching up i stayed with it and kept my foot down i don t like doing that because you know you re going to blow it up and it did that s not something we usually do with our auto club team we take pride in running a clean operation but you ve got to do what you ve got to do given the amount of tire smoke in round two it was no surprise the session ended with another pedal fest as alexis dejoria got her bandero tequila toyota to the finish line ahead of low qualifier matt hagan s dodge albeit with a 5 71 elapsed time the win was good timing for dejoria who recently had a conversation with crew chief del worsham about saving a tire smoking run dejoria is now int the semifinals for the fourth time this season and she can reach her first final by beating fellow toyota team driver and reigning world champ ron capps in the final four the semifinal round is set in the fueltech pro mod series and rickie smith will take on his rival stevie fast jackson for spot in the final the winner will face doug winters who earned a bye run in his supercharged chevelle after j r gray fouled in the second round by a maddening three thousandths of a second winters had struggled earlier but made a respectable 5 915 run smith beat mike castellana on a tiny holeshot 5 798 to 5 781 while jackson topped jose gonzales with a 5 758 with incoming leader kris thorne on the sidelines the round is crucial for both smith and jackson who have a long history as rivals stick around we re gonna give you a show said jackson i tripped a bit yesterday but that was a good win jose is as good as they come now we get to take on rickie it s going to be a show after tire smoke decided most of the match ups in the second round of top fuel and funny car there was more of the same in the semifinals the round began with a highly anticipated match between world champs steve torrence and brittany force neither dragster made it to the christmas tree under power as both smoked the tires immediately torrence managed to get his capco dragster pointed in the right direction and won with a 5 400 after force s monster dragster got sideway and came close to the centerline tony schumacher also ran his career record to 4 0 against justin ashley in another race defined by tire smoke ashley s car lit the tires almost immediately while schumacher made it further downtrack but turned on the win light with a 4 33 schumacer s okuma dragster also shed a body panel before the finish line but by that point the race had long since been decided schumacher ran his record to 8 1 since his team was purchased by joe and cathi maynard prior to the seattle event the first pair of the funny car semifinals was decided early when alexis dejoria red lighted but it might not have mattered as ron capps bucked the tire smoke trend and put down a solid 3 955 in his napa toyota capps reached the final for the fourth time this season and the first time since bristol and will face bob tasca iii tasca is headed to the final for the fifth time in six events and has a good chance to pull off a third win after stopping robert hight in the semifinals tasca earned lane choice for his 26th career final with an impressive 3 926 after the houston event in april tasca was buried in ninth place in

a positive environment for cyclical assets kolanovic wrote in a note to clients on monday kolanovic has remained bullish through most of 2022 despite the sharp declines for stocks in the first half of the year the aggressive selling by investors earlier this year is a key reason why stocks can go higher from here kolonovic said given our core view that there will be no global recession and that

as smoke filled the skies over portland during the riverside and beachie creek fires in 2020 scientists from pacific northwest national laboratory gathered their air quality equipment to get a closer look at the air inside homes what the scientists found could help people keep the air inside their homes cleaner even as wildfire smoke season gets longer in the pacific northwest we found that even with a completely shut home we still had really high penetrations of particulate matter indoors said chrissi antonopoulos a senior analyst with pacific northwest national laboratory for a little more than a week scientists set up air quality monitors inside and outside a home in portland the monitoring stations collected data every two minutes for a few days that summer portland earned the distinction of the city with the most polluted air in the world the people inside the home which was built in 1928 kept all their windows closed and avoided cooking or other activities such as burning candles that increase air pollution indoors however the smoke particles found their way inside the scientists looked at the ratio of pollution outside to pollution inside which peaked at almost 80 antonopoulos said the old housing stock that we have here is not adequate to protect us from either extreme heat or large scale pollution events from wildfires she said our housing is old and leaky when the scientists added a portable air cleaner with a hepa filter to the home the inside air quality dramatically improved antonopoulos said however the air quality still showed unhealthy particulate levels particulates from smoke can irritate people s respiratory and cardiovascular systems especially people with asthma copd and coronary artery disease wildfire smoke also is dangerous for children older adults and pregnant women moreover wildfire smoke often has a greater impact on people with a lower socioeconomic status according to an article from the american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers journal keeping inside air clean often costs money antonopoulos said however some solutions cost less than others she suggested a few ways to keep air as healthy as possible when the skies fill with smoke make a space at home that s kept as smoke free as possible known as a clean room to do that seal off one room especially the windows plastic air sealing covers can make the windows more air tight and towels can work under the doors antonopoulos said keep the door shut as much as possible to do that seal off one room especially the windows plastic air sealing covers can make the windows more air tight and towels can work under the doors antonopoulos said keep the door shut as much as possible use a hepa grade air filtration system make sure the amount of air the filtration system cleans at a time fits the size of the room it s in save money by making a filter with a box fan the key is to have the highest filter possible antonopoulos said the key is to have the highest filter possible antonopoulos said keep the filter clean and change it every three months especially after long days with lots of smoke antonopoulos said manually check air filters to see if they look black and dusty avoid running window air conditioners as much as possible and turn off ventilation like in bathrooms that pull air inside air conditioners are just pulling sucking in the outdoor air indoors use them as little as possible just enough to get some cooling she said avoid creating other indoor air pollution such as cooking with a gas stove or burning incense or candles seal up attics foundations and windows for the long term with the help of professionals closing up tiny cracks can help keep out polluted outside air however antonopoulos said it can also keep polluted indoor air inside homes however more research needs to be done antonopoulos said to develop filtration technologies that are integrated better into central air systems new technologies also need to be accessible and affordable to everyone she said so we need to find technologies that aren t going to increase the energy burdens and that also can be distributed equitably antonopoulos said

cyclical assets jpmorgan global strategist marko kolanovic is sticking with his bullish view on the u s economy and stocks we maintain that inflation will resolve on its own as distortions fade and

if you listen to philosophical discussions the pediatrician and psychoanalyst d w winnicott writes in the child the family and the outside world from 1964 you sometimes hear people using a lot of words over the business of what is real and what is not real a well adjusted adult winnicott goes on has a solid grasp of what is real and objective versus what is imaginary and subjective a child crucially has not yet made this distinction the world that we share with the child is also the child s own imaginative world and so the child is able to experience it intensely the reason for this is that we do not insist when we are dealing with a child of that age on an exact perception of the external world yet the problem in the first season finale of nathan fielder s the rehearsal is just that a world that insists on itself as it is and not as a child imagines it or in this case as a child has been directed to imagine it in the show s immersive improvisational domestic scenario a boy named remy is one of several children who are cast as the son of fielder s alter ego remy calls nathan daddy they exchange i love you s they re even comedically simpatico after remy invents a character named dr fart nathan praises the kid s ability to escalate the sketch soon enough though the external world intrudes on the imaginative one remy s time on the show is ending but his idea of nathan as daddy is not the boy doesn t have a dad at home he is lost and inconsolable and nathan s remorse is palpable a central question that hangs over the rehearsal as well as fielder s previous semi reality series nathan for you is that of informed consent to what extent do fielder s subjects understand what they are taking part in and how much does it matter the uncertainty is most precipitous whenever fielder s project has involved children who of course can t give informed consent at all either to participate in the first place or to have their participation edited into a public permanent record nathan for you in which nathan offered terrible advice to small business owners featured in a season 3 episode a wondrously deranged segment in which he tried to persuade a hotel proprietor to stock a portable soundproof box that completely isolates the child from his parents carnal acts part of the product testing phase was placing the box and the unwitting little boy inside it a few feet from a full blown orgy even when nathan for you crossed ethical lines the results could have a grim usefulness to them a season 2 segment about a dud toy called the doink it nathan enlists santa claus himself to convince kids that owning the doink it is the only way to avert a kind of social death becomes an unsettling exhibit in how quickly and easily a child can be molded manipulated and deceived even the most sympathetic viewer may conclude that this is in part what the rehearsal became too part of the brilliance and seduction of the show however is in its slipperiness its mutability it never stops changing and never stays in place and so for all we know remy and nathan s misery was mostly staged or heavily contrived in the editing room with that in mind then perhaps the best way to watch the rehearsal is borrowing from winnicott to assume the child s point of view attempt no discernment between real and not real accept whatever your imagination gives you and experience it intensely for example following a tearful scene with remy nathan s mien conveys something that even the most capable parent may feel a few times in their child management career the overwhelming certainty of having completely and irreparably fucked up you might look at nathan just then and see yourself that too is real it didn t take long for the rehearsal to become a show overtly about parenting at first though for all its absurdist convolutions and seemingly unlimited budget it sat more or less adjacent to any number of expert advice reality tv programs just as nathan for you did in the first episode we meet kor skeete who wants to come clean about a long ago lie he told a friend so nathan casts an actress to play the friend and directs his production team to build a full sized replica of the bar in which the admission will unfold now kor has a scene partner and a stage for rehearsing his confession over and over although nathan remains the dramatist the auteur in another episode a subject patrick wants to rehearse asking his brother for his share of a family inheritance nathan s remedy involves among other things a literal gold digging expedition angela introduced in episode 2 wants to rehearse marriage and motherhood so nathan sets her up in her dream home and arranges a round the clock rotation of child actors including remy who age from infancy to teenhood under her roof it is with angela that the rehearsal begins to shape shift when the hall of mirrors starts multiplying on itself and turning inward a suitable marriage rehearsal partner cannot be located for angela whose brand of christianity is as extreme as her capacity for passive aggression and who believes that phenomena ranging from halloween to google are satanic so nathan steps into the role himself amplifying the show s title and underscoring the new pressures upon him as a performer nathan opens and begins teaching classes at the fielder method school of acting but then he casts an actor to play him and casts himself as one of his own students i wanted to impress nathan student nathan confides in voice over nathan realizes that he hasn t established sufficiently dad like relationships with any of the child actors playing adam angela s pretend son so he sets aside his other rehearsals to focus on angela s alone adam age fifteen is angry and deep into drugs he is made to o d so that the show can rewind to adam age six and grant nathan a do over at fatherhood by the end of the fifth episode angela has self ejected from her own rehearsal adam has become jewish like his dad and father and son are celebrating hanukkah together a high point of the episode is when nathan s voice over declares it was time to stand up for my own values as the camera watches him dragging angela s christmas tree out of the house and with a little grunt heaving it into the woods other viewers including my colleague naomi fry have pointed out the many similarities between the rehearsal and the 2008 film synecdoche new york written and directed by charlie kaufman both center on a protagonist who is simultaneously passive and a control freak who directs his actors to stalk the real figures whom they are playing and who dumps insane amounts of other people s money on giant film sets that are replicas of actual places but synecdoche is death haunted dirge like intentionally airless whereas the rehearsal is a thrilling paradox ostensibly designed and mapped and thought through to all logical extremes and yet it feels as though anything can happen synecdoche in a typical flourish enacts its parental anxieties by making the lead character s daughter renounce him on her deathbed before expiring of tattoo ink poisoning the rehearsal in contrast depicts every parent s worst nightmare then simply reincarnates the kid adam s rebirth is engineered by sending the teen age version of him down an enclosed chute like playground slide only for the little kid version to emerge from the other end it s sort of like the end of big the maneuver carries a double risk it might scan either as mawkish or as a mean prank on those who are moved by mawkishness the scene evokes the balancing act of another kaufman script the one for adaptation which was directed by spike jonze and adapted from my colleague susan orlean s book the orchid thief in adaptation the twin brother screenwriters charlie and donald kaufman embody a sense and sensibility duality charlie is a genius cerebral self doubting neurotic averse to formula and any perceived excess of sentiment but longing to feel passionate about something donald is shambling and trite lacking in obvious talent but also freer braver unafraid of embarrassment when charlie discloses that the girl donald loved in high school made fun of him behind his back donald is unfazed it was mine that love i owned it he says you are what you love not what loves you when i first saw adaptation upon its release in 2002 i wondered whether the film was endorsing donald s attitude or mocking it but kaufman and jonze were never asking us to choose nathan himself articulates this either both world view when he is rehearsing a confrontation with a version of angela who is played by an actress from the fielder method school fake angela in character demands to know how seriously or not she should be taking the rehearsal it s silly and serious nathan replies i mean it s complicated life can be more than one thing right in other words you can cry a little when adam comes down the slide and laugh a little at yourself for doing so by you i mean me the entire arc of season 1 of the rehearsal maps onto the journey of parenthood you start by trying to foresee preëmpt and outwit the future by believing as nathan does in the early rehearsals that it may be possible to leave almost nothing to chance and you end up dwelling on the many times when parenthood and childhood outwitted you nathan recruits others to stand in for remy a slightly older child a full grown man a doll etc he deploys them in order to relive his time with remy and see if there was a better path he explains after all how can you move on from a mistake if you don t even know what you could have done to avoid it this final turn which casts nathan in a new role too produces the season s ambiguous vertiginous and astonishing climax there s even a killer punch line is it real nathan fielder s autonomic nervous system appears to think so his voice snags for a split second he begins breathing harder his ears turn a bright deep red sorrow is a proof of love he says sadness means that your heart works life s better with surprises he says or as winnicott writes there is no such thing as life without tears except where there is compliance without spontaneity

development ticad vi in nairobi kenya 28 august 2016 photo epa dai kurokawa as the 30th anniversary of the tokyo international conference on african development ticad approaches observers of this flagship for japan s relations with africa have raised questions about its relevance and future direction advertisement don t want to see this remove ads in a commentary published on 22 june 2022 in the japanese newspaper nihon keizai shinbun satoshi shimoda a senior staff writer of the broadsheet intimated that certain senior japanese government officials are desperate to see the end of the ticad and hope it will cease to exist by 2028 when ticad x is expected to be convened in the context of the impending ticad viii in tunis tunisia on 27 and 28 august 2022 questions have been raised about what the forum has achieved since its inception in 1993 professor keiichi shirato of ritsumeikan university has suggested that the summit would do well to use the occasion to assess japan s failed promises to increase japanese investments in africa following the end of the cold war japan boldly deviated from its hitherto stagnant relations with african countries embracing what was posited as more proactive relations with africa that would involve comprehensive economic development packages to help advance the economies in the region in assuming such a position japan rhetorically distanced itself from the pervading discourses at the time about donor aid fatigue in relation to africa a point the japanese ministry of foreign affairs mofa noted as the trigger for the ticad process the first of the recent trend towards multilateral arrangements between africa and the major economies including china s forum on china africa cooperation focac although the japanese government orchestrates and single handedly funds and manages the ticad the initiative is in principle co organised with the united nations the world bank the united nations development programme the african union commission and other relevant partners this arrangement was articulated to preempt potential external criticism against japan as attempting to encroach on the interests of africa s traditional partners the sort of opprobrium china has experienced in its recent relations with africa advertisement don t want to see this remove ads procedurally since 1993 the ticad was held once every five years in japan but this changed following the fifth summit in 2013 when it was agreed that the summits would be held every three years this was due to pressure on mofa from the african countries to lessen the gap between the summits to mirror those of the focac which meets every three years rotating the venue of the summits between japan and the african countries as was the practice with focac was also incorporated into the ticad process consequently ticad vi the first to be held in africa was convened in nairobi kenya in 2016 and ticad viii will be held this year in tunis since 2011 the summits have been interspersed with interministerial meetings which are convened to review progress on decisions and agreements made at the previous summit meeting according to mofa ticad vi in 2016 attracted 11 000 attendees including representatives presidents prime ministers foreign ministers etc of 53 african countries as well as representatives of development partner countries and asian countries international and regional organisations the private sector and nongovernmental organisations ngos advertisement don t want to see this remove ads ticad vii in 2019 attracted 53 leaders of 42 african countries and drew more than 10 000 attendees including representatives of 52 countries outside africa europe the united states and asia representatives of 108 international and regional organisations and representatives of the private sector and ngos the indications now are that the bloated ticad summits are past their sell by date as far as the japanese government is concerned ticad viii is planning to heavily trim down the number of attendees by confining side events to online it is estimated that 100 corporate and start up entrepreneurs will be invited to the event but according to shirato it is not clear how many african leaders will attend reflecting uncertainties even among the latter about the usefulness of the ticad not least because it has so far failed to engender the expected japanese private sector investments in africa according to shimoda the problem is that the script for the japanese government s plan to transform japan s relations with the african countries from an aid based initiative to a private sector led development through ticad is yet to be drafted in other words the whole exercise is like making a movie without a script advertisement don t want to see this remove ads indeed although japan is the third largest economy in the world it is not among the top 10 countries with the largest foreign direct investment fdi stocks in africa according to the 2022 world investment report of the united nations conference on trade and development the balance of japan s fdi in africa which stood at approximately 12 billion at the end of 2013 has continued to decline and had fallen to about 4 8 billion at the end of 2020 compared to 65 billion from the uk 60 billion from france 49 billion from the netherlands 48 billion from the us and 43 billion from china japan s fdi stocks in africa even pale in comparison to those of singapore and switzerland at 21 billion and 17 billion respectively according to a survey conducted by the singapore based asia africa investment and consulting pte ltd there are about 500 japanese companies operating in africa compared to about 2 500 chinese companies 2 000 us companies and 1 100 french companies inspired by these indicators shimoda has used a rather colourful euphemism to describe japan s private sector led initiative through ticad as no more than a chic picture of a japanese rice cake omochi the point being that no matter how delicious the cake may look in the picture it is not edible the problem is that since its inception in the early 1990s the ticad has been micromanaged by mofa the ticad was the brainchild of senior officials of the foreign ministry but more importantly japan s prominent economic ministries the ministry of international trade and industries now the ministry of economy trade and industries and the ministry of finance were not particularly involved in the planning and organisation of the platform this calls into question the development objectives and content of the ticad as the economic ministries are germane to whatever arrangements the japanese government makes regarding economic development secondly and in relation to the point above mofa designed the ticad as an advisory platform for africa s economic development that would not be supported by financial pledges from japan but would instead act as a vehicle through which expert advice and guidance conceptually and technically would be given to the african governments this deviated from the recognisable formula integral to japanese aid to the east asian countries which involved comprehensive economic cooperation packages with the trinity of aid direct investment and imports from developing countries what has been referred to as the linchpin of japan s win win approach designed to contribute to the aid recipient s economic development as well as the promotion of japan s exports according to professor yasutami shimomura consequently japanese aid to africa even in the context of the ticad was until 2013 largely limited to the provision of humanitarian assistance attempts to transform the ticad into a business oriented venture based on the formula above began in 2007 and became more formalised at ticad iv in 2008 this was because the african economies had been growing since 2000 largely due to the increase in trade with china basically as perceptions about the economic prospects of the african countries began to shift towards the positive the attitudes of the japanese government and the japanese business community towards the ticad began to alter correspondingly thus unlike the previous summits ticad iv in 2008 was calibrated to encompass action oriented outcomes with an emphasis on public private partnership subsequently then prime minister shinzo abe tried to use the forum in the interests of abenomics the policies his government devised to redeem japan from its protracted economic stagnation pressures from the prime minister s office on the economic ministries and the japanese private sector might have helped to sensitise these entities about economic prospects in africa as such from about 2013 the doyukai japan association of corporate executives also made several recommendations to the japanese government to leverage the japanese private sector s involvement in the ticad for example the doyukai exhorted the japanese government to establish multiple development goals and attach timescales and finance to them in effect the japanese business community started to demand more development assistance from the japanese government towards african countries the association was forthright in requesting that the japanese government take a more strategic and flexible approach to oda to meet the needs of both african countries and japan s national interest the doyukai further proposed that the japanese government set forth and implement a focused strategy for africa oriented around the needs and priorities of the private sector as a means to encourage companies wishing to set up operations in africa and asked for the japanese government s assistance in prioritising the needs of the private sector even the conservative and idiosyncratic keidanren japan business federation which metaphorically would obsessively check a stone bridge to ensure its security and still not cross it affirmed in a 2018 recommendation that increased yen loans grant aid and japan bank for international cooperation jbic investment and loans as well as relaxed conditions for financing and increased guarantees through nippon export and investment insurance nexi will continue to be essential for the development of africa despite these initiatives japanese private sector involvement in africa s economic development has remained sluggish the japanese business community would no doubt attribute the problem to the fact that the development assistance they expected as seed money for africa s economic development has not been forthcoming despite pledges by the japanese government at each of the ticad summits since 2013 in addition in a recent survey the japan external trade organisation pointed out that while business momentum in africa is growing concerns about risks remain noting that in terms of management issues preparation implementation of legal regulations was the biggest risk of the firms the organisation surveyed approximately 80 viewed this as a problem indicating strong concerns about governance in truth the african countries have tended to troop to the summits with a shopping list of demands and expectations and offer almost nothing in return despite the name and the rhetoric surrounding the ticad as a development initiative it was conceived by its originator ambassador yoshio hatano then japan s permanent representative to the united nations as a diplomatic lever to raise japan s profile on the international stage in order to gain a permanent security council seat at the united nations the feasibility of which would depend on support from the african countries at the general assembly that failed the forum was subsequently inadvertently rejigged to fit what its name promised to help propel the development of the african economies that aim has continued to flounder because the script for the project is yet to be written according to shimoda in the meantime some japanese policymakers feel exasperated by the ticad nevertheless the japanese government will hesitate to ditch what has become one of its foreign policy flagships there are also bureaucratic forces within the mofa and its agencies that would fight to keep it plodding along as a diplomatic platform for japan s international profile although the bloated ticad summits may be much slimmed down as may the development content of the initiative it would not be at all surprising if japan used the summit this month primarily as a platform to make pronouncements about the war in ukraine and its

by aditi shah and norihiko shirouzu bidadi india reuters toyota is rebooting its strategy for india doubling down on a bet that emerging markets will learn to love its hybrids as long as the price is right renowned for its pioneering prius the japanese carmaker has struggled to sell large numbers of its hybrid camry sedan since its indian debut in 2013 partly due to a sticker price of more than eight times the annual income of a middle class family this time toyota is determined to do it differently with lower cost hybrids said four company and industry executives and suppliers who provided previously unreported details about the carmaker s sourcing production and pricing strategy central to the strategy is a drive to cut the cost of full hybrid powertrains by making them in india where the automaker s factories are running well below capacity and to source key materials within the country toyota motor nyse is also leveraging its cooperation with partner suzuki motor majority owner of india s biggest carmaker maruti to benefit from its low cost engineering know how and mild hybrid technology the hybrid bet is a turning point it will be a litmus test for toyota s future and success in india one person with direct knowledge of toyota s plans told reuters a full hybrid can be driven for stretches on electric power whereas mild hybrid technology only supplements the combustion engine to help cut emissions however mild hybrids have smaller batteries and cost far less toyota s indian strategy is at odds with global rivals volkswagen etr general motors nyse and india s tata motors nyse which are rushing to roll out pure electric vehicles evs and comes in the face of criticism from investors for sticking with fossil fuel hybrids hybrids are generally cheaper than evs as they typically have smaller batteries and are not reliant on charging stations important factors in markets such as india where customers are price sensitive and charging infrastructure can be patchy toyota declined to share details about cost savings future product launches car pricing strategies or production plans for full or mild hybrid models in india the world s biggest automaker told reuters it wanted more first time buyers in india to own full hybrids as a first step towards mass electrification and that it would continue to increase local sourcing and production to be competitive learning to love mild toyota s first new hybrid to hit india s roads will be the urban cruiser hyryder a compact sports utility vehicle suv which two people with knowledge of the plan said is likely to be priced around 25 000 less than half the price of the camry that would pit it against popular midsize combustion engine suvs made by hyundai motor and kia motor in a fast growing segment that makes up 18 of car sales in india the world s fourth biggest auto market the full hybrid hyryder however will be 31 more fuel efficient than the hyundai and kia diesel models offering an economy of 28 km per litre 65 miles per gallon a key metric for indian buyers to bring down the cost of the hyryder which will be sold by toyota and suzuki it will use a hybrid system originally developed for subcompact cars or one size smaller according to a toyota engineer familiar with hybrid technology by combining the hybrid system with a low cost chassis and some upper body parts from suzuki the end result is an suv on a par with or slightly cheaper than the prius sedan which starts at 25 000 in the united states the high cost complexity of hybrids is hard to overcome but it s a good start the toyota source who was not involved in the hyryder s development said savings have also come from working with suzuki on designing and developing the suv as well as leveraging the scale and pricing power with suppliers of maruti which produced eight of the 10 best selling models in india in 2021 even so there is a cost differential of 3 400 between toyota s full hybrid and its comparable gasoline car in india said another source higher than the typical differential of about 2 000 for toyota in most countries to boost sales in india s price sensitive market toyota will also sell hyryders with a mild hybrid powertrain supplied by suzuki a significant departure for toyota which has long championed full hybrids the shift is a recognition that toyota has been unable to bring down the cost of full hybrids to the point where they can always compete on price in markets such as india the people familiar with toyota s planning said it also shows how toyota is altering its strategy for different markets depending on what buyers want and are willing to pay as we come down the price points we hope to increase our numbers as well as our market share vikram kirloskar vice chairman of toyota kirloskar motor the japanese company s indian unit told reuters toyota s next hybrid for india will be a multi purpose vehicle or people carrier expected later this year or early in 2023 two sources said building in bidadi another factor affecting the hyryder s price is taxation india levies taxes of 43 on hybrids on a par with gasoline or diesel suvs and far higher than the 5 tax on evs toyota is lobbying to get the taxes reduced sources said the company said it wants new delhi to provide support including taxation to all green technologies that help india achieve its goal of reducing fossil fuel and carbon emissions so far the government has not shown any interest in extending its fiscal support beyond evs making hybrid powertrains in india aligns toyota with prime minister narendra modi s drive to boost local manufacturing especially at a time when major car companies such as ford motor nyse have left the country it also comes as india tightens fuel efficiency and emission targets for carmakers selling hybrids will help toyota meet its regulatory requirements as credits they earn will go towards offsetting the production of fossil fuel vehicles at the toyota kirloskar auto parts factory in bidadi an industrial town near bengaluru in southern india the japanese automaker s new indian strategy is already in motion a joint venture between toyota its parts affiliate aisin seiki co and india s kirloskar systems the plant is manufacturing e drives for the toyota hybrid system the e drive ensures seamless switching between the engine and electric motor and shifting the manufacture of one of the hybrid system s four key components to india is a major move toyota sees the bidadi factory as a starting point for building a local supply chain for the evs it will eventually bring to india we now have the core technology whether it s an electric vehicle or a hybrid kirloskar said it s a huge bet the plant can make 135 000 e drives a year on one assembly line and could raise that to over 400 000 by adding two more about 55 of raw materials by value for the e drives come from india two sources said capital equipment such as tools and dies are also made there though rare earth magnets for the motors and some other components are imported the cost savings on the made in india e drives are expected to be in the double digits in percentage terms compared with imported systems one source said toyota will also export them back to japan for hybrid cars built there as well as to countries in southeast asia india is one of the lowest cost bases for these parts we are competitive on this kirloskar said adding that he expected about 40 to 50 to be exported though that could change depending on local demand of the three other main hybrid components toyota already makes engines in india but the 1 8 kilowatt hour kwh lithium ion batteries and power control units will be imported for now toyota is making the hyryder at its under used and revamped plant in bidadi which has an annual capacity of 200 000 cars more than 50 of hyryder pre orders are for the full hybrid though people aware of toyota s production plans say this could settle at 30 to 40 with the cheaper mild hybrid becoming more popular in india where most cars sell for under 15 000 once numbers pick up the cost will come to a point where hybrids will become mainstream this will lay the ground for an eventual switch to fully electric or fuel cell vehicles said one person familiar with toyota s plans it s a huge bet but we know electrification is the future

menafn afp us central bankers have been hammering home a single message interest rates will rise until inflation begins to come down but financial markets keep hoping to hear a different tune one indicating the pace of rate hikes will slow all eyes will be on this week s annual gathering of policymakers in jackson hole wyoming to hear federal reserve chair jerome powell explain his stance again with market watchers hoping to get something more to their liking the fed could be a victim of its own success after keeping the benchmark borrowing rate at zero throughout the pandemic the steep spike in prices which surged to a 40 year high following russia s invasion of ukraine prompted the central bank to take aggressive action in the battle to contain red hot inflation which topped nine percent in june the fed has hiked rates four times including massive three quarter point increases in june and july steep moves unheard of since the early 1980s but in recent weeks signs of easing price pressures and a slowing economy along with falling energy costs and indications global supply chain snarls have lessened caused financial markets to become optimistic the fed will dial back or even pause rate increases and even begin to cut next year stocks on wall street have risen for four straight weeks despite a string of officials repeating the message that rates will continue to rise even though annual inflation slowed in july as oil prices fell while the annual gathering often becomes a place for global central bankers to signal shifting policy powell is expected to repeat that message friday though he may acknowledge that a slowdown will come later in the year it does seem like what we ve heard from powell so far suggests there s quite a high bar for them to transition from aggressive hikes to a slower pace of 25 basis point steps said jonathan millar of barclays millar who served as a fed economist and forecaster under four central bank chiefs told afp that markets are looking further ahead anticipating the rate hikes will be successful in slowing inflation but for policymakers one thing they definitely want to communicate is that they remain very much focused on issues with price stability and that they will react very cautiously to any signs of improvements in the inflation data that means indications prices are coming down more broadly not just because of falling oil managing the market s expectations is really job one millar said they have to enforce that credibility but like other economists he believes the fed s policy setting federal open market committee fomc at its september meeting will step down to a 0 5 percentage point increase taking the range of the key lending rate up to 2 75 to 3 0 percent to be followed up with quarter point hikes in november and december walking a narrow line kathy bostjancic of oxford economics said the dilemma for powell is to recognize the progress towards achieving a soft landing bringing inflation back down towards the two percent target without derailing economic growth while confirming the fed s resolve he continues to have to walk kind of a narrow line she told afp you don t want to be too pessimistic and with housing prices and sales cooling from their torrid pace along with other encouraging data he has the wind at his back but she said the message he really has to give is that we re still going to be looking to raise rates to restrictive level to really make sure inflation is still our number one priority the annual monetary policy symposium hosted by the kansas city federal reserve bank runs august 25 27 it often is a place for officials from around the world to come to discuss policy changes in the works but so far no major global central bank chief has confirmed they speak at the event other than powell

author editorial board anu taiwan s status as a potential trigger point for conflict amid escalating strategic competition between the united states and china has only been confirmed in the wake of nancy pelosi s visit to taipei there is risk of miscalculation mistake and escalation that could have devastating consequences china s flexing its military might over pelosi s visit is currently feeding global uncertainty even if conflict is avoided the new status quo will sit uncomfortably with the united states and the west and tensions are likely to worsen the united states and china are now engaged in policies of mutual technology decoupling as the next phase of their trade war japan is enacting economic security laws aimed at china in part to avoid becoming collateral damage in us decoupling policies australia having been a target of beijing s trade coercion seems to have also chosen to side with america in its futile attempt to diversify trade away from china these decoupling policies have predictably failed to defy economic gravity interdependence with china is actually increasing for the united states its allies and the global community china is the world s largest trading nation and becoming more important whereas total us goods trade fell to us 3 8 trillion in 2020 from us 4 2 trillion in 2019 before recovering to us 4 7 trillion in 2021 total chinese trade in goods increased from us 4 6 trillion in 2019 to us 4 7 trillion in 2020 and grew to a staggering us 6 trillion in 2021 china s trade is predominantly market driven not state driven the private sector accounts for roughly 92 per cent of china s exports of which 42 per cent are from foreign invested firms that is a huge constraint on policymakers trade in goods between china and the united states grew 19 per cent in 2021 to us 693 billion according to us data even though china fell short of the agreed purchases of us goods under their phase one trade deal american companies expanded their operations in china with us 38 billion of new investment in 2021 to bring the us stock of direct investment in china to us 118 billion japanese investment into china also continued to increase further integrating their economies total direct investment flows into china rose by a third in 2021 to a record high of us 334 billion for the year that s a lot of businesses committing to the chinese market with new factories and operations even with chinese borders closed and harsh domestic policies in pursuit of zero covid the mutually beneficial economic relationship runs counter to washington s instinct to counter every chinese interest globally the zero sum approach to china dusts off the cold war template but the first cold war is a decidedly imperfect template to guide policy amid the confounding picture of rivalry and interdependence that the facts above illustrate as sourabh gupta explains in this week s feature article the soviet union and the united states had no common interests or common aims during the cold war moscow s objective he reminds us was to overthrow capitalism as a rival centre of ideological authority and global power china on the other hand has fundamentally bought into the us led order not sought to overthrow it tout court this july marked 75 years since george kennan introduced the idea of containment that became the organising zero sum framework to box in the soviet union containment was premised on washington s remaining the dominant global economic power gupta explains but china is a protagonist whose economic size and material capabilities at the government s disposal will outstrip that of the united states a strategy to cope with the challenge posed by china must be built on realism and objectivity not ideology and values gupta argues realism and objectivity starts with the fact that chinese and american economic power from which their political and military power derive is built on economic interdependence that interdependence is the source of prosperity and security unlike the cold war where the soviet union and the united states had no shared interests or aims except ultimately to avoid mutual self destruction china and the united states have a large and growing economic relationship that continues to bind them and the rest of the world together management of that interdependence remains a powerful and shared interest economic interdependence itself won t stop a war but it vastly raises the costs of conflict the commercial peace has put a floor on political relations in east asia between china and japan for example and across the pacific china the united states and the global community also share a core interest in decarbonising their economies to avoid catastrophic climate change the climate related elements of the landmark inflation reduction act signed by president joe biden this week is welcome news but the law attempts to sideline china from us clean energy supply chains which will make america s energy transition much more costly and difficult a politically shaky united states distracted by big domestic challenges like entrenched inequality and democratic institutions under stress is failing to prosecute its other core interest of wrapping the rising power in new rules as the united kingdom did to the united states at bretton woods the non binding indo pacific economic framework that excludes china and relies on an executive order from the white house is a very poor substitute for leadership in multilateral rule making backed by broad political buy in at home the rest of the world has an even stronger interest in securing multilateral rules to protect itself from the whims of washington and beijing who have both shown willingness to leverage their economic might for political purposes if governments in australia or japan pursue market distorting actions to diversify trade and supply chains away from china it will make them poorer and less secure almost all of australia and japan s neighbours have china as their largest economic partner china continues to demonstrate it has a stake in the existing system for example by signing onto the interim wto dispute settlement substitute the mpia to enforce trade rules both australia and china have ambitions to diversify their economic relationships away from each other as beijing looks to secure long term iron ore supplies in west africa deepening economic engagement brings prosperity and a peace dividend though a fracture in trust and a loss of confidence in the multilateral rules means the risks will come to dominate china too is searching for economic and political security its insecurities are being fanned by its domestic challenges and the west s misdirected containment efforts china s economic security in a multilateral economic system is still a major guarantor of economic and political security to the rest of the world the eaf editorial board is located in the crawford school of public policy college of asia and the pacific the australian national university the post the economic ties that bind china first appeared on east asia forum source link

bleeding heartland continues to catch up on the legislature s significant actions during the session that ended on april 27 previous posts related to the work of the iowa house or senate can be found here republicans showed little interest in amending the iowa constitution during the 2019 session only one amendment passed both chambers if and when that proposal appears on a statewide ballot it will spark a costly and divisive campaign about gun rights and regulations the senate and house debate over the pro gun amendment is the focus of the first half of this post arguments raised on both sides will surely return in future television commercials and mass mailings the rest of the post reviews this year s unsuccessful attempts to change the constitution one amendment backed by governor kim reynolds made it through the iowa house and four others advanced from a house or senate committee but did not come up for a floor vote the rest did not get through a committee even though some of the same ideas went further last year through both chambers and halfway to appearing on a statewide ballot altering iowa s constitution is a lengthy process two separately elected legislatures must approve identical language then the proposed amendment must receive a majority vote on a statewide ballot any amendment approved this year or during the 2020 legislative session will need to clear the iowa house and senate again in 2021 or 2022 in order to go before voters in 2022 expansive pro gun amendment senate joint resolution 10 later renamed senate joint resolution 18 represents the second attempt to add the right to keep and bear arms to iowa s constitution the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the sovereign state of iowa affirms and recognizes this right to be a fundamental individual right any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny republicans approved the same language in 2018 so in theory the amendment should have been on the 2020 general election ballot however iowa secretary of state paul pate s staff failed to publish the amendment in newspapers around the state before the 2018 election forcing the legislature to start the process over the same thing happened during the last decade delaying adoption of a less controversial amendment this year s debates on the pro gun amendment played out just like last year democrats in both chambers advocated replicating language from the second amendment to the u s constitution republicans insisted on wording that would require courts to subject any firearms regulations to heightened scrutiny the senate took up the resolution on march 13 video here state senator brad zaun the floor manager dodged questions from democratic senator herman quirmbach about whether his intent was to prevent the state legislature from regulating bump stocks or bazookas democratic state senator tony bisignano offered two amendments which were voted down along party lines the first would have added the second amendment language identically to the iowa constitution the second would have kept most of the republican proposed amendment striking the words any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny democratic senator bill dotzler gave one of the most compelling speeches during the floor debate he began by describing himself as an army veteran and owner of pistols shotguns crossbows rifles who is a firm defender of the second amendment my partial transcript what we re talking about here is basically what strict scrutiny means so my experience in the legislature has taught me this words matter and the words that you put into law can be interpreted different from what legislators think in the late 1990s an iowa house bill created an incentive for businesses to locate in enterprise zones dotzler asked in committee what if a business from outside the enterprise zone moves into one of those zones creating a depressed area in the former location would the state of iowa be giving them extra incentives to move and they said well no that s not our intent and we don t mean that at all and i said well this isn t defined very well after governor terry branstad signed that bill into law a company called waterloo industries left a depressed area and received incentives for moving into an enterprise zone and it was challenged the attorney general s office went and said no that was the intent of the legislature it was ok to do that it was fine that isn t what the discussion was in committee that s what attorneys do they look at the words and they i don t think it makes a lot of difference here what you re saying unless you define it and senator zaun you didn t define it you just said well it isn t your intent it s up to the people of iowa to decide dotzler expressed doubt that the people who could be voting on this amendment in 2022 will understand what strict scrutiny means because it s too complicated to explain in a 30 second ad so if you know what it is and what your intent is then let us know because i m deeply concerned before retiring from john deere dotzler worked with some people who had alcohol problems or mental illness or were abusing their wives like convicted felons such people shouldn t have weapons he said under current law we can stop that from happening now there are plenty of people in iowa that are looking at the terminology strict scrutiny and thinking that your intent is that every person has a right to a weapon no matter what that s what i think it means every person we don t need background checks we aren t going to check to see if there s a record on somebody you can just buy a weapon anywhere that s what i believe it means i haven t heard anybody say any different what we do here matters and i think you re just throwing a jump ball up in the air to get my fellow gun owners worked up about something that makes them believe that this democrat sitting in this seat don t care about their inalienable rights to have a weapon which i do because i own more than most i don t hunt but i enjoy going to the range and utilizing them because i believe in my right of freedom and i believe in protecting myself but i also believe that there are people that shouldn t have weapons and they shouldn t have a right to them and that s what this debate s about and this is where i think you re wrong because you haven t really clarified what you mean and i think you better in his closing remarks zaun denied that the resolution would allow domestic abusers or people with felony convictions to own firearms he denied that there are loopholes at gun shows in iowa he goes to them regularly and always has to show his id and permit to purchase a weapon why demand strict scrutiny language we re trying to give the power to the citizens of the state of iowa to decide how important their second amendment rights are zaun said senators approved the constitutional amendment by 33 votes to 16 with democrat rich taylor joining all the republicans to support it later the same day the iowa house took up the companion bill house joint resolution 3 i clipped the relevant part of opening remarks by republican state representative matt windschitl the floor manager windschitl acknowledged that in the three other states with strict scrutiny language there have been some lawsuits challenging restrictions but he claimed courts in those states have not overturned the regulations it s not overturned their permitting process it s not allowed felons to have firearms it s not putting firearms in the hands of domestic abusers none of that it has not happened what makes us think that somehow in the great state of iowa our judiciary is going to view it any differently the strict scrutiny standard is simple and here s why i believe that we need it we are on a constant endeavor to protect iowans we are on a constant endeavor to make sure they re taken care of let s give them the fundamental protections for this natural right that they need so that they can protect themselves and let s make sure that the government does not infringe upon that right several house democrats spoke against the amendment state representative scott ourth who voted for a major pro gun bill in 2017 warned that the gop s preferred language would make the issue needlessly controversial iowans might vote down windschitl s proposal but they would overwhelmingly approve of the democratic alternative replicating second amendment language ing our state constitution it s rare for members of the majority to speak against their own party s bill but state representative andy mckean who was still a republican in march laid out the most detailed case against the gop version like ourth he said he supported the second amendment at the same time he had strong reservations about forcing judges to apply the strict scrutiny language to any and all gun related legislation of the 44 states that have some version of a right to keep and bear arms in their constitutions only three louisiana alabama and missouri call for strict scrutiny mckean noted eight states have rejected adding such language to their constitutions in recent years south dakota oklahoma illinois minnesota montana indiana florida and tennessee why number one is the expense the three states that require strict scrutiny for firearm legislation have become testing grounds for challenges to existing regulations an expensive experiment for taxpayers laws that have challenged at considerable expense to the taxpayer including the following felon and possession laws a state law imposing a sentencing enhancement for the use of a firearm during kidnapping a law prohibiting the possession of firearms while distributing drugs and a law prohibiting possession by parolees with felony convictions litigating such cases has cost millions of dollars the fiscal note on tennessee s proposed law found that each lawsuit would cost the state 100 000 criminal defendants have brought numerous frivolous suits public safety was another concern mckean said some of the lawsuits caused criminal prosecutions to be put on hold another concern is treating the second amendment differently from our other bill of rights varying degrees of scrutiny are applied to all the other fundamental bill of rights protections the fourth amendment is the most obvious example search or seizure has to be reasonable not necessary to serve a compelling state interest the eighth amendment bars cruel and unusual punishment but doesn t require the government to justify the punishment as necessary to serve a compelling state interest and reasonable time place and manner restrictions are placed on speech in public areas where the rights of the speaker may come into conflict with the rights of others requiring strict scrutiny for the review of all firearm legislation fails to recognize that there are a wide variety of matters touching the second amendment that call for different levels of scrutiny and fly in the face of established court precedent in the landmark heller decision recognizing individual second amendment rights the u s supreme court rejected the idea that strict scrutiny should apply to all gun laws in fact justice scalia s opinion identified many reasonable gun safety laws like those that prevent dangerous people from accessing guns and keeping guns out of the hands of felons as presumptively lawful a very different standard from strict scrutiny noting that windschitl had expressed concern for self defense mckean said courts had already determined that any law burdening the right to defend oneself in the home was subject to strict scrutiny but as we move outside the home intermediate scrutiny which is also a tough standard to satisfy is appropriate because public safety interests merit increased protection by way of example mckean mentioned permitting requirements for carrying a concealed weapon minimum age requirements for buying or carrying firearms barring people with felony convictions or domestic abusers from owning firearms sentencing enhancements for using a firearm in the commission of another crime these have nothing to do with self defense and should not be subjected to strict scrutiny iowans support reasonable regulations of firearms mckean joined democrats to support ourth s amendment which failed by 52 votes to 47 but the house vote on final passage went strictly along party lines 53 46 the following month mckean joined the democratic caucus through one chamber stalled in the other restoring voting rights to iowans who have completed felony sentences article ii section 5 of iowa s constitution reads a person adjudged mentally incompetent to vote or a person convicted of any infamous crime shall not be entitled to the privilege of an elector governor reynolds told state lawmakers in january our constitution takes away the voting rights of anyone convicted of a felony forever only two other state constitutions have a similar provision and last november the people of florida voted to remove their ban through the power of clemency the governor can restore those rights and i have done that 88 times since taking office but i don t believe that voting rights should be forever stripped and i don t believe restoration should be in the hands of a single person our founders gave us a process to amend the constitution should the passage of time change our view let s begin that process now i believe iowans recognize the power of redemption let s put this issue in their hands the governor s office recommended the text later named house joint resolution 14 it would change article ii section 5 to read as follows disqualified persons a person adjudged mentally incompetent to vote or a person convicted of any infamous crime felony who has not discharged his or her sentence shall not be entitled to the privilege of an elector democratic state representative mary wolfe had introduced a different approach to reach the same goal her proposal was never assigned to a subcommittee and wolfe endorsed the governor s preferred language the house judiciary committee unanimously approved the constitutional amendment in early march a few weeks later the full chamber approved changing the felon disenfranchisement language by 95 votes to 2 republicans dean fisher and jon jacobsen were the only opponents within days an iowa senate subcommittee advanced the bill but it went no further senate judiciary committee chair zaun was skeptical from the beginning about automatic restoration of voting rights for iowans with felony convictions he introduced a bill stating a person shall not be considered to have discharged a sentence for purposes of article ii section 5 of the constitution of the state of iowa unless the person has paid all restitution court costs fines surcharges or penalties the person owes as a result of the person s conviction and has been removed from the sex offender registry established in chapter 692a zaun s bill didn t go anywhere but his concerns carried the day he declined to bring the constitutional amendment up for a full committee vote in time for the legislature s second funnel deadline on april 5 stephen gruber miller and barbara rodriguez reported for the des moines register zaun r urbandale said he had told reynolds on thursday that the senate effort would be an uphill climb hampered by the lack of a second bill to clarify what it would mean for felons to have completed their sentences this language i believe was not clear enough and there was not any parameters in regards to what those restoration of those voting rights were he said zaun said he expects to take up the issue again next year he said he knows it was one of reynolds top legislative priorities for the current session but that it lacks support from republicans on the judiciary committee i ve been down here a long time there s been many governors that didn t get everything they wanted he said this is a process reynolds sounds willing to cut a deal during the 2020 session after the legislature adjourned the governor told kcci tv and who tv she was disappointed the measure didn t pass the senate she noted that some house members had said during the floor debate that there should be some restrictions for instance maybe people who had committed the most serious crimes would not qualify she d be willing to work with house and senate republicans before next year to find consensus language on carve outs for people who should never get their right to vote back i hope the governor doesn t agree to requirements that would be tantamount to a poll tax such as denying voting rights to anyone with unpaid fees she could increase her leverage by making clear that she will act unilaterally to create an automatic restoration process if the legislature does not act through one house or senate committee committees approved four other state constitutional amendments this year leaders didn t bring any of these joint resolutions to a vote in the full chamber but all will be eligible for house or senate floor debate during the 2020 legislative session allowing the governor to name a new lieutenant governor the house and senate both approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 with language on the gubernatorial line of succession the concept was to clarify that if a governor leaves office before the end of the term the lieutenant governor who assumes the governor s powers may appoint a new lieutenant governor as with the pro gun amendment failure to publish the measure in newspapers around the state before last year s election forced lawmakers to start the process from scratch house state government committee chair bobby kaufmann proposed house joint resolution 6 and shepherded the bill through his committee the senate state government committee unanimously approved a companion measure senate joint resolution 19 in february no right to an abortion in june 2018 the iowa supreme court struck down a law mandating a 72 hour waiting period for abortions on the grounds that it violated women s due process rights and equal protection guaranteed under the state constitution republicans drafted senate joint resolution 9 later renamed senate joint resolution 21 in response the measure would add the following language to article i sec 26 no right to abortion or required funding of abortion the constitution of the state of iowa does not secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion this resolution came out of the senate state government committee on a party line 10 to 5 vote in early march for reasons that remain unclear it never came to the senate floor although the 29 senate gop co sponsors represented more than enough to pass the resolution the three republicans who did not co sponsor the abortion measure had huge clout majority leader jack whitver senate president charles schneider and assistant majority leader dan zumbach nothing comes to the senate floor without the leaders blessing perhaps political considerations were a factor whitver just came out of a tough re election campaign in the northern suburbs of des moines and democrats will target schneider s seat in the western suburbs in 2020 voters in those communities especially women are predominantly pro choice and have been drifting toward democrats in recent years sixteen house republicans introduced a similar amendment house joint resolution 5 sandy salmon dean fisher jeff shipley stan gustafson terry baxter anne osmundson skyler wheeler tom moore jon jacobsen cecil dolecheck rob bacon tedd gassman phil thompson tom jeneary thomas gerhold and steven holt no one on the house republican leadership team co sponsored that amendment which is probably why it was referred to the house judiciary committee but never assigned to a subcommittee during a may 21 telephone interview house judiciary committee chair holt told bleeding heartland we haven t checked to see if there s the votes to pass this measure in the house you know obviously as pro life folks we would like to see something done to somewhat negate what the supreme court had ruled such as basically an abortion neutrality amendment that would just make the constitution silent on the issue but there hasn t been a lot of discussion on it in the house this year i know that the senate was working on it and certainly i think it s very possible it could come up next year but there haven t been any kind of discussions on it in the house given that almost every republican lawmaker voted for a near total abortion ban in 2018 i m surprised this constitutional amendment didn t get more traction super majority requirement for tax increases republican senator jim carlin introduced senate joint resolution 16 later renamed senate joint resolution 22 it would require a two thirds majority vote in both the iowa house and senate for any bill that alters individual income tax rates in a way that results in a net increase in state tax revenue the ways and means committee approved this resolution on a party line vote during the second to last week of the legislature session limiting state government spending zaun introduced senate joint resolution 2 which would limit spending from the state s general fund to the lesser of two numbers 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for the following fiscal year for the general fund or 104 percent of the current fiscal year net revenue estimate for the general fund current law has a 99 percent general fund spending limitation but not exactly like zaun s proposal david reynolds of the non partisan legislative services agency explained the differences in this fiscal note a senate appropriations subcommittee recommended passing this resolution the full appropriations committee later approved it renamed senate joint resolution 20 all republicans and two democrats liz mathis and amanda ragan voted that resolution out of committee senate leaders never brought it up for a vote on the floor a different proposal to enshrine the 99 percent spending limit in iowa s constitution cleared the iowa senate with bipartisan support in 2017 its champion was then senate majority leader bill dix who resigned in the middle of last year s legislative session for whatever reason the current senate leaders don t share his passion for the issue through a subcommittee crime victims rights republican state representatives ashley hinson and megan jones introduced house joint resolution 11 one version of the crime victims rights amendment known as marsy s law although a house judiciary subcommittee recommended passage with some changes the full house committee never brought up the resolution a similar constitutional amendment made it through a house committee during the 2018 session but did not come up for a floor vote democratic state representative marti anderson introduced a different version of a crime victims rights amendment this year as is typical for proposals from the minority party anderson s legislation was never assigned to a subcommittee in the upper chamber republican senator zach whiting introduced senate joint resolution 8 a slightly different victims rights amendment a senate judiciary subcommittee recommended amendment and passage but it never came before the full judiciary committee didn t make it through subcommittee home rule for school districts zaun is a prolific bill filer his senate joint resolution 1 stated in part school districts are granted home rule power and authority not inconsistent with the laws of the general assembly to determine their local affairs and government except that they shall not have power to levy any tax unless expressly authorized by the general assembly a subcommittee hearing was scheduled but there is no record of the bill passing that first stage term limits for lawmakers republican senator dan dawson introduced senate joint resolution 3 limiting state legislators to sixteen years of service in the legislature combined tenure in house and senate it was assigned to a state government subcommittee but moved no further whiting introduced senate joint resolution 4 limiting iowa house members to six two year terms and state senators to three four year terms it also was assigned to a subcommittee but did not advance republican senator jake chapman introduced senate joint resolution 7 would limit house members to four two year terms senators to two four year terms and most statewide elected offices governor lieutenant governor secretary of state state auditor attorney general to three four year terms for some reason chapman didn t deem it necessary to limit the tenure of the secretary of agriculture assigned to a subcommittee but never advanced whiting also introduced senate joint resolution 11 calling for an article v convention to amend the u s constitution to establish term limits for members of the u s house and senate republican senator jason schultz introduced senate joint resolution 15 calling for an article v convention to impose fiscal restraints on the federal government limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government and limit the terms of office for its officials and for members of congress term limits are never popular with incumbents the proposals from whiting and schultz may have failed for an additional reason the gun lobby opposes all article v proposals for fear a convention would produce unplanned changes to the second amendment gender neutral constitution gop representative hinson introduced house joint resolution 9 which would make references to the governor in our state s founding document gender neutral it never was assigned to a subcommittee democratic senator pam jochum introduced senate joint resolution 5 which would replace all male references in the iowa constitution with gender neutral terms this proposal was assigned to subcommittee but never got a hearing campaign finance reform democratic senator kevin kinney proposed senate joint resolution 6 asking congress to convene a convention under article v of the u s constitution for the exclusive purpose of proposing an amendment to respond to the u s supreme court s citizens united decision on campaign finance it was assigned to three different subcommittees but never advanced democratic state representative dave jacoby introduced the same proposal but his house joint resolution 10 never was assigned to a subcommittee hunting and fishing democratic state senator rich taylor introduced senate joint resolution 14 adding new language to establish a right to hunt fish and harvest wildlife including by the use of traditional methods subject to reasonable laws enacted by the general assembly and reasonable rules adopted by the natural resource commission to promote wildlife conservation and management to maintain natural resources held in trust by the state for public use and to preserve the future of hunting fishing and harvesting wildlife it was assigned to a senate natural resources and environment subcommittee which never met to consider it never introduced privacy of electronic data the iowa house unanimously approved a constitutional amendment in 2017 that would add language protecting electronic communications and data against unreasonable searches and seizures the measure died in the senate two years ago and never got off the starting block this year no one picked up the ball after this amendment s sponsor former republican state representative ken rizer retired in 2018

fallen over the last several months and year to date the stock is down 48 analyst philip cusick in his coverage of this stock for jpmorgan sees that share price decline as an opportunity for investors we believe at the current 6 5x 2022e ev ebitda ihs shares are significantly undervalued and expect valuation to improve over time we like the strong growth profile in regions where ihs operates which is fueled by high population growth expanding economic activity higher penetration and increased usage and transition to 4g and eventually 5g the company has a strong operating track record driven by its long tenured and experienced management team to deliver results in challenging markets cusick opined this adds up in the analyst s view to an overweight i e buy rating and his 16 price target indicates room for substantial growth on the order of 119 in the year ahead to watch cusick s track record click here overall while the shares are down the street sentiment on ihs remains solid the

potential of 160 see ihs stock forecast on tipranks snap one holdings snpo with the second jpm pick we ll turn to the smart home sector snap one is a leading distributor of smart home tech offering customers solutions for entertainment and networking home audio home security and network and even remote power management smart solutions put all this at the property owner s fingertips snap one s product lines and installations are available in both the residential and commercial markets the firm operates as a holding company delivering its products through a network of subsidiaries and brands smart home tech has been growing in popularity over the past several years and snap one has been reporting quarter over quarter revenue growth for the past year but snpo shares have declined 47 so far this year several factors have impacted the stock price the company s revenue growth has decelerated while the net loss is widening that doesn t mean that the current numbers are bad just not as good as investors would like to see in 2q22 the company reported 296 9 million a gain of 17 year over year at the same time the net loss grew by 27 y y to reach 1 3 million the company s cash holdings fell from 40 6 million on december 31 2021 to 31 3 million june 30 2022 looking forward the company expects the full year 2022 net sales to come in between 1 16 billion and 1 18 billion a y y gain of 15 to 17 jpmorgan analyst paul chung reminds us that snap one s q2 results beat the forecasts and goes on to say fy22 guidance was reiterated despite the beat baking in some conservatism given the macro backdrop in our view though still implies close to 20 y y growth a strong guide in our view when most firms are cutting guidance pricing actions in june should provide support for gross margins coupled with more measured pace of opex spend to generate solid profitability and cash flow integrator demand feedback remains strong and the higher end consumer is looking relatively more resilient in the current environment to this end chung sets an 18 price target implying a one year upside of 62 which backs up his overweight i e buy rating on the stock to watch chung s track record click here all in all this interesting smart home firm has picked up 6 recent wall street reviews and these break down 5 to 1 in favor of buy over hold for a strong buy consensus rating the stock is selling for

you re reading an excerpt from the today s worldview newsletter sign up to get the rest free including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know sent to your inbox every weekday this week marks six months since the start of russia s latest invasion of ukraine the resulting war has dominated international headlines disrupted global supply chains and galvanized a new spirit of solidarity in the west for many europeans the moment marked a turning point in history as german chancellor olaf scholz declared in the early weeks of the conflict the stark moral dimensions of the war the brazen destructive russian advance and the courageous ukrainian response led to the scales falling off the eyes of european elites who had sought peaceful accommodation with russia what was unleashed was on a scale not seen in the heart of europe in decades it definitively ended as the new statesman s jeremy cliffe wrote the easy optimism of the immediate post cold war years but he added even as we drift towards something new its contours are still hazy advertisement the fog of war is still thick over ukraine beyond the country s trench strewn landscapes and blockaded battered coastal cities a clash of ideologies even of visions of history is still playing out in their refusal to bow to russian president vladimir putin s neo imperialistic ambitions ukrainians see themselves on the front line of a global war between democracy and autocracy that s a vision echoed by their backers in the west including president biden himself who declared in march that ukraine was waging a great battle for freedom between liberty and repression between a rules based order and one governed by brute force putin of course sees it all differently russia s army poured across its neighbor s borders on feb 24 after he delivered a now infamous speech it was steeped in historical grievance and revisionism and cast ukraine as an artificial nation whose nazi regime was a pawn of the west putin raged at nato s expansion into eastern europe and warned of an anti russia emerging in territories that were our historical land this would not do bringing kyiv ukraine to heel wasn t just about checking western influence but redeeming the tragedy of the fall of the soviet union which putin said disrupted the balance of forces in the world unhcr s kellytclements visited ukraine this past week nearly six months into the war what she witnessed was dramatically escalating needs and ongoing recovery efforts as winter quickly approaches the region pic twitter com hpiuog8nzo unhcr the un refugee agency refugees august 21 2022 putin s imagined rebalancing hasn t gone as planners in the kremlin thought it would ukraine bravely resisted the invasion and forced russian troops into an ignominious retreat after a failed campaign to capture kyiv rather than being chastened nato has expanded bringing sweden and finland beneath the umbrella of the world s preeminent military alliance in the baltic states local authorities have begun dismantling soviet era monuments the war has catalyzed a long delayed process of decolonization for ukraine and some of its neighbors who now seem eager to cut away the claims imposed on their countries by a legacy of subjugation to moscow advertisement the toll of western sanctions on russia s economy has been stiff half of the country s foreign reserves are frozen hundreds of western companies have pulled out of the russian market and key oil and gas exports are now being sold off to opportunistic buyers for discounted prices u s intelligence estimates reckon as many as 80 000 russian soldiers may have already died in the fighting western analysts also believe that the russian war machine is severely depleted with munition stocks running low share this article share but that s cold comfort to ukrainians who have paid an almost unfathomable price to defend their nation s very right to exist six months of war have seen thousands killed and millions exiled from their homes russian forces have carried out alleged atrocities and war crimes they are now entrenched across a wide swathe of south and southeast ukraine with analysts foreseeing a long bitter war of attrition ahead six months into the war the ukrainian message to western elites has barely changed everything we need is weapons and if you have the opportunity force to sit down at the negotiating table with me ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said in a recent interview with my colleagues reiterating his government s frequent requests for more advanced arms and munitions this equipment gives ukraine more leverage on the battlefield but also in future theoretical negotiations with a more chastened russian regime this kid posing on a tank in downtown kyiv where families have flocked to see a parade of destroyed russian military equipment somehow summed up for me both the hope and utter heartbreak of ukraine s battle for survival nearly six months into the war pic twitter com b1jifs0hl2 emma graham harrison _emmagh august 20 2022 despite delays and logistical hurdles that aid led by the united states has come to ukraine the biden administration has so far committed more than 10 billion worth of security assistance to kyiv while also coordinating and mobilizing broader support among nato and european partners from washington to warsaw lawmakers believe ukraine should be given the tools for a decisive military victory even if such an outcome remains only a distant prospect advertisement but that bullishness may wane in europe the approach of winter and the bleak certainty of skyrocketing energy costs have raised questions over whether the west can sustain the same resolve in supporting ukraine s war effort for the next six months as it has for the past half year the centrality of the united states in helping ukraine hold the line is a reminder that for all the rhetoric about europe entering a brave new age the old 20th century equations still apply when it comes to the continent s geopolitics american superpower plays a paramount role yet no single government can manage the wider shocks of the war which included jolts to the global agricultural supply chain that have sent food prices soaring in parts of africa and governments toppling in south asia as a result officials from non western nations express frequent bemusement with the zeal on show in western capitals where talk of compromise with or concessions to russia is anathema most puzzling to us is the idea that a conflict like this is in essence being encouraged to continue indefinitely a senior african diplomat in new york told reuters advertisement frustratingly for ukrainian diplomats fewer african officials are making the obvious case that russia could simply withdraw its troops from the sovereign territory of another nation it s unclear if russia s isolation will widen or narrow in the coming months both putin and chinese president xi jinping who is engaged in his own escalating confrontation with the united states over taiwan are planning on attending this year s summit of the group of 20 major economies in indonesia indonesian president joko widodo hoped that won t deter leaders like biden from attending the rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying widodo told bloomberg news last week what we want is for this region to be stable peaceful so that we can build economic growth and i think not only indonesia asian countries also want the same thing

us central bankers have hammered out a single message interest rates will rise until inflation starts to fall but financial markets continue to hope to hear a different tune that suggests the pace of rate hikes will slow all eyes will be on the annual meeting of policymakers in jackson hole wyoming this week to hear federal reserve chair jerome powell explain his stance once again with market watchers hoping for something more to get to your liking the fed could become a victim of its own success after keeping the benchmark interest rate at zero throughout the pandemic the surge in prices which rose to a 40 year high following the russian invasion of ukraine prompted the central bank to take aggressive action fighting blistering inflation which topped 9 percent in june the fed hiked rates four times including massive three quarter point hikes in june and july steep moves not seen since the early 1980s but in recent weeks signs of easing price pressures and a slowing economy along with falling energy costs and signs that global supply chain problems have eased have made financial markets optimistic that the fed will roll back or even suspend rate hikes and is even starting to do so cut next year wall street stocks have risen for four straight weeks even as a number of officials reiterated the message that interest rates will continue to rise even as annual inflation slowed in july as oil prices fell while the annual gathering often becomes a place for global central bankers to signal a shift in policy powell is expected to reiterate that message on friday though he may acknowledge a slowdown will materialize later in the year it seems like what we ve heard from powell so far suggests there s a pretty high bar for them to transition from aggressive hikes to a slower pace of 25 basis point increments said jonathan millar of barclays millar who has served as a fed economist and forecaster under four central bank governors told afp that markets continue to look ahead and expect rate hikes to be successful in slowing inflation but for policymakers one thing they definitely want to communicate is that they will remain very focused on price stability issues and will be very cautious on signs of improving inflation data that means indication prices are falling more broadly and not just because of the falling oil managing market expectations is really job one millar said you have to enforce this credibility but like other economists he believes the fed s policy making federal open market committee fomc will backtrack on a 0 5 percentage point hike at its september meeting widening the interest rate range to 2 75 to 3 0 percent then moving on to quarter point hikes in november and december walking a fine line oxford economics kathy bostjancic said the dilemma for powell is to acknowledge progress towards a soft landing bringing inflation back to the 2 target without derailing economic growth while also acknowledging the fed s determination to confirm he still has to walk a fine line she told afp news agency you don t want to be too pessimistic and with home prices and sales cooling off from their blistering pace along with other encouraging data he has tailwind but she said the message he really needs to get across is that we re still going to try to raise rates to hawkish levels to really make sure inflation is still our top priority

water lilies serene landscapes pastel colours reflecting changing light french impressionist painter claude monet s paintings have been loved for decades but he would never have become the iconic artist that he is without standing up for his passion here are a few facts about the french painter to help you get to know him and his work better 1 he had an early start money began drawing as a young boy in paris in the mid 1800s and would often sketch his friends and neighbours as a teen he even sold charcoal caricatures of local figures monet learned how to use oil paints and the technique of en plein air outdoor painting which later became his hallmark style while monet s mother encouraged his art his father a grocery store owner wanted him to join the family business and focus on learning how to stock and order products 2 he never abandoned art in 1861 monet was drafted into the army and left paris for algeria monet s mother had died several years prior but his father who was still alive offered to pay for his son s discharge from the army if monet promised to give up painting but monet refused in the first year of his seven year military commitment monet got sick with typhoid his aunt with whom he was very close paid to get him released and once he was home she enrolled him in art school in paris 3 disillusionment was an issue the late 1920s saw monet as a young artist disillusioned with the academie france s art establishment monet hated sticking to one style of art but unfortunately the academie was known for promoting formulaic artwork the kind of paintings hung in the louvre with subjects related to greek and roman mythology depressed and struggling to make ends meet monet jumped off a bridge over the seine in 1868 he survived his fall and soon began spending time with other artists who shared his disillusionment portrait of claude monet by the photographer nadar in 1899 image credit wikimedia commons 4 a new beginning monet moved in an inspirational circle his friends were other frustrated artists who later became incredibly famous renoir edgar degas and paul cezanne to name a few the group called itself the anonymous society of painters sculptors printmakers etc and organised an exhibition in 1874 the exhibition was considered groundbreaking for its new forms of art featuring bold vivid colours and spontaneous brushwork a critic at the show compared monet s painting impression sunrise to an incomplete sketch or impression historians think that s the origin of the term impressionism which became the unique style used to describe the artists radically different paintings 5 imported water lilies from 1883 until his death in 1926 monet lived in giverny northern france during those years he hired gardeners to plant a variety of flowers and trees in his garden from poppies to apple trees turning it into a sanctuary that became the perfect setting for his artwork since monet became quite wealthy from the sales of his paintings during his lifetime he invested a great deal in his garden he installed a japanese footbridge across his pond which features in much of his work and he imported water lilies from egypt and south america although local city council officials told him to remove the foreign plants so they did not poison the water he refused monet s water lilies became iconic aspects of his work over the next 25 years he even hired six full time employees to take care of them one gardener would take a boat into the pond every morning to wash or dust each lily pad only once they were clean would monet begin painting them

menafn afp asian markets were broadly lower monday as the rally from june s lows runs out of steam owing to renewed concerns about federal reserve plans to ramp up interest rates to combat runaway inflation all eyes are on a symposium in jackson hole wyoming where fed boss jerome powell will deliver a speech that will be followed for an idea about the bank s next moves a dip in price rises and signs of economic slowdown had raised hopes policymakers would ease up and possibly cut next year after two successive 75 basis point hikes helping equities rally globally but that optimism has slowly been eroded in recent weeks as fed officials including powell have warned that the battle against inflation was far from won particularly as the jobs market remained resilient one of the latest was richmond fed boss thomas barkin who reasserted his commitment to bringing inflation back to two percent from the four decade high of around nine percent he said on friday the policy board would do what it takes to get there but warned there s a path to getting inflation under control but a recession could happen in the process jonathan millar of barclays said it was unlikely powell would signal a slowdown in rate hikes this week it does seem like what we ve heard from powell so far suggests there s quite a high bar for them to transition from aggressive hikes to 25 basis points one thing they definitely want to communicate is that they remain very much focused on issues with price stability and that they will react very cautiously to any signs of improvements in the inflation data and national australia bank s rodrigo catril added that the fed chief will likely say that while we may be close to the end of the beginning of the current tightening cycle we are still a long way from the end all three main indexes on wall street fell friday and asia followed suit in early trade hong kong tokyo sydney seoul taipei manila and jakarta dropped however shanghai rose after china s central bank cut prime loan rates as it tries to bolster the world s second biggest economy which has been ravaged by lockdowns across the country as part of leaders zero covid strategy singapore and wellington also edged up the prospect of more us hikes to come has given another boost to the dollar which rallied against the yen and is approaching the 140 yen mark for the first time in 24 years the stronger greenback was helping to keep oil prices down while downward pressure was being enhanced by speculation rising about a possible iran nuclear deal that could ease a supply crisis caused by russia s invasion of ukraine the global balance for the remainder of the year is not as tight as many were expecting with russian supply holding up well said warren patterson of ing groep nv while it may take several months for iran to get production back to pre sanction levels in the event of a deal in the short term they should still be able to boost exports by relying on storage key figures at around 0230 gmt tokyo nikkei 225 down 0 4 percent at 28 805 52 break hong kong hang seng index down 0 1 percent at 19 755 48 shanghai composite up 0 4 percent at 3 270 83 euro dollar down at 1 0032 from 1 0034 friday pound dollar down at 1 1822 from 1 1827 euro pound up at 84 86 pence from 84 81 pence dollar yen up at 137 30 yen from 136 93 yen west texas intermediate down 1 2 percent at 89 69 per barrel brent north sea crude down 1 1 percent at 95 68 per barrel new york dow down 0 9 percent at 33 706 74 points close london ftse 100 up 0 1 percent at 7 550 37 close

call it a recession or anything else you prefer but the bottom line is that the prosperity of decades past is not coming back thinking expansively about the economy is no longer part of the american mindset since as should be perfectly clear to everyone by now the fed s epic easy credit hoax can do little but inflate asset values to the point of collapse we are nearly there now even accepting that the u s stock market afflicted by mass psychosis will remain capable for a while of staging one last fatally deceptive hurrah to make certain everyone is aboard for the crash that ends two generations of economic madness we can no longer delude ourselves into thinking the statistics pushed at us by biden but also by his predecessors portend better times least meaningful of all but still greeted with spin hubris and a raucous burlesque of feigned nervousness on wall steet are employment figures that would suggest the economy is producing plenty of jobs but what kind of jobs and for whom leave it to my friend and colleague charles hugh smith one of the most insightful thinkers in the blogosphere to tell it like it is the picture is quite despairing he avers not necessarily for you and me as individuals though since each of us in theory has the wherewithal to plan for dealing with the worst of times for him personally that means not merely hunkering down with a perhaps overly optimistic plan b but with a rigorously plotted plan c to make him as self sufficient as possible when an energy dependent food network has made it extremely difficult for people living in heavily urbanized areas to feed themselves and keep warm accordingly he has also scaled back energy use in and around his home in hawaii cutting out unnecessary things so that reacting to the coming crisis will not require sudden drastic changes in his lifestyle what new jobs concerning all those pathetic jobs the economy has been creating they won t have even a microscopic impact on debts we ve piled up ensuring ruinous deflation rather than the piddling cpi kind that is playing havoc these days with household budgets for years i ve catalogued the ways in which these massive and still exploding debts have hollowed out our standard of living and desiccated the american dream it began in the inflationary 1970s when single earner homes could no longer afford the level of housing medical care and college tuition that had obtained in the 1950s the feminist revolution burst forth to fill the income gap not because women were particularly eager to join the workforce but because they had to and now for reasons charles most recent weekly installment of musings makes painfully clear there is a counterforce big enough to overwhelm the pittance that working women and harder working men have clawed back from a relentless secular economic decline specifically the work ethic is dying among young people who offer our only hope for dealing with a debt trap that has eroded the so called good life to the vanishing point nearly costless capital has allowed multinational corporate giants to seek labor wherever it is cheapest as a result they have been able to siphon more than 50 trillion from workers since 1975 shown in the graph above employees are making a slight comeback these days but they know they can t win and would rather go slack on the job rather than struggle for their entire lives just to make ends meet depending on millennials we should therefore not delude ourselves into thinking millennials and gen x ers will be able to pay the social security and medicare benefits of baby boomers expected to live increasingly into their 80s and 90s our demographic destiny is as grim as it is clear since it portends among other things the wholesale collapse of real estate values along with taxes collected on boomer retirements homes valued at 500 000 and up in more hamlets boondocks and rural subdivisions than anyone could count charles spells out the problems this will create when the debt encumbered sources of america s false prosperity are laid bare by intractable deepening recession 1 there won t be a younger generation with the means or interest in buying all the global baby boomers overvalued assets 2 those inheriting their boomer parents assets which they assume they can sell at today s bloated prices will be shocked at the decline of the valuation once the massive supply overhang hits the market 3 younger generations with little interest in trying to make a lot of money to sock away for a distant retirement will not be funneling earnings into stocks bonds real estate investment trusts etc the decline of financial assets the demand for financial assets will decline and sellers will find a dearth of buyers as demand for the vast oversupply of financial assets falls so will price 4 as labor demands an equalization of income and power corporations will be hard pressed to extract more profits from labor profits will be pressured for many reasons including labor costs 5 consumption may hold up better than expected as younger workers spend their earnings on experiences and enjoying life rather than socking away money or devoting it to paying mortgages and property taxes 6 the sacrifices required to live in high rent cities the equivalent of a mortgage will push younger workers out of high priced cities eventually reducing demand and rents he further notes that if cities decay per my forecast this migration could gather momentum much faster than the mainstream expects there are other second order effects of the destabilizing inequality generated by globalization and financialization and the unraveling of these two forces will generate additional consequences few anticipate
my first work with the tyee was an opinion piece that published a few months after the pandemic started up at the time covid 19 outbreaks were reported at meat processing plants in canada and i felt it was important to call attention to how our buying habits can affect the food and agriculture industries it s now over two years later and the pandemic is still going with new reports out that the only people who have largely thrived in this timeframe are billionaires in particular grocery magnates like loblaws president galen weston jr it feels timely to revisit the ways in which our global food and economic system is affected by ways both large and small in terms of the small scale i am as much a problematic participant in these global systems as anyone living on the limited income of a freelance writer and part time editor i often take the shortcuts of hitting big box grocery stores armed with discounts provided by loyalty programs store made apps and in store deals time is also a limited commodity in my life trimming corners here and there in my daily routine sometimes leads to grabbing frozen pizzas instant meals or other heavily processed items this summer though i was determined to put the brakes on those habits and to truly put my money where my mouth is that meant taking on a self imposed challenge to curate my grocery shopping in a more deliberate intentional way throughout the month of july i dedicated my food purchases as much as humanly possible to eating locally and by that i mean all of the province of british columbia in addition i also allowed myself the luxury of using spices i already had on hand i also took full advantage of the small herb and vegetable garden i ve cultivated on the balcony of my bachelor apartment on vancouver island gardening is set to a proverbial easy mode and armed with a lush strawberry plant some green onions broccoli tomatoes and basil i definitely had advantages that not everyone has including a total freedom from allergies religious beliefs or other dietary restrictions like celiac disease or diabetes that said i also have the disadvantage of being a pretty basic home cook and my tastes are basic to match so learning new recipes wasn t really on the table i don t typically experiment in the kitchen so my plan mainly relied on trying to replicate my big box grocery purchases in local settings while i d love to have eaten only vancouver island cuisine it is estimated that we are only able to supply about 10 per cent of the food we consume here with that slightly broader definition of local in hand and with a personal pledge to also avoid corporate outlets where possible on the basis that such outlets are not representative of local business and are also likely price gouging i set out to put food on my table here is what i learned week one trust but verify zero waste emporium week one boneless skinless chicken thighs free range and raised on the island 24 kg 11 21 gluten free pasta 13 kg 6 50 lockwood farms eggs one dozen 7 b c grown tomatoes on the vine 8 67 kg 4 39 zero waste emporium made pasta sauce 500ml 4 old soul jam co raspberry mint jam 10 b c grown mushrooms 10 kg 1 44 total 44 54 zero waste emporium was one of my first choices the store is known for being environmentally friendly and encourages patrons to bring reusable containers instead of packaging things in single use plastic with a helpful employee guiding me to island raised items i came away with a haul including a raspberry mint jam from victoria s old soul jam co i needed something to spread that jam on which took me to a local baker the bikery canada is the world s sixth largest wheat producer and the vast majority of that is produced in alberta and saskatchewan which produced 8 170 100 and 9 566 300 metric tonnes of wheat in 2010 respectively by comparison b c only produced 43 700 tonnes in 2010 b c wheat exists but is less common the bikery s owner said that with global supply chain issues from covid 19 and russia s invasion of ukraine prices of flour skyrocketed i asked him if he thought he might have to increase prices for good measure week one 1l island farms 1 per cent milk 3 49 0 10 deposit two tree island strawberry yogurts 13 18 sunwing cherry tomatoes 2 80 one dozen eggs 7 50 plant based frozen pizza by local maker vagabond pies 17 b c grown potatoes 1 50 1 2 dozen day

35 90 kg 26 56 pack of monterey jack cheese by little qualicum cheesemakers 52 90 kg 11 83 total 124 16 oh i already have he said i rounded out my week with a trip to for good measure this indie grocer has a deal where they offer 10 per cent off everything for the first wednesday of each month a welcome saving for my tight budget with cheese bread and tomatoes i m able to make sandwiches my morning meals are jam on toast eggs and yogurt i fry up some chicken thighs with zero waste pasta sauce mushrooms and noodles a surprising amount of leftovers carry over to the following week the food i get from these small businesses feels more filling than what i usually get from big box stores is it an effect of better nutritional value or is my subconscious mind simply placing higher value on more expensive goods and stretching those goods out the answer is likely somewhere in between week two farm to table one advantage of living on vancouver island is a robust hobby farm and small scale farming community the climate of the island is temperate allowing for a burgeoning winery industry that s beginning to rival the okanagan with operations in central saanich and in the cowichan valley moss street market week two three packs of handmade crackers 30 pack of chicken legs and back bacon 19 handmade tri colour pasta 12 green beans and salad mixes 14 total 75 there are also a number of farmers markets held throughout the city and i manage to hit a pair up on the weekend for a handful of items moss street market and james bay community market touring the stalls engaging in snippets of conversation with some of the makers crafters and farmers i find a recurring response when i tell them of my month long pledge you could not do this in the winter it s a reminder that canada has a limited growing season compared to many other countries perhaps more crucially that growing season is now also being disrupted by climate change last year a drought in the prairies caused wheat production to plummet 38 5 per cent across canada this is to say nothing of how on the west coast the heat dome cooked over 1 billion mollusks to death and there are still potential illnesses lingering for harvesters flooding in the fraser valley also left its mark on farmers and growers and a cool spring delayed some crops this year james bay market week two two soup mixes made by immigrant students of camosun college s maker to market program 15 kombucha and pasta sauce 16 beef breakfast sausage 16 i also snag while i m in the area a stick of butter from for good measure for 7 and for good measure though not at for good measure i hit the bikery up for some bagels 18 total 72 while none of these events are individually anything to panic about in terms of food supplies they serve as continual reminders that our food is only available so long as it can actually grow if these costs are less exact than at the businesses i bought from in week one it s only because cash is king at farmers markets and receipts are not handed out i rely heavily on note taking for these records i m particularly pleased with the simple homey nature of a meal of baked chicken baked potatoes and fried green beans from this list of ingredients the soup mixes make for an easy break from cooking from scratch along with the salad mixes and the beef breakfast sausages are a welcome boost of protein for the mornings of toast and eggs week three immigrant communities and the global supply chain fisgard market week three 2 lb bag of chow mein noodles 4 19 500ml amano soy sauce founded by japanese immigrant teiichi amano in vancouver 5 99 premade har gow and siu mai dim sum shrimp and pork dumplings by gah lok dim sum in richmond 21 98 red bell pepper 1 18 custom shopping bag 2 70 total 37 33 i m half chinese and while i m not much of a culinary wizard to put it mildly i still feel obliged to attempt a stir fry or two in my diet to stay close to my roots this immediately raised a question though how would certain ethnic foods be affected by a pledge to eat locally through global trade we import a wide range of fruits and vegetables so that one can walk into a supermarket and consistently have access to things which don t grow here that list of non canadian goods includes rice a single commercial operation started in 2019 in chatham kent ontario bananas only grown at canada banana farms in blyth ontario and coconuts though palm trees grow in vancouver they do not produce edible fruit other things are seasonal and multiple suppliers tell me that things like peaches or apples are often shipped up from california in the winter it s a reminder that things we take for granted at the supermarket are often the result of free trade agreements and when those agreements are jeopardized by war politics or even a pandemic what s left on the shelf can look very different zero waste emporium week three b c grown bok choy 5 b c grown portobello mushrooms 0 40 boneless skinless chicken thighs free range and raised on the island 24 kg 11 73 total 16 70 nevertheless i hit up chinatown in victoria to see what i could find i was delighted to find a large number of b c made goods at fisgard market including soy sauce chow mein noodles and prepared dim sum made in the lower mainland the chow mein turned out better than i d hoped my mother hopefully will be proud when she reads this i also picked up two more loaves of bread from the bikery at 5 apiece i eat a lot of bread it turns out week four straight to the source my trip to duncan week four a variety of meat from the drift meat seafood including chicken thighs 4 30 kg bacon 6 80 kg prawns 10 87 kg breakfast sausage patties 12 for six pack island harvested honey by a local beekeeper nielsen s honey 7 loaf of bread from kloosterman s farm 5 three sprout roll snacks from salt spring sprouts and mushrooms 10 1 89l glass bottle of 2 per cent milk from the cowichan milk co 6 a 2 deposit total 95 25 upon digging a little i felt i cheated with the milk i bought in the first week from island farms island farms does represent b c based farmers but under the larger umbrella of agropur i felt less confident that i was participating in the buy local spirit partaking in large scale industry operations i hunted down a truly independent dairy operation the cowichan milk co located in the cowichan valley with a modest 50 cow holstein herd they fit the bill there was just one problem they don t deliver to victoria for the scale of their operation sending a delivery van down the malahat highway doesn t make sense indeed moving goods around vancouver island has been problematic for years such as when the malahat closed down last winter during a period of sustained storms a lack of rail freight and upgraded port facilities in harbours like victoria or port alberni to handle large commercial shipping also raises the carbon footprint of the island bruce williams on behalf of greater victoria chamber of commerce brought this issue up during public presentations for the provincial select standing committee on finance and government services all of the goods coming into this country through the port of vancouver have to go through the port of vancouver before they come back to vancouver island williams said it s a large carbon footprint and cost as well especially goods that then leave that region go to other points east of here to be brought back again i realized the only way i would get local milk was to go straight to the source that meant hopping a bus up to duncan at an inflated fare of 10 with a round trip duration of about four hours with a voyage that long i felt i should stock up on other goods and hit the farmers market in duncan as well how does this compare to my usual a dozen local food heroes on what a pandemic teaches read more the million dollar question to use a thematically appropriate idiom is this how did this compare against my usual grocery purchases over the course of the month i spent a grand total of 467 91 comparatively in july 2021 i spent 255 75 on groceries that 200 is significant for a penniless writer to be sure but i have discovered a few things one as i said earlier is that i do feel much healthier and like i am eating less unhealthy food another is that it bears repeating that the costs i am paying an independent farmer or supplier are borne out in what are much more likely to be better labour conditions fewer carbon emissions and fewer industrial byproducts furthermore july 2021 predates the worst effects of hyperinflation that we re seeing right now so it s hard to say how it would have adjusted this year but i think the bigger picture is in recognizing how our food systems have arrived at this place globalization climate change supply chains these are forces which regardless of how conscious we are of them are having massive impacts on our daily lives in canada s far north we ate only local for a year i was transformed read more as we see ever rising costs in our groceries our gas and in our housing it s worth taking the time to step back and assess where those costs are coming from and what we can do about them for me it was a month long look into buying locally but it may have a lasting effect on my personal habits i have only been back to a big box grocery once in all of august and then only to get some parmesan cheese i now find myself willing to shell out more money for this most basic need so long as it means the product is worthwhile i m also feeling healthier though again i m quick to emphasize that a host of factors can contribute to that but even if it s not conclusive that this experiment made me healthier in body it certainly did in mind knowing where my food comes from doing what i can to support local businesses while also sticking it to a billionaire class of grocery chain owners all of that is pure food for the soul and i am ready to eat my fill

washington aug 22 2022 bss afp us central bankers have been hammering home a single message interest rates will rise until inflation begins to come down but financial markets keep hoping to hear a different tune one indicating the pace of rate hikes will slow all eyes will be on this week s annual gathering of policymakers in jackson hole wyoming to hear federal reserve chair jerome powell explain his stance again with market watchers hoping to get something more to their liking the fed could be a victim of its own success after keeping the benchmark borrowing rate at zero throughout the pandemic the steep spike in prices which surged to a 40 year high following russia s invasion of ukraine prompted the central bank to take aggressive action in the battle to contain red hot inflation which topped nine percent in june the fed has hiked rates four times including massive three quarter point increases in june and july steep moves unheard of since the early 1980s but in recent weeks signs of easing price pressures and a slowing economy along with falling energy costs and indications global supply chain snarls have lessened caused financial markets to become optimistic the fed will dial back or even pause rate increases and even begin to cut next year stocks on wall street have risen for four straight weeks despite a string of officials repeating the message that rates will continue to rise even though annual inflation slowed in july as oil prices fell while the annual gathering often becomes a place for global central bankers to signal shifting policy powell is expected to repeat that message friday though he may acknowledge that a slowdown will come later in the year it does seem like what we ve heard from powell so far suggests there s quite a high bar for them to transition from aggressive hikes to a slower pace of 25 basis point steps said jonathan millar of barclays millar who served as a fed economist and forecaster under four central bank chiefs told afp that markets are looking further ahead anticipating the rate hikes will be successful in slowing inflation but for policymakers one thing they definitely want to communicate is that they remain very much focused on issues with price stability and that they will react very cautiously to any signs of improvements in the inflation data that means indications prices are coming down more broadly not just because of falling oil managing the market s expectations is really job one millar said they have to enforce that credibility but like other economists he believes the fed s policy setting federal open market committee fomc at its september meeting will step down to a 0 5 percentage point increase taking the range of the key lending rate up to 2 75 to 3 0 percent to be followed up with quarter point hikes in november and december walking a narrow line kathy bostjancic of oxford economics said the dilemma for powell is to recognize the progress towards achieving a soft landing bringing inflation back down towards the two percent target without derailing economic growth while confirming the fed s resolve he continues to have to walk kind of a narrow line she told afp you don t want to be too pessimistic and with housing prices and sales cooling from their torrid pace along with other encouraging data he has the wind at his back but she said the message he really has to give is that we re still going to be looking to raise rates to restrictive level to really make sure inflation is still our number one priority the annual monetary policy symposium hosted by the kansas city federal reserve bank runs august 25 27 it often is a place for officials from around the world to come to discuss policy changes in the works but so far no major global central bank chief has confirmed they speak at the event other than powell

menafn usa art news for heidi klum before there was fashion there was art and it s never been a secret the german american supermodel perhaps best known for her 13 year stint as a victoria s secret angel and 16 years hosting has always turned to painting as part of her life in 2002 she was one of 100 artists who painted sculptures for a public art project paying tribute to search and rescue dogs who served during 9 11 in 2016 she auctioned off a painted roche bobois desk to support unicef during art basel miami beach and during lockdown klum shared her exploits in the studio in numerous posts on social media most recently klum unveiled one of her paintings of a bored ape yacht club nft on a digital billboard in times square as part of apefest in june she s planning an upcoming drop of 10 nfts all based on the popular collection dog with butterflies september 27 2002 in new york city photo by matthew peyton getty images width 686 height 1024 heidi klum poses at the installation of her painted sculpture september 27 2002 in new york city photo by matthew peyton getty images as with many celebrities klum s ties to the space are somewhat complicated by business relationships her wallet transactions show that her first nft was purchased at cost from an investor who also paid to register her wallet in the company who made her second nft as reported by dirty bubble media thankfully klum was happy to bring us into the loop in a wide ranging phone interview about art critiquing collecting and more although she declined to discuss her romantic relationship with vito schnabel heidi klum painting in her studio photo courtesy of heidi klum what is your earliest memory of making art just drawing and painting as a kid we didn t always have the money for everything and anything so we were a very creative household my mom was always quick with the sewing machine making something for me and then also something matching for my barbie did you have any formal training in painting art was one of my majors in bergisch gladbach a small town outside cologne when i first went to new york in 1994 i took oil painting classes with wade schuman on the weekends i danced for 15 years before i started modeling my poor parents had to bring me to dance three four times a week and my team went to national competitions so i always was into expressing myself in many different fields because of life and work and traveling for modeling and later having children there was less and less time for painting but i never really stopped and when the pandemic happened i did more paintings the fun thing was that we did one big painting together as a family when we were all stuck at our house for about six months everyone was always painting as they felt like it where do you paint at home i have an outside studio it s up on the bedroom patio everything i paint is with oil i have two gigantic easels there cans of paint my brushes and more canvases i also have two couches there so people can lounge around and watch me paint it s a beautiful big outside space and how often are you in the studio sometimes i do three or four paintings and then i won t paint anything for the longest time i just did 10 paintings for my nft project and they re quite big heidi klum painting in her studio photo courtesy of heidi klum how would you describe your taste in art my style in general is very eclectic our house it s kind of like the pippi longstocking villa villekulla it s very vibrant i love raw energy i have butterfly wallpaper we have a gigantic blue snail in the backyard even my kids sometimes say this doesn t go together but for me what doesn t go together goes together even more i usually prefer paintings over photography but i became friends with the photographer adam fuss like a hundred years ago when i was in new york i always loved his photos he took these life size photographs of me kind of silhouettes of my pregnancies heidi klum painting in her studio photo courtesy of heidi klum is there a favorite piece you own my most valuable possessions are probably my kids art i have one gigantic staircase that has 50 paintings that my kids have done but one would also be the first rose painting julian schnabel ever did one of his plate paintings it was a consignment and i gave him the idea to do one with roses when you actually ask someone to paint something for you and then they do another series of like 12 of them it s one of my proudest moments he is one of the greatest painters of our time and i respect and love him so much julian schnabel s first rose painting is the jewel of heidi klum s collection photo courtesy of heidi klum do you see art and beauty as a through line in your life connecting the art studio and in the fashion industry yes and no in making clothes there s a lot of different steps that you don t have when you are painting or making a sculpture i feel like with art the sky s the limit you don t have always someone behind you and saying this is gonna be too expensive or how do we manufacture that from your days on you obviously know the importance of critique do you ever get feedback on your paintings and has that even been a difficult experience i have never really gotten that much feedback to be honest with you because i don t think i ve ever really put myself out there too far but i think getting a reaction is half the fun in a way i m also not afraid of it i m a big girl launching these nft paintings is really the first time putting myself out there being on a times square billboard with one of my paintings was probably one of my most proudest moments normally i hang there with my face on it so it was different heidi klum painted this roche bobois desk for a charity sale during art basel miami beach in 2016 photo by sergi alexander getty images what inspired this new nft project do you collect them i only have two nfts which i display on screens in my home the first one is my cryptopunk which kind of looks like me and my second one is a utopian for afterparty which is this community that does special events they have a house in los angeles where influencers come it s kind of what the young people are doing i was very interested to see what this was all about the nft art world is wild you don t know what art i have hanging in my house but with nfts because of your wallet people can see what you have i think that s why a lot of people enjoy it and it s kind of like a new way to play the stock market you can lose a lot you can win a lot it s a way for people to get bragging rights not that i do it for bragging rights when i was looking around at all these different people doing nfts i thought what would my nft be most people have artists create their nfts for them but i wanted to create my own because i love doing painting so my idea was to paint on 10 of the most important nfts out there which next to the cryptopunks are the board apes i think i got kind of the idea subconsciously because i had asked richard prince to make a painting of me a long time ago using one of my favorite pictures of me shot by rankin that s kind of what i wanted to do heidi klum attends apefest during nft nyc in times square on june 24 2022 in new york city with her new nft art based on the bored ape yacht club displayed on a digital billboard photo by gotham gc images how did you chose which apes to depict i found someone who owns many of them and was willing to let me paint on them i don t wanna say who it is because they re a private person i printed them out all out five by five on canvas and had them stretched i went into a studio downtown a gigantic warehouse had them all hung from the ceiling and then i just gave myself 12 hours to paint all of them which was crazy but so much fun at the same time i have the 10 original paintings i have the digital versions and i also created 10 videos of me painting them some nfts will have the original painting attached and some will just be digital the times square billboard was just giving a glimpse that just happened because cozomo de medici stumbled across them in the nft world word goes around he believed in my project and showcased it during ape fest heidi klum with her nft paintings based on the bored ape yacht club photo courtesy of heidi klum is there any truth to the rumor that cozomo de medici is snoop dogg i can t comment outside of nfts what was an artwork or exhibition that you saw recently that you really loved i m friends with lola montes schnabel and her show was probably the last one i saw at nino meir gallery here in west hollywood i have many things from her right now she s experimenting with painting on tiles but also she s done beautiful sculptures for that show heidi klum and david ostrowski photo courtesy of heidi klum what other contemporary artists do you admire one of the first was david ostrowski from germany jeff elrod i love and we re friends and have been to marfa many times dan colen ron gorchov sterling ruby rashid johnson bruce high quality foundation rene ricard if that gives you an idea when do you plan to debut the full nft series as you know the whole market has crashed it s probably better to buy now than to drop this is the worst time to drop anything but it will be soon for me it was more the passion of making it the same way that i love being an art piece myself once a year when i do halloween the makeup and costumes involved are definitely an art form unto themselves what inspired you to start hosting these parties my love for halloween and transforming comes from germany in cologne we have a big carnival kind of the unsexy version of what they do in brazil we have different kind of costumes it s more silly and also more political now i sit through 15 hours of having prosthetics glued on me purely for the reaction i get from people and then it takes another like three four hours to get it off i feel like i m the canvas and i love showcasing these people s art and they love doing this on me they re like no actress wants to sit through 15 hours of this you re the only one we love you because we can really go for it i really rack my brain every year to not let any of the halloween fans down this year for example will be my best halloween costume ever it s thrilling for me four years ago i was in the window on a street in manhattan all day getting my make up done people could come from morning to night and see me getting ready i was kind of like a little art installation and what about

we are being warned that food prices in the u s are going to go absolutely haywire after the election in november i am taking such warnings very seriously and i believe that you should too global officials have been telling us over and over again that we are heading into an unprecedented global food crisis and i have been writing about this again and again in recent weeks but so far the vast majority of the population doesn t seem to be taking this seriously agricultural production is going to be way below expectations all over the planet in 2022 and that means that there will be far less food to go around in 2023 let me give you a perfect example of what i am talking about just within the last couple of days it has been reported that there will be crop losses of up to 50 percent in the german state of baden württemberg crop losses of up to 50 percent are now expected in parts of germany due to drought farmers in affected regions have claimed up to half of the crops in parts of the german state of baden württemberg are likely to be lost due to drought farmers in the region have claimed with problems to do with the prices of fuel fertiliser and pesticides connected to the green agenda and war in ukraine also reportedly causing problems for those in the region these are crop losses that haven t happened yet these are crop losses that will happen in the fall if sufficient rain does not arrive soon with the losses expected to materialise in the autumn the farming chaos may end up being another crisis facing germany s floundering political class as fuel shortages combined with a freefalling economy hit a public already suffering from officials poor handling of the covid 19 pandemic just within the past week i have written about how authorities are also projecting similar crop losses in key areas of the uk france and italy and here in the united states 37 percent of farmers in the western half of the country say that they will be killing their own crops because there is no chance that they will come to maturity due to the endless drought all of these crop losses haven t hit the food system yet so none of these crop losses are reflected in grocery store prices yet that won t happen until the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023 with all of that in mind i would like to share with you a comment that was just posted on one of southern prepper s videos just a heads up i have a family member who works in the corporate pricing department for groceries this company has been in business 40 years meeting was called 1 day ago and they were told prices will be on steroids after the election owner said he s never seen what s headed our way in 40 of business they just hired 10 more people and can not keep up with data input all hands on deck and overtime included get your house in order buy holiday grocery products while you can find and afford them boss told employees to stock up now please pay attention folks it would be easy to dismiss that comment because we don t know who it is from and so we can t verify the specific claims that are made but this is entirely consistent with everything else that i am hearing food prices have been rising rapidly in recent months but the really big deal is all the food that is not being grown right now this lack of production is going to push prices to levels that would have once been unthinkable most people simply do not realize how much our farmers are hurting right now just check out these numbers nearly three quarters of us farmers say this year s drought is hurting their harvest with significant crop and income loss according to a survey by the american farm bureau federation an insurance company and lobbying group that represents agricultural interests the survey was conducted across 15 states from june 8 to july 20 in extreme drought regions from texas to north dakota to california which makes up nearly half of the country s agricultural production value in california a state with high fruit and nut tree crops 50 of farmers said they had to remove trees and multiyear crops due to drought which will affect future revenue this is going to affect all of us if farmers and ranchers don t produce our food we do not eat things are even worse in western europe and the war in ukraine is greatly restricting the flow of agricultural goods from eastern europe in 2023 there is going to be a mad scramble for whatever food that is available and global prices are going to go nuts we have already started to see food riots and civil unrest is some areas of the globe but i anticipate that things will get much worse next year even here in the united states i expect that there will be a lot of anger and frustration and as we have seen it certainly doesn t take much for our major urban areas to explode things aren t even that bad yet and already we are seeing people behave in ways that are extremely bizarre for example just consider a very strange incident that just happened in los angeles the gang of people ransacked the store while shouting completely destroying the covid 19 safety screen that had been set up to grab as much as they could in los angeles california a group entered the convenience store near figueroa street and el segundo boulevard with surveillance footage showing the looters shouting at each other on august 15 they can be seen running across the store and grabbing drinks cigarettes lottery tickets bags of chips and other items approximately 100 young people were involved in the violence when i read about this sort of a thing it makes me very sad i have been strongly warning that such unrest would be coming to america and eventually it will get completely out of control as food prices surge to crazy heights those at the bottom of the economic food chain will not be happy the coming food crisis will be a difficult time for our nation and for the world as a whole if you understand what is coming it gives you an opportunity to get prepared sadly most of the population doesn t want to listen to the warnings and that is extremely unfortunate it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael and my brand new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available on amazon com in addition to my new book i have written five other books that are available on amazon com including lost prophecies of the future of america the beginning of the end get prepared now and living a life that really matters commissionsearned when you purchase any of these books you help to support the work that i am doing and one way that you can really help is by sending digital copies as gifts through amazon to family and friends time is short and i need help getting these warnings into the hands of as many people as possible i have published thousands of articles on the economic collapse blog end of the american dream and the most important news and the articles that i publish on those sites are republished on dozens of other prominent websites all over the globe i always freely and happily allow others to republish my articles on their own websites but i also ask that they include this about the author section with each article the material contained in this article is for general information purposes

loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life if you have not already done so i strongly urge you to ask jesus to be your lord and savior today
for almost a year army leaders have been creating an officially sanctioned military uniform bra for female soldiers members of the army uniform board will review the final options in the fall and decide which to add to the uniform the goal is for the army tactical brassiere to be as supportive as possible for servicewomen and enhance military readiness this marks a major change for the military until now female service members have purchased bras for themselves crucially it also reflects a change in how military leaders perceive female soldiers in 1957 military women s bras exploded into the news because of what they meant for female soldiers appearances at the time military regulations governed all aspects of outward appearances for female soldiers from makeup application and hair care to how much food to eat military leaders expected servicewomen to look like the first ladies of the land as one early 1950s recruiting ad proclaimed while change has come gradually and vestiges of this thinking still affect the military development of the atb with its focus on best equipping female soldiers to do their jobs indicates that the military is making important efforts to move toward equity in 1948 the women s armed services integration act granted women permanent positions in all military branches after world war ii ended servicewomen filled military roles around the world in american occupation zones the u s occupation of japan ended in 1952 but american troops remained in the country including a group from the women s army corps the appearances of soldiers in the wac mattered to military officials they commissioned fashion designer hattie carnegie to design wac uniforms during world war ii elizabeth arden developed a lipstick color montezuma red made to match the trim on the marine corps women s reserve uniforms advertising materials routinely portrayed servicewomen as well dressed young women in tailored smart uniforms even so the supporting items beneath the uniform remained a secret until 1957 advertisement that fall lt jeane wolcott arrived to take over command of the 96 member wac detachment in yokohama while inspecting her unit wolcott discovered that a staggering 95 of the 96 women did not have as polished a feminine appearance as regulations demanded wolcott told the women to be better prepared for their next inspection she recommended the women shop around for shapewear including girdles shoulder padding and falsies better known today as push up bras it s unclear how news of wolcott s disappointment spread although it might have come from the women in the unit themselves but the associated press picked up the story it appeared in newspapers around the world shape up in falsies army orders girls read the london daily sketch headline wolcott doubled down telling the new york journal american some of the young ladies who are not too gifted in some ways were told they could make improvements for women who were beginning to bulge a bit wolcott suggested girdles for those who weren t well endowed causing their uniform to dip in front of the shoulders wolcott suggested padding at the shoulders or falsies but because the army did not issue servicewomen girdles or bras wolcott could not order the women to comply she promised there would be no disciplinary action taken against those whose appearance did not improve but some of the women expressed dismay at her verdict nonetheless one servicewoman contacted her congressman to complain within a week a male commander came to inspect the women he and wolcott believed the women looked better in this inspection although wolcott said she had sent some women for medical attention so they could be placed on a diet in her view women needed to look feminine and when they did not that needed to be fixed wolcott explained that she wanted her women to be women her view reflected military leaders prevailing views on female soldiers at the time since world war ii military leaders had worried over the possibility of lesbianism in the women s services to combat these fears officials linked femininity and women s military service assuming that women who looked and acted like women were also heterosexual in the aftermath of wolcott s caustic evaluation the women found support not just from the male commanding officer who inspected them next but also from new york bra manufacturer martin schur he telegrammed wolcott your order to shape up interesting but difficult also falsies old fashioned instead the manufacturer would send the unit 100 bras to uphold and uplift best traditions of the army advertisement the battle of the bulge as one editorial cartoonist named it exposed tensions over the expectations for women s appearances while some wacs reportedly scurried to purchase undergarments as wolcott recommended many did not appreciate being reduced to physical specimens of femininity on the other hand the incident reinforced for some like san francisco chronicle columnist and editor abe mellinkoff that women did not belong in defense roles in a piece with the headline support urged for strategic areas mellinkoff argued that wolcott s requests were evidence that women did not belong in the military he reminded readers that wolcott could not enforce her suggestions because the military did not stock falsies as a matter of fact he wrote the army cannot issue falsies because no training manual has been written on their proper use under various combat conditions because army manuals tended to run a couple of wars behind the times mellinkoff speculated that the military might get falsies at least by the time they get the intercontinental ballistics missile he was off on his calculations by more than half a century icbms debuted in 1959 yet while an army bra took another 60 plus years women began serving in greater numbers in the ensuing decades but even as their numbers increased equal treatment came slowly to the military through the 1970s military leaders carefully shaped women s defense roles to make the idea of women in uniform acceptable to the american public regulations required parents to sign off on women s enlistment if they were under the age of 21 rank limitations ensured few servicewomen until the late 1960s would advance to high ranks in part to ensure that women would not command men women could marry while in service but motherhood meant dismissal from the armed forces military service offered women unique career opportunities yet constrained their roles at the same time in theory women were equal partners in defense in reality these limitations and the emphasis on servicewomen s femininity set women apart a decade after wolcott s lecture to her troops wacs serving in vietnam expressed similar concerns to those aired by the soldiers she objectified asking their superiors whether they were there to do a job or to look nice advertisement sexism sexual harassment and sexual assault remained problems in the military even as women played an increasingly large role in american defense in 2015 the military finally eliminated gender based combat restrictions in the years since servicewomen have achieved firsts across the armed forces as they began to qualify for roles previously only open to men yet this process has not been easy today women achieve their positions based on their physical and mental capabilities but even these changes did not purge sexism and gender based discrimination from the military this is a key legacy of the early cold war and the ideas preached by leaders like wolcott the development of the atb is part of a larger movement to better understand what military personnel need to do their jobs well uniforms are more than just the outer layers that most people see bras in particular are increasingly understood as an important functional part of women s clothing in 2021 women on the british olympic team got bras designed for them individually based on research about how proper bras best support women athletes the atb prototypes are no different in concept and their designers are focused on comfort and performance in 1957 the yokohama battle of the bulge focused on bras as something that would help keep servicewomen looking good today military leaders attention to servicewomen s undergarments reflects a new focus on making sure all members of the nation s defense team are ready it s a recognition that readiness can look different for men and women even while acknowledging that gender should not be the main determinant of a service member s role tanya l roth is the author of her cold war women in the u s military 1945 1980 she teaches at an independent school in st louis mo send questions comments to the editors
