russian president vladimir putin announced russia would recognise two breakaway regions in ukraine east as independent entities video reuters russian president vladimir putin has signed a decree recognising the two breakaway regions in eastern ukraine as independent entities and ordered the russian army to launch what moscow called a peacekeeping operation in the areas upping the ante in a crisis the west fears could unleash a war mr putin told russia s defence ministry to deploy troops into the two breakaway regions to keep the peace in a decree issued shortly after he signed the recognition decree it was not immediately clear the size of the force that mr putin was dispatching when they would cross the border into ukraine and exactly what their mission would be discussed the events of the last hours with potus we begin the meeting of the national security and defense council a conversation with borisjohnson is also planned володимир зеленський zelenskyyua february 21 2022 the russian leader was shown signing the recognition decree as well as agreements on co operation and friendship with breakaway luhansk and donetsk regions on russian state tv on monday the separatist leaders of the two regions were present at the signing ceremony read more the signing ceremony came amid a long televised address in which mr putin railed against ukraine and shortly after the kremlin had said mr putin had told the leaders of france and germany that he planned to sign the decree recognising the independence of the two regions held by russian backed separatists the french and german leaders voiced disappointment after hearing the decision the kremlin said in a readout of the phone calls moscow s move to recognise the regions is also likely to torpedo a last minute bid for a biden putin summit to halt the threat of russia invading ukraine russia s rouble tumbled to new weeks long lows during mr putin s televised address as he spoke from behind a wooden office desk flanked by russian tricolour flags the long address delved into the region s history as far back as the ottoman empire and as recent as the tensions over nato s eastward expansion a key irritant for moscow mr putin described ukraine as an integral part of russia s past without a tradition of genuine statehood of its own if ukraine was to join nato it would serve as a direct threat to the security of russia he said with his decision to recognise the regions mr putin brushed off western warnings that such a step would be illegal would kill off peace negotiations and would trigger sanctions against moscow ursula von der leyen and charles michel the presidents of the european commission and european council said in response to the move the recognition of the two separatist territories in ukraine is a blatant violation of international law the territorial integrity of ukraine and the minsk agreements the eu and its partners will react with unity firmness and determination in solidarity with ukraine meawnhile in a statement minister for foreign affairs simon coveney said ireland s support for ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders and its right to choose its own foreign and security policy path is unwavering he added that the state supported a clear and strong eu response to russia s move to recognise the regions including sanctions measures the eu had warned of sanctions from the 27 nation bloc should moscow annex or recognise the breakaway regions if there is annexation there will be sanctions and if there is recognition i will put the sanctions on the table and the ministers will decide the eu s foreign policy chief josep borrell said after a meeting of the bloc s foreign ministers recognition of the rebel held areas could provide a pretext for russian troops to cross the border into those areas the current ukraine crisis has been triggered by what washington says is russia having now massed a force numbering 169 000 190 000 troops in the region including pro russian rebels in eastern ukraine russia denies any plan to attack its neighbour which broke away from moscow s rule with the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but it has threatened unspecified military technical action unless it received sweeping security guarantees including a promise that ukraine will never join nato fake news separately moscow said ukrainian military saboteurs had tried to enter russian territory in armed vehicles leading to five deaths an accusation dismissed as fake news by kyiv the developments fit a pattern repeatedly predicted by western governments who accuse russia of preparing to fabricate a pretext to invade ukraine by blaming kyiv for attacks and relying on pleas for help from separatist proxies european financial markets tumbled at the signs of increased confrontation after having briefly edged higher on the glimmer of hope that a mooted summit might offer a path out of europe s biggest military crisis in decades at a televised meeting on monday of his security council which normally meets behind closed doors mr putin restated russia s demands insisting that it was not enough for the west to say ukraine was not ready to join nato at present he also said he would make a decision today on the request for recognition made a few hours earlier by the leaders of the luhansk and donetsk regions which broke away from kyiv s control in 2014 shelling has intensified since last week along a long simmering front line between the rebels and ukrainian forces in east ukraine ukraine and the west consider the rebels to be russia s proxies and have been warning for weeks that moscow might use them to construct a case for war officials in kyiv said shelling on monday by separatists in eastern ukraine killed two troops and one civilian and wounded four soldiers worst case scenario looms the televised security council meeting in moscow allowed mr putin and his top advisers to outline their case dmitry medvedev the security council s deputy chairman told the meeting it was obvious that ukraine did not need the two breakaway regions and that a majority of russians would support their independence russia already offers passports to residents of the two regions and mr medvedev said there were now 800 000 russian citizens there russian defence minister sergei shoigu appeared to raise the stakes even further by saying that ukraine which renounced nuclear weapons after independence from the soviet union had a greater nuclear potential than iran or north korea after talks in brussels with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg british foreign minister liz truss said western countries were preparing for a worst case scenario the airlines lufthansa klm and air france all cancelled flights to kyiv hours earlier french president emmanuel macron gave hope of a diplomatic solution saying mr putin and his us counterpart joe biden had agreed in principle to meet mr putin said mr macron had told him washington had changed its stance on russia s security demands without specifying how the white house said mr biden had accepted the meeting in principle but only if an invasion hasn t happened washington which heads the nato alliance has flatly rejected the idea of excluding ukraine for good or reversing nato s eastward enlargement of the last three decades but has offered talks on weapons deployments and other security issues kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov said a call or meeting between mr putin and mr biden could be set up at any time but there were no concrete plans yet for a summit mr macron s office and the white house said details would be worked out by us secretary of state antony blinken and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov later this week mr lavrov confirmed he planned to meet mr blinken in geneva on thursday and said there had been some progress in talks with the west on security mr blinken has said any meeting would be called off if russia invades no one can resolve our issue without us ukraine said it must be included in any decisions aimed at resolving the crisis and that it had seen warnings online that hackers were preparing to launch cyberattacks on government agencies banks and the military on tuesday no one can resolve our issue without us top ukrainian security official oleksiy danilov told a briefing russia s military said a group of saboteurs had crossed the frontier from ukraine near the russian city of rostov on monday morning followed by two armoured vehicles coming to evacuate them it said five members of those forces had been killed when russian forces repelled them ukraine said the report was fake news and that no ukrainian forces were present in the rostov region western countries say they are preparing sanctions that would hit russian companies and individuals in the event of an invasion people familiar with the matter said these could include barring us financial institutions from processing transactions for russian banks austrian chancellor karl nehammer said the european union s package of sanctions would include stopping certification of the nord stream 2 gas pipeline connecting russia to germany which is awaiting german and eu regulatory approval additional reporting reuters bloomberg guardian

listen to this article listen to this article washington federal reserve governor michelle bowman said monday that she was open to lifting interest rates by more than the traditional quarter point at the central bank s next meeting in march bowman s comments came after several officials on friday pushed back against the idea of a half point increase in the fed s benchmark short term interest rate the fed is looking to raise rates as inflation surged to 7 5 in january compared with a year earlier the biggest increase in four decades the debate over how quickly to raise interest rates is being closely watched by financial markets and also could have an impact on the broader economy many economists have said the fed has moved too slowly in response to an unexpectedly persistent surge in prices raising the risk that inflation could remain high but if it raises rates too quickly the fed risks choking off growth and hiring the bank is almost certain to start lifting interest rates at its march 15 16 meeting with most officials who have expressed views backing a quarter point increase however james bullard president of the federal reserve bank of st louis has expressed support for a half point hike sometime at the fed s next three meetings any increase next month would be the first since 2018 bowman said in prepared remarks to an american bankers association conference in palm desert california that she supported lifting rates next month and that if the economy evolves as i expect additional rate increases will be appropriate in the coming months i will be watching the data closely to judge the appropriate size of an increase at the march meeting she added suggesting she is open to a half point hike the fed s rate increases typically push up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses slowing the economy s growth average mortgage rates have already risen to nearly 4 the highest since 2019 as markets have moved in anticipation of the fed s increases before joining the fed s board in 2018 bowman was the top bank regulator in kansas and has not been a leading voice on the fed s interest rate policies still as a fed governor she has a permanent vote on interest rates and three of the seven governor seats are now vacant bowman also said inflation is much too high and is a heavy burden for all americans but especially for those with limited means who are forced to pay more for everyday items delay purchases or put off saving for the future she said higher prices will likely continue for the first half of the year potentially declining in the second half but there is a substantial risk that high inflation could persist disrupted supply chains have slowed the production of goods like cars furniture appliances and electronics even as demand for those items has soared a key reason for higher inflation bowman acknowledged the fed can t do anything about supply problems but said it could address strong demand by ending its ultra low interest rate policies that are no longer needed john williams president of the new york fed said friday that he did not see any compelling argument to take a big step at the beginning of rate hikes indicating he supports a quarter point boost next month most economists expect six or seven rate hikes this year which would be a quicker pace than the last time the fed tightened credit from 2015 to 2018 investors have priced in a 70 chance of at least six increases this year according to cme s fedwatch fed governor lael brainard said friday that she expected the fed to initiate a series of rate increases at its meeting in march she also said the financial markets expectations are aligned with the fed s plans suggesting she supports investors view that there will be six rate increases this year the fed also has said it will start reducing its 9 trillion in bond holdings later this year which would likely have the effect of pushing up interest rates brainard and williams are considered part of a troika of close advisers to fed chair jerome powell

025 fourth quarter results segment results well intervention well intervention revenues decreased 12 1 million or 9 in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the previous quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower utilization in the north sea and brazil offset in part by higher utilization in the gulf of mexico and higher operating rates in west africa during the fourth quarter 2021 north sea utilization declined with the seasonal slowdown and our brazil utilization declined as the siem helix 1 had minimal utilization during the fourth quarter 2021 following the completion of its long term contract in august 2021 and scheduled regulatory inspections overall well intervention vessel utilization decreased to 56 in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 72 in the previous quarter well intervention net loss from operations increased to 21 1 million in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 13 3 million in the previous quarter the increased loss was due to lower revenues offset in part by reduced operating costs in the north sea during the fourth quarter well intervention revenues increased 7 2 million or 6 in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the fourth quarter 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher utilization in west africa offset in part by lower utilization in brazil and lower rates in the gulf of mexico during the fourth quarter 2021 our fourth quarter 2021 utilization in west africa benefitted from near full utilization on the q7000 which had no utilization during the fourth quarter 2020 however our fourth quarter 2021 revenues were negatively impacted with the completion of our long term contracts during 2021 on the q5000 which had lower rates compared to the prior year and the siem helix 1 which had minimal utilization following the completion of its long term contract in august 2021 and scheduled regulatory inspections compared to near full utilization in the prior year well intervention vessel utilization was 56 in both the fourth quarters 2021 and 2020 well intervention incurred a net loss from operations of 21 1 million in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to operating income of 1 9 million in the fourth quarter 2020 operating income decreased despite higher revenue due to lower margins in west africa and the gulf of mexico compared to the prior year robotics robotics revenues decreased 1 8 million or 4 in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the previous quarter the seasonally lower revenues were driven by a decrease in rov activity and lower seasonal vessel rates in the north sea offset in part by a higher number of vessel days rov and trencher utilization decreased to 38 in the fourth quarter 2021 from 43 in the previous quarter while trenching days remained flat quarter over quarter chartered vessel utilization was 99 in both the third and fourth quarters 2021 although there were 419 total vessel days during the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 358 total vessel days during the previous quarter vessel days during the fourth quarter 2021 included 197 spot vessel days performing seabed clearance work in the north sea and 40 spot vessel days completing the rov support work for a telecom project offshore guyana compared to 99 and 77 of such spot vessel days respectively during the previous quarter robotics operating income decreased 1 4 million during the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the previous quarter due to lower revenues during the fourth quarter 2021 robotics revenues decreased 1 3 million or 3 in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the fourth quarter 2020 the decrease in revenues year over year was due to lower rates on our vessels offset in part by an increase in vessel and rov activity during the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the fourth quarter 2020 during the fourth quarter 2021 our spot vessel days completing the telecom project offshore guyana were at lower demobilization rates and our site clearance projects were on average at lower overall rates compared to the fourth quarter 2020 total vessel days during the fourth quarter 2021 increased to 419 days compared to 336 days during the fourth quarter 2020 vessel days during the fourth quarter 2021 included 197 spot vessel days performing seabed clearance work and 40 spot vessel days completing rov support work for a telecom project offshore guyana compared to 74 spot vessel days performing seabed clearance work and 78 spot vessel days performing decommissioning projects and rov support work during the fourth quarter 2020 chartered vessel utilization was 99 during the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 100 during the fourth quarter 2020 total rov and trencher utilization was 38 in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 32 in the fourth quarter 2020 with 90 trenching days in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 92 days in the fourth quarter 2020 robotics income from operations increased 1 7 million in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the fourth quarter 2020 due to lower costs and higher margins on projects during the fourth quarter 2021 production facilities production facilities revenues increased 1 6 million or 9 in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the previous quarter and 5 1 million or 34 compared to the fourth quarter 2020 primarily due to higher oil and gas production volumes and prices during the fourth quarter 2021 selling general and administrative and other selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses were 21 5 million or 12 7 of revenue in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 13 3 million or 7 4 of revenue in the previous quarter the increase was primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation costs compared to the previous quarter other income and expenses other expense net was 0 1 million in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 4 0

quarter 2021 cash flows operating cash flows were 18 9 million in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 28 7 million in the previous quarter and 40 2 million in the fourth quarter 2020 the decreases in operating cash flows quarter over quarter and year over year were primarily due to lower earnings offset in part by improvements in working capital during the fourth quarter 2021 capital expenditures totaled 0 9 million in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 0 6 million in the previous quarter and 1 1 million in the fourth quarter 2020 free cash flow was 17 9 million in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 28 1 million in the previous quarter and 39 1 million in the fourth quarter 2020 the decreases in free cash flow quarter over quarter and year over year were due primarily to lower operating cash flows in the fourth quarter 2021 free cash flow is a non gaap measure see reconciliation below full year results segment results well intervention well intervention revenues decreased 22 7 million or 4 in 2021 compared to 2020 the decrease was primarily driven by lower vessel utilization and rates on the q4000 and the siem helix 1 which completed its long term contract in brazil during the third quarter 2021 and lower rates on the q5000 with the completion of its long term contract in the gulf of mexico during the second quarter 2021 the decrease was offset in part by higher utilization on the q7000 which had near full utilization once resuming operations in january 2021 after being warm stacked for the majority of 2020 overall well intervention vessel utilization remained flat at 67 in both 2021 and 2020 well intervention incurred a net loss from operations of 35 9 million in 2021 compared to operating income of 26 9 million in 2020 a decrease of 62 7 million the decrease was due to lower segment revenues as well as lower margins associated with our resumed activity in west africa in 2021 robotics robotics revenues decreased 40 7 million or 23 in 2021 compared to 2020 the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in seabed clearance and trenching activities chartered vessel days decreased to 1 178 in 2021 compared to 1 690 in 2020 due primarily to a reduction in vessel days associated with our renewables site clearance projects in the north sea which totaled 360 days in 2021 compared to 647 days in 2020 trenching days decreased to 336 days in 2021 compared to 407 days in 2020 overall rov and trencher utilization increased to 36 in 2021 compared to 34 in 2020 robotics operating income decreased 8 0 million or 58 in 2021 compared to 2020 the decrease in operating income was due to lower revenues offset in part by lower operating expenses during 2021 production facilities production facilities revenues increased 11 0 million or 19 in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase was due to higher oil and gas prices and production volumes and higher revenues related to the helix fast response system in 2021 production facilities operating income increased 6 9 million compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in revenues in 2021 selling general and administrative and other selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses were 63 4 million or 9 4 of revenue in 2021 compared to 61 1 million or 8 3 of revenue in 2020 the increase was primarily related to an increase in employee incentive compensation costs offset in part by cost reduction measures and lower credit provisions which included credit losses of 1 9 million in 2020 net interest expense net interest expense decreased to 23 2 million in 2021 compared to 28 5 million in 2020 the decrease was primarily associated with lower funded debt which decreased by 91 0 million during 2021 and lower amortization of debt discounts on our convertible senior notes which were eliminated with our adoption of asu no 2020 06 accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s own equity the decrease was offset in part by a full year of higher interest rates on our convertible senior notes due 2026 which were issued in august 2020 gain on extinguishment of long term debt the 9 2 million gain on extinguishment of long term debt in 2020 was associated with our repurchase of a portion of our convertible senior notes due 2022 and 2023 other income and expenses other expense net was 1 5 million in 2021 compared to other income net of 4 7 million in 2020 the change was primarily due foreign currency losses due to a weakening of the british pound in 2021 compared to foreign currency gains due to a strengthening of the british pound in 2020 cash flows helix generated operating cash flows of 140 1 million in 2021 compared to 98 8 million in 2020 the increase in operating cash flows in 2021 was due to improvements in working capital lower regulatory certification costs and the receipt of tax refunds of 18 9 million related to the cares act offset in part by lower earnings in 2021 regulatory certification costs which are considered as part of helix s capital spending program but are classified in operating cash flows were 9 6 million in 2021 compared to 19 3 million in 2020 capital expenditures declined to 8 3 million in 2021 compared to 20 2 million in 2020 primarily due to completion of the q7000 which commenced operations early 2020 and reductions in capital spending as part of our response to the covid 19 pandemic free cash flow was 131 8 million in 2021 compared to 79 5 million in 2020 due to higher operating cash flows and lower capital expenditures in 2021 free cash

net debt net debt to book capitalization and free cash flow we define ebitda as earnings before income taxes net interest expense gain or loss on extinguishment of long term debt net other income or expense and depreciation and amortization expense non cash impairment losses on goodwill and other long lived assets and gains and losses on equity investments are also added back if applicable to arrive at our measure of adjusted ebitda we exclude the gain or loss on disposition of assets and the general provision release for current expected credit losses if any in addition we include

long term debt including current maturities of long term debt less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash net debt to book capitalization is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of net debt and shareholders equity we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures net of proceeds from sale of assets we use ebitda adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to monitor and facilitate internal evaluation of the performance of our business operations to facilitate external comparison of our business results to those of others in our industry to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future investments and acquisitions to plan and evaluate operating budgets and in certain cases to report our results to the holders of our debt as required by our debt covenants we believe that our measures of ebitda adjusted ebitda and free cash flow provide useful information to the public regarding our operating performance and ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures and may help our investors understand and compare our results to other companies that have different financing capital and tax structures other companies may calculate their measures of ebitda adjusted ebitda and free cash flow differently from the way we do which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures ebitda adjusted ebitda and

the severe weather means extensive preparations from utility companies busy hardware stores and county emergency management plans consumers energy media spokesperson josh paciorek said the incoming ice can have major effects on power outages a half inch of ice on power lines or trees can add up to 500 lbs on that power line on that tree causing it to sag to break causing trees to break fall into power lines he said we re looking at maybe around a third of an inch of ice but still that s several hundred pounds more on those power lines on those trees resulting in potential outages the ice can also affect when power can be restored once crews safely get out on the field consumers energy said they have 200 crews on standby for the northern and central michigan area ice also causes problems with restoration efforts because that poses further danger for our crews working to restore power after an ice storm said paciorek make sure you take extra precautions while driving you ll see our crews they ll be working already on the side of the road getting power turned back on just make sure you slow down go around give them space while they work while consumers energy is preparing before the storm ebels hardware in falmouth says they get lots of people coming in after a big storm we always advertise generators and shovels snowmelt all of that stuff said abby dezeeuw but it s usually after it hits after we get ice it s known that people are here because the power s gone out and usually they need a generator after some lengthy power outages earlier in the winter and selling out of their stock of generators they ordered even more generators this time around i actually ordered double what we normally do so i think we have around 35 units in stock right now generator wise said dezeeuw we re always well stocked with ice melt salt and shovels clare county emergency manager jerry becker has been coordinating and making sure plans are set with law enforcement first responders and other county leaders we ve been getting regular weather updates for the last 3 4 days from the national weather service and we re watching how this storm is going to develop and looking at the possible impacts for our residents in clare county said becker becker s concerns are on road patrol 911 emergencies opening possible emergency shelters and making sure meals on wheels is delivered to those in the county in order to open up an emergency shelter there s a few pieces of criteria that s looked at before making a decision we start watching the power grid and the power outage board and then we also rely heavily on 211 and also 911 to see what we get for calls for assistance said becker it s really kind of in the air right now we re watching the fluctuations and again in communication with national weather service and relying on them to see where it s going to go and what it s going to do paciorek said there s a few things to remember before heading into this storm a lot of people like to charge their phones or their laptops overnight while we would recommend start charging those devices earlier on in the day and making sure they re fully charged he said have a few extra canned foods can opener medication food ready to go have a battery powered radio as well as part of the emergency kit and a flashlight along with some batteries don t use generators in enclosed spaces make sure they re 25 ft away from any enclosed space to keep your family safe you can follow power outage alerts on the consumers energy outage map if you see a downed power line call 911 then call consumers at 1 800 477 5050 if you lost power and are in need of an emergency shelter call 211 to find out resources near you
asx futures are trading 1 1 lower this morning pointing to a rocky start in trading this morning while wall st was closed for a public holiday yesterday europe s major benchmark indices took a massive tumble down more than 2 as russia massed forces to the ukraine border following president vladamir putin s recognition of two separatist republics in the ukraine putin has signed a decree recognising the donetsk and luhansk people s republics in ukraine and told france and germany of his intention to sign the decree late yesterday the decree could give moscow the excuse it needs to invade ukraine european leaders have expressed disappointment at the move with nato calling it a pretext to invasion this further undermines ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity erodes efforts towards a resolution of the conflict and violates the minsk agreements to which russia is a party nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said british foreign minister liz truss said the move violated the united nations charter we will not allow russia s violation of its international commitments to go unpunished truss wrote on twitter the european union has said it would place sanctions on those involved in recognising ukraine s breakaway regions as independent the us believes russia has massed a force of 169 000 190 000 troops in the region including pro russian rebels in eastern ukraine us national security adviser jake sullivan said the administration had always been ready to talk to avert a war but would respond to any attack so when president macron asked president biden yesterday if he was prepared in principle to meet with president putin if russia did not invade of course president biden said yes sullivan told nbc s today show on monday but every indication we see on the ground right now in terms of the disposition of russian forces is that they are in fact getting prepared for a major attack on ukraine whatever happens in the coming days it looks as if there is no coming back in a pre recorded speech putin justified his decision to sign the decree blaming nato for the current crisis while calling the us led alliance an existential threat to russia in disregarding the

here is a creep feed grinding setup employing many of the elements discussed in this article seen here are a profiled grinding wheel continuous dressing unit directly above it nozzles following the profile of the wheel and tooling the white plastic piece for capturing and pooling the coolant is grinding the material removal process of the future consider these two important ongoing trends in machining tighter tolerances better performing systems in automobiles and other end products are driving the demand for increasingly tighter feature tolerances and finer surfaces on machined parts harder materials manufacturers are increasingly using superalloys ceramics and other materials engineered for high hardness at high temperatures this results in parts that are more durable but harder to machine and to these trends in machining in general one can add an important material engineering trend that directly affects grinding improved grains and bonds in grinding wheels are delivering more effective performance together all these developments suggest there will be greater use of grinding in the future they also point to an implication even more specific than that taken together these factors suggest that we will see increasingly greater use of creep feed grinding what is creep feed grinding compared to the more common surface grinding creep feed grinding employs a heavier grinding depth combined with a slow traverse rate generally with a profiled grinding wheel to generate a given geometric form at a material removal rate mrr that is much higher than the finishing passes for which grinding is generally known the mrr is why creep feed grinding offers such promise in machining a hard high temperature alloy such as inconel or an even harder material such as a ceramic matrix composite the potential mrr of a heavier metal cutting process such as milling is limited greater use of these hard materials therefore means greater challenges for milling but developments such as grinding wheel improvements have enabled creep feed grinding s mrr in these same materials to significantly increase according to grinding wheel manufacturer saint gobain abrasives which is known by the brand norton we have already reached the point at which grinding is no longer a terminal process in the machining sequence for a part instead in a significant and growing number of cases grinding is the process i recently spoke about this shift with members of the norton engineering team during a visit to the company s higgins grinding technology center in northborough massachusetts this boston area facility where application engineering and product testing are performed on grinding wheels and other products is one of four such grinding technology centers for the company worldwide on the day i visited much of the testing i saw on cnc grinders on the facility s r d floor related to creep feed grinding team members i met with included technology manager robin bright phd senior application engineer bruce gustafson director of bonded abrasives brian rutkiewicz and high performance materials technologist philip varghese phd all creep feed experts who have been involved with a company initiative called machining to grinding aimed at helping support manufacturers making a transition from metal cutting to greater use of grinding this initiative which has focused on aerospace manufacturers as they shift to difficult to machine alloys and composites has also realized success for gear makers and now is finding applications in automotive manufacturing i asked the team members what is important to understand about creep feed grinding today their replies covered the following 10 points the first of which explores the somewhat ambiguous question of just where creep feed begins 1 creep feed grinding has no formal definition there are no creep feed police gustafson says the principal defining characteristic of creep feed grinding is a depth of cut that is high for grinding but opinions differ on precisely what depth marks the transition in his work involving aircraft engine related grinding applications he has noted that engineers in this sector frequently mark the beginning of creep feed at 0 015 inch his own opinion places the transition earlier than this he thinks a grinding depth of 0 005 inch can qualify as creep feed in either case he says the choice is arbitrary with no formal definition likely it is reasonable to think of your deep grinding application as creep feed and you may have done grinding that was arguably creep feed without realizing it 2 creep feed is both a low force and a high force process rutkiewicz characterizes the creep feed process by pointing to this seemingly contradictory depiction the force in the cut is low from one perspective and high from another while each cutting particle on the grinding wheel experiences a low force relative to other modes of grinding the force imparted to the machine and part overall is likely to be high compensating for the heavy depth of cut in creep feed is a traverse rate feed rate that is low often on the order of 5 to 20 inches per minute the low feed rate and corresponding chip load mean the cutting force upon every individual grit of the surface of the grinding wheel is also low wheel life and power efficiency both potentially benefit from this and yet a lot of grits are engaged the larger depth of cut of creep feed means a longer arc of the wheel is submerged in the part increasing force overall as a result the requirements of a grinding machine used in this process include spindle power of at least 15 to 20 horsepower per inch of grinding wheel width and a static loop stiffness of 100 000 pounds per inch for each inch of grinding wheel width 3 creep feed offers advantages over conventional grinding compared to a conventional process that makes faster lighter passes creep feed grinding offers the following benefits shorter cycle time true the feed rate is low but the increased depth of cut more than compensates for this additionally the reduced total number of passes means there is less time lost to acceleration and deceleration as the machine reverses reduced machine wear another beneficial result of the reduced frequency of machine reversals longer wheel life the reduced force per grit point 2 above means that this high mrr process is actually less demanding on the wheel finer tolerance and more complex geometric for the low feed rate and low force per grit enable superior control over the outcome of the grinding operation all these benefits come with one very large downside to creep feed grinding discussed in the next point 4 coolant is crucial the long arc of wheel engagement translates to greater heat generation in the process coolant is therefore crucial to using creep feed grinding effectively other machining processes routinely apply flood coolant by using a nozzle to point the coolant stream in roughly the direction of the cut but creep feed requires coolant application to be taken more seriously various considerations are employed to ensure as much of the coolant s heat transfer capacity is realized as possible including coolant delivery speed is matched to the speed at the wheel surface syncing coolant flow speed with the speed at which any point of the wheel is passing ensures more of the coolant meets and follows with the wheel coolant delivery nozzles are arranged in profiles that match the profile of the grinding wheel see photo in the slideshow above special coolant collection tooling is used in creep feed grinding a ramp on the exit side of the part collects coolant and enables it to pool at the wheel for still greater wheel exposure to the fluid this ramp might even be machined to match the part profile 5 down grinding is preferred for mrr similar to milling in which the two possible directions of tool rotation relative to the workpiece produce either conventional milling or climb milling the two possible directions of grinding wheel rotation produce either up grinding or down grinding dr bright says creep feed s preference is down grinding when the objective is high mrr the rotation of the wheel in down grinding causes the bottom of the wheel to move in the same direction as the feed of the part this type of grinding causes any point of the wheel any grit of the wheel to first meet the workpiece where the material engagement is greatest see diagram in the slideshow above again heat is the reason for this preference where stock removal is high to grind in the other direction is to have the grit first meet the material without cutting into it the result is that each grit is not making a chip right away dr bright says initially the grits are sliding and plowing which causes friction and excess heat into the part down grinding though it might seem more abrupt allows for a cooler grinding process as grits are forming chips when they first engage the part by contrast up grinding is preferred where the objective is either a fine surface finish or extending the life of the abrasive 6 intermittent dressing is becoming more acceptable because the material removal per pass is so great in creep feed grinding aluminum oxide wheels used in this process tend to require continuous dressing a dressing wheel applied to the grinding wheel as it is grinding keeps the wheel sharp at all times indeed continuous dress capability is potentially another machine requirement for creep feed grinding in addition to power and stiffness however newer grinding wheels with ceramic grit make it possible to avoid this need because the ceramic wheels remain sharp for a longer period of time they make it possible to use intermittent dressing meaning dressing using a separate wheel located elsewhere in the workzone apart from the grinding head dressing only when needed allows the wheel to last longer and by eliminating the need for continuous dress capability the more advanced grinding wheel makes it possible to perform creep feed grinding on a less expensive machine 7 superabrasive wheels can move beyond tool grinding a third wheel type is also likely suitable for intermittent dressing dressable metal bond superabrasive wheels using diamond or cubic boron nitride cbn grit have been used in cutting tool manufacturing for grinding composite cermet and ceramic tools based on the similarity of material properties norton engineers believe these wheels could also efficiently grind ceramic matrix composite and gamma titanium aluminide parts for aerospace another useful feature of these wheels is their porosity for grinding wheels in general that are engineered for creep feed grinding material grains are spaced widely to create microscopic porosity allowing coolant to infiltrate the wheel in a superabrasive wheel such as the norton winter paradigm product line the metal bond allows for a wheel porosity ranging to 46 percent in some cases superabrasive wheels also can be used without any dressing single layer metal bond superabrasive wheels designed for no dressing have been applied to realize creep feed grinding on cnc milling machines 8 broaching now has a low footprint rival milling is not the only competitor to creep feed grinding another is broaching specifically the broaching that is applied to realize the fir tree forms in aircraft engine disks made of superalloy a form such as this can be generated through creep feed grinding the result might be considerable floor space savings because of the long linear travel it requires the broaching machine for this operation could easily be 30 to 40 feet long creep feed grinding offers the chance to perform the same machining within a standard size machine tool 9 in aerospace the mrr can match that of milling dr varghese stresses again the view that grinding is a finishing process and the final touch applied to a machined part to realize dimensional and surface tolerances that is the historical role of grinding is a view that will become less and less inclusive of all that grinding can do as advanced workpiece materials are used more widely in the past 1 cubic inch per minute per inch of wheel width is the typical specific mrr that has been expected of grinding in superalloy grinding applications today on cnc machines using engineered wheels creep feed grinding can realize a specific mrr of 18 cubic inches per minute per inch of wheel width resulting in overall mrr equal to or better than what a milling cutter might do in that same workpiece material he says another important area of advance has been in the energy demand creep feed grinding requires from the perspective of the machine creep feed is a high force process point 2 but the sharper cutting grit in modern wheels reduces that force improved wheel porosity for conveying swarf and coolant along with improved coolant techniques also help to improve energy efficiency as a result the specific energy of creep feed grinding the energy required to remove each cubic inch of material has become comparable to milling as well 10 creep feed offers the promise to relocate heat treatment but comparing milling to grinding in terms of their machining cycles alone might miss one of the greatest benefits of creep feed a fundamental change to the sequence of the process in that traditional role of grinding as a finishing operation the part often undergoes heat treatment just ahead of this step grinding is an effective process for machining in the harder post heat treatment state though milling the part in this state would be problematic thus most of the part s machining is carried out through milling while the workpiece is still soft then comes heat treating then the part may receive a final light milling step before grinding or it may go to grinding directly this sequence milling sending the part away for heat treatment bringing the part back to the shop for the operations including grinding is second nature to manufacturers and a standard way many parts are made however creep feed grinding can undo that sequence the workpiece could be heat treated first meaning the workpiece could be brought to its final hardness first before any machining is done creep feed grinding would eliminate the interruption delay and coordination necessary to ship a partially completed part away for this off site step matching the mrr of milling may be the benchmark enabling grinding to take on a larger role in production but reordering the steps needed in production may in some cases be where creep feed grinding realizes its greatest savings

further aligning our employees with the goal of creating shareholder value operating loss was 0 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 down from income of 1 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2020

conference id 2232968 for international callers use of non gaap financial measures this press release presents adjusted ebitda a non gaap financial measure used by management in analyzing the company s financial results and ongoing operational performance in order to better assess the company s financial results management believes that net income excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses and before interest income taxes stock based compensation depreciation and amortization changes in fair value of non marketable equity investments the de recognition of non cash expense resulting from the pto expense reduction in the first quarter of 2021 and the resolution of a mutual disagreement related to various elements of a past partnership which resulted in a reduction to cost of sales in the first quarter of 2020 adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company because adjusted ebitda reflects net income adjusted for certain gaap accounting non cash and non operating items which may not in any such case fully reflect the underlying operating performance of our business we also believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to many investors to assess the company s ongoing operating performance and to compare the company s operating performance between periods in addition beginning in 2021 executive bonuses are based on the achievement of adjusted ebitda targets as noted above the definition of adjusted ebitda includes an adjustment for the impact of the deferred revenue write downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses following the completion of any acquisition by the company the company must record the acquired deferred revenue at fair value as defined in gaap which may result in a write down of deferred revenue if the company is required to record a write down of deferred revenue it may result in lower recognized revenue operating income and net income in subsequent periods revenue for any such acquired business is deferred and is typically recognized over a one to two year period following the completion of any particular acquisition so our gaap revenues for this one to two year period will not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value management believes that including an adjustment in the definition of adjusted ebitda for the impact of the deferred write downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses provides useful information to investors because the deferred revenue write down recognized in periods after an acquisition may given the nature of this non cash accounting impact cause our gaap financial results during such periods to not fully reflect our underlying operating performance and thus adjusting for this amount may assist in comparing the company s results of operations between periods adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measures and should not be considered as measures of financial performance under gaap because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda is susceptible to varying calculations accordingly adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as an analytical tool this non gaap financial measure should not be considered a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance which are prepared in accordance with gaap investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to net income the most comparable gaap measure which is set forth below in this release about

scott morrison tells vladimir putin to stay out of ukraine as russian president rolls in the tanks as pm blasts his nonsense claims there are now thought to be 190 000 russian troops on the border of ukraine as tensions escalate russian president vladimir putin on monday night signed a decree recognising two regions as states he claimed move allows him to send russian troops into the regions as part of a peacekeeping process australian prime minister scott morrison said this was nonsense and urged mr putin to stay out of ukraine scott morrison has urged vladimir putin to withdraw his order to send troops into ukraine as europe teeters on the brink of the biggest war since 1945 the russian president on monday night signed a decree recognising two parts of ukraine controlled by pro russian fighters as sovereign states and ordered his forces to enter to keep the peace western allies fear this will pave the way for an invasion of ukraine which president putin described as ancient russian lands in a speech on monday speaking on the campaign trail in tasmania on tuesday morning mr morrison said the suggestion these troops would enter to keep peace was nonsense and told president putin to withdraw this handout video grab released by the russian defence ministry on february 21 2022 shows bombing during joint exercises of the armed forces of russia and belarus at a firing range near brest russian president vladimir putin signs a document recognising the independence of separatist regions in eastern ukraine in the kremlin in moscow russia on monday russia should step back it should unconditionally withdraw back behind its own borders and stop threatening its neighbours he said referring to russia s 2008 war with georgia he said we ve seen this behaviour before and seeking to take opportunity to threaten a neighbour for their own advantage is just simply not on is unacceptable it s unprovoked it s unwarranted and russia should understand that by seeking to invade another country that this cannot advantage them and it would seriously and significantly cost russia mr morrison said he hopes for a peaceful solution but warned that australia will support the west in imposing sanctions on russia i can assure you that the moment that other countries put in place strong and severe sanctions on russia we will be in lockstep with them he said mr putin has been building up troops on the ukrainian border since november he fears the pro european ukrainian government will join the anti russian alliance nato and wants to prevent this ukraine was part of the soviet union until its collapse in 1991 and mr putin describes it as historical russia the two separatists areas in eastern ukraine which have experienced fighting since 2014 are the donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic recognising the rebel regions independence effectively shatters the minsk peace agreements and opens the door for russia to sign treaties with the states and openly send troops and weapons there to defend them against ukrainian threats prime minister scott morrison during a visit to josef chromy wines in relbia tasmania on monday the move fuels further tension with the west and narrows the diplomatic options available to avoid war since it is an explicit rejection of a seven year old ceasefire mediated by france and germany still touted as the framework for any future negotiations on the wider crisis the kremlin said that upon hearing that putin will sign the order to recognise the independence of eastern ukraine s donetsk and luhansk regions french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor olaf scholz had expressed disappointment over the decision in phone calls with the russian president boris johnson said putin s decision to recognise the two separatist ukrainian republics was in breach of international law and an ill omen and dark sign that things are moving in the wrong while uk foreign secretary liz truss said the move would not go unpunished as she announced new sanctions on russia the uk prime minister will chair a cobra meeting on tuesday morning to discuss the latest developments in ukraine and agree on a significant package of sanctions on moscow the eu s top officials also said they will impose sanctions while the u s has ordered sanctions which will prohibit new investment trade and financing in the two separatist regions of ukraine recognised by putin nato chief jens stoltenberg also condemned mr putin accusing russia of trying to stage a pretext to invade ukraine yet again earlier mr putin vowed to decide today whether to recognise ukraine s eastern regions as independent states he made the remark at the end of an hours long security council meeting that was broadcast on russian tv during which the country s top security officials were called up one by one and asked to lay out the case for war seemingly aimed at persuading a sceptical public of the need to attack having spent days staging what are widely believed to be false flag attacks on ukrainian soil and blaming them on kiev ministers presented the evidence to putin today claiming russians in ukraine s donetsk and luhansk regions are under threat of genocide that no peace deal can save them and that he must intervene to save lives but in evidence that the entire spectacle was being staged with the west warning a decision to invade has already been made eagle eyed viewers noticed that defence minister sergei shoigu s watch was five hours behind moscow time suggesting the hearing was pre recorded all eyes will now turn to ukraine s border regions for evidence that russian troops have crossed after videos published earlier in the day showed tanks and armoured vehicles in battle formations some of them less than three miles from the frontier elsewhere today us officials warned russian battle plans call for overwhelming fire against ukraine that could cause tens of thousands of casualties within days of an invasion us also warned russia has prepared a hit list of people it wants to kill or send to detention camps if ukraine falls with dissidents journalists political figures ethnic minorities and lgbtq people all on the list fresh explosions were heard in ukraine s eastern regions with separatist leaders claiming a ukrainian citizen was killed and that kiev s troops had crossed the border in armoured vehicles russia claimed that a ukrainian shell hit its territory in the rostov on don region destroying an unoccupied guard post kiev has strongly denied shelling separatist or russian positions pro russian separatists said 60 000 people have now been evacuated from rebel held areas to russia air france announced it is halting all flights to and from kiev following similar move by germany s lufthansa vladimir putin today chaired a meeting of russia s full security council with top aides getting to their feet one by one to lay out the case for war in ukraine ukrainian servicemen are seen outside of svitlodarsk ukraine on february 21 putin addresses the nation as he recognised the independence of the donetsk and lugansk people s republics on monday pro russian separatists in ukraine celebrated on monday evening as fireworks went off following russian president vladimir putin signing a decree recognizing two eastern ukrainian regions as independent republics russian tanks russian support trucks russian terminator tanks armoured vehicles that are designed to support infantry units fighting in urban areas were spotted being transferred to the frontlines at the weekend russia used body parts from morgue to fake attacks in donbass ukraine today accused russia of taking corpses from morgues and using them in incidents of fake attacks blamed on kiev in one piece of footage pro moscow journalists reporting from a market in the donetsk region claimed a saboteur had attempted to plant a bomb there in the morning while people did their shopping reporters claimed the criminal had been blown up by security forces before showing images of body parts scattered around the road but kiev said the limbs had likely been taken from a local morgue and placed to appear as if an attack had taken place in an effort to justify russia marching troops into the region to protect locals we assume that they take corpses from morgues and blow them up for imitation said an official a second such incident was reported elsewhere in the donbass region as separatist channels reported that a miner had been killed in a blast advertisement dymtro kuleba ukraine s defence minister said after the council meeting that the entire world will watch what russia does next and that everyone realises the consequences if putin vows to recognise the breakaway regions we all should calmly focus on de escalation efforts no other way he tweeted it comes as two ukrainian soldiers died on monday and three were wounded in a shelling attack in zaitseve a village 18 miles north of the rebel stronghold donetsk ukraine s national police said german chancellor olaf scholz who had a phone call with putin on monday evening warned him that recognising the eastern regions would be a one sided breach of peace negotiations and that he has a responsibility to de escalate tensions by removing troops from the border meanwhile joe biden called ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and convened a meeting of his national security team after putin slammed the u s for colonizing ukraine and using it as a puppet regime in televised remarks before signing the decree putin told the public in a lengthy televised address on monday evening i believe it is necessary to take a long overdue decision to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic he was then shown signing mutual aid agreements with rebel leaders in the kremlin at the end of his lengthy speech putin asked russia s upper house of parliament the federation council to support this decision both russia s lower and upper houses of parliament are due to vote on the recognition on tuesday the russian leader also demanded that ukraine end military operations against pro moscow rebels in the eastern part of the country or face more possible bloodshed we demand an immediate end to military operations putin said accusing kyiv of trying to organise a blitzkrieg in east ukraine otherwise all responsibility for the possible continuation of bloodshed will be fully on the conscience of the regime in power in ukraine he added the west had repeatedly warned putin not to recognise ukraine s rebels a move that effectively buries a fragile peace agreement regulating the conflict putin spoke for over an hour in a speech heavy with historical references questioning ukraine s right to sovereignty and alleging the west had spent years cheating moscow modern ukraine was entirely and completely created by russia putin said appearing visibly angry putin said ukraine should be called ukraine of vladimir ilyich lenin saying it owes its creation to the russian revolutionary he also accused kiev of waging genocide in eastern ukraine and of preparing to get hold of a nuclear arsenal he said the west spat on russia s security concerns for years by moving nato eastwards and putting military infrastructure closer to russia s borders the russian leader said the west was trying to blackmail moscow regardless of the situation in ukraine there is only one aim to stop russia from developing and they will do it as they did before even without any formal pretext at all the longtime russian leader said uk joins biden and the eu in ordering sanctions against russia after breach of international law the uk is to join the us and the eu in imposing new sanctions on russia in response to their breach of international law and attack on ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity foreign secretary liz truss said on tuesday it comes as the ukraine crisis intensified after russian president vladimir putin said he would recognise two breakaway republics the decision to recognise donetsk and luhansk in eastern ukraine was an ill omen and a flagrant breach of international law boris johnson said in a press conference ms truss tweeted about the new sanctions on monday evening after saying mr putin s actions could not be allowed to go unpunished tomorrow we will be announcing new sanctions on russia in response to their breach of international law and attack on ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity she said earlier on monday the foreign secretary said the recognition of the donetsk people s republic and the luhansk people s republic as independent states demonstrates russia s decision to choose a path of confrontation over dialogue we will co ordinate our response with allies she said we will not allow russia s violation of its international commitments to go unpunished the move follows a decision by us president joe biden to immediately impose sanctions on the two breakaway regions in ukraine a move which was met with criticism for not being strong enough jim scuitto who served as chief of staff to the u s ambassador to china under obama said of the sanctions is this really it white house press secretary jen psaki assured in her monday statement that there will be further measures taken in coordination with u s allies and partners if russia further invades ukraine we are continuing to closely consult with allies and partners including ukraine on next steps and on russia s ongoing escalation along the border with ukraine she wrote the european union s top officials have also said the bloc will impose sanctions against russia eu commission president ursula von der leyen and council president charles michel say in a joint statement that the recognition is a blatant violation of international law the statement added that the bloc will react with sanctions and reiterates its unwavering support to ukraine s independence sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders advertisement in response ms truss said the uk will announce new sanctions on russia on tuesday in response to their breach of international law and attack on ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity meanwhile mr johnson will chair a cobra meeting at 6 30am uk time on tuesday morning to discuss the latest developments in ukraine a no 10 spokesperson said the spokesperson said the prime minister will chair a cobr cobra at 0630 tomorrow morning to discuss the latest developments in ukraine and to coordinate the uk response including agreeing a significant package of sanctions to be introduced immediately president biden has also ordered new sanctions after calling putin s announcement a blatant violation of russia s international commitments the sanctions will prohibit new investment trade and financing in the two separatist regions of ukraine recognized by putin the absence of sanctions directly on russia or putin was immediately met with backlash from those who said the biden administration isn t doing enough in response to the latest russian movements and announcements white house press secretary jen psaki assured that there will be further measures taken in coordination with u s allies and partners if russia invades ukraine we are continuing to closely consult with allies and partners including ukraine on next steps and on russia s ongoing escalation along the border with ukraine she wrote the european union s top officials have also said the bloc will impose sanctions against russia eu commission president ursula von der leyen and council president charles michel say in a joint statement that the recognition is a blatant violation of international law the statement adds that the bloc will react with sanctions and reiterates its unwavering support to ukraine s independence sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders responding to putin signing a decree formally recognising rebel held territories in eastern ukraine as independent states mr johnson told a press conference i gather that vladimir putin has effectively announced that russia is recognising the breakaway republics of donetsk and lugansk this is plainly in breach of international law it s a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of ukraine it is a repudiation of the minsk process and the minsk agreements and i think it s a very ill omen and a very dark sign and certainly does seem to me that it s certainly an indication yet another indication that things are moving in the wrong direction in ukraine the uk will continue to do everything we can to stand by the people of ukraine with a very robust package of sanctions as you know fortifying the eastern flank of nato in all the ways that we have but also being one of the few countries to have given the ukrainians the defensive weaponry that we think is appropriate to their needs and we will continue to to think about what more we can do to support ukraine in what is clearly a very very dark and difficult time mr johnson later told the ukrainian president that he believes a russian invasion is a real possibility in the coming hours and days a downing street spokesperson said prime minister boris johnson spoke to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy this evening to discuss the deteriorating situation in and around ukraine outlining his grave concern at recent developments in the region the prime minister told president zelenskyy that he believed an invasion was a real possibility in the coming hours and days the prime minister strongly condemned the kremlin s decision today to recognise luhansk and donetsk as independent states and said the move made the minsk agreements and process unworkable he added that the uk was already engaging with partners on the issue and said the uk would raise it at the united nations security council and organisation for security and co operation in europe in the coming days mr johnson also told president zelenskyy that he would explore sending further defensive support to ukraine at the request of the country s government a downing street spokesperson said he told president zelenskyy that the uk had already drawn up sanctions to target those complicit in the violation of ukraine s territorial integrity and that those measures would come into force tomorrow the prime minister also said he would explore sending further defensive support to ukraine at the request of the ukrainian government the leaders agreed that the west needed to support ukraine in the event of an invasion but should continue to pursue a diplomatic solution until the last possible second regardless of president putin s actions the uk would be steadfast in its full support of ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity the prime minister said waving russian flags people celebrated the latest announcement in the streets in donetsk ukraine on monday february 21 putin s recognition of the donetsk and luhansk rebel regions independence paves the way for the long feared russian invasion pro russian residents in donestk celebrated independence with a fireworks show on monday russian and belarus soldiers during joint exercises of the armed forces of russia and belarus in a handout video grab taken and released by the belarussian defence ministry on february 19 2022 u s army soldiers assigned to the 82nd airborne division deployed to poland to reassure nato allies and deter russian aggression encamp at an operating base 6km from the ukrainian border near przemysl poland february 21 what did vladimir putin say in his speech on donbass those who embarked on the path of violence bloodshed lawlessness did not recognize and do not recognize any other solution to the donbass issue except for the military one in this regard i consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the donetsk people s republic and the luhansk people s republic i ask the federal assembly of the russian federation to support this decision and then to ratify the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with individual republics these two documents will be prepared and signed in the very near future and from those who seized and hold power in kyiv we demand an immediate cessation of hostilities otherwise all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of ukraine announcing the decisions taken today i am confident in the support of the citizens of russia of all the patriotic forces of the country on ukraine membership of nato if ukraine was to join nato it would serve as a direct threat to the security of russia on origins of modern ukraine modern ukraine was entirely created by russia more precisely bolshevik communist russia this process began immediately after the revolution of 1917 as a result of bolshevik policy soviet ukraine arose which even today can with good reason be called vladimir ilyich lenin s ukraine he is its author and architect this is fully confirmed by archive documents and now grateful descendants have demolished monuments to lenin in ukraine this is what they call decommunisation do you want decommunisation well that suits us just fine but it is unnecessary as they say to stop halfway we are ready to show you what real decommunisation means for ukraine on ukrainian statehood ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood on break up of ussr russia assumed obligations to repay the entire soviet debt in return for the newly independent states giving up part of their foreign assets in 1994 such agreements were reached with ukraine but they were not ratified by ukraine ukraine preferred to act in such a way that in relations with russia they had all the rights and advantages but did not bear any obligations from the very first steps they began to build their statehood on the denial of everything that unites us they tried to distort the consciousness the historical memory of millions of people entire generations living in ukraine on nato s 2008 membership promise to ukraine and georgia many european allies of the united states already perfectly understood all the risks of such a prospect but were forced to come to terms with the will of their senior partner the americans simply used them to carry out a pronounced anti russian policy a number of member states of the alliance are still very skeptical about the appearance of ukraine in nato at the same time we are receiving a signal from some european capitals saying what are you worried about this will not happen literally tomorrow yes in fact our american partners are also talking about this well we answer if not tomorrow so the day after tomorrow what does this change in a historical perspective basically nothing moreover we know the position and words of the u s leadership that active hostilities in eastern ukraine do not exclude the possibility of this country joining nato if it can meet the criteria of the north atlantic alliance and defeat corruption at the same time they try to convince us over and over again that nato is a peace loving and purely defensive alliance saying that there are no threats to russia again they propose that we take them at their word but we know the real value of such words on threats to russia we clearly understand that under such a scenario the level of military threats to russia will dramatically increase many times over i pay special attention to the fact that the danger of a sudden strike against our country will increase many times over let me explain that u s strategic planning documents contain the possibility of a so called preemptive strike against enemy missile systems and who is the main enemy for the u s and nato we know that too it s russia in nato documents our country is officially and directly declared the main threat to north atlantic security and ukraine will serve as a forward springboard for the strike if our ancestors had heard about it they probably would simply not have believed it and today we don t want to believe it but it s true on sanctions they are trying to blackmail us again they are threatening us again with sanctions which by the way i think they will introduce anyway as russia s sovereignty strengthens and the power of our armed forces grows and a pretext for another sanctions attack will always be found or fabricated regardless of the situation in ukraine there is only one goal to restrain the development of russia and they will do it as they did before even without any formal pretext at all just because we exist and we will never compromise our sovereignty national interests and our values i want to say clearly and directly that in the current situation when our proposals for an equal dialogue on fundamental issues have actually remained unanswered by the united states and nato when the level of threats to our country is increasing significantly russia has every right to take retaliatory measures to ensure its own security that is exactly what we will do advertisement there are now thought to be 190 000 russian troops on the border of ukraine comprising around three quarters of its conventional forces backed by 500 fighter jets 50 heavy bombers and dozens of attack helicopters the kremlin denies it has plans to attack but western allies say putin is trying to concoct a pretext to invade by stirring up conflict in two breakaway eastern regions donetsk and luhansk and staging false flag attacks to justify marching his troops in on a mission to protect them should russia go ahead with its attack the us has warned the un security council that moscow has prepared a list of targets for assassination and imprisonment in detention camps officials say the list includes anyone who might oppose the kremlin including political figures journalists russian and belarusian dissidents sheltering in the country ethnic minorities and members of the lgbtq community as we ve seen in the past we expect russia will try to force cooperation through intimidation and repression a us official told foreign policy magazine on friday before a letter containing the allegations was sent to the us on monday these acts which in past russian operations have included targeted killings kidnappings forced disappearances detentions and the use of torture would likely target those who oppose russian actions includes russian and belarusian dissidents in exile in ukraine journalists and anti corruption activists and vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and lgbt persons kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov called the claims an absolute lie heavy shelling was reported along the frontline at the weekend leaving several ukrainian troops dead following what russian state media claimed were terror attacks targeting top officials and a gas pipeline in the two regions which the west said was staged fighting continued on monday with separatist commanders alleging that artillery had been fired into the donetsk region and struck a hospital with clashes reported near mariupol russia separately claimed that a ukrainian shell had blown up a guard post in rostov on don ukraine denies firing at either separatist or russian territory the kremlin has also been pushing claims that mass graves containing the bodies of civilians killed by ukrainian troops have been discovered in the region and today submitted documents containing those allegations to the un security council tens of of thousands of civilians mostly women children and the elderly have now being evacuated from rebel held areas into russia due to the threat fighting age men have been ordered to stay behind under the threat of legal sanctions if they try to leave in what appeared to be a last ditch diplomatic gambit brokered with the aid of french president emmanuel macron the white house said biden has agreed in principle to a meeting with putin as long as he holds off on launching an assault but the kremlin said no concrete plans had been made it is the second time that emmanuel macron who has tried to position himself as europe s top security negotiator has been embarrassed by moscow given guarantees which were revoked when he made them public two weeks ago he claimed putin had agreed to stop military drills on ukraine s border which russia immediately denied white house press secretary jen psaki said the administration has been clear that we are committed to pursuing diplomacy until the moment an invasion begins u s secretary of state antony blinken and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov are set to meet on thursday in europe as long as russia does not send its troops into ukraine beforehand we are always ready for diplomacy we are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should russia instead choose war psaki said in statement and currently russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full scale assault on ukraine very soon despite the threat life in the capital kiev outwardly continued as usual for many sunday with brunches and church services ahead of what biden said late last week was an already decided upon russian attack katerina spanchak who fled a region of eastern ukraine when it was taken over by russian allied separatists was among worshippers crowded into the capital s st michael s monastery smoky with the candles burned by the faithful to pray that ukraine be spared we all love life and we are all united by our love of life spanchak said pausing to compose herself we should appreciate it every day that s why i think everything will be fine our joint prayers will help to elude this tragedy which is advancing said another worshipper who identified himself only by his first name oleh a u s official said sunday that biden s assertion that putin has made the decision to roll russian forces into ukraine was based on intelligence that russian front line commanders have been given orders to begin final preparations for an attack the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sensitive intelligence the united states and many european countries have charged for weeks that putin has built up the forces he needs to invade ukraine a westward looking democracy that has sought to move out of russia s orbit and is now trying to create pretexts to invade western nations have threatened massive sanctions if putin does u s officials on sunday defended their decision to hold off on their planned financial punishments of russia ahead of any invasion after ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy called passionately saturday for the west to do more if you pull the trigger on that deterrent well then it doesn t exist anymore as a deterrent pentagon spokesman john kirby told fox on washington s sanctions threat russia held nuclear drills saturday as well as the conventional exercises in belarus and has ongoing naval drills off the coast in the black sea the announcement that russia was reversing its pledge to withdraw its forces from belarus came after two days of sustained shelling along a contact line between ukraine s soldiers and russian allied separatists in eastern ukraine an area that ukraine and the west worry could be the flashpoint in igniting conflict ukrainian tanks take part in training drills at an unknown location somewhere in ukraine in an image taken on sunday but released by the military on monday ukrainian soldiers and helicopters take part in military drills at an unspecified area somewhere in ukraine on sunday a ukrainian soldier aims his rifle during training exercises somewhere in the country which took place on sunday canadian military aid arrives at lviv airport in the west of ukraine late sunday as the west continues to supply the army with defensive weapons against a russian attack biden hits two pro russian regions in eastern ukraine with sanctions after putin declared them independent joe biden will issue sanctions on the two regions declared independent republics by russian president vladimir putin monday in his first real move toward full scale invasion the absence of sanctions directly on russia or putin was immediately met with backlash from those who said the administration isn t doing enough in response to the latest russian movements and announcements white house press secretary jen psaki assured that there will be further measures taken in coordination with u s allies and partners if russia further invades ukraine we are continuing to closely consult with allies and partners including ukraine on next steps and on russia s ongoing escalation along the border with ukraine she wrote biden almost immediately called ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky and convened a meeting of his national security team after vladimir putin slammed the u s for colonizing ukraine and using it as a puppet regime in remarks where he announced he would sign a decree recognizing two eastern regions of ukraine as independent states the president also hopped on a secure call with french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor olaf scholz shortly after putin s remarks we have anticipated a move like this from russia and are ready to respond immediately psaki wrote in her monday statement following putin s remarks president biden will soon issue an executive order that will prohibit new investment trade and financing by u s persons to from or in the so called dnr and lnr regions of ukraine she detailed adding the departments of state and treasury will have additional details shortly we will also soon announce additional measures related to today s blatant violation of russia s international commitments psaki added a bipartisan group of 21 lawmakers pledged on monday to work toward whatever emergency supplemental legislation will best support our nato allies and the people of ukraine no matter what happens in the coming days we must assure that the dictator putin and his corrupt oligarchs pay a devastating price for their decisions they wrote zelensky said he discussed with biden on monday afternoon the events of the last hours we begin the meeting of the national security and defense council he posted adding a conversation with boris johnson is also planned the white house confirmed that biden did have a roughly 35 minutes call with zelelnsky advertisement biden convened the national security council at the white house on russia s military buildup around ukraine white house officials released no immediate details of their roughly two hours of discussion we re talking about the potential for war in europe u s vice president kamala harris said earlier sunday at a security conference in munich germany that saw urgent consultations among world leaders on the crisis it s been over 70 years and through those 70 years there has been peace and security zelenskyy on sunday appealed on twitter for a cease fire russia has denied plans to invade but the kremlin did not respond to zelenskyy s offer saturday to meet with putin after a call with macron putin blamed ukraine incorrectly according to observers there for the escalation of shelling along the contact line and nato for pumping modern weapons and ammunition into ukraine macron a leader in european efforts to broker a peaceful resolution with russia also spoke separately to zelenskyy to british prime minister boris johnson and to biden blinken intentionally raised the prospect of a biden putin summit in interviews with u s television networks on sunday in a bid to keep diplomacy alive a senior u s official said the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss u s reasoning blinken said that biden was prepared to meet president putin at any time in any format if that can help prevent a war and the u s official said macron had then conveyed the offer of talks to putin conditioned on russia not invading in his phone calls with the russian leader tensions mounted further however the u s embassy in moscow issued an advisory urging greater caution by americans in russia overall have evacuation plans that do not rely on u s government assistance it warned immediate worries focused on eastern ukraine where ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14 000 people in the eastern ukraine regions of lugansk and donetsk separatist leaders have ordered a full military mobilization and sent more civilians to russia which has issued about 700 000 passports to residents of the rebel held territories claims that russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action officials in the separatist territories claimed ukrainian forces launched several artillery attacks over the past day and that two civilians were killed during an unsuccessful assault on a village near the russian border ukraine s military said two soldiers died in firing from the separatist side on saturday when tension is escalated to the maximum as it is now for example on the line of contact then any spark any unplanned incident or any minor planned provocation can lead to irreparable consequences putin s spokesman dmitry peskov said in an interview that aired sunday on russian state television on the front lines ukrainian soldiers said they were under orders not to return fire zahar leshushun peering into the distance with a periscope had followed the news all day from a trench where he is posted near the town of zolote right now we don t respond to their fire because the soldier said before the sound of an incoming shell interrupted him oh they are shooting at us now they are aiming at the command post russian attack helicopters are pictured taking part in joint drills in belarus on sunday as the kremlin announced the drills will not end as expected but will be extended to an unknown date meaning 30 000 troops remain in the country smoke rises into the air after russian attack helicopters blew up a target on a firing range in belarus during joint training exercises on sunday amid fears of an invasion tanks and armoured vehicles of the russian and belarusian militaries take part in training exercises at the weekend shortly before the kremlin announced the drill will be extended and its forces will remain in the country russian and belarussian machine gunners take part in joint training exercises in belarus at the weekend russian troop tents and

satellite image shows an overview of a new deployment east of valuyki russia on friday separatist officials announced the evacuation of civilians and military mobilization in the face of what they described as an imminent ukrainian offensive on the rebel regions ukrainian officials have strongly denied any plans to launch such an attack and described the evacuation order as part of russian provocations intended to set the stage for an invasion the separatist authorities said monday that at least four civilians were killed by ukrainian shelling over the past 24 hours and several others were injured ukraine s military said two ukrainian soldiers were killed over the weekend and another serviceman was wounded monday ukrainian military spokesman pavlo kovalchyuk said the ukrainian positions were shelled 80 times sunday and eight times early monday noting that the separatists were cynically firing from residential areas using civilians as shields he insisted that ukrainian forces weren t returning fire in the village of novognativka on the government controlled side 60 year old ekaterina evseeva said the shelling was worse than at the height of fighting early in the conflict it s worse than 2014 she said her voice trembling we are on the edge of nervous breakdowns and there is nowhere to run evseeva said that residents were hunkering down in basements amid the renewed fighting yesterday i saw my neighbor with her 2 month old as she was running to the basement it shouldn t be like this russian troops and tanks are spotted in a forest area near civilian buildings bottom left near belgorod just a short distance from the border with ukraine russian military vehicles are spotted formed up into a convoy and heading south next to a highway and near a

as these vehicles on farmland near soloti ukrainian troops near the frontlines with pro russian separatist forces train using a british nlaw anti tank missile launcher moscow denies any plans to invade ukraine but wants western guarantees that nato won t allow ukraine and other former soviet countries to join as members it also urges the alliance to halt weapons deployments to ukraine and roll back its forces from eastern europe demands flatly rejected by the west russian officials have shrugged off western calls to deescalate by pulling back troops arguing that moscow is free to deploy troops and conduct drills wherever it likes on its territory last week western officials dismissed russian statements about some of the troops returning to their bases saying that moscow was actually beefing up its forces around ukraine a u s official said sunday that biden s assertion last week that putin has made the decision to roll russian forces into ukraine was based on intelligence that russian front line commanders have been given orders to begin final preparations for an attack the official spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the sensitive intelligence russia also upped the ante saturday with sweeping nuclear drills that included multiple practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles that putin personally oversaw ukraine s president reaffirmed his call for a quick meeting with putin to help defuse tensions but there was no response from the kremlin the european union s top diplomat foreign policy chief josep borrell welcomed the prospect of a biden putin summit but said that should diplomacy fail the 27 nation bloc has finalized its package of sanctions for use if putin orders an invasion the work is done we are ready said borrell who is chairing a meeting of eu foreign ministers and was tasked with drawing up a list of people in russia to be hit with asset freezes and travel bans he provided no details about who might be targeted the european commission has prepared other sanctions to limit the access to financial markets for the russian economy and impose export controls that will stop the possibility for russia to modernize and diversify its economy its president ursula von der leyen said over the weekend advertisement german foreign minister annalena baerbock welcomed macron s summit initiative and warned russia against any false flag action to provoke hostilities i appeal urgently to the russian government to the russian president don t play with human lives she said as she arrived at the

this memorandum outlines key considerations for u s public companies in preparation for the 2022 annual reporting and proxy season part i of this memo which was published in january 2022 describes key considerations for annual reports on form 10 k including housekeeping items and our top eight disclosure considerations for form 10 ks in 2022 part ii of this memo below describes key considerations for 2022 annual meeting proxy statements part ii top 13 considerations for 2022 annual meeting proxy statements the following are key considerations for your upcoming annual meeting proxy statement 1 focus on board diversity disclosure the call for enhanced disclosure on board diversity has accelerated in recent months culminating in nasdaq s new board diversity rules nasdaq now requires its listed companies no later than august 8 2022 to provide detailed disclosure on board diversity using standardized templates 1 board diversity is also a key focus of proxy advisory firms and institutional investors companies should keep in mind the following when crafting and finalizing board diversity disclosure a pay attention to definitions of diversity to align with a wider range of diversity policies as companies seek to meet investor expectations on board diversity it is important to consider relevant definitions of diversity nasdaq iss blackrock vanguard and state street have different definitions of a diverse board member as shown in appendix a in particular iss and blackrock consider diversity to be broader and include more categories than nasdaq for example blackrock considers individuals with disabilities and veterans to be diverse while nasdaq does not as a result for a company to potentially increase the number of directors on its board that iss or institutional investors like blackrock consider to be diverse it should consider and if beneficial disclose information in accordance with a broader definition of diversity when including this expanded disclosure however nasdaq listed companies must still follow the prescribed nasdaq templates for the board diversity matrix2 and can only supplement their board diversity matrices with additional diversity categories below the board diversity matrix rather than within it for an example of an acceptable presentation of the nasdaq board diversity matrix supplemented with additional diversity categories see appendix b nasdaq listed companies must also follow additional requirements for their diversity disclosure for example the header for nasdaq s required matrix must state board diversity matrix and must disclose the date that the information was collected while nyse listed companies are not required to include a board diversity matrix in their proxy statements they should consider doing so given proxy advisory and institutional investor policies to the extent relevant in light of the companies shareholder base 3 nyse listed companies should also consider nasdaq templates as a point of reference even though they are not bound to following that form because of their prevalence in proxy statements this year b re visit sec guidance on board diversity the sec s rule on board diversity requires companies to disclose whether and if so how the nominating committee or the board considers diversity in identifying nominees for director in the past the sec staff has taken the broad view that if a company considers diversity in selecting its director nominees then essentially the company has adopted a diversity policy for purposes of the rule and as a result the company is required to disclose how it assesses the effectiveness of the policy and how it implements it 4 accordingly if a company includes disclosure that it considers diversity in selecting its director nominees this year it should also consider providing language on how it implements and assesses the effectiveness of its approach to board diversity c confirm board diversity information with directors as referenced in part i of our annual memo item 6 we recommended text for a question on diversity to add to d o questionnaires this year reviewing responses to this question is crucial to confirm information on your directors diversity characteristics and to obtain their consent to disclose this information in the company s proxy statement on an aggregate and anonymized basis if this question was not added before d o questionnaires were distributed a stand alone question distributed to directors will suffice see appendix c for our sample board diversity question d review board diversity disclosure with board members given that many companies will provide new or enhanced board diversity disclosure this year it is important to distribute the planned disclosure to the board well in advance of its publication and explain the rationale and approach to the disclosure 2 consider disclosure in a board skills matrix while neither nasdaq nor the nyse requires it in light of investor pressure and market trends towards increased disclosure of director qualifications companies should consider enhancing their board composition disclosures by providing a matrix summarizing the skills of their directors beginning in 2022 glass lewis may recommend voting against the chair of the nominating committee if a company has inadequate disclosure on board skills in addition glass lewis s reports for s p 500 companies include an assessment of company disclosure in the proxy statement relating to board diversity skills and the director nomination process 5 in drafting this disclosure companies should consider whether to disclose each individual director s skills or aggregated data and which skills to include in the matrix for example common skills include financial accounting industry knowledge compensation hr board governance experience and legal regulatory compliance experience and companies may find it helpful to review peer disclosures 3 focus in on board risk oversight disclosure the role of the board in overseeing the risk management for the entire enterprise has become a critical disclosure point item 407 h of regulation s k requires companies to disclose the board s role in the risk oversight of a company such as how the board administers its oversight function the sec has emphasized that companies should discuss how their boards oversee the management of material risks such as with respect to cybersecurity risks the sec has been particularly focused on cybersecurity in recent months with chairman gary gensler announcing that he has asked the sec staff to make recommendations relating to companies cybersecurity practices and cyber risk disclosures 6 moreover investors have increasingly scrutinized board risk oversight disclosure for descriptions of the board s oversight of environmental and social e s issues 7 such as oversight of the covid 19 pandemic and continued health and safety considerations including potential vaccine mandates and climate change and related disclosures proxy advisory firms are focused on board oversight of e s risks as well according to its 2022 updated proxy voting guidelines iss includes demonstrably poor risk oversight of issues including climate change in its list of material failures of governance stewardship risk oversight or fiduciary responsibilities at a company that will result in a recommendation of a vote against directors committee members or the entire board additionally glass lewis will note as a concern when boards of companies in the russell 1000 do not provide clear disclosure concerning the board level oversight afforded to e s issues and will generally recommend voting against the governance committee chair of an s p 500 company that fails to provide explicit disclosure concerning the board s role in overseeing these issues 8 similarly blackrock s 2022 voting guidelines note that if a board has failed to exercise sufficient oversight ith regard to material esg risk factors or where the company has failed to provide shareholders with adequate disclosure to conclude appropriate strategic consideration is given to these factors by the board it may vote against relevant directors 9 4 review board considerations for independence iss and glass lewis each have their own director independence criteria to the extent relevant to a company in light of its shareholder base these criteria generally should be assessed alongside the applicable nyse or nasdaq requirements to ensure shareholder support for the company s directors for a proxy statement s director independence section under item 407 a of regulation s k a company must identify each director who is independent under applicable nyse or nasdaq standards in addition under item 407 a 3 a company must describe in its proxy statement by specific category or type any transaction relationship or arrangement that was considered by the board of directors under the applicable independence standard in determining that a director is independent this disclosure requirement expressly requires companies to disclose transactions relationships or arrangements not disclosed as related party transactions under item 404 if they were considered by the board in finding a director to be independent for this disclosure companies should carefully i determine which transactions relationships and arrangements warrant consideration by their board in a particular director s independence determination and therefore require proxy disclosure and ii draft disclosure so as not to raise issues under the applicable proxy advisory firm s independence criteria 5 consider board overboarding policies given the increasingly strict overboarding policies of institutional investors it is crucial to monitor the number of outside public company directorships that each director holds for example blackrock reported that from july 1 2020 to june 30 2021 it voted against 163 directors at 149 companies on the basis of overboarding10 and glass lewis cited overboarding as one of the top reasons it recommends against a director three key tips on this first know your key investors policies a company should be aware of its investors policies with respect to overboarding and educate its board of directors on these policies see appendix d for an outline of these overboarding policies a company should be aware of its investors policies with respect to overboarding and educate its board of directors on these policies see for an outline of these overboarding policies second carefully draft your director biographies in the proxy statement ensure there is clear disclosure of outside public company directorships in proxy statements information on outside directorships is provided in the directors biographical section pursuant to item 401 e 2 of regulation s k which requires disclosure of directorships at other u s publicly traded companies to the extent a director at your company is serving on the board of either a private company or non profit company 11 there is no sec requirement to disclose this information 12 moreover if one of these other company directorships is voluntarily disclosed your proxy statement should clarify that the outside directorship is at a private company in order to avoid having that directorship inadvertently counted against the director under an overboarding policy consider disclosing extenuating circumstances for overboarding situations for some investors this additional explanation may be helpful if a director is overboarded for example vanguard s policy states that a fund might vote for an overboarded director if the director has publicly committed to stepping down from a directorship in order to fall within the thresholds 13 third consider your overboarding policies in governance guidelines lastly companies may want to consider enhancing their overboarding policies in their governance policies to align with their investors policies according to spencer stuart data company policies on limiting additional directorships at s p 500 companies in 2021 are trending in line with key institutional investor overboarding policies 14 6 consider human capital management disclosure in addition to required disclosures in the form 10 k many companies are including disclosures on human capital issues in their proxy statements and or on their websites and investors are increasingly looking for additional disclosures on this topic for example blackrock notes that a company s approach to human capital management is a critical factor in fostering an inclusive diverse and engaged workforce and called on companies to disclose their eeo 1 survey responses 15 similarly starting in 2022 state street will vote against the compensation committee chair at companies that do not disclose their eeo 1 survey responses companies are already required to collect this data and to the extent their investors request disclosure of this information they should consider disclosing it on their websites or sustainability reports 7 determine whether to hold a virtual meeting and if so provide relevant disclosures as a result of the pandemic the number of virtual meetings held by u s public companies has increased significantly according to data from broadridge 1 929 meetings were held online using their virtual shareholder meeting platform in 2021 compared to 1 494 in 2020 and 248 in 2019 16 mirroring this general trend 86 of s p 500 companies held virtual only annual meetings in 2021 compared to 78 in 2020 17 the sec s division of corporation finance recently updated its guidance on conducting shareholder meetings in light of covid 19 concerns to encourage companies to continue to provide shareholder proponents or their representatives with the ability to present their proposals through alternative means such as by phone during the 2022 proxy season companies opting to hold virtual only meetings should lock in their desired meeting date with service providers and consider their disclosure in light of proxy advisory firm policies in particular glass lewis expects robust disclosure in the proxy statement addressing the ability of shareholders to participate in the meeting including disclosure of shareholders ability to ask questions at the meeting procedures if any for posting appropriate questions received during the meeting and the company s answers on its public website and logistical details for meeting access and technical support 18 where such disclosure is not provided glass lewis may recommend against the chair of the governance committee 19 8 consider any updates to related person transaction rpt disclosure as discussed in our prior alert the nyse recently amended its related party transaction rule to require the audit committee or another independent committee to conduct a reasonable prior review and oversight of all rpts accordingly companies should 1 confirm that their rpt policies satisfy applicable requirements and also 2 consider any updates to their proxy statements to reflect rpt policy changes as we previously noted sec rules20 specifically allow a company to disclose that a policy permits the ratification of an rpt and further require a company to identify any rpt where a company did not follow its own policy including via ratification of such an rpt as a result some companies have adopted revisions to their rpt policies that generally require advance approval of all rpts while still allowing for the specific ratification of rpts in cases where advance approval is not reasonably feasible 9 assess esg disclosure in proxy statement both proxy advisory firms and institutional investors are focused on companies esg disclosures and the proxy statement has increasingly become the home for many such disclosures companies should consider the following when drafting their proxy statements this year a consider institutional investor policies with a growing number of institutional investors now demanding disclosure on esg topics these disclosures have increasingly become necessary by default for many public companies see appendix e for summaries of the policies of institutional investors on esg disclosure in addition iss 2022 policy updates introduce a board accountability policy for the world s highest greenhouse gas emitting companies which looks for both disclosure of climate related risks and specific emissions reductions targets further emphasizing the importance of esg disclosure even for companies that are not the current target of the iss policy 21 b consider both market norms and potential liability the proxy statement has increasingly become the home for esg disclosure in sec filings companies should weigh the appropriateness and benefits of enhancing their esg disclosures in proxy statements companies should note the enhanced liability implications of including disclosure in their proxy statements in addition to section 10 b and rule 10b 5 of the exchange act which are applicable to all public disclosures rule 14a 9 and section 18 of the exchange act impose heightened liability risks for false and misleading statements filed with the sec in proxy statements and annual reports respectively c consider potential sec comments sustainability disclosure on corporate websites can provide equally effective vehicles for this disclosure to investors however in its recent sample comment letter the sec pointed out that it may ask companies why information included in their voluntary sustainability reports is not also included in their sec filings 22 regardless of the ultimate approach taken the esg information that is disclosed in proxy statements should be checked for consistency with information disclosed elsewhere by a company including human capital disclosures in form 10 ks and voluntary sustainability reports on corporate websites moreover esg information that is disclosed in proxy statements should be vetted and reviewed by all appropriate parties and be subject to a company s disclosure controls and procedures 10 thoughtfully address say on pay vote failures or weak results in cd a during 2021 increased opposition to say on pay votes resulted in the highest number of say on pay vote failures in the last ten years a total of 63 russell 3000 companies including 18 s p 500 companies received less than 50 support for their say on pay votes in addition approximately 15 of russell 3000 companies say on pay proposals received less than 80 support the glass lewis threshold for an adequate say on pay vote and 6 8 received less than 70 support the iss adequacy threshold in many of these situations one time covid 19 related changes contributed to the opposition especially where executive pay increased or was protected or the company had other problematic pay practices 23 iss recommendations have a significant impact on vote results with results being on average 30 lower for companies that receive an iss against recommendation as a result receiving an against recommendation from iss will often result in a lost say on pay vote under iss standards for any company that either failed a say on pay vote or experienced weak results last year proxy advisory firms will expect compensation committees to demonstrate responsiveness to shareholder concerns developing an effective cd a to address the failure head on and regain shareholder support involves the following demonstrate an understanding of the drivers behind the failed vote carefully review iss and glass lewis reports and voting results and identify in the cd a the specific issues raised make it clear that the company heard the message and understands the concerns of shareholders carefully review iss and glass lewis reports and voting results and identify in the cd a the specific issues raised make it clear that the company heard the message and understands the concerns of shareholders describe the shareholder engagement process glass lewis expects robust disclosure of engagement activities and specific changes made in response to shareholder feedback in the absence of evidence that the board is actively engaging shareholders on these issues a company that previously failed say on pay may receive negative voting recommendations from iss and glass lewis against compensation committee members 25 describe in detail the company s engagement efforts e g percentage of total investors and or large investors contacted and the percentage of total investors and or large investors with whom the company spoke who participated in the discussions ideally this includes the compensation committee chair and the specific feedback received glass lewis expects robust disclosure of engagement activities and specific changes made in response to shareholder feedback in the absence of evidence that the board is actively engaging shareholders on these issues a company that previously failed say on pay may receive negative voting recommendations from iss and glass lewis against compensation committee members describe in detail the company s engagement efforts e g percentage of total investors and or large investors contacted and the percentage of total investors and or large investors with whom the company spoke who participated in the discussions ideally this includes the compensation committee chair and the specific feedback received avoid using covid 19 as a crutch in its updated faqs related to covid 19 pay decisions published in december 2021 iss cautioned companies that he surprise element of the pandemic in early 2020 is generally no longer applicable 26 so blaming the pandemic generally as an explanation for problematic pay practices will not be well received companies will need to clearly and thoughtfully explain why any pandemic related changes were necessary including the specific pandemic related challenges and how those challenges rendered the original program design obsolete or the original performance targets impossible to achieve in its updated faqs related to covid 19 pay decisions published in december 2021 iss cautioned companies that he surprise element of the pandemic in early 2020 is generally no longer applicable so blaming the pandemic generally as an explanation for problematic pay practices will not be well received companies will need to clearly and thoughtfully explain why any pandemic related changes were necessary including the specific pandemic related challenges and how those challenges rendered the original program design obsolete or the original performance targets impossible to achieve identify specific actions to address shareholder concerns whether the actions are modest such as adopting a no hedging or pledging policy or stock ownership guidelines middle of the road such as including in that same proxy statement more detailed disclosure of the performance metrics for a cash bonus plan or equity awards or removing single trigger vesting in equity awards or substantial such as a forward looking commitment to use more robust performance based compensation with more challenging performance targets or longer performance periods or return to performance based compensation following one time covid 19 changes explain the changes clearly and tie them directly to the feedback received in shareholder meetings use charts and graphics wherever possible to strengthen the narrative including a chart showing each concern and the company s actions in response the company should

review as of january 2021 iss proxy research department no longer provides draft voting recommendation reports to u s companies 27 including those in the s p 500 index however companies may pay iss s consulting department iss corporate solutions to prepare a written analysis of the possible voting recommendation from iss proxy research department on the say on pay proposal or at least potential problems it may raise based on iss publicly available policies companies should be aware that the iss corporate solutions team providing the analysis does not have influence over and may provide an analysis with a conclusion different from the ultimate voting recommendation that iss proxy research department gives to investors 11 scrutinize perquisites in light of recent sec enforcement actions and guidance the sec remains focused on perquisite disclosures and has brought at least six enforcement actions on perquisites involving findings of internal controls shortcomings in the last 18 months these included actions against a company that failed to track whether corporate jet flights were integrally and directly related to an executive s job functions28 a company that failed to appropriately apply the sec s rules to its system for identifying tracking and calculating perquisites including for hotel stays by executives29 and a company that failed to implement expense reimbursement policies and procedures 30 it is important that companies have robust controls to track perquisites and confirm based on the sec s framework that all perquisites are properly identified and disclosed under the sec s framework any personal benefit provided to an executive officer or director is a perquisite unless i it is integrally and directly related to the performance of his her duties to the company i e he she effectively could not do his her job without it ii it is available on a non discriminatory basis to all employees to whom it may be lawfully provided based on jurisdictionally recognized legal restrictions or iii the executive officer or director fully reimburses the company for it companies should also be particularly careful that any new or modified benefits offered to executive officers or directors because of the covid 19 pandemic are appropriately considered and disclosed if necessary in september 2020 the sec issued guidance emphasizing that during the pandemic the above described analysis continues to apply when determining whether an item is a perquisite and that the determination of whether the personal benefit is integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive officer or director s duties i e whether he she could effectively not do his her job without it should be assessed in light of remote working arrangements during covid 19 31 the sec has pledged to continue to focus on whether companies are fully disclosing compensation paid to their top executives and have appropriate internal controls in place to ensure that shareholders receive information to which they are entitled 32 and the sec s division of enforcement is scrutinizing perquisite disclosure using risk based data analytics to uncover potential violations 12 update your pay ratio disclosure the 2022 proxy season will be the fifth year for mandatory pay ratio disclosure the pay ratio rule permits a company to identify its median employee once every three years as long as the company reasonably believes there has not been a change in its employee population or compensation arrangements that would significantly affect its pay ratio disclosure companies should continue to assess whether they need to select a new median employee due to significant changes in their employee population or compensation arrangements as a result of covid 19 or other events 13 last but not least confirm proxy housekeeping items are complete including these four items a confirm sufficient shares available for grants under equity compensation plans confirm as early as possible that no additional shares are required for future grants under an equity compensation plan a company should confirm both the number of existing shares still available for grant as well as its plans for future equity grants adding shares to a plan can be a straightforward exercise when planned in advance but it also involves many to do items including for example updating the equity compensation plan itself carefully form checking the equity plan proposal against the technical requirements of item 10 of schedule 14a which has been a hot bed target for litigants considering iss and glass lewis policies to determine whether they will support the proposal and drafting disclosure to obtain their support drafting a form s 8 and updated equity plan prospectus showing the new number of shares which may need to be updated for new tax disclosures if applicable tax laws have changed and in the case of nyse listed companies drafting and having the nyse clear a supplemental listing application to list the additional shares b get your voting standards correct once an annual meeting agenda is finalized confirm your proxy statement disclosure on the voting standards that will apply to each agenda item as well as how broker non votes and abstentions will be treated getting this correct means considering the applicability of state law your certificate of incorporation bylaws and stock exchange requirements for each proposal as we reported in our prior alert as a result of an amendment to nyse rules this is the first proxy season that proposals subject to nyse rules e g the approval of an equity plan will no longer require any special treatment for abstentions consistent with nasdaq s approach the nyse now defers to a company s governing documents and applicable state law for the treatment of abstentions with such proposals c confirm any disclosure on section 16 delinquencies companies should review their prior section 16 reports and identify any reports that were not filed on a timely basis for each such late report a company will need to disclose the section 16 insider who filed late the number of late reports and transactions that were not reported on a timely basis and any known failure to file a form d confirm your notice complies with applicable state law companies should review their notice for their annual meeting at the beginning of their proxy statements in order to confirm it includes the information required by applicable state law for delaware corporations written notice under delaware general corporate law dgcl section 222 must include the date time and place if any for the meeting the means of remote communications if any by which stockholders may be deemed to be present and vote at the meeting and the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting in addition section 219 of the dgcl requires that if a stockholder meeting is to be held by means of remote communication a company must include in its notice i the specific means of accessing during the meeting the list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting 33 and ii if the company plans to host the stockholder list for the required 10 day period prior to the meeting virtually rather than at its principal place of business the information required to gain access to such list 34 1

moscow russian president vladimir putin recognized two breakaway regions in eastern ukraine as independent on monday and ordered the russian army to launch what moscow called a peacekeeping operation into the area accelerating a crisis the west fears could unleash a major war putin told russia s defense ministry to deploy troops into the two regions to keep the peace in a decree issued shortly after announcing recognition for russian backed separatists there drawing u s and european condemnation and vows of new sanctions it was not immediately clear whether the russian military action would be regarded by the west as the start of an invasion of ukraine that the united states and its allies have warned about for weeks since the area was already controlled by russian backed separatists and moscow in practice there was no word on the size of the force putin was dispatching but the decree said russia now had the right to build military bases in the breakaway regions and that troops mission would be to uphold the peace in a lengthy televised address packed with grievances against the west putin looking visibly angry described ukraine as an integral part of russia s history and said eastern ukraine was ancient russian lands and that he was confident the russian people would support his decision advertisement russian president vladimir putin delivers a video address monday feb 21 2022 to the nation from moscow following the initiative of the country s lower house of parliament and security council to recognise two russian backed breakaway regions in eastern ukraine as independent entities sputnik alexey nikolsky kremlin via reuters russian state television showed putin joined by russia backed separatist leaders signing a decree recognizing the independence of the two ukrainian breakaway regions the self proclaimed donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic along with agreements on cooperation and friendship defying western warnings against such a move putin had announced his decision in phone calls to the leaders of germany and france earlier both of whom voiced disappointment the kremlin said moscow s action may well torpedo a last minute bid for a summit with u s president joe biden to prevent russia from invading ukraine the rouble extended its losses as putin spoke at one point sliding beyond 80 per dollar pro russian activists react on a street as fireworks explode in the sky monday after russian president vladimir putin signed a decree recognising two russian backed breakaway regions in eastern ukraine as independent entities in the separatist controlled city of donetsk ukraine reuters alexander ermochenko biden will issue an executive order soon prohibiting new investment trade and financing by u s persons to from or in the two breakaway regions the white house said it will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of ukraine white house spokesperson jen psaki said in a statement psaki said measures being rolled out in response to putin s decree were separate from sanctions the united states and its allies have been readying if russia invades ukraine u s secretary of state antony blinken said the executive order is designed to prevent russia from profiting off of this blatant violation of international law the u n security council was scheduled to meet monday night a russian diplomat said following a request by the united states the united kingdom and france dutch prime minister mark rutte said european union countries have agreed to impose a limited set of sanctions targeting those who are responsible for russia s recognition of the rebel regions advertisement british foreign minister liz truss said in a twitter post that on tuesday the government will announce new sanctions on russia in response to putin s decision nato secretary general jens stoltenberg accused russia of continuing to fuel the conflict in eastern ukraine and trying to stage a pretext for a further invasion russia annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014 in his address putin delved into history as far back as the ottoman empire and as recent as the tensions over nato s eastward expansion a major irritant for moscow in the present crisis with his decision putin brushed off western warnings that such a step would be illegal kill off peace negotiations and trigger sanctions i deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic putin said he said earlier that if ukraine was to join nato it would serve as a direct threat to the security of russia sanctions threat putin has for years worked to restore russia s influence over nations that emerged after the collapse of the soviet union with ukraine holding an important place in his ambitions russia denies any plan to attack its neighbor but it has threatened unspecified military technical action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees including a promise that ukraine will never join nato advertisement but recognition of the separatist held areas paved the way for putin to send military forces there arguing that he was intervening as an ally to protect separatists against ukrainian forces putin s move will narrow the diplomatic options to avoid war since it is an explicit rejection of a seven year old ceasefire mediated by france and germany touted as the framework for future negotiations on the wider crisis separately moscow said ukrainian military saboteurs had tried to enter russian territory in armed vehicles leading to five deaths an accusation dismissed as fake news by kyiv both developments fit a pattern repeatedly predicted by western governments who accuse russia of preparing to fabricate a pretext to invade by blaming kyiv for attacks and relying on pleas for help from separatist proxies moscow has said repeatedly it has no such plans service members of the ukrainian armed forces examine an area near the village of memryk in the donetsk region on monday feb 21 2022 which the military said recently came under shelling maksim levin reuters hours earlier french president emmanuel macron gave hope of a diplomatic solution saying putin and biden had agreed in principle to meet but the kremlin said there were no specific plans for a summit the white house said biden had accepted the meeting in principle but only if an invasion hasn t happened washington says russia has massed a force numbering 169 000 190 000 troops in the region including the separatists in the breakaway regions and could invade within days advertisement european financial markets tumbled at the signs of increased confrontation after having briefly edged higher on the glimmer of hope that a summit might offer a path out of europe s biggest military crisis in decades the price of oil russia s main export rose while russian shares and the rouble plunged

for certain non recurring items that the company doesn t believe directly reflect its core operations and may not be indicative of ongoing business operations adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pro forma net income by the weighted average shares of class a common stock outstanding assuming the full exchange of all outstanding units of solaris llc solaris llc units after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding equity based awards when used in conjunction with gaap financial measures adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that the company believes are useful measures to evaluate performance period over period and relative to its competitors by assuming the full exchange of all outstanding solaris llc units the company believes these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies that have different organizational and tax structures as well as comparisons period over period because it eliminates the effect of any changes in net income attributable to solaris as a result of increases in its ownership of solaris llc which are unrelated to the company s operating performance and excludes items that are non recurring or may not be indicative of ongoing operating performance adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation presentation of adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share should not be considered alternatives to net income and earnings per share as determined under gaap while these measures are useful in evaluating the company s performance it does not account for the earnings attributable to the non controlling interest holders and therefore does not provide a complete understanding of the net income attributable to solaris adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share should be evaluated in conjunction with gaap financial results a

the united states on monday feb 21 announced financial sanctions against rebel territories freshly recognized by russia in eastern ukraine and warned that more were ready if necessary president joe biden will issue an executive order to prohibit new investment trade and financing by us persons to from or in the so called dnr and lnr regions of ukraine white house press secretary jen psaki said referring to the breakaway regions of donetsk and lugansk the order will provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of ukraine psaki said adding that the measures are separate to wider western sanctions ready to go should russia further invade ukraine the two self proclaimed republics already have extremely limited dealings with us citizens however the sanctions herald a new phase in what could soon become the most dangerous east west confrontation since the collapse of the soviet union biden has led a coalition of european and other us allies to craft a package of what they say will be crippling economic sanctions on russia should troops massing on ukraine s borders start an attack while the kremlin has for weeks denied invasion plans it has at the same time built up an enormous force of troops and heavy weaponry on three sides of ukraine putin s speech monday in which he declared recognition for independence of the two rebel areas appeared to raise the chances of invasion he charged ukraine with being a western puppet a threat to russian security and claimed that people in the russian controlled separatist enclaves needed protection moscow has for years been giving the separatist rebels covert financial political and military backing key questions now will be whether russian troops will openly roll across the border to defend the two entities and if so whether they will stop at the current frontline in fighting between the separatists and ukraine s government or push further into ukrainian territory the extent of a russian offensive would determine the level of western sanctions on friday the deputy us national security advisor for international economics daleep singh warned that sanctions would turn russia into an international pariah it will become isolated from global financial markets and be deprived of the most sophisticated technological inputs he predicted intense capital outflows mounting pressure on its currency surging inflation higher borrowing costs economic contraction and the erosion of its productive capacity singh said the western financial sanctions and export controls are embedded in a broader strategy that would undercut putin s aspirations to project power and exert influence on the world stage immediately after putin s speech the white house said that biden talked by phone with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky for 35 minutes he also spoke for half an hour with two key european allies french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor olaf scholz an official said the white house did not respond immediately to questions about whether there was still any consideration being given to a suggested summit between biden and putin agence france presse agence france presse

arrhythmia management company focused on improving the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias acutus medical s primary product is its acqmap imaging and mapping system which consists of a console workstation proprietary software algorithms and a single use catheter that contains ultrasound transducers and electrodes which collect the data required to create a comprehensive map of a patient s cardiac anatomy and electrical propagation pathways and patterns to gain a market foothold acutus medical initially lent its first generation acqmap console and workstation to users free of charge to facilitate the sale of its disposable products in late 2019 acutus medical began to install its second generation acqmap console and workstation products with potential purchasers under evaluation arrangements the acutus medical class action lawsuit alleges that throughout the class period acutus medical made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that i a material percentage of the acqmap systems under evaluation had been randomly installed at sites with little if any consideration given to whether the healthcare providers at the selected locations were likely to adopt or desire acutus medical s products ii a material percentage of the acqmap systems under evaluation had been installed in locations where acutus medical did not possess the infrastructure necessary to appropriately educate train and support medical service providers on the system s operations iii as a result acutus medical was in the process of designing a strategic plan to terminate and relocate approximately 20 of then existing acqmap systems evaluation arrangements iv acutus medical s management discussion and analysis was materially false and misleading and failed to disclose that the termination and relocation of approximately 20 of existing acqmap systems evaluation arrangements was reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on acutus medical s 2021 financial results and v acutus medical s risk factor discussions were materially false and misleading and made reference to potential risks without disclosing that such risks were then existing or adequately describing the specific nature of the risks then facing acutus medical on november 11 2021 acutus medical announced that it had slashed its 2021 revenue guidance due in part to a strategic decision by acutus medical during the third quarter of 2021 to relocate approximately 20 of acqmap systems installations under then existing evaluation arrangements to address meaningfully lower than expected product adoption further contrary to acutus medical s representations during the class period acutus medical revealed that acutus medical needed to relocate acqmap systems that had been placed in improper locations thereby negatively impacting customer uptake on this news the price of acutus medical common stock plummeted more than 45 in a single day damaging investors the lead plaintiff

and the asia dow such is the sensitivity on the financial markets right now temporary confidence can evaporate rapidly and that s what we ve seen today after what appears to be another deterioration in relations between russia and western powers wrote susannah streeter senior investment and markets analyst for u k based financial services firm hargreaves lansdown in an email insights not every currency can be a stablecoin stablecoins have been the best thing ever for the hegemony of the dollar as the digitization of fiat currency into tokens overwhelmingly favors the greenback but as crypto is naturally home to dollar skeptics certainly there must be a move to create stablecoins with alternative denominations there s a version of tether denominated in euros and there are stablecoin projects denominated in singapore s dollar and indonesia s rupiah but these are three of the hundreds of currencies out there certainly there s a demand for more right the problem is that many smaller economies aren t a huge fan of the internationalization of their currency and ceding control there aren t the right ingredients for a locally denominated stablecoin to take off in those countries consider taiwan over the weekend leo seewald the former head of blackrock taiwan and now a director at taipei based exchange maicoin discussed its new taiwan dollar twd stablecoin the project s webpage cites reducing the capital cost of local and cross border transactions without intermediary as a benefit of the project but that goes against a pillar of taiwan s central bank s monetary policy taiwan has strict capital controls on its currency exporting taiwan dollars is strictly forbidden with few exceptions the central bank doesn t want the taiwan dollar to be used offshore as the country s arch rival china could use an offshore twd as a weapon by market making an unofficial exchange rate through buying and dumping the currency at a disadvantageous price the central bank is also not a big fan of the taiwan dollar being used to settle transactions that don t have a direct nexus to taiwan something a stablecoin is specifically designed to do last year it handed down significant fines against deutsche bank ing and anz for letting commodity traders price grain contracts between brazil india and other third countries in twd despite the deal having no nexus to taiwan in theory this won t work because the currency can t be exported off island but the banks used a synthetic proxy for the twd a forex instrument called a non deliverable forward to get around this and then there s the export market as an economy heavily reliant on exports it d really sting if the local currency began to appreciate given the importance of taiwan s semiconductors and the government s usually balanced budgets one would think the twd would be headed towards the stratosphere not so because of regular interventions in the fx market by the central bank to control the appreciation of the twd very slow and steady wins the race the bank believes the mother of all ironies is that taiwan is deemed to be more of a currency manipulator than china because of lack of transparency on the issue everyone knows that the rmb is pegged and only trades within a specific band just don t call taiwan a currency manipulator or say they have capital controls that gets central bankers and the diplomatic corps mad in 2011 the governor of taiwan s central bank scolded reporters when addressed with the question foreign investors can buy equities and move all the foreign currency they want through taiwan he said just don t touch our precious twd stablecoins can throw a wrench in all of this a carefully managed currency from an export driven economy with a geopolitical foe next door isn t the best candidate to be deployed to the free for all that is the crypto market pricing crypto contracts in twd or having it be used as a medium of settlement via digital asset on ramps or off ramps is going to blow away all the tenants of the central bank s decades of policies and punishments the international grain market has nothing on crypto for volatility singapore isn t a huge fan of the internationalization of its currency either as singapore is a largely importing nation given its lack of natural resources it strives for exchange rate stability and doesn t want international deals with no nexus to the country priced in its currency denominate that in usd please but for stablecoins to get on the radar of these respective banks they need to be bigger first a lot bigger currently the twdc has minted 7 8 million taiwan dollars of its tokens or around 283 000 singapore s xsgd is further along with a market cap of 185 million far from enough to complement the currency the kind that bloomberg s mike mcglone argues tether is to the dollar but also far from enough to be the threat to the economy that the white house claims stablecoins are asia is going to be trading in usd

the growth catalysts for these hot stocks right now are too big to ignore volatility in the stock markets like the kind we re witnessing lately can make investors edgy but such times also generate golden opportunities to invest money and buy stocks if you can spot stocks with definite growth catalysts today and add them to your portfolio you could eventually build solid wealth over time if you have say 25 000 on you right now that you won t need in the near future consider these five stocks to make that money work for you the stock many dumped for no reason upstart holdings upst 7 89 shares were battered when growth stocks crashed toward the end of 2021 but with the company s fundamentals intact i believed it was only a matter of time before upstart stock rebounded the company s just released fourth quarter numbers could well be the inflection point investors have waited for upstart s numbers reveal how more and more banks and borrowers are flocking to the cloud based artificial intelligence driven lending platform for loans in its fourth quarter upstart s revenue surged 240 year over year as its partner banks originated loans worth 4 1 billion now you might say that percentage figure is not a fair reflection of upstart s growth as 2020 was a challenging year but consider that upstart s sequential revenue also grew a solid 252 in q4 and that its outlook points at a trend that s here to last to put some numbers to that upstart expects to grow revenue by 65 in 2022 and foresees auto loan transactions worth 1 5 billion on its platform this year that s a really impressive number given that the company has only just entered the u s auto loan market it s a multibillion market though and upstart also plans to enter newer markets after personal and auto loans the opportunities are huge and if upstart can deliver your money on the stock could grow manifold with risks comes returns paypal holdings pypl 1 67 stock was already on soft ground when a disappointing outlook from the fintech giant in mid february pushed the stock even farther down the cliff yet while paypal s challenges have been baked into its stock price the market is turning a blind eye to its growth opportunities for example paypal is all set to integrate its money sharing app venmo with amazon amzn 1 35 which should boost venmo s total payment volume tpv over time for perspective venmo s tpv grew 44 to nearly 230 billion in 2021 overall paypal s tpv hit 1 25 trillion in 2021 and is expected to touch 1 5 trillion in 2022 which could boost revenue by at least 15 that means paypal s revenue could cross 30 billion in 2022 20 of which will likely be converted into free cash flow fcf the double digit revenue growth and the strong cash flow generation especially in an industry where several players are not even profitable yet are surefire green flags for any investor weighing whether a stock is worth their money paypal in fact looks poised to grow earnings by double digits for years to come and that itself should help drive the stock price higher multiply your money with this dividend growth stock nextera energy nee 0 52 is the kind of stock you d want to buy and forget the renewable energy stock has dropped sharply this year but if you believe that clean energy is the future of energy now s the time to buy nextera energy stock for starters nextera announced a 10 dividend increase on feb 18 in line with the dividend growth goal it set out in 2020 more importantly nextera energy now expects to grow annual dividend by around 10 through 2024 that not only reflects the company s confidence in its growth but also management s commitment to shareholders both of which can play a huge role in the kind of returns the stock can generate over time we ve seen that happen wit nextera energy stock over the years nextera energy s existing assets which include the largest regulated utility in the u s and the world s largest wind and solar company are on solid footing its pipeline meanwhile continues to grow nextera energy s renewables arm expects to build anything between 23 and 30 gigawatts of capacity between 2021 and 2024 as the world scrambles to decarbonize that s huge and it should ensure steady growth in the company s earnings cash flows and dividends for years to come which should eventually reflect in the stock price returns electric vehicles are set to rule the roads ford f 3 01 stock stunned the markets in 2021 when it more than doubled but this could just be the beginning for he company that s making big moves in the red hot electric vehicle ev space while its flagship f 150 pickup truck continues to outsell in america 2022 is in fact a crucial year for ford as it starts deliveries of the all electric version of its f 150 pickup the f 150 lightning within months of launch ford secured more than 200 000 preorders for the f 150 lightning even compelling management management to stop accepting more orders by the time 2021 ended the legacy automaker is now aggressively ramping production capacity to meet demand in between ford has just started shipping its all electric van the e transit ford s first ev the mustang mach e is already raking in solid sales with such an impressive ev lineup and ford s strong outlook for revenue and fcf for 2022 there s little that could stop this auto stock from rallying higher ford also reinstated its dividend recently which further reflects management s confidence in the company s prospects the market is underappreciating this megatrend shopify shop 2 04 saw its business boom over the past couple of years or so as covid 19 mandates forced people to stay indoors and rely on e commerce for most of their needs shopify on its part doesn t just help small businesses set up virtual stores but also offers entrepreneurs an outlet to reach their products and services to the world e commerce in fact is a megatrend and shopify s growing merchant base that runs into millions now evidences its popularity in its just released earnings report shopify reported a 57 jump in 2021 revenue to 4 6 billion as the company added several partners to offer its merchants better facilities and continued to roll out new products such as a money management product the market fears shopify may not grow as much anymore as the restrictions under the pandemic ease which explains why the stock has crashed in recent weeks yet shopify should still be able to grow revenue by double digits percentages and likely even outpace average industry growth in which case the stock could eventually prove be a big winner if bought around the current price

kremlin says no concrete plans for summit with biden over ukraine the kremlin on monday said there were no concrete plans for a summit over ukraine between russian president vladimir putin and his u s counterpart joe biden after the french president said the two leaders had agreed a meeting in principle a summit might offer a possible path out of europe s biggest military crisis in decades and financial markets edged higher on the glimmer of hope for a diplomatic solution however both washington and moscow played down hopes of a breakthrough and satellite imagery appeared to show russian deployments closer to ukraine s border than before western countries accuse russia of planning an invasion of its neighbour moscow denies planning any attack but has demanded security guarantees including a promise that ukraine would never join nato nerves were further frayed when the belarusian defence ministry announced on sunday that russia would extend military drills in belarus that had been due to end russia has tens of thousands of troops there north of the ukrainian border kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov told reporters that a phone call or meeting between putin and biden could be set up at any time but there were no concrete plans yet for a summit tensions were growing but diplomatic contacts were active and a meeting of foreign ministers was possible this week he also said putin would imminently address an extraordinary session of russia s security council the white house said in a statement that biden had accepted the meeting in principle but only if an invasion hasn t happened we are always ready for diplomacy white house press secretary jen psaki said we are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should russia instead choose war western countries are preparing sanctions they say would be far reaching against russian companies and individuals in the event that russia invades including steps to bar u s financial institutions from processing transactions for major russian banks people familiar with the matter said ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba arriving in brussels to meet his european union counterparts urged the bloc to start imposing some sanctions on russia now to show it was serious about wanting to prevent a war the west has so far rebuffed kyiv s calls to impose tighter sanctions now arguing that to work as a deterrent they must be saved as a potential punishment if russia invades eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said he still saw room for diplomacy but would convene an extraordinary eu meeting to agree sanctions when the moment comes u s stock index futures rallied on prospects for further diplomacy the euro rose and stocks steadied around the world french president emmanuel macron s office said in a statement that he had pitched a summit on security and strategic stability in europe to both leaders summit plans unclear macron s office and the white house said the substance of the plan would be worked out by u s secretary of state antony blinken and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov during a meeting planned for feb 24 french foreign minister jean yves le drian said on twitter that he would hold talks with lavrov later on monday ukraine welcomed a possible summit between but said it must be included in any decisions aimed at resolving the crisis no one can resolve our issue without us ukraine s top security official oleksiy danilov told a briefing everything should happen with our participation macron s announcement followed a volley of phone calls between macron biden putin zelenskiy and british prime minister boris johnson u s based satellite imagery company maxar on sunday reported multiple new deployments of russian military units in forests farms and industrial areas as little as 15 km 9 miles from the border with ukraine blinken said the extension of the exercises in belarus made him more worried that russia was on the brink of an attack in a letter to u n human rights chief michelle bachelet seen by reuters the united states said an invasion could create a human rights catastrophe and might include rounding up and killing opponents washington has also repeatedly raised concerns that russia could manufacture a pretext for an invasion with a so called false flag attack designed to look as if it had been carried out by ukraine russia accuses the west of hysteria sporadic shelling across the line dividing ukrainian government forces and pro russian separatists in the east has intensified since thursday with both sides trading blame the separatists have been busing out civilians accusing kyiv of planning an attack ukraine and the west view the rebels as russian proxies escalating to provide moscow with a justification to invade sounds of fighting were heard again on monday including a blast in the centre of the separatist held city of donetsk the cause could not be determined russia s fsb intelligence service said a shell fired from ukrainian territory had hit a russian border guard post in the city of rostov but that no one had been hurt the rebels said two civilians were killed in shelling by kyiv government forces russia s ria news agency said russian media reported 61 000 evacuees from east ukraine had crossed into russia kyiv denies firing on civilians or across the border into russia washington says accusations that kyiv would intentionally escalate the conflict are absurd at a time when russia has massed troops on the border source reuters reporting by reuters bureaux writing by kevin liffey editing by peter graff

moscow russian president vladimir putin ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern ukraine after recognising them as independent on monday accelerating a crisis the west fears could unleash a major war a reuters witness saw unusually large columns of military hardware moving through the breakaway city of donetsk after putin told russia s defence ministry to send forces into the two regions to keep the peace in a decree issued shortly after announcing recognition for russian backed separatists there the moves drew u s and european condemnation and vows of new sanctions although it was not immediately clear whether the russian military action would be regarded by the west as the start of a fullscale invasion the area was already controlled by russian backed separatists and moscow in practice there was no word on the size of the force putin was dispatching but the decree said russia now had the right to build military bases in the breakaway regions and that the troops mission would a peacekeeping operation in a lengthy televised address packed with grievances against the west putin looking visibly angry described ukraine as an integral part of russia s history and said eastern ukraine was ancient russian lands and that he was confident the russian people would support his decision russian state television showed putin joined by russia backed separatist leaders signing a decree recognising the independence of the two ukrainian breakaway regions the self proclaimed donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic along with agreements on cooperation and friendship defying western warnings against such a move putin had announced his decision in phone calls to the leaders of germany and france earlier both of whom voiced disappointment the kremlin said moscow s action may well torpedo a last minute bid for a summit with u s president joe biden to prevent russia from invading ukraine the rouble extended its losses as putin spoke at one point sliding beyond 80 per dollar biden responded by signing an executive order for a halt to all u s economic activity in the breakaway regions and a ban on import of all goods from those areas as well as investment there white house spokesperson jen psaki said the measures being rolled out in response to putin s decree were separate from sanctions the united states and its allies have been readying if russia invades ukraine u s secretary of state antony blinken said the executive order is designed to prevent russia from profiting off of this blatant violation of international law the u n security council will meet publicly on ukraine at 9 p m est monday 0200 gmt on tuesday a russian diplomat said following a request by the united states britain and france dutch prime minister mark rutte said european union countries have agreed to impose a limited set of sanctions targeting those who are responsible for russia s recognition of the rebel regions and british foreign minister liz truss said the government would announce new sanctions on tuesday nato secretary general jens stoltenberg accused russia of trying to stage a pretext for a further invasion russia annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014 in his address putin delved into history as far back as the ottoman empire and as recent as the tensions over nato s eastward expansion his demands that ukraine drop its long term goal of joining the atlantic military alliance have been repeatedly rebuffed by kyiv and nato states with his decision to recognise the breakaway regions putin brushed off western warnings i deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic putin said he said earlier that if ukraine was to join nato it would serve as a direct threat to the security of russia sanctions threat putin has for years worked to restore russia s influence over nations that emerged after the collapse of the soviet union with ukraine holding an important place in his ambitions russia denies any plan to attack its neighbour but it has threatened unspecified military technical action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees including a promise that ukraine will never join nato but recognition of the separatist held areas paved the way for putin to send military forces there arguing that he was intervening as an ally to protect the separtists against ukrainian forces putin s move will narrow the diplomatic options to avoid war since it is an explicit rejection of a seven year old ceasefire mediated by france and germany touted as the framework for future negotiations on the wider crisis separately moscow said ukrainian military saboteurs had tried to enter russian territory in armed vehicles leading to five deaths an accusation dismissed as fake news by kyiv both developments fit a pattern repeatedly predicted by western governments who accuse russia of preparing to fabricate a pretext to invade by blaming kyiv for attacks and relying on pleas for help from separatist proxies moscow has said repeatedly it has no such plans biden reaffirmed support for ukraine s sovereignty in a call with president volodymyr zelenskiy and also spoke to french president emmanuel macron and germany chancellor olaf scholz hours earlier macron gave hope of a diplomatic solution saying putin and biden had agreed in principle to meet but the kremlin said there were no specific plans for a summit the white house said biden had accepted the meeting in principle but only if an invasion hasn t happened washington says russia has massed a force numbering 169 000 190 000 troops in the region

the buffalo mining company a division of the pittston company as early as the 1940 s the company began dumping unwanted materials like clay and low quality coal close to the tiny town of saunders along buffalo creek eventually during the 1960s the company and the workers built three makeshift dams without an engineering plan or strong materials according to a case study by association of dam

their spot it became communities brunty said they organized that very well we did it ourselves for the longest time we picked up garbage of course litter wasn t the only environmental problem there was also the problem of black water the wastewater from coal mines today residents say the water is much cleaner than it was even before the disaster jessica lilly wvpb perry harvey worked with the buffalo creek watershed association to get buffalo creek on the west virginia division of natural resources trout stocking list years ago the coal companies would dump black water in the creek anyway and then as laws changed and stuff they can t do it no more lifetime resident perry harvey said standing beside the creek just across from the buffalo creek disaster memorial for the people who died harvey remembers the state of the creek during the initial cleanup efforts at that time when the u s army corps of engineers came in here they basically just dredged the creek and changed the route or the road the main highway harvey said after the flood there wasn t no habitat for the fish in 2005 harvey and some of his neighbors formed the buffalo creek watershed association the watershed group covers about 20 miles of stream from the tiny unincorporated towns from curtis to man west virginia their goal was to get buffalo creek on the state s dnr trout stocking schedule but to do it it would take even more work from the community and regulators and a lot would have to change courtesy work to create fish habitats in buffalo creek in 2015 we started cleaning the highways and the creek and getting all of the stuff out of it brunty said then there was a biologist that just came down and ran a test of the ph level how cold the water was and stuff the creek needed to be cool and clean and it also needed to be reshaped like a natural river standing beside buffalo creek memorial highway on a ledge above the river harvey points to some stacked rocks while water gently rolls over it by the flow of the water coming over the rocks it will form a pool and the oxygen comes off of the rocks harvey explains and it puts more oxygen in and keeps the water cool the association worked with appalachian stream restoration to install 192 of these rock structures in a 16 mile stretch over almost 2 years the west virginia department of environmental protection funded most of the project with about 750 000 worth of grants while a coal company donated the rock the hardest part was getting the litter cleaned up to show the dep and the dnr that we were we re going to stick with this thing harvey said work to reclaim the buffalo creek communities courtesy the west virginia department of natural resources stocked the creek on february 25 2020 the work of the buffalo creek watershed association paid off today the creek supports habitat for trout when the watershed association here decided to try to do it they started testing the water former west virginia dnr commissioner keith wilson said then the dnr sent their trout biologist up and looked at it tested the water and it was acceptable to trout so we went from there and stocked buffalo creek was added to the monthly stocking schedule in 2006 after improvements in water quality and fish habitat the work even caught the attention of the state in 2013 when the buffalo creek watershed association won the west virginia department of environmental protection cabinet secretary award new work for a new generation the communities affected by the disaster have been cleaning up and rebuilding for 50 years now there s a new generation that s continuing that work in their own way man high school students complete hours of community service before they graduate many of those hours are completed by youth cleaning litter and debris along buffalo creek courtesy hunter montgomery some kids put in the work at an even younger age when barbara brunty s two grandsons were little she would often take them to help you have to start with the kids brunty said that was us we took them they helped us pick up garbage brunty s grandson hunter montgomery grew up along buffalo creek with a passion for hunting and fishing once we started throwing lines out in the water that was as far as it went montgomery said we were hooked fish got hooked we got hooked it just took off from there montgomery is in college now but he remembers those clean up days with his family we would go out and pick up trash montgomery said i would go out with my grandfather pick up trash because it was an initiative to get me to work it was also an initiative to encourage people let s come together as a community we can start putting these fish in here but hey they re not just going to magically appear you have to put in an effort montgomery remembers being about 8 years old when buffalo creek was added to the state s trout stocking schedule being told there s trout in the creek that are a pound pound and a half and they re bigger than what you are normally catching montgomery said you re tickled to death now montgomery is working on a degree in civil engineering technology at fairmont state university i like environmental work i like what it s about montgomery said something like growing up on the creek and meeting these types of people and seeing what they do really puts it in a frame of mind that that s something that i want to do as well that s something that does drive me to be a better civil engineer and to come back and do environmental work if not here other places to just improve what world i have around me courtesy fish day in logan county 2016 the buffalo creek watershed association also created an annual event called fish day in 2004 at the beginning of logan county schools spring break the group passes out food fishing lessons and supplies we had pizza we had free rods and reels all of the kids who were there got one we got to see the stock truck coming down the creek brunty said i know what a stock truck looks like now i m following it anywhere in the state of west virginia due to the fact that i watched that stock truck so much as a kid fishing poles given out during fish day 2019 in logan county wv the fishing poles and food come from local businesses the association usually gives away about 125 fishing rods reels and tackle it makes you feel good to have the kids be able to get out and enjoy fishing and catching fish montgomery said these days perry harvey is still involved with the buffalo creek watershed association as a board member he says he envisioned fish day as the beginning of a brighter future for the region along with the environmental challenges the region has struggled with an opioid addiction epidemic that it may turn some of them around maybe growing up in man and maybe enjoy fishing instead of the drugs harvey said fish day might offer free rods and reels to kids but it holds a special meaning for some of the adults in the region it s not just fish day it s community day brunty said with a smile everybody goes if you don t have kids you still come you get to talk to your neighbors that you may not even see any other time brunty says fish day was an important part for the community to fight its way back from the coal waste flood and find a new identity courtesy arthur and barbara brunty at fish day in logan county 2021 the region in logan county was lined with small close knit coal mining towns before the disaster while there s still some mining around brunty says the community has had to come together with a focus on a cleaner environment that s who we are you clean up do we like picking up garbage no it s somebody else s garbage brunty said we don t throw it out but we pick it up fifty years ago barbara brunty lost the community she knew but over time and through the work for her neighbors coming out of that tragedy she s part of a community that has a new meaning and purpose that s something my family could do brunty said we don t have a lot on buffalo creek but we got our fish you can go out and there ll be somebody out there the creek is clean we just have to take care of what we got montgomery said enjoy

by may zhou in houston and nathan william in beijing china daily updated 2022 02 22 07 21 edgar snow left and his wife helen foster snow organization s head very pleased when he gets xi s letter praises intl friendship adam foster a great nephew of trailblazing united states journalist helen foster snow has long believed in the value of building connections between nations through people coming together his great aunt together with edgar snow whom she met and married in china had championed the practice by making the communist party of china known to the world through their writings on the party and the chinese revolution if ever adam foster could do with some reinforcement on the need for people to people exchanges it came in late january in the form of a letter from president xi jinping xi told foster in the letter that he highly appreciates the positive contributions made by his family to the development of relations between china and the united states over the years the president highlighted the work of the helen foster snow foundation an organization named after the accomplished journalist and writer in her own right who helped convey a more accurate picture of china to the world xi said he hopes that foster and the foundation based in utah will continue to follow the example of edgar and helen snow foster the foundation s president told china daily s edgar snow newsroom i m grateful that the leaders of our countries understand the importance of people to people relationships and building bridges and working together our work has also received a tremendous amount of support from people across the united states and china so to me this really is international friendship in action foster spoke of feeling very pleased when he received xi s letter a treasured delivery ahead of spring festival the president s words of encouragement came in response to a letter foster had sent him foster decided to write to xi when he was taking stock of the foundation s accomplishments over the past four years to emphasize the spirit of international friendship which helen foster snow embodied last year marked the 90th anniversary of helen foster s arrival in china and adam foster said he wanted to thank the chinese people for honoring his great aunt s work over the years adam foster let slip that there s also a connection between helen foster snow and xi zhongxun father of president xi helen foster snow encouraged her friend rewi alley to establish the bailey school in shandan gansu province in 1940 to help underprivileged children get an education later i learned that rewi alley invited president xi s father to serve as an honorary principal of the bailey school he said so the spirit of international friendship which helen began so long ago continues today and i think this spirit was really echoed by president xi s letter with his great aunt s charitable work in mind foster said that china s feat of raising millions of people out of poverty counts as the most remarkable change he has witnessed over the years foster said the foundation is committed to creating a platform for dialogue engagement and practical cooperation focusing on exchanges in education culture and business as well as in the subnational sphere to achieve that goal the foundation is working with universities museums and other institutions to promote language learning education and cultural exchanges for example we are working with partners in jiangxi province to create a ceramic cultural center based in utah to share this amazing cultural tradition of ceramic artistry with americans with northwest university in xi an we are working to promote the helen foster snow translation award to be a world class translation competition he said the foundation is also planning to create a high level award in helen foster snow s name to recognize those who have helped to build bridges between the peoples of china and other nations foster said that despite the covid 19 pandemic the foundation has held several events in chinese provinces to share his great aunt s work as a photojournalist in 1930s china events like these create a chance for subnational governments to engage and dialogue with each other on nonsensitive topics he said last year his daughter makennafoster was chosen as a young ambassador to represent the us at the silk road children s emissary for chinese new year we feel the best way to honor helen is to continue the work she was engaged in adapted to current conditions foster said adam foster s first connection with china came when he met a chinese student in southern france when he was 19 he was serving as a volunteer for the church of jesus christ of latter day saints a faith whose adherents are known as mormons while there i met a young college student named ge yi from beijing who was studying art at the university in marseille foster said he was the first person from china i had ever met i told him i was related to helen foster snow and he said wow your family is very famous i didn t really know what that meant at the time since i had never been to china of course he heard about his great aunt s trip to china when the us and china resumed contact in the early 1970s however he had no clue of the impact she had on china and us china relations he remembered her mostly as a generous family member who while not wealthy herself helped to pay for his father s college education helen foster went to china in 1931 and reported on china for several us publications there she met edgar snow and married him in 1937 she traveled to yan an befriended red army leader mao zedong and was granted full access to other communist leaders and the military her photos gave a big boost to edgar snow s celebrated book red star over china which amplified mao s thinking on the world stage the snows also helped to develop chinese industrial cooperatives the gung ho movement to create jobs and income for chinese people to gain economic power against the japanese invaders she returned to the us in 1940 and resumed contact with china following president richard nixon s visit to china in 1972 little known in the us helen foster snow is a household name in china adam foster became friends with ge and calls him his very first chinese friend the most astonishing thing was how alike we were his sense of humor was similar to my own he was honest hardworking and very hospitable foster recalled these were values that i was taught at a young age growing up in the culture of utah and i marveled how someone who lived on the other side of the world could be so similar to the people i grew up with that encounter prompted foster to read helen foster snow s work my china years after he returned to utah to attend college i was spellbound learning about 1930s china helen and edgar snow s courtship the dec 9 movement the xi an incident helen s escape from her hotel window to visit yan an and the chinese industrial cooperative gung ho movement it had romance adventure and intrigue i remember thinking this should be a movie in 2016 adam foster was invited to china by northwest university in xi an and spent several days traveling to sites associated with helen and edgar snow s past in 2018 foster visited again to attend the dedication ceremony for the gung ho museum in baoji shaanxi province there he realized how the model of utah s industrial cooperatives promoted by brigham young utah s first governor had been promoted by snow in china and then india inspired by his great aunt foster established the helen foster snow foundation in 2018 to continue her remarkable legacy of bridge building and he has never looked back
moscow russian president vladimir putin ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern ukraine after recognising them as independent on monday feb 21 accelerating a crisis the west fears could unleash a major war a reuters witness saw unusually large columns of military hardware moving through the breakaway city of donetsk after putin told russia s defence ministry to send forces into the two regions to keep the peace in a decree issued shortly after announcing recognition for russian backed separatists there the moves drew us and european condemnation and vows of new sanctions although it was not immediately clear whether the russian military action would be regarded by the west as the start of a fullscale invasion the area was already controlled by russian backed separatists and moscow in practice there was no word on the size of the force putin was dispatching but the decree said russia now had the right to build military bases in the breakaway regions and that the troops mission would a peacekeeping operation in a lengthy televised address packed with grievances against the west putin looking visibly angry described ukraine as an integral part of russia s history and said eastern ukraine was ancient russian lands and that he was confident the russian people would support his decision russian state television showed putin joined by russia backed separatist leaders signing a decree recognising the independence of the two ukrainian breakaway regions the self proclaimed donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic along with agreements on cooperation and friendship defying western warnings against such a move putin had announced his decision in phone calls to the leaders of germany and france earlier both of whom voiced disappointment the kremlin said moscow s action may well torpedo a last minute bid for a summit with u s president joe biden to prevent russia from invading ukraine the rouble extended its losses as putin spoke at one point sliding beyond 80 per dollar biden responded by signing an executive order for a halt to all u s economic activity in the breakaway regions and a ban on import of all goods from those areas as well as investment there white house spokesperson jen psaki said the measures being rolled out in response to putin s decree were separate from sanctions the united states and its allies have been readying if russia invades ukraine us secretary of state antony blinken said the executive order is designed to prevent russia from profiting off of this blatant violation of international law the un security council will meet publicly on ukraine at 9pm est monday 0200 gmt on tuesday 3 00am singapore time a russian diplomat said following a request by the united states britain and france dutch prime minister mark rutte said european union countries have agreed to impose a limited set of sanctions targeting those who are responsible for russia s recognition of the rebel regions and british foreign minister liz truss said the government would announce new sanctions on tuesday nato secretary general jens stoltenberg accused russia of trying to stage a pretext for a further invasion russia annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014 in his address putin delved into history as far back as the ottoman empire and as recent as the tensions over nato s eastward expansion his demands that ukraine drop its long term goal of joining the atlantic military alliance have been repeatedly rebuffed by kyiv and nato states with his decision to recognise the breakaway regions putin brushed off western warnings i deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic putin said he said earlier that if ukraine was to join nato it would serve as a direct threat to the security of russia sanctions threat putin has for years worked to restore russia s influence over nations that emerged after the collapse of the soviet union with ukraine holding an important place in his ambitions russia denies any plan to attack its neighbour but it has threatened unspecified military technical action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees including a promise that ukraine will never join nato but recognition of the separatist held areas paved the way for putin to send military forces there arguing that he was intervening as an ally to protect the separtists against ukrainian forces putin s move will narrow the diplomatic options to avoid war since it is an explicit rejection of a seven year old ceasefire mediated by france and germany touted as the framework for future negotiations on the wider crisis separately moscow said ukrainian military saboteurs had tried to enter russian territory in armed vehicles leading to five deaths an accusation dismissed as fake news by kyiv both developments fit a pattern repeatedly predicted by western governments who accuse russia of preparing to fabricate a pretext to invade by blaming kyiv for attacks and relying on pleas for help from separatist proxies moscow has said repeatedly it has no such plans biden reaffirmed support for ukraine s sovereignty in a call with president volodymyr zelenskiy and also spoke to french president emmanuel macron and germany chancellor olaf scholz hours earlier macron gave hope of a diplomatic solution saying putin and biden had agreed in principle to meet but the kremlin said there were no specific plans for a summit the white house said biden had accepted the meeting in principle but only if an invasion hasn t happened washington says russia has massed a force numbering 169 000 190 000 troops in the region including the separatists in the breakaway regions and could invade within days european financial markets tumbled at the signs of increased confrontation after having briefly edged higher on the glimmer of hope that a summit might offer a path out of europe s biggest military crisis in decades the price of oil russia s main export rose while russian shares and the rouble plunged

for many particularly federal workers today means a day off because it s presidents day plans are in place for a long weekend of travel binge watching tv maybe sleeping in today and for those in new orleans sleeping off the fun from the first weekend of carnival parades but what exactly is presidents day glad you asked 1 he never told a lie supposedly the inspiration for this day off is america s first president george washington when washington passed away in 1799 he was considered such an important figure in u s history that his birthday washington was born feb 22 1732 became a perennial day of remembrance starting in 1800 the holiday was called washington s birthday 2 when did presidents day become official washington s birthday wasn t truly an official holiday until jan 31 1879 when president rutherford b hayes signed it into law though it only applied to federal employees in the district of columbia it took until 1885 for it to become celebrated by the whole country 3 when did washington s birthday change its name to presidents day good question with no real definitive answer the u s congress and no actual president has ever required the name change from washington s birthday to presidents day the blog by george washington s mount vernon the house he lived in that is now a museum said that presidents day was proposed as a monday holiday in 1951 but nothing happened what the site surmises is that the ubiquitous presidents day commercials and advertisements for sales caused the public to adopt the holiday name it was also seen as a good way to honor all the country s presidents rather than just one 4 why isn t it celebrated on washington s actual birthday it wasn t until june 28 1968 when congress passed the uniform monday holiday act which was to provide a uniform annual observance of legal public holidays on monday you can thank sen robert mcclory of illinois who championed the bill which proposed to shift federal holidays so they could be three day weekends by creating more three day weekends congress hoped to bring substantial benefits to both the spiritual and economic life of the nation this is why you have certain federal holidays on monday martin luther king jr day indigenous peoples day also observed as columbus day memorial day and labor day the irony of this change to presidents day is that it guarantees the holiday won t be celebrated on washington s actual birthday as the third monday cannot fall any later than feb 21 5 what does president abraham lincoln have to do with this lincoln was born on feb 12 1809 and somehow his birthday was linked with the washington s birthday holiday in some places in the united states lincoln s birthday was celebrated on its own some schools had the winter holiday between washington s and lincoln s birthdays merging the two holidays was also a provision in the uniform monday holiday act though the fact remains what other president could advertisers use with washington other than honest abe lagniappe what is closed on presidents day federal offices no mail is delivered and most banks are closed as are the new york stock exchange and nasdaq of course major stores will be open by sue strachan

we need to stop putin because he will not stop at ukraine liz truss britain s foreign secretary said in an interview sunday in the daily mail about russian president vladimir putin s apparently imminent invasion of ukraine putin has said all this publicly that he wants to create the greater russia that he wants to go back to the situation as it was before where russia had control over huge swathes of eastern europe ursula von der leyen the head of the european union s executive commission said the kremlin s dangerous thinking which comes straight out of a dark past may cost russia a prosperous future she said if russia invades ukraine russia would have limited access to financial markets and tech goods according to a sanctions package that is being prepared ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said saturday that he wants to meet with putin to negotiate a solution to the crisis that has seen thousands of russian military troops deployed along ukraine s borders i don t know what the president of the russian federation wants so i am proposing a meeting zelenskyy said at the munich security conference ukraine what we know meanwhile austria france and germany are the latest nations to urge their citizens to leave ukraine in anticipation of an imminent invasion lufthansa the german airline has also canceled flights to kyiv and odessa a ukrainian black sea port u s president joe biden will meet with the national security council sunday the white house announced saturday as it reaffirmed that russia could launch an attack against ukraine at any time white house press secretary jen psaki said putin presided over military drills saturday as shelling escalated in eastern ukraine russia s defense ministry said saturday s exercises which the kremlin says were previously planned to check readiness involved practice submarine launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles with putin and the president of belarus looking on poised to strike saturday u s defense secretary lloyd austin said the more than 150 000 russian troops that have massed at ukraine s border are now poised to strike as he spoke with reporters in lithuania where lithuanian president gitanas nauseda called for an increased u s troop presence at the munich security conference on saturday u s vice president kamala harris warned that russia s plan was already unfolding there is a playbook of russian aggression and this playbook is too familiar to us all russia will plead ignorance and innocence it will create false pretext for invasion and it will amass troops and fire power in plain sight said harris who added a russian invasion would trigger sanctions that include far reaching financial sanctions and export controls speaking at the same conference earlier saturday stoltenberg said russia in threatening ukraine will get more nato instead of the smaller nato footprint putin says he is seeking stoltenberg also said he has sent a letter to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov calling for a meeting of the nato russia council to avert a conflict in ukraine stoltenberg told the munich security conference that there is no evidence that russia has withdrawn any of its troops from ukraine s borders and there is a real risk of conflict but as ukraine s zelenskyy addressed the audience of high level officials and security experts from around the world zelenskyy pushed back against predictions of an imminent russian invasion declaring we do not think we need to panic agence france presse reported british prime minister boris johnson however told the bbc that evidence points to russia planning the biggest war in europe since 1945 new attacks observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe reported more than 1 500 cease fire violations in east ukraine on saturday the highest single day number this year ukraine s military accused separatists in two breakaway territories in eastern ukraine the self proclaimed donetsk and luhansk republics of carrying out a new wave of attacks saturday the separatists who also accused ukraine s military of carrying out new attacks saturday signed mass military mobilization decrees the head of one of the territories urged all able bodied men to take up arms against what he claimed is kyiv s aggression the regions have also begun evacuating some civilians from border areas biden said the move was a result of russian misinformation saying that it defies basic logic that people in ukraine would choose this moment to engage in combat with more than 150 000 russian troops on ukraine s borders should moscow invade ukraine it will be critical for the united states to convince the world that russia is the aggressor and that it did so unprovoked max bergmann senior fellow at the center for american progress told voa this was a master class from the biden administration in how to win an information war with russia bergmann said the biden administration has read the kremlin playbook and they are exposing russian disinformation as they come across it however biden is still offering putin a de escalation off ramp saying that diplomacy is always a possibility he said based on the significant intelligence capability of the u s he has reason to believe putin will still consider the diplomatic option diplomatic channels u s secretary of state antony blinken is scheduled to meet with lavrov on feb 24 in the event of an invasion western allies must resolve differences over the timing and severity of sanctions against moscow for example the initial package likely will not include banning russia from the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication or swift system used by 200 countries for international financial transfers russian officials have denied they plan to invade ukraine but diplomatic talks with western officials have led to a standoff russia has demanded that the u s and its allies reject ukraine s bid for membership in nato the west has rejected that as a nonstarter but has said it is willing to negotiate with moscow over missile deployment and troop exercises in eastern european countries closest to russia some

ford wants to wall off its electric operations from its internal combustion engine business and has even considered spinning off one or the other people familiar with the effort said ford motor co is looking at ways to separate its electric vehicle operation from its century old legacy business hoping to earn the sort of investor respect enjoyed by tesla inc and other purely ev makers chief executive jim farley wants to wall off ford s electric operations from its internal combustion engine business and has even considered spinning off one or the other people familiar with the effort said a spinoff could generate the kind of earnings multiples that have given tesla a market value approaching 1 trillion but splitting the company which ford says it isn t planning may prove too difficult so farley instead may simply separate the ev business internally as its own unit as part of a broad reorganization that seeks to give ford an edge in the electric age advertisement a spinoff could be a tough sell to the ford family it controls the automaker through a special class of stock and is leery of losing influence over the 118 year old company said the people who didn t want to be identified revealing internal deliberations the founding family led by executive chair bill ford has three seats on the board the company faces pressure from wall street to spin off its nascent ev business to boost value by shedding legacy costs and to gain greater access to capital markets investors have awarded immense value to pure ev makers such as rivian automotive inc whose market value briefly topped ford s late last year even though the company produced relatively few vehicles we are focused on our ford plan to transform the company and thrive in this new era of electric and connected vehicles the company said by email when asked about a potential spinoff we have no plans to spin off our battery electric vehicle business or our traditional business early this month however farley didn t reject the possibility of spinning off either operation when queried on the subject during the company s earnings call running a successful ice business and a successful bev business are not the same farley said i m really excited about the company s commitment to operate the businesses as they should be the ev business is fundamentally different in the customers it attracts the way its products are built and the engineering and design talent that must be hired we re not seeking half measures farley said on the call we re done with incremental change we have a clear plan a bias for action and a whatever it takes mind set advertisement late last year ford had talks with financial advisors to explore some options for the ev operation including a potential reorganization and raising private capital for it according to two people familiar with the matter as farley sought to maximize the value of ford s ev operations his vision evolved over time from initially considering a smaller spinoff to contemplating a full breakup to now looking at an internal split the people familiar with the effort said even an internal split would be complicated splitting up engineering and operations at a carmaker where some engineers and factories create and build both types of vehicles is no easy task one of the people said even if everyone favors a true split it would be heavy work to manage the complexity the person said ford has committed 30 billion to its ev strategy through 2025 and is said to be planning to spend an additional 10 billion to 20 billion by the end of the decade to convert factories to build plug in models farley has tripled production of the electric mustang mach e and doubled output of its f 150 lightning plug in pickup which will begin selling this spring the company plans to produce 600 000 evs annually in two years and generate as much as half of its sales from battery powered vehicles by 2030 in its current structure the automaker lacks access to the financing available to tesla and other ev makers that are viewed more favorably by banks and investors creating a pure plug in offshoot could provide ford access to cheaper capital and give investors the opportunity to assign a value to its ev business the people said farley is working closely on the effort with doug field the former head of apple inc s car project whom ford hired in september as advanced technology chief the people said field who previously worked as tesla s chief engineer would have a senior role in any new entity the people said advertisement field and farley would have their work cut out for them if they chose to pursue a full spinoff aside from having to win over the founding family car dealers and the united auto workers union also would have to be convinced that they wouldn t get left behind analysts have said ford needs to shed its legacy business model to achieve the profit margins that tesla commands which farley has estimated to be more than 10 000 a car to offset the higher cost of electric vehicles analysts say automakers need a direct sales model such as those at tesla and rivian that bypasses dealers and the cut of revenue they receive carmakers also need to lower labor costs ford is making great progress in electric morgan stanley analyst adam jonas said in a november note to investors old line carmakers face serious challenges from evs and in our view will require non traditional actions to address them ford already builds the mustang mach e in mexico where wages are a small fraction of what they are in the u s the automaker also is building its first all new assembly plant in half a century to manufacture electric f series trucks in tennessee and the uaw has no assurance it will represent those workers there is precedent for what farley and field are considering in 2017 auto supplier delphi technologies spun off its combustion engine powertrain business and renamed the remaining company aptiv which focuses on electronics and software for evs and autonomous vehicles aptiv began trading at greater multiples advertisement as a full scale automaker ford has a bigger lift though farley appears eager to shake things up this is a culture change at ford he said on the earnings call this is part of the rhythm change bloomberg writers crystal tse and kiel porter

moscow russian president vladimir putin ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern ukraine after recognising them as independent on monday accelerating a crisis the west fears could unleash a major war a reuters witness saw unusually large columns of military hardware moving through the breakaway city of donetsk after putin told russia s defence ministry to send forces into the two regions to keep the peace in a decree issued shortly after announcing recognition for russian backed separatists there the moves drew us and european condemnation and vows of new sanctions the area was already controlled by russian backed separatists and moscow in practice ukraine s borders remain unchangeable despite russian action the un ambassador added ukrainian leader volodymyr zelensky on tuesday demanded clear support from the west after russia recognised two eastern separatist regions russian envoy to the united nations vasily nebenzya on monday said moscow remains open to diplomacy but stressed the need to defend separatist areas from what he dubbed ukrainian aggession we remain open to diplomacy for a diplomatic solution he said during an emergency un security council meeting however allowing a new bloodbath in the donbass is something we do not intend to do the emergency session followed putin s order to deploy to the breakaway regions a move roundly decried during the meeting by the united states and allies china at the un urged restraint by all sides on ukraine there was no word on the size of the force putin was dispatching but the decree said russia now had the right to build military bases in the breakaway regions and that the troops mission would a peacekeeping operation in a lengthy televised address packed with grievances against the west putin looking visibly angry described ukraine as an integral part of russia s history and said eastern ukraine was ancient russian lands and that he was confident the russian people would support his decision russian state television showed putin joined by russia backed separatist leaders signing a decree recognising the independence of the two ukrainian breakaway regions the self proclaimed donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic along with agreements on cooperation and friendship defying western warnings against such a move putin had announced his decision in phone calls to the leaders of germany and france earlier both of whom voiced disappointment the kremlin said moscow s action may well torpedo a last minute bid for a summit with us president joe biden to prevent russia from invading ukraine the rouble extended its losses as putin spoke at one point sliding beyond 80 per dollar biden responded by signing an executive order for a halt to all us economic activity in the breakaway regions and a ban on import of all goods from those areas as well as investment there white house spokesperson jen psaki said the measures being rolled out in response to putin s decree were separate from sanctions the united states and its allies have been readying if russia invades ukraine us secretary of state antony blinken said the executive order is designed to prevent russia from profiting off of this blatant violation of international law the u n security council will meet publicly on ukraine at 9pm est monday 6am uae on tuesday a russian diplomat said following a request by the united states britain and france dutch prime minister mark rutte said european union countries have agreed to impose a limited set of sanctions targeting those who are responsible for russia s recognition of the rebel regions and british foreign minister liz truss said the government would announce new sanctions on tuesday nato secretary general jens stoltenberg accused russia of trying to stage a pretext for a further invasion russia annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014 in his address putin delved into history as far back as the ottoman empire and as recent as the tensions over nato s eastward expansion his demands that ukraine drop its long term goal of joining the atlantic military alliance have been repeatedly rebuffed by kyiv and nato states with his decision to recognise the breakaway regions putin brushed off western warnings i deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the donetsk people s republic and the lugansk people s republic putin said he said earlier that if ukraine was to join nato it would serve as a direct threat to the security of russia putin has for years worked to restore russia s influence over nations that emerged after the collapse of the soviet union with ukraine holding an important place in his ambitions russia denies any plan to attack its neighbour but it has threatened unspecified military technical action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees including a promise that ukraine will never join nato but recognition of the separatist held areas paved the way for putin to send military forces there arguing that he was intervening as an ally to protect the separtists against ukrainian forces putin s move will narrow the diplomatic options to avoid war since it is an explicit rejection of a seven year old ceasefire mediated by france and germany touted as the framework for future negotiations on the wider crisis separately moscow said ukrainian military saboteurs had tried to enter russian territory in armed vehicles leading to five deaths an accusation dismissed as fake news by kyiv both developments fit a pattern repeatedly predicted by western governments who accuse russia of preparing to fabricate a pretext to invade by blaming kyiv for attacks and relying on pleas for help from separatist proxies moscow has said repeatedly it has no such plans biden reaffirmed support for ukraine s sovereignty in a call with president volodymyr zelenskiy and also spoke to french president emmanuel macron and germany chancellor olaf scholz hours earlier macron gave hope of a diplomatic solution saying putin and biden had agreed in principle to meet but the kremlin said there were no specific plans for a summit the white house said biden had accepted the meeting in principle but only if an invasion hasn t happened washington says russia has massed a force numbering 169 000 190 000 troops in the region including the separatists in the breakaway regions and could invade within days

u s gas inventories have depleted faster than average this winter despite warmer than normal temperatures as strong demand in europe and asia has boosted exports of liquefied natural gas tightening the market working stocks in underground storage have fallen by 1 703 billion cubic feet since the start of november according to data from the u s energy information administration the depletion rate has been the fastest since the winter of 2017 18 and is significantly above the pre pandemic five year average of 1 485 billion cubic feet weekly natural gas storage report eia feb 17 inventories are now 289 billion cubic feet 13 below the pre pandemic seasonal average compared with 103 billion cubic feet 3 below the average at the start of november inventories have depleted rapidly even though the winter has been significantly warmer than average across the major population centres of the united states cutting heating demand the number of population weighted heating degree days has been 10 below the long term average according to the u s climate prediction center despite the rapid inventory depletion traders now anticipate they will remain adequate through the end of the main heating season based on futures prices the end of winter march april calendar spread is currently trading at around 5 cents per million british thermal units down from 1 80 in early october when there were fears stocks might fall to critically low levels gas inventories will nevertheless end winter below average across north america and europe even assuming pipeline supplies from russia keep flowing high levels of injections will be needed to refill depleted storage on both sides of the atlantic while still meeting strong demand from asia refilling to rebuild depleted inventories u s gas production will need to keep increasing while consumption will have to be restrained through the spring and summer months which should keep prices relatively high front month futures prices have fallen around a quarter from their recent high in september 2020 but are still slightly above the average in real terms in the 55th percentile since 1990 on the consumption side power generators are paying twice as much for gas than coal on an energy equivalent basis more than offsetting the superior efficiency of many gas fired units high gas prices will continue to give generators an incentive to run gas units for fewer hours using coal fired ones instead helping rebuild gas stocks on the production side the number of drilling rigs targeting primarily gas bearing rock formations climbed last week to 124 up from 90 at the same point last year and the highest since before the pandemic and the number of rigs targeting primarily oil bearing formations has risen even faster to 520 up from 306 this time last year which will also boost output of associated gas from oil wells production has started rising again and was up more than 5 in the three months from september to november last year compared with the year before winter 2022 23 north america europe and asia have avoided feared shortages of gas this winter mostly as a result of mild temperatures across the northern hemisphere but the scarcity of gas has not disappeared fully and there will need to be an unusually large accumulation of inventories between april and september to ensure next winter does not start with a shortfall rebuilding depleted inventories will therefore be the dominant theme in global gas market and by extension the coal and electricity markets over the next six months hedge funds and other money managers are still bullish on u s gas prices with a net long position in the two main futures and options contracts equivalent to 1 885 billion cubic feet which is in the 65th percentile since 2010 bullish long positions outnumber bearish short ones by a ratio of more than 2 1 in the 69th percentile since 2010 anticipating prices will have to rise again to rebuild inventories before winter 2022 23 source reuters editing by david evans
