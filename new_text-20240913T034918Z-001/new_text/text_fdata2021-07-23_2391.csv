employers should pay higher wages in the labor shortage and the government should cut the labor shortage by welcoming migrants according to meandering and emotional answers given by president joe biden at a cnn town hall the way you raise wages for people at the bottom rungs of the job market is by letting fewer in to compete with them noted mark krikorian director of the center for immigration studies but he added biden s incoherent and contradictory preferences are commonplace in the lobbying hothouse of washington d c i m not letting this go biden vehemently told the july 21 townhall audience at cincinnati ohio he continued we talk about dreamers sort of generically let s think about it now what it really means you re 5 years old you re 9 years old your mommy or dad says i m going to take you across the rio grande and we re illegally going to go into the united states what he s supposed to say not me that s against the law these are kids who have done well and so what we re going to do is first of all appeal the case number one but number two we re going to make sure that as number of my republican colleagues say they support the right of dreamers to come they should be able to stay in the united states of america yet at the same event biden also touted wage raises for working americans even though decades of migration have slashed job opportunities and wages for more than 100 million americans biden s wage comments came when a restaurant operator asked him the entire industry amongst other industries continue to struggle to find employees how do you and the biden administration plan to incentivize those that haven t returned to work yet biden told the restaurant operator he likely will have to raise wages amid the current shortage of workers all kidding aside i think it really is a matter of people deciding now that they have opportunities to do other things and there s a shortage of employees people are looking to make more money and to bargain and so i think your business and the tourist business is really going to be in a bind for a little while there may be other reasons that wages are higher for less skilled workers but clearly one of them is when competition from immigrant workers creates a loose labor market when there are more workers chasing fewer jobs krikorian noted but few politicians want to recognize that their promise to pro migration lobbyists also wrecks their promises of wage raises for voters he said adding not making the connection between immigration policy and wages for american workers is either obtuse or deliberately deceptive i just find it hard to believe they can t make that connection i think it s more likely they just literally just put it out of their minds so it never occurs to them and if it ever whispers to them in the back of their minds they push it away biden s pro amnesty answer but not his wage raising answer was touted by a sprawling network of pro migration activists funded by facebook founder mark zuckerberg and anonymous progressive donors for example chris golden one of the communication activists at zuckerberg s fwd us applauded biden s statement as animated and passionate and the president was his most animated most passionate when asked about his commitment to protecting dreamers i m not letting this go he said chris golden chrisgolden july 22 2021 zuckerberg s network of investors is working closely with west coast democrats such as vice president kamala harris to pressure biden s east coast deputies to support multiple economy changing wage cutting amnesties in the pending 2021 budget bills overall investors want to import more migrants even very poor migrants because they spike sales rental rates profits and stock values but migration damages ordinary americans career opportunities cuts their wages raises their rents curbs their productivity shrinks their political clout and wrecks their open minded equality promoting civic culture in general legal and illegal migration moves wealth from employees to employers from families to investors from young to old from children to their parents from homebuyers to investors from technology to stoop labor biden s revived federal delivery of legal and illegal labor also helps to move wealth and social status from heartland red states to the coastal blue states and from the rural districts to the urban districts within each state
all of us working in wealth management and as financial advisers need to have a global perspective a tanker wedged in the suez canal that sends tremors through global supply chains is a reminder of how small and interconnected the world is today to be successful we need to have eyes on investments and economies all over the world this global approach perfectly dovetails with our ability to help promote a sustainable future investors should be able to expect greater expertise and guidance on impact investing from advisers who have this global view investors can start by asking for conversations that define exactly what we mean by impact investing on the flip side advisers should look for opportunities to frame the conversation around an individual s values there s some disagreement on the term in the investment community it s been referred to as social responsibility investing and sustainable investing and as esg investing why not take a broad definition impact investing is any investment driven by values from there advisors and investors have the opportunity to set goals and take action here are four tips i ve learned for doing just that 1 break the ice on impact investing social and environmental values aren t always top of mind for investors when talking about their financial plans and goals that s what an informed proactive advisor is for taking a customer centric approach wealth advisors can frame the conversation and then listen we can then offer curated options based on the client s own set of values this proactive invitation to clients to discuss values is a little unusual but it s important even when they are interested in it many investors don t initiate discussions about esg investing because it is a relatively new field we can open the door for them a good place to start is what areas does an investor not want exposure to when one of our advisors in minnesota asked a client about this it opened a conversation about bank of the west s own policies against investing in coal fired electric plants human trafficking and a host of other areas the adviser asked would you like me to tell you more about that the client was intrigued and appreciated learning about restrictive finance policies that aligned with their values for investors unfamiliar with specific esg criteria just knowing that they exist can help them rethink their investment strategy for investors don t be afraid to broach the subject with your adviser impact investing is an increasingly common approach to wealth management your advisor may not realize you re interested in exploring it once they do they should be able to provide you with options for pursuing an investment strategy that aligns with your values 2 activate the client s vision once a client s values are clear they can and should expect their adviser to get to work determining the best way to adjust their portfolios to reflect them this could happen through specific diagnostic and analytical tools or another approach to strategically align investments with a client s ethics and principles advisers can then work with each client to help them invest all or just a portion of their portfolio in values based holdings that reflect who they are and what they stand for new impact oriented investors tend to start with five to 15 of their portfolio in esg investments of course this depends on the investor as esg investing is very subjective if an investor decides to proceed a dedicated financial institution can offer them a curated line up of mutual funds and etfs or apply positive and negative screens to any professionally managed portfolios i like to give clients choices among socially responsible funds that align with their values and are evaluated based on esg factors such as climate change conflict risk and human rights some really exciting options might include enhanced impact investments which are highly targeted solutions including special and time limited offerings such as purpose driven structured notes green bonds and private funds 3 rigorously vet recommendations more about that curated line up of mutual funds and etfs not every fund lives up to the esg label so it s important to strategically and rigorously conduct due diligence here s the recommended process by which my team can select our more than 25 recommended esg funds conduct a landscape assessment of all available funds select preliminary providers that carry the product we are looking for analyze each provider s sustainability or impact philosophy and their product conduct due diligence on them and schedule a series of interviews add product to our recommendations list pursue continual monitoring and validation of approved products for investors the important takeaway here is that an adviser s recommendations should be well informed impact investing is a large enough space that you can make informed choices among many options 4 respond to questions with data advisers may be anticipating questions from clients about returns on impact investing and as an investor you may have a lot of questions i like to answer these questions with data this is what informed investors want and need from an adviser for instance data on how u s sustainable open end funds and exchange traded funds continued to break records in 2020 according to morningstar increasing in number by 30 over 2019 during 2020 flows into us sustainable mutual funds and etfs reached 51 billion pushing the total of worldwide sustainable assets under management to 1 7 trillion according to morningstar the u s inflows were up sharply from 2019 when flows were 21 billion and nearly tenfold over 2018 when flows were 5 billion investing for impact doesn t mean compromising your financial objectives investment returns have been shown to be similar between sustainable indexes and the broader stock market according to morningstar we find that esg funds are generally well managed and tend to invest in companies with ceos who have the bottom line in mind not just esg but because of their esg commitments they are more attuned to the risks of having their product lines boycotted or picket lines in front of corporate offices or not being ranked by either morningstar msci or one of the other ratings firms quite simply they are more concerned with due diligence and that can boost their profitability making a difference doesn t just encompass lifestyle changes but changes to where we put our money as investors you have the opportunity to help finance a more sustainable world as wealth management professionals we have the privilege and responsibility of making that opportunity available and achievable michael pereira is head of bank of the west s wealth management group

many of the deported migrants who are now getting special invites to re enter the u s are so poor they need government aid for housing and healthcare according to the department of homeland security dhs the admission came in a july 19 statement to progressive contractors who want to be paid for wrapping the poor and unskilled migrants in the taxpayer funded federal welfare system the dhs statement said when appropriate the contractor shall collaborate with other providers contractors and stakeholders to help ensure a wraparound approach to services services include but are not limited to housing primary health care nutrition assistance legal assistance immigration and travel processes the housing aid is being offered to lawfully deported migrants who are being invited to return by joe biden s pro migration deputies progressives argue the aid is deserved because the migrants were unfairly separated from their children during the deportation process yet any housing given to migrants will raise americans rents including the rents paid by the poor and minority americans whom progressives claim to support the potential winners in any welfare wraparound contract include the university trained progressives in the various pro migration advocacy groups these progressives work with groups such as the aclu and large pro migration groups such as kids in need of defense kind which was created by brad smith microsoft s very wealthy pro migration president the progressives serve as cheerleaders and enablers for investors who want the government to extract poor consumers renters and workers from other countries for use in the u s economy the progressives embrace their supportive role even though the inflow gradually pushes many millions of ordinary americans out of decent jobs and good housing on july 21 axios com allowed the progressives to make their pitch for a wraparound contract at least a third of migrant families separated at the border during the trump administration and reunited in the u s so far under president biden were homeless initially three people familiar with estimates discussed by advocates and government officials told axios why it matters as the number of reunions grows such homelessness rates have the potential to significantly strain non governmental organizations already plagued by limited resources some 41 family reunifications have been completed on biden s watch with an estimated 2 100 families still separated that s too small a sample to gauge with certainty the extent of the housing needs moving forward parents are coming back with very little to no resources and coming back to very precarious situations said christie turner herbas kind s director of special programs the axios report also included a warning to biden s deputies it should be in the biden administration s interest not to see these families end up in homeless shelters lee gelernt the aclu s lead attorney in its family separation lawsuit told axios perhaps 2 000 of the deported migrants are being invited back in by dhs secretary alejandro mayorkas who has a limited parole authority to admit people for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit our highest priority is to reunite these families it s not about righting the wrong of the past it s about restoring the conscience of our government mayorkas said as he touted his return of four deported migrants in a may 4 appearance on msnbc the adult migrants were temporarily separated from their children as the adults were processed in the criminal courts while the children were sheltered in other centers some of the parents were sent home without their children and some choose to separate themselves from their children by leaving them behind in the united states so the children could apply for asylum investors and progressives stigmatized this law enforcement as family separation and zero tolerance as they opposed almost any effort to curb the flow of consumers renters and migrants across the border the pro enforcement policy began in july 2017 and lasted until january 2021 when it was quickly ended by biden s pro migration administration biden s deputies say the policy separated at perhaps 4 000 children from the parents amid the vast inflow of 2 million migrants but trump largely ended the migration inflow from mid 2019 once his deputies pushed out a series of reforms that were fought in court by the aclu and other investor funded lawyer groups trump s reduction in migration help nudge up salaries for americans for forcing employers to compete for american workers in a tight labor market in general legal and illegal migration moves wealth from employees to employers from families to investors from young to old from children to their parents from homebuyers to investors from technology to stoop labor biden s revived federal delivery of legal and illegal labor also helps to move wealth and social status from heartland red states to the coastal blue states and from the rural districts to the urban districts within each state obviously investors want to import more migrants even very poor migrants because they spike sales rental rates profits and stock values the dhs statement promises that aid to the migrants dubbed class members will be free of any obligations or costs terms of establishing contact for pre reunification and post reunification include informing the class member that all of the services being offered are voluntary and they shall not be penalized in any way for rejecting them informing the class member that this effort is not for dhs hhs or any government entity to track them but rather to aid in their recovery from traumatic separation informing the class member that engaging in these support or mental health services or even reaching out for more information shall not affect any efforts they may have been making towards obtaining legal status their housing any current or future social services any work they may be engaged in for their livelihood whether authorized or unauthorized and their right to obtain a work permit when authorized in june mayorkas said he will put the dignity of foreign migrants foremost in our efforts for example he ended the trump administration s public charge barring the award of green cards to migrants who would rely on taxpayer aid i felt and we collectively in the department felt that the rescission of that rule would not only restore dignity to the process but adhere to the rule of law he claimed

uneven recovery we hope all of you your families coworkers and friends are healthy and you re reengaging as global economy is open i m also pleased to report carlisle s covid 19 infection rates approach zero in the second quarter which wouldn t have happened without our team s strict adherence to our safety protocols and commitment to each other across our global footprint i m also very pleased that carlisle s performance continues to strengthen as we further accelerate into the economic recovery please turn to slide three vision 2025 has provided the clarity and consistency of direction that proved to be essential in guiding our efforts during the depths of the pandemic last year it continues to guide us today as we seek to leverage improving demand across our end markets in 2021 and beyond vision 2025 provides carlisle and our stakeholders a clear and direct vision that unites us in a collective goal which in turn drives our priorities and everyday actions we are very much on track to exceed the 15 of earnings per share targeted in vision 2025 our performance in the second quarter of 2021 illustrates our continued solid execution toward our stated goals several highlights of this continued progress include ccm s continued rebound in sales from the bottom of the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020 as a reminder ccm sales were down approximately 20 in the second quarter of last year as we entered the third quarter of last year we had already begun to see improvement sooner than many industries and that has continued sequentially through today that positive momentum drove 28 organic growth year over year at ccm in the second quarter of this year and added to a significant and growing backlog the rapid recovery from the lows of 2020 reinforced our confidence in this business as we commented on in the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call we envision 2021 being a year of challenges as pent up reroofing demand returned rapidly and supply chains distribution channels contractors and labor markets came under increasing pressure to deliver their services and meet customer expectations our conviction in the late fall of last year that all of the fundamental drivers of growth we saw prior to the pandemic were still in place led us to take significant action on securing raw materials ensuring production facilities were fully capable and putting in place pricing actions to offset what we anticipated to be significant raw material headwinds in the year looking at the future we continue to believe that the multi decade trends in reroofing demand increased emphasis on energy efficiency and tight labor markets will drive solid growth in our ccm business as a result we will continue to invest significant capital into our building products businesses a few recently announced examples of our steadfast commitment to ccm s future include our plans to invest more than 60 million to build a state of the art facility in sikeston missouri where we will manufacture energy efficient polyiso insulation we re also constructing our sixth tpo manufacturing line in carlisle pa which will produce the commercial roofing industry s first 16 foot wide tpo membranes we re breaking ground on phase two of the eur8 million expansion of our ccm waltershausen germany facility which as a reminder produces our unique epdm based restorix product and lastly a significant investment in our r d capabilities and manufacturing capacity in our cartersville georgia spray foam insulation business shifting gears to other parts of carlisle we continue to leverage the carlisle operating system to drive efficiencies across our platforms and geographies and in the second quarter cos delivered 1 savings as a percent of sales and continued to further its role as a culturally unifying continuous improvement foundation for carlisle employees globally in seeking to raise the return profile of carlisle companies we continue to focus on optimizing our business portfolio during the quarter we announced the divestiture of cbf and earlier this week we announced an agreement to acquire henry company which we will talk about later both changes to our portfolio will enhance long term value creation for our shareholders we continue to be a consistent and meaningful return of capital to our shareholders since 2016 we have returned over 1 8 billion in share repurchases alone bob will provide more details later but we continue to be active in the capital markets opportunistically repurchasing shares when appropriate we also anticipate continuing our long history of consistently raising our dividend and when completed in august will be our 45th consecutive year we re very proud of this symbolic act in the nature of nearly half a century of stability of our business model financial profile and commitment to our shareholders moving to slide four driven by the growing strength in our ccm business and momentum building at cft our revenue increased 22 year over year ccm had outstanding performance growing revenue 28 year over year cft continues to drive new product innovation and operational efficiencies to better leverage improving dynamics in its global end markets partially offsetting this growth was commercial aerospace which continues to weigh on cit with revenues declining 8 year over year in the quarter that said aerospace orders have stabilized and we have line of sight to continued sequential revenue improvement in 2021 while aerospace markets have been depressed our team at cit has remained focused on innovation and continuing our long term commitment to our customers and most importantly preparing for the inevitable recovery please turn to slide five carlisle construction materials segment continues to demonstrate its extremely durable business model and to execute very well in the face of numerous challenges ccm volumes in 2021 are benefiting from work postponed in 2020 due to the covid 19 pandemic and given both material and labor constraints we believe even more deferrals experienced in the first half of this year will only add to the pipeline of roofing contractors workload in the second half of 2021 we maintain our strong conviction in the sustainability of reroofing demand in the u s where we continue to expect the market to grow from 6 billion to 8 billion in the next decade we continue to be very proud of the ccm team s ability to keep the carlisle experience intact managing a record level of incoming orders ensuring we keep our contractors working and maintaining our commitment to being the best partner in the industry and i d like to take a moment to acknowledge our procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service teams for their tireless and extremely dedicated work without which the carlisle experience wouldn t be possible and as a reminder by the carlisle experience we mean ensuring delivery of the right product at the right place at the right time we do this by deploying industry leading investment in production and r d capabilities these investments have totaled over 300 million in the past five years we also continue to invest in best in class education for our channel partners on the latest roofing products and installation best practices including over 20 000 hours of virtual learning courses during the pandemic i mentioned our world class customer service team that processed over 65 000 orders in the second quarter a remarkable feat at nearly 2 times the normal quarter s activity we continue to innovate and provide value added products that ensure quicker more efficient and safer installation of our building envelope systems and solutions in an increasingly labor and material constrained environment finally and importantly we continue to focus on producing products that contribute to a better environment for all stakeholders a few comments on our other businesses cit s second quarter results were in line with subdued expectations given the ongoing disruption in the commercial aerospace market despite a difficult past 18 months the cit team is taking significant actions to position cit to be stronger when the market rebounds we acted to create more a more rational footprint in 2020 and 2021 closing three of our facilities and while these decisions are not taken lightly they were necessary to position cit to return to and exceed our legacy profitability levels when demand returns also during this time we have continued to invest in r d in order to build our new product pipeline and support our customers we continue to see some light at the end of the tunnel evidenced by improving leading indicators for commercial aerospace including the expanding vaccine rollout numbers of tsa daily screenings increasing from a low of 20 of normal last year to over 80 in july growing activity at our aircraft manufacturers and corresponding improvements in cit s order books all of this gives us confidence that cit is positioned for sequential improvement going forward cft delivered improved revenue and profitability performance in the second quarter driven by its reenergized commitment to new product introductions improved operational efficiencies price realization from earning the value that comes with innovation and an improved customer experience i m very heartened by the progress the team has made over the last year in improving our sales and profitability putting us back on track to achieve our expectations for this business we expect the team to continue executing on its vision 2025 growth strategy and to deliver continued improvement moving into the second half of 2021 turning to slide six hopefully everyone had the opportunity to listen to our call on monday during which we introduced our agreement to acquire henry company a best in class provider of building envelope systems that control the flow of water vapor air and energy and a building to optimize building sustainability henry delivered revenues of 511 million and adjusted ebitda of 119 million or 23 margin in the last 12 months ended may 31 2021 bob will review more of the financial details related to henry later in the call but we expect henry to add more than 1 25 of adjusted eps in 2022 all of us at carlisle are very excited to work with the henry team which has a proven track record of growth a very strong brand and a long history of new product innovation the announced agreement to acquire henry is another clear example of how we are executing on our vision 2025 strategy to optimize our portfolio which includes our efforts to expand further into the building envelope for those of you new to henry let me give you a few examples of how in practice henry complements ccm henry s large direct sales force who have been focused on helping architect specify waterproofing and air and vapor barriers can now assist in specifying ccm single ply roofing solutions on the same buildings additionally henry has a presence in the residential and big box marketplaces markets not previously a substantial part of ccm s business moving to slide seven our esg efforts also continue to gain momentum in april we published our 2020 sustainability report which built on the foundations of our first report in 2019 and for the first time the 2020 report disclosed in detail how carlisle was tracking on the global reporting initiative or gri standards we re also in the process of establishing achievable water energy and emission reduction targets based on detailed audits of our global facilities turning to diversity during the course of april carlisle employees participated in the ceo action for diversity inclusion day of understanding the day of understanding created a singular focal point in our year and is an opportunity for leaders to guide open dialogue about diversity in their workspace carlisle has been a member of the pwc led ceo action for diversity inclusion since 2018 and an organization that now includes over 2 000 ceo signatories in order for carlisle employees to participate in our ongoing success we issued a special stock option grant or equity equivalent of 100 shares to employees on may 2 2018 those shares vested in the second quarter of 2021 having appreciated almost 80 for each participating employee this meant a gain of over 8 000 i m very pleased the share has performed so well for our employees because carlisle s success wouldn t be possible without their efforts finally one area where we have made significant improvement is in our industry leading safety record our incident rate of approximately one quarter of the industry average demonstrates the work that has been done by all employees to ensure a safe workplace while staying ahead of the industry is important in the past six years our incident rate has fallen 52 of all of our tracked metrics this is especially meaningful because reducing employee injuries by 50 has had a tangible benefit and meaningful impact on people s lives to continue to drive the importance of safety in our operations in early 2020 we announced path to zero which represents our commitment to creating the safest possible work environment and features the goal of zero accidents and zero industries this program was launched globally in the second quarter of this year and now bob will provide operational and financial detail about the second quarter review our balance sheet and cash flow bob robert m roche chief financial officer thanks chris as chris mentioned earlier we had a very solid second quarter i m especially pleased about the margin expansion at ccm cit coming off market lows and positioned to deliver sequential growth for the next few quarters cft s order book improving our disciplined approach to capital deployment in the form of share repurchase and dividends continued investment in our high roic businesses to drive organic growth and our portfolio optimization actions including divesting cbf and the announced agreement to acquire henry company please turn to the revenue bridge on slide eight of the presentation revenue was up 22 in the second quarter driven by ccm and cft offset by the well documented commercial aerospace declines at cit organic revenue was up 20 7 ccm and cft each delivered greater than 25 organic growth in the quarter acquisitions contributed 0 4 of sales growth for the quarter and fx was a 90 basis point tailwind on slide nine we have provided an adjusted eps bridge where you can see second quarter adjusted eps was 2 16 which compares to 1 95 last year volume price and mix combined were 1 30 year over year increase raw material freight and labor costs were a 0 95 headwind interest and tax together were a 0 01 headwind share repurchases contributed 0 07 and cos contributed an additional 0 12 higher opex was a 0 32 headwind year over year half of which is related to the may vesting and cash settlement of stock appreciation rights granted to all carlisle employees outside the us in 2018 with the remainder reflecting the resumption of more normalized expense level versus last year s cost containment measures taken in the depths of the pandemic now let s turn to slide 10 our second quarter performance by segment in more detail at ccm the team again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 27 5 driven by volume and price along with 70 basis points of foreign currency translation tailwind all of ccm s product lines delivered 20 growth with particular strength in architectural metals and spray foam insulation ccm effectively managed raw material inflation headwinds experienced in the quarter with disciplined pricing proactive sourcing and allocating products to strategic customers adjusted ebitda margin at ccm was 21 5 in the second quarter a 60 basis point decline from last year driven by higher raw material prices partially offset by volumes price and cos savings despite raw materials being a headwind in the second quarter we continue to anticipate net neutral price raws for the full year adjusted ebitda grew 24 to 201 2 million again demonstrating the earnings power of our ccm business please turn to slide 11 our cit results cit revenue declined 8 2 in the second quarter as has been well publicized this decline was driven by the pandemic s continued impact on commercial aerospace markets we still anticipate a prolonged recovery in aerospace but are optimistic there will be resumption in growth as we enter the second half of the year cit s medical platform continues to build a robust pipeline of projects with an increasing backlog we continue to expect sequential improvement from pent up demand as the impacts of covid hospital capex and postponed elective surgeries ease cit s adjusted ebitda margins declined year over year to 8 driven by commercial aerospace volumes partially offset by price cos and lower expenses given the positive indicators we are optimistic that cit will deliver sequentially improving financial performance into the second half of 2021 turning now to slide 12 cft s sales grew 54 year over year organic revenue improved 44 3 and acquisitions added 3 6 in the quarter fx contributed 6 cft is well positioned to accelerate through the recovery due to continued stabilization in key end markets driven by an improved industrial capital spending outlook in 2021 coupled with new product introductions would have included 4 1 million of incremental new product sales in 2021 year to date along with our continued pricing results adjusted ebitda margins of 15 9 or over 100 basis point improvement from last year this improvement primarily reflects volume price and mix on slide 13 and 14 we show selected balance sheet metrics our balance sheet remains strong we ended the quarter with 713 million of cash on hand and 1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility we continue to approach capital deployment in a balanced and disciplined manner investing in organic growth through capital expenditures and opportunistically repurchasing shares while also actively seeking strategic and synergistic acquisitions in the quarter we repurchased 643 000 shares for 116 million bringing our 2021 year to date total to 1 6 million shares for 266 million we paid 28 million of dividends in the second quarter bringing our 221 total to 56 million we invested 32 million of capex into our high returning businesses to drive organic growth bringing our 2021 total to 55 million a few examples of these investments include our new missouri polyiso facility expansion of our tpo line carlisle pa and investment in our spray foam capabilities in cartersville georgia in addition as has been noted we announced an agreement to purchase henry company for 1 75 billion henry generated revenue of 511 million and adjusted ebitda of 119 million representing a 23 ebitda additionally henry was expected to deliver 100 million of free cash flow in our first year of ownership we also expect meaningful cost synergies of 30 million by 2025 finally we expect henry to be immediately accretive to carlisle s ebitda margin adding over 1 25 of adjusted eps in 2022 free cash flow for the quarter was 64 6 million a 54 decline year over year due to increased working capital usage related to our high sales growth of 22 turning to slide 15 you can see the outlook for 2021 in corporate items corporate expense is now expected to be approximately 125 million up from the previous estimate of 120 million the increase is wholly related to the vesting and cash settlement of our stock appreciation rights discussed earlier we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately 210 million we still expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 120 for the full year we continue to invest in our business and expect capital expenditures of approximately 150 million net interest expense is still expected to be approximately 75 million for the year and we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 25 finally restructuring is expected in 2021 to be approximately 20 million and with that i ll turn the call back over to chris chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer thanks bob entering the third quarter we continue to be very optimistic about the remainder of 2021 from record backlogs at ccm to supportive trends in cit aerospace markets to growing strength at cft coupled with excellent sourcing and price discipline and significant traction on our esg journey we are confident in our ability to deliver solid results for all carlisle stakeholders for full year 2021 we anticipate the following at ccm as previously mentioned the trends that began in q3 2020 gain momentum as we moved into 2021 we anticipate this momentum to carry over in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 considering this momentum coupled with record backlogs stemming from project deferrals that occurred in 2020 positive momentum in our newer businesses of architectural metals and spray foam and expansion of our european business we are increasing our anticipated revenue growth to high teens in 2021 at cit we are encouraged by leading indicators trending positive but it remains difficult to gauge when a complete recovery in commercial aerospace will occur given a very difficult year over year comparison in the first and second quarters we continue to expect cit revenue will decline in the mid to high single digit range in full year 2021 at cft with end market strengthening and improvements in the team s execution of our key strategies we now expect mid teens revenue growth in 2021 and finally for carlisle as a whole we are now increasing our expectations to mid teens revenue growth in 2021 as we pass the midpoint of 2021 we are tracking to deliver our vision 2025 goals of 8 billion in revenues 20 operating income and 15 roic all driving to exceed 15 of earnings per share by 2025 despite lingering uncertainties around covid supply chain constraints and what we perceive as near term raw material inflation carlisle s employees across the globe remain focused on the execution of the strategies and key actions that support vision 2025 our team continues to embody a positive and entrepreneurial spirit a commitment to continuous improvement and a focus on delivering results for the carlisle shareholder given our 100 year plus history and the resilience this company has shown in times of adversity and uncertainty we remain confident in carlisle s outlook our strong financial foundation cash generating capabilities unwavering commitment to our vision 2025 strategic plan and to providing products and services essential to the world s needs this concludes our formal comments zen we re now ready for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of bryan blair of oppenheimer bryan blair oppenheimer analyst thanks good afternoon guys chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer good afternoon bryan bryan blair oppenheimer analyst great performance in ccm actually we re flirting with normal seasonality sequential seasonality which i didn t think was possible given the supply chain constraints that you ve called out and that are so pervasive to what extent did raw material availability freight other constraints impact ccm s ability to meet demand in the quarter chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer well as we discussed the team did a great job managing it and i don t think it really impacted their ability to meet the demand that was present in the quarter obviously the surge in orders takes into account some more reserve that are for the third quarter and fourth quarter and we continue to work to fulfill all of those but the team did a great job in meeting all the demand that was put through it in the second quarter bryan blair oppenheimer analyst understood and thinking about the third quarter are there any incremental watch items in terms of the listed constraints that we should think about in terms of ccm s ability to meet demands and an extension of that what kind of growth rate are you assuming as we bridge to the high teens guide chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer yeah bryan we don t see i mean again there s a lot going on in the world with delta variant and everything else but we don t see a lot of changes from what happened in the second quarter going into the third we would expect raw materials to i m going to say loosen up a little they have been loosening up since the beginning of the year more and more since the problems in texas and the freeze and everything so we can we see that continuing slightly so we don t see a lot of watch out items on our list and we re going in today we d expect i m going to say normal growth you expect third quarter to be somewhat higher than the second quarter so i think the growth rate will continue going into the third with normal like you said normal seasonality where third quarter s larger than the second and then shrinking a bit in the fourth as always happens into the winter months robert m roche chief financial officer yeah and bryan i would just add one thing that i think we the results were encouraging and it s interesting to talk about normal seasonality but we really are still in the midst of an extraordinary time just as impactful was going down was last year into the declines we had i think coming back has been something that is not normal and i think the ccm team has done a superb job of managing through all of that like you said and getting close to normal seasonality but we still want to communicate the fact that it s a very difficult environment throughout the business from supply chain all the way to order entry as we discussed bryan blair oppenheimer analyst completely understood one last one for me in the revised high teens sales growth guide for ccm how should we think about the volume first price contribution for the year robert m roche chief financial officer yes bryan that s mostly going to be price but there is some volume increase in there as well bryan blair oppenheimer analyst okay so the step up from low double digits to high teens is mostly price robert m roche chief financial officer yeah mostly price as raw s continue to increase we as discussed needed to continue to increase price to keep up with that bryan blair oppenheimer analyst got it okay thanks guys chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer thanks bryan operator your next question comes from the line of tim wojs of baird equity research tim wojs baird equity research analyst good afternoon chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer good afternoon robert m roche chief financial officer hi tim tim wojs baird equity research analyst nice work i guess first question could you just talk a little bit about how you re managing the backlog just there s chatter that like people are double ordering and trying to get products from anybody they can so how are you kind of controlling that just to make sure that you actually have real backlog robert m roche chief financial officer well certainly we can t we don t know because we don t have the customers mind as to what s a real order and what s not a real order we treat all orders the same and then what we re really doing is just prioritizing them based on the necessity of shipping and in addition to that obviously a customer an existing customer that s been a longtime customer for carlisle is going to be prioritized over someone that s being opportunistic so i think again we re doing in a very rational way and we re attempting to maintain that carlisle experience and ensuring that the contractors that needed to have that product there and making sure that we re not having any inventory or products sit around somewhere on a job site or in a warehouse but the people that need the product to put on the roof or getting it done and i think the team is doing a good job of that but obviously that involves a lot of heavy lifting on the part of the sales force on the part of customer service to coordinate a lot of work there so i think as we to your point on the extra ordering as we get through the year we don t see it impacting the projections that we ve made that will sort itself out as we begin to continue to fulfill these orders and then i d say just we ll check in as we get closer to the winter and we ll know where we are so as i mentioned to brian it s such evolving environment and this recovery has been so rapid and the demand has been in a lot of industry s so strong that i think we just focus on the near term and make sure again that we re delivering on that carlisle experience for the contractor that needs it today tim wojs baird equity research analyst okay okay good and then i think you guys are definitely taking share where would you kind of peg the market at relative to your high teens sales growth and i guess what s your confidence that once some of these supply chain issues settle down that you can hang on to some of that share gain longer term chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer well i ll take the last one first i think we view these last year and this year these disturbances these really trying times as opportunities and probably the best opportunity for contractors distributors end users architects to see the really true carlisle experience and the work that our team does i mean when everything is going smoothly you don t understand that how powerful that experience is and so what i would hope is that as we are introduced to new customers as people that are with other suppliers decide to try carlisle that they are overwhelmed by the experience and decide to make that permanent shift is that always occur i can t tell you what level of people or what percentage of the people that get material from us for the first time stay with us but my guess is that it s contributed to our growth over the last few years and we ll continue to do that so that s our goal to continue to perform well continue to perform better than anyone else and make sure that people see that and want to be part of that team i think on the other side of the growth side and bob may have some comments on that but i think that the industry right now and the recovery probably market shares have not moved much relative to overall demand just because demand has been so heavy so again what i would look for is to run through the year let s sort out those orders you talked about that there may be some over ordering and then get into 2022 hopefully we ll have a more normal year and then we ll be able to assess our progress versus the industry and versus our competitors bob do you want to add anything robert m roche chief financial officer that s good chris tim wojs baird equity research analyst okay good i ll hop back in queue thanks guys robert m roche chief financial officer yeah thanks tim chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tim operator next question comes from the line of joel tiss from bank of montreal joel tiss bank of montreal analyst hey guys how s it going chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer hey joel joel tiss bank of montreal analyst all right so i m going to switch gears a little bit i wonder it s kind of an off the wall question but you think it would make any sense for you guys to think about like spinning out everything that s not ccm that would kind of accelerate your move to 2025 maybe not on the revenue side but certainly on the margin side chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer well i don t think it would make any sense right now and the only reason i say that is i think that certainly valuations it would be very hard to find a valuation from a purely pragmatic perspective on any business given ccm s declines and given the fact that cst has not probably reached its full potential after the years of work we put into it but there s still more to come so what i would yeah i would just say that s probably not a thought that s now in our mind i mean we want to continue to boost the building products portion of our business around ccm adding henry does that that gives us a lot to digest and to focus on i think we wait until things get through the sustainable growth recovery that and runway that we see in cit and cft and then joel as we ve always done we just assessed the portfolio and i think that s something that s gone back as long as i ve been at carlisle everything from divesting of carlisle tire wheel motion control food service and making additions like accella petersen and that we re always looking at the portfolio and obviously we make all our decisions based on what s best for the carlisle shareholders so it s something we always look at but i don t see any actions in the near term joel tiss bank of montreal analyst and then as you build out your building envelope and it s starting to get pretty serious is there any way or to team up with like a carrier or a train or someone who s doing sort of building assessments to help the buildings get more efficient and lower their costs and all that is there any way to team up with those guys to get like spec ed into to being part of that energy audit and helping them get to their goals chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer sure and i think i don t know about those two companies in particular but i do know that every day our teams and ccm through their connections with the industry organizations through their connections to architects through large building owners people who are putting in warehousing data centers things like that you can t help but think that as esg as energy efficiency becomes a bigger priority for all those end users and building owners that they re going to almost drive cooperation so that we re getting we re making sure that as we re putting on that building envelope and ensuring that it s a it s got great insulation vapor water air barriers things like that that they re also asking the provider of that energy unit that s either heating and cooling to participate and have some coordination i think a lot of that occurs at the design level with architecture and specifies and as we mentioned both with carlisle and with our henry team they re going to spend a lot of time with those organizations so i think you re on the right track i just i can t comment on carrier or train because i just don t know but i would imagine those conversations are being had joel tiss bank of montreal analyst well that s great thank you very much robert m roche chief financial officer you bet joel chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question comes from the line of saree boroditsky of jefferies saree boroditsky jefferies analyst hi good afternoon chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer good afternoon robert m roche chief financial officer good afternoon saree saree boroditsky jefferies analyst within cit could you just talk about what you saw in the quarter from medical versus aerospace and then how do those growth rates are expected to look for the remainder of the year and then any color as we start to think about 2022 robert m roche chief financial officer yes i ll take the last one first saree i mean i don t think we re ready to talk about 2022 yet now certainly we expect growth at cit and continued ramp in our profitability but we re a long way from what s going to happen with aerospace getting into 2022 at this point in time medical versus aerospace in the quarter were almost the same decline and that s largely due to the massive orders or i m going to say revenue we saw last second quarter if you remember we talked about a big spike in orders when covid hit in shipments in the quarter so in medical so that s why it was relatively flat but we expect acceleration faster acceleration in medical going to the end of the year than we do in aerospace but we expect some growth in aerospace saree boroditsky jefferies analyst got it and then you raised the outlook for cft could you just talk about the outlook for industrial capex projects what are you hearing from customers and then again i ll just ask should that strength continue as you think about going into next year chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer i think we see the industrial space continuing to improve out of the depths of 2020 and improvement in production and that i think the other thing that i would remind you is cft we did have some difficulties when we first bought that business and there were share losses and i think part of the gains are getting back what is what i would call their rightful share through their innovation and new products and really good work by the teams in communicating the value proposition so i think it s a combination of that that markets are improving industrial markets are improving we think they ll continue to improve globally as we go throughout the year and then i think there s a piece of that too that is just getting its stride back and becoming a solid carlisle company bob do you want to add anything robert m roche chief financial officer nope that was clear chris saree boroditsky jefferies analyst thanks for taking my questions i ll pass it on chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer thanks saree operator next question comes from kevin hocevar of northcoast research kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good afternoon everybody nice job there chris i m trying to wrap my head around one of the comments you made i think in your prepared remarks i think you had mentioned in the ccm business you had received 65 000 orders in the quarter which is double the usual amount so i guess i m just trying to understand what that means i mean is that again a sign that there s some double ordering going on is it maybe distributors trying to build some inventory even maybe contractors get some product on the job site even if they don t need it yet just because things are so tight is it backlog building in a pretty material way i guess and does that mean there ll be less orders in the third and fourth quarter is it some panic buying i guess i m just trying to understand because it seems like a pretty interesting stat i m just in my head around i m curious if you can just elaborate on that a bit chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer yes well i think one of the things that we probably will need to do later is give the reference point in 2019 because without that reference point double the previous period you don t have a good reference for where we were in 2019 to gauge that i think the other thing is on the double ordering i d be careful about that because as we know last year people were not ordering we talked at length about how distribution going into the season had cut back on orders people were concerned about whether they d be on the job i mean it was only a year ago that states like pennsylvania and cities like boston weren t allowing contractors on the job site in certain cases they were increasing the ppe and the other protocols making more difficult we were having inspections occurring virtually it was hard to get permits pulled because governmental agencies were shut down so and we think that now we re in the second quarter but you have to remember that was some of that stuff there was still concern in the first quarter the things were happening and we did get ahead of it in production as we mentioned we got to ahead in our pricing but there s still some lag there out in the market until the confidence came back that the contractor and the distributors that would be able to function somewhat normally so i think there is a surge there and i think a lot of those orders i have no reason to believe that most of them actually occurred in the quarter aren t real because i do think there s pent up demand people were waiting that s what we talked about is demand to continue to build and if you think about even not including 25 of the orders in a year and letting them build in the back half of 2020 and then the first quarter of 2021 one would expect a pretty substantial surge in the second quarter of this year and then we ll just need to monitor and when we get to the third quarter of this year it will be we can do that same check and then have a comparison because we ve been through the heavy and last part of the season getting into the winter months so i won t read too much into it other than demand is strong and we are coming out of this pandemic strong and people are gaining confidence and they re placing orders and they re getting back on the roof and they got a lot of backlog to make up yes kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst okay that s helpful and in terms of the increased guidance just one quick question there so the low double digit to high teens increase in ccm it sounds like the majority of that is pricing is that pricing increase based on what you ve currently kind of realized between price increases that have already taken effect or i know there s also like an august increase you have out there for a lot of roofing products is there some assumptions of future pricing as well baked into that guidance robert m roche chief financial officer no that includes obviously the announced price for august but no nothing beyond that at this point kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst okay got you and then just last question what was in terms of the price cost dynamics what was that in the second quarter and it sounds like the expectation is a continuation of neutral for the year so is there any change in the expectation of i mean obviously there s been a lot of moving pieces since three months ago in terms of the inflation expectations and the pricing expectations so but maybe is the kind of the trajectory it sounds like it might not be the expectation of the net of that might not be all that different but curious what it was in the quarter and then kind of the how you see that playing out in the balance of the year robert m roche chief financial officer yes certainly the net s not different but certainly with our increase in revenue based on price we ve gotten a lot more cost pressure and assumed a lot more price traction over the last three months as costs have continued to rise and be up there we are a lot more confident that we need the price to cover it q2 was about 25 million negative as we expected and we expect to make that up in the second half of the year more in the fourth quarter than the third quarter but positive in both those quarters to make up for what we were short this quarter kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst okay all right thank you very much robert m roche chief financial officer thanks kevin operator next question comes from the line of garik shmois of loop capital garik shmois loop capital analyst thanks for taking my question chris just curious you made a comment in your prepared remarks around allocating products to strategic customers i m just wondering if you could expand on that is it really more of a function that because you re effectively at full capacity you can be selective and service your i guess higher margin higher quality customers or any kind of additional color on that comment would be helpful chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think that our customers we have some a lot of very loyal customers that work very hard to make sure carlisle is specified and chosen throughout the world actually and we don t want to make decisions in a quarter and we want to have share gains but we want to make sure that the work we re doing with people because it is pretty extensive we spend a lot of time working with our contractors on things like warranty inspections and on helping prepare quotes in that that we always want to strategically give our efforts to those distributors contractors those that are with us for the long run and have invested significantly in the carlisle brand so i don t think it s anything while we stated i don t think it s anything other than our normal practice there that we expect a lot out of our partners and they would expect a lot out of us in terms of loyalty as well garik shmois loop capital analyst okay thanks and just on the building envelope business you called out spray foam and metal roofing going book over 40 in the quarter it sounds like that the entire building envelope business was up over 20 in the quarter what s the outlook there i guess what i m asking given that business has been more exposure to housing is there any pause that you might be seeing at all just with the pause in new housing just given the inflation in the market and the builder is pulling back a bit any help on the building that would be extremely helpful chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer no i think on the metal side petersen is pretty much a commercial metal business and i think there we re seeing a lot of movement into metal as it becomes architecturally more attractive as it has some renewable and recyclable aspects to it we re just finding it s gaining traction there s some very positive trends there and petersen has done an excellent job of adopting the carlisle experience which they probably call it the petersen experience before but it s a great brand with great coverage and good relationships on the drexel side which is a little bit more on the residential side again we re seeing people are choosing metal roofs in a lot of cases there s more interest in drexel has a very unique value proposition where they are actually preparing that work right on site and driving a lot of value so as that team gets out and demonstrates the value proposition they re gaining a lot of traction on the spray foam side we originally bought accella we talked about that high single digit industry growth rate as people would adopt foam as a far superior insulator and some in certain cases vapor barrier components to it and what we re really just seeing is that continued traction versus other forms of insulation and certainly here in the southwest with the heat and even in the north i know being from minnesota and living in arizona spray foam insulation just provides a superior solution for the space and the wall cavity and just drives great performance and we see it just continuing to gain share in the marketplace so i think the trends are positive for both and then we on top of that we re adding very positive unique value propositions with each business and i would be remiss if i didn t say that the partnership between cft with their newly launched spray foam equipment which provides superior on ratio performance it s got better heating capabilities in the competition a much better performing product coupled with our spray foam coming out of ccm has also created a lot of interest with the end users and is helping us drive the preference for our brands so actually we re excited about all of those businesses and what they ve done garik shmois loop capital analyst okay and i guess just one follow up in the guide you took your ccm guidance up largely on price was there any change to the underlying assumptions on the envelope side of the ccm robert m roche chief financial officer no garik they re mostly in line and those are up in price as well commodities that go into metal roofing and in the spray foam are just as volatile as the flat roofing commodity so we need to get price in those as well to keep up with our flat price cost garik shmois loop capital analyst okay fair point thanks again chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thank you garik operator there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to chris please go ahead chris koch chairman president and chief executive officer thanks zen and thanks everybody this concludes our second quarter 2020 earnings call or 2021 excuse me and thanks for your

joined here today by our president and ceo peter arvan and i m very happy to say by our next cfo melanie hart we ll start as usual today with opening remarks by pete peter arvan president chief executive officer thank you mark and good morning to everyone on the call beginning in may of last year as the country came to grips with the pandemic and its effects on everyday life across north america and europe homeowners interest in swimming pools and anything to do with outdoor living surged the steady growth that we d seen over the years kick into overdrive as people realize that investing in their own backyard they could enjoy a family friendly safe healthy outdoor living experience right at home demand for in ground pools above ground pools luxury patios and outdoor kitchens spiked creating demand that quickly soaked up any available builder capacity this surge in demand has not let up and continues through today as our builders and remodelers are telling us for the most part they are booked through year end and in many cases into 2022 our retailers are also reporting robust store traffic as well this morning following an exceptional first quarter we reported that our second quarter total earning total sales came in at a record 1 8 billion which is a 40 increase over the second quarter of 2020 which was up 14 over 2019 this is our largest quarter ever and our seasonally most significant quarter of the year thanks to the tremendous efforts and hard work of our team that is executing at an incredible level the support from our supplier partners and the perseverance of our customers together we helped more people enjoy the healthy safe outdoor living experience than ever before from a base business perspective sales increased 32 with acquisitions accounting for 8 of our quarterly growth inflation as we have previously mentioned has been above average this year and is trending to 5 to 6 for the year in total this has had no meaningful impact on demand and has passed through the channel as is typically the case overall the unprecedented demand for our products has strained the manufacturing capacity and supply chains in the industry in times like this we use our strong balance sheet the robust network of sales centers and tremendous execution to help our customers keep projects moving forward so families can enjoy their backyard and escape by and large the manufacturers are finding ways to increase production which when combined with the industry seasonality should ease some of the shortages that have played the industry this year allowing supply chains to function more normally as the year progresses looking at base business in our four largest markets california saw a sales increase of 33 florida sales increased 35 texas saw sales decline by 30 and arizona sales increased 24 for the quarter overall our year round base business markets increased by 31 while the seasonal markets increased by 33 this growth is a testament to the strong demand throughout the entire business now let me provide some product sales details for our base business even with the strained supply chains equipment sales which include heaters pumps filters lighting and automation all used in the construction remodel and maintenance of swimming pools posted record sales up 35 in the quarter following a 62 gain in the first quarter again what is most significant about this result is that it occurred in our seasonally biggest quarter when industry capacity is most challenged and our comps the most difficult from an industry perspective chemicals which have been a challenge to supply this year with the widely known industry shortages our sales increased by 28 in the quarter pricing represented 19 of the increase while volume accounted for 9 persistent shortages in trichlor and dichlor have driven increased demand for alternatives such as liquid chlorine in calcium hypochlorite which most recently have seen supply interruptions of their own in elevated stock outs across our network as teams grapple with industry shortages in most cases this results in intermittent stock outs across some of our network that can last a day or two as seasonal demand for chemicals is peaking soon we expect the situation to ease in the coming months building material demand remains strong as construction and remodel activity is brisk our sales in this product category grew by 33 in the quarter following a similar growth number in the first quarter retail products posted a 20 gain driven by a larger installed base and elevated usage levels although here too the shortage in chemicals and other products is limiting growth commercial pool products continue to rebound as leisure travel has resumed and resort hotel and municipal pools reopened for the quarter sales in this product group increased 45 coming off a weak second quarter in 2021 where sales fell by 21 due to the covid lockdowns currently sales in this category are being dominated by maintenance and repair products as large commercial construction projects are just beginning to get traction again last year we completed four acquisitions three blue and one green and to date we have completed two more blue acquisitions all are performing well and being integrated into our network which will make them even better our deal pipeline and expansion plans are robust and remain a focus area for the business year to date 2021 we have opened nine new locations seven on the blue side and two on the green side let me now take you across the atlantic and provide some commentary on our european business sales remains brisk and growth strong for the second quarter we saw sales grow by 42 bringing the year to date growth to an incredible 62 our team is executing at the highest level and benefiting from a similarly strong market that we are seeing in north america being a multi line distributor versus a distributor manufacturer allows us to be more flexible and provide customers more options in a supply constrained environment this has allowed us to take significant share turning to our horizon business we are very pleased to report that sales growth continues to be strong as the business posted another terrific quarter with sales up 31 for the same period base business sales increased 24 versus last year as mentioned above year to date we ve opened two new locations one in california and the other in florida while continuing to execute our strategic plan of organic growth greenfield expansion and acquisitions as we develop our pipeline in targeted areas let me now switch my commentary to gross margin expenses and operating income first on gross margins we are very pleased to have reported a gain of 170 basis points for the quarter and a 200 basis point gain from our base business this improvement was driven by supply chain execution inflation benefits and product mix melanie will provide more color on this topic operating expense performance was spectacular given the volume growth our opex as a percentage of sales improved by 117 basis points for the quarter has been driven by the team s execution and a relentless focus on capacity creation activity pool360 sales grew by 56 and accounted for 12 of our sales for the quarter the importance of this tool continues to increase as it enables both our customers and pool corp to be more efficient in how we operate wrapping up the income statement i could not be prouder of what our team delivered in operating income the record 339 million in operating income for the quarter was a 64 increase over the same period last year our team s skill dedication and commitment to the customer experience is second to none this along with the benefits of our business model continue to set us apart from the competition and enable us to continue to take share in this challenging environment our ability to consistently drive organic growth and manage our cost structure through execution and capacity creation is a testament to the team here at pool corp with this in mind and the half of the year behind us we are raising and narrowing our eps guidance for the year from previously 11 85 to 12 60 to 13 75 to 14 25 per diluted share including the 0 29 year to date tax benefit that we have received looking forward there are several factors and trends that give us confidence for continued growth beyond 2021 first the single family housing market remains strong driven by millennials entering the housing market for the first time the urbanization and the southern migration all of which are very positive factors for both the blue and the green business as people move to the sun belt states with longer outdoor living season they see the value of investing in a pool patio outdoor kitchen or remodel project which is driving demand for our products second the work from home change that has swept across north america is also creating more time to enjoy a luxury backyard retreat this trend looks like it will continue longer term third new products such as automation and the connected pool simply increase our sales opportunity on every project as people become familiar with this new user friendly technology fourth new in ground pool installations were 96 000 pools last year and are forecasted to grow to more than 110 000 pools this year as our builders are reporting stronger backlogs that continue into 2022 each new pool adds to the maintenance and repair market going forward which by far is the largest part of our industry fifth inflation which is higher than normal this year will likely continue with elevated levels into 2022 sixth the new variable speed pump legislation that goes into effect this month will add 30 million to 40 million of incremental revenue opportunity going forward seventh our relentless focus on the customer experience and our expansion plans are allowing us to take significant share and we see that continuing going forward finally acquisitions will continue to play a role in our growth as we continue to build and execute our deal pipeline as part of our strategic plan as you can see we have many reasons to be optimistic about the future and we expect to continue the track record of success that we have demonstrated over the years i will now turn the call over to melanie hart for her financial commentary melanie hart chief financial officer i am very pleased to be joining you all this morning i will cover some of the details of our second quarter financial results as pete has provided an overview of our sales activity in the quarter i will begin my commentary with some additional discussions on gross margins gross margins increased 170 basis points during the quarter with base business gross margins up 200 basis points these increases exceeded the expectations expressed on our first quarter call first we saw benefits from our supply chain initiatives which included a focus on accelerating purchases ahead of vendor price increases to limit stock outs where possible in today s tight supply conditions next with our increased purchase volumes we also expect improvements in the rate earned under our vendor progress additionally we realized some improvements in gross margin during the 2021 second quarter from product mix changes as a larger portion of our sales was comprised of lower margin bigger ticket items in prior year lastly customer mix changes also had a positive impact on margins for the quarter moving down the p l to expenses our consolidated quarter to date operating expenses were up 27 with base business operating expenses increasing 18 over prior year on base business sales growth of 32 base business operating expenses were down 140 basis points as a percentage of sales variable expenses such as those related to personnel and freight costs that are necessary to serve our increased business activity were very well managed by the team during the quarter included in these expenses is our performance based compensation we recorded an additional 7 million over prior year during the quarter and 19 million more year to date given our exceptionally strong performance operating margin grew 280 basis points to 18 9 for the quarter the five acquisitions added since second quarter of last year have performed well contributing 11 million or 11 operating margin the operating margin contribution from these acquisitions was below our base business operating margins and like underperforming sales centers and new locations of which we opened nine new locations in the past 12 months represent additional opportunity for operating income growth overtime interest expense declined from the same time last year as lower debt levels resulted in lower overall borrowing costs our average debt for second quarter 2021 was 376 8 million compared to the same period last year of 493 4 million our recurring tax rate continues to be around 25 on pre tax earnings we realized an additional asg tax benefit of 7 7 million or 0 19 per share from stock option exercises that occurred during the quarter bringing the reported rate to 22 9 for the quarter i ll now move to our balance sheet and cash flows our growth in current assets over last year reflects an increase in total net receivables of 29 including the effect of acquisitions made after the second quarter of last year this is driven by sales growth in the quarter offset by strong collections activity we realized a reduction in dso or days sales outstanding to 25 8 days down from 28 5 days during the same quarter last year inventories were up in total 42 or 36 not considering the inventories we added for acquisitions we continue to leverage our capital strength and sourcing scale to add inventories to support the demand increases and maintain customer service levels inventory turns on a trailing four quarter basis increased to 4 1 from 3 5 in second quarter of 2020 cash provided by operations through the end of june was 187 2 million this is down 33 9 million from the same quarter last year primarily due to increased inventory investments prior year also benefited from deferred tax payments that shifted from june to july in 2020 as part of the covid relief package cash flow for the year are expected to remain strong but we may continue to prioritize investments in inventory over cash generation as we believe our strong inventory position has allowed us to gain share for the year we ve also been focused on returning excess cash to shareholders in may the board increased the authorization of share buyback by 450 million during the quarter we spent 19 million in addition to the 66 million repurchased in first quarter returning a total of 85 million to shareholders year to date these repurchases resulted in total shares acquired of almost 243 000 for an average price paid of 348 leaving 542 million on our repurchase authority we also increased the quarterly dividend rate during the quarter by 38 our debt levels remain lower than our targeted range with a trailing 12 month ratio of 0 5 at quarter end giving us substantial capacity and flexibility to support our business needs and execute on capital investment opportunities i ll now turn the call over to mark to provide comments on our expectations for the remainder of the year mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer thank you melanie those are my comments today with some perspective on our second quarter financial results for each of the last two quarters i have alluded to our results looking like the work of some sort of modern day renaissance masters in hindsight i think i should have saved my superlatives for this q2 results which are the real work of the master at the peak of the season when demand is greatest our customers needs are most urgent and our supply chain is the most stressed delivering the kind of results we achieved this quarter is the embodiment of a team effort that is truly exceptional and demonstrates incredibly high level of execution our second quarter was the combination of a frenetic year in the pool industry that really showcase the talent of our team as well as the value of our business model looking back over the last year our trailing 12 months of financial highlights included 40 revenue growth and cumulative sales of 4 8 billion 84 basis points of gross margin expansion and 350 basis points of operating margin expansion while delivering a return on invested capital of 50 all remarkable results in addition we had a balanced deployment of capital over this 12 month period with 125 million in capital used to acquire five companies and nearly 200 million returned to shareholders evenly split between dividends and share repurchases and we invested 26 million in pp e primarily to support investments in technology and new locations we also invested just over 200 million in working capital in 2021 ahead of our seasonal business peak to be in the best position possible to serve our customers throughout our supply constraint environment as a matter of note our sales growth over the last year of 1 4 billion was just a bit more than our total sales when i joined the company back in 2004 clearly our marketplace has evolved at a rapid pace over the course of the last year and as our performance and our outlook for the future which continues to be very positive at this point i ll share some insights into the factors included in our guidance range using the midpoint of our new guidance range as a measuring stick and comparing the new range to the old you can see that we raised our expectations by 15 for the year this is a result of three factors better overall q2 performance than expected with higher sales growth and bigger gross margin gains than we had factored into our previous range expectations for somewhat higher sales growth and better gross margin performance for the remainder of the year and lastly the 7 7 million or 0 19 share benefit from our asu tax gain in the second quarter that was not in our previous range our previous range had anticipated sales growth for the year in excess of 20 our new range which of course as q2 baked into it anticipates sales growth in excess of 25 for the year with greater growth in q3 than in q4 as past become increasingly difficult as a reminder our q3 2020 sales growth was 27 while q4 2020 sales growth was 44 which was aided by a very favorable weather conditions and included acquisitions which will be lapped this year while we assume normal weather for the rest of the year in our guidance range favorable fourth quarter weather this year could see us reach a milestone of 5 billion in revenue for the full year as i noted our gross margin expectations for the remainder of the year have also improved with year over year gross margin gains now anticipated in both the third and fourth quarters so much less improvement in the fourth quarter given the 70 basis points of margin pickup we recorded in q4 of 2020 despite inflationary pressures on our operating costs and growth in certain discretionary business expenses that have been pared back during the pandemic we expect to continue to manage expenses well and could achieve as much as 250 to 300 basis points operating margin improvement in 2021 over 2020 with the majority of additional gains for the back half of the year coming in q3 with that i will turn the call back over to our operator to begin our question and answer session questions and answers operator the first question comes from david manthey with baird please go ahead david manthey baird analyst all right thank you good morning everyone peter arvan president chief executive officer good morning david manthey baird analyst yeah and mark congratulations what a run it s been fantastic good luck mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer yeah thank you david i appreciate it david manthey baird analyst yeah so as far as the quarter goes here i think the gross margin is a good place to start this quarter you clearly jumped outside of the typical band for a second quarter and you sort of implied that the back half will continue to be higher year on year but i guess if i look at the 160 basis points better than the five year average assuming no major fallout in business when you look at that sort of overage how much of that do you think is structural versus transitory assuming the same level of business activity mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer i ll take that dave i guess structural versus transitory that s interestingly i guess of phrasing it i think first of all when you look at the margin gains in the second quarter as melanie went through them we got some benefit from last year a little bit of margin pressure from the bigger ticket lower margin sales that we had that we didn t have in the second quarter of this year and frankly we don t expect going forward so that s really not transitory one benefit we mentioned customer mix part that relates to internet sales so we do sell to internet retailers and store based retailers and given the lower margin on internet and the supply outages we didn t have as much growth there as we had in our store based retail is that going to come back in the future it s possible but i see that being longer term perhaps not necessarily over the next year or more given the higher pace of revenue growth in the industry and the need to continue to prioritize store based sales for us we have those supply chain initiatives that we discussed which also involve the inflation that we ve seen and as pete mentioned in his comments we expect continued inflation as we move through the rest of this year and into next year so that may not well certainly won t be a long term issue don t see that being an issue over the next 12 to 18 months and then vendor incentives melanie mentioned as well and that s something that we ll be working through with our vendors in terms of what that looks like going forward and i don t want to trying to predict at this point so i think there s a combination there but i feel pretty positive about the margin gains certainly continuing through the rest of this year and into next year and then we ll see what happens after that so a long answer to your question good question and hopefully give you a little bit of insight david manthey baird analyst yeah that s helpful for sure and second if we can talk about the kind of deconstructing the growth pete i think you mentioned that chemicals unit volumes were up like 9 which if i think about that 60 of your business which is maintenance and minor repair that probably correlates fairly well so the outsized growth you re seeing has to be coming from the refurb and the new pools and i think you ve talked about new pools being up like from 96 000 last year to 110 000 this year which is kind of teens growth so that leaves us with the refurbishment as well as the content in those pools can you just touch on kind of when you see this outsized growth then we sort of know the pieces that aren t growing at 40 sort of what pieces do you see driving those and how sustainable are those factors peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah good question dave i think when you try and deconstruct the growth we commented on the chemical volume you ve zeroed in on a couple of things the new construction going from 96 000 so last year new construction was up 26 so this year we think the new number is going to be 110 000 so when you have new pool construction that you re bringing into play a lot of different product groups right so you re bringing in building materials which from a from a year over year comp perspective remember the second quarter of last year we had essentially little to no construction in many markets across the country because of restrictions due to covid so that has certainly rebounded so we see the building materials and construction materials product sales driving growth and that s a function it s going into two places right it s going into remodel which by far is the bigger portion of the market i mean a lot of folks zero in on the new construction is new construction that d be 110 000 112 000 115 000 whatever to me that is it s all good but the lion s share of the market and where we re seeing a lot of activity as well is in remodel so when i look at the growth and one of the major drivers of our growth is a the pools are being used more right so just general maintenance equipment is a piece of that as technology we re seeing more homeowners adopt or opt for technology or more high tech products smarter products which is again driving the value of the ticket for us and then when you do a remodel project those can go from a few thousand dollars for a new piece of equipment to all the way up to resurfacing the pool and adding decks and patios around it changing tiles and changing structural features in the pool all of which are very good and again the opportunity for that given the age of the installed base is very very good david manthey baird analyst that s very helpful thanks very much guys all the best mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer yeah thank you operator the next question comes from ryan merkel with william blair please go ahead ryan merkel william blair analyst hey everyone mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer good morning peter arvan president chief executive officer good morning ryan merkel william blair analyst congrats on some incredible numbers yet again peter arvan president chief executive officer thank you ryan merkel william blair analyst so i guess first off pete it sounds like you have enough evidence now to say the pool industry has entered a new normal with work from home migration to the suburbs migration south is that a fair statement peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah we are as i said in the end toward the end of my comments when i was sitting back reflecting upon what is driving the numbers and whether it is a short term thing or a longer term trend when i started listing those out which is why i purposely did it there are several factors as you mentioned that change the outlook for our industry and give us great confidence that the growth will continue that it wasn t just a covid driven bubble ryan merkel william blair analyst right okay just wanted to make sure that was the message and then on gross margins i just want to get a better view of the cadence during the second half mark not to put you on the spot here but maybe up 100 basis points year over year in 3q and maybe up something like 40 basis points year over year in 4q that in the ballpark mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer yeah you want to send me your model and i can just fill it up for you i would say maybe a little bit better than what you re thinking certainly in the third quarter fourth quarter a little bit tougher but we see more benefits and as i said expect some of that to continue in the next year so feel good about the gross margin opportunity for us as we exit the second quarter here and enter the third ryan merkel william blair analyst okay sounds good and just lastly inventory levels still up massively year over year obviously demand is a big part of that but are you also using your scale to buy inventory just given the shortages and then are you also buying ahead of price increases still peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah i think there s three factors right so inventory dollars are up but when you look at it in terms of days of inventory we re actually down we this is where in this environment is where a company like pool corp really excels because we use the strength of the balance sheet to lean in to make sure that we have product available for our builders so part of it is that there is still periodic shortages of product and every but that s a widely known fact but what happens is it could be one product right so if i look at the inventory balance in total it could be a couple of products that are missing for to ship a job complete so when that comes in it will go but by and large it s a couple of factors one business is up so our days of inventory are down because of the shortages we are buying ahead certainly to make sure that we have as much product as we can and then we re still dealing with intermittent shortages of specific items that may be holding up the shipment of a complete job ryan merkel william blair analyst sounds good thanks for the comments and mark all the best mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer yeah thank you ryan operator the next question comes from susan maklari with goldman sachs please go ahead susan maklari goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning everyone and congrats on a great quarter mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer good morning peter arvan president chief executive officer good morning thank you susan maklari goldman sachs analyst my first question is going back to the gross margin i know that you mentioned that you definitely saw some lift from an improved mix shift i guess when we think about what s going on the ground you mentioned the fact that you re still seeing a lot of refurbishment a lot of new pool construction going on how does that mix today compared to where you were in kind of a more normalized period 2019 2018 whatever it was and is there more to go in terms of that normalization over time peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah in terms of you re saying the increased construction activity susan maklari goldman sachs analyst yeah so what are the sales of that peter arvan president chief executive officer the impact of that susan maklari goldman sachs analyst yeah exactly right peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah i mean the mix question is kind of a complicated one but if you focus just on construction so with pool bill going from let s call it 75 000 80 000 to 90 000 to 100 000 110 000 those are typically larger customers that are doing the construction and that s a little bit lower margin customers just because they re buying more and have more a little more purchasing power generally speaking but that s just one part of the overall story and margins there is a lot of other things going on there we re selling more building materials which are a higher margin category for us and that s growing and we have other product categories that are higher margin growing as well so i wouldn t focus just on the construction and that piece of it because if you look back over time our margins have been very stable even with growth from 2010 really up through 2020 of construction we ve managed a very stable gross margin story so that answer your question susan susan maklari goldman sachs analyst yeah no it definitely does and i know it s tough because there s a lot of moving pieces there but like i said i was just trying to think about the fact that that new construction piece has really risen pretty significantly in the last call it year and a half two years now and how to think about what that means relative to where we were before peter arvan president chief executive officer right susan maklari goldman sachs analyst yeah my second question is around you ve obviously gained quite a bit of market share and it seems like that s continuing to come through is there anything that you can talk to whether it s in terms of i don t know maybe historical retention rates or other initiatives around how sticky that businesses and your ability to really kind of keep these customers engaged going forward peter arvan president chief executive officer sure if you look at over time we have consistently gained share over time so i think we have a tremendous focus on the customer experience and every time we get a new customer we treat that as a golden opportunity to make sure that we maintain that and if you look back historically on our market share it s been we ve been consistently growing that now in the last year we certainly have grown faster given the circumstances that have played out but if you look back over time those tend to be very sticky relationships with the customers so it s not like they come to us they jump back over time we ve been able to demonstrate that as people come to us we engage them we work with them we cover that business take care of their service as best we can and focus on execution that that business generally stays with us susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay that s helpful thank you good luck peter arvan president chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from anthony lebiedzinski with sidoti company please go ahead anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst good morning and thank you for taking the questions and mark congrats again on your pending retirement so i guess first in terms of capacity creation peter arvan president chief executive officer anthony you broke up all we heard was in terms of capacity creation and then you broke up anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst oh sorry so let me repeat that so in terms of capacity creation how should we expect that to evolve over the next few years for you peter arvan president chief executive officer i mean as you know it s been a focus area for us for the last several years it s one of my personal focus areas and i think it s paid great dividends going forward i think there are various parts of it right there it s capacity creation within the facility within our truck fleet and within labor productivity i think we ve gotten better we are still not as consistent across the network as i would like meaning that there is still opportunity in this area we see pool360 for instance and our bluestreak application we see those continuing to grow and add value for not only us but for our customers as well so i think it s a very very important area for us and has paid great dividends and i don t think we are anywhere close to the end of what we can extract out of that focus anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it and then in terms of your customers whether it s pool remodelers or much increase the capacity for them or is it over the last few months or so can you just comment on that i know there have been labor constraints for a while but i just wanted to see if there has been any changes that you have seen from your customers peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah that s a great question and i was talking to several of our field folks over the last couple of weeks about that and i m encouraged by i heard several times from our folks that our customers are adding labor and expanding their crews in many cases which i think is going to expand capacity for the industry and as you know labor has been the single biggest limiting factor on the industry growth over time but i think given how desirable this space is outdoor living and pools and patios and such i think builders are growing more comfortable and more confident in the opportunity and they re starting to add labor to their teams now there hasn t been a step function increase in that yet but i can tell you having been here for almost five years that s not been a common thread that we see crews expanding but i think what we ve seen year to date this year there are some very positive signs in that area anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it ok and then the last question for me in terms of higher costs i know you mentioned freight i think in your release i do you think there is other than that just wanted to get a better sense basically as to where you re seeing the greatest pressure points in terms of cost increases peter arvan president chief executive officer sure certainly freight is an area freight fuel is a component of that typically that from an inbound freight perspective is captured in our cost of product line from an outbound perspective we actually have an advantage in this area and again as part of our capacity creation in that most of our freight happens on our own fleet so by working on the things that we have done over the last couple of years with the truck utilization smarter routing better loading and such we have been able to minimize some of the effects that have happened in the industry other areas real estate is an issue that we all face and that the demand for warehouse space is going up so every time we renew a lease that s an area that is we re seeing inflation in as well and there has always been or there has been of late some inflation on labor as well anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay well thank you and best of luck peter arvan president chief executive officer yep thank you mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer thank you anthony operator the next question comes from stephen volkmann with jefferies please go ahead stephen volkmann jefferies analyst hi good morning guys still morning here thanks for taking my question and mark if you want to do my model too i appreciate it mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer i will be happy to do you can send it to me in the future i am kidding stephen volkmann jefferies analyst i m going to send it in before you leave understood i would never send you my model but seriously i think a lot of this has been asked but i guess what i m trying to just think of is longer term i don t know maybe this is a peak question but you guys have this pool financial model slide you included in lots of your presentations and sort of lays out what you think the model is and i guess what i m wrestling with is has this changed is the 6 to 8 revenue growth that s a stable gross margin kind of over the long term have you kind of accelerated this to another level at this point or where do you think we are in that process peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah as you re part of the question would you like to do it mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer i d be happy to first of all i think will be giving an update in september we have an investor and shareholders and we ll go through our longer term expectations and initiatives that we see as pete mentioned in his comments to one of the earlier questions there s definitely been a step up in industry volume and activity and as we look forward i think there is more growth opportunity over the next several years from an industry perspective then perhaps we ve seen certainly you look at pool construction and the acceleration there and then the aging of the installed base and some of the factors pete mentioned about the long term activities that should continue to drive demand in the pool industries i see us being fairly optimistic about the growth opportunity in our model will reflect that not significantly but some modest uptick there stephen volkmann jefferies analyst and just to push you on the next level down your gross margin has been ridiculously stable for such a long time is it now stepping up a little bit going forward or is this more temporary mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer well i think that sounds like a question i addressed earlier but certainly in the short term it s picked up we ve done a good job over time of maintaining stability some of what we see in the short term may not continue long term but i think there is some opportunity to bring the margin level up from what it has been over the last couple of years so that certainly will be an effort that we ll be focused on stephen volkmann jefferies analyst all right so we will call that medium term than maybe and the final one from me i m just curious maybe this is more of a peak question but i wasn t expecting a lot of inflation next year because it felt like the chemical situation normalizes and some of the supply constraints through the industry to normalize it just felt like a less inflationary outlook to me but you seem pretty confident that this will continue so just curious about that peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah it s a little early to tell you exactly what i think the number is going to be next year because this is the time of year when our manufacturers are trying to read the tea leaves as to what their inflation is and what they re going to pass along i think by the construct what you said for a moment on the chemical side i don t think the chemical situation will return to normal in my opinion until probably the third quarter end of third quarter fourth quarter of next year because our information on when the plant come back online puts it out into the end of the second quarter for a start up so by the time it has a meaningful impact on the industry it will be later in the year so from a chemicals perspective i don t see a whole lot of change in that area from an equipment perspective again it s a little bit early but if you ask me to call it right now i would say that it s going to be above the normal which for us remember has been in the 1 range and i m pretty comfortable that it s going to be above that number for next year but again as the year goes on as we normally do we ll give you a much better read on that in future calls stephen volkmann jefferies analyst super thank you guys peter arvan president chief executive officer yep operator the next question comes from david macgregor with longbow research please go ahead david macgregor longbow research analyst yes good morning and great quarter mark congratulations on your retirement mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer thank you david macgregor longbow research analyst i had a question on the new construction i guess the question is just to what extent is your forward visibility on new construction improving through any change in technology right the use of pool360 gives you a little more forward visibility i don t know maybe online engagement with you customers but i m just trying to get a sense of if you re getting a little better forward look on construction now as a consequence of some of the changes that have occurred peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah we actually have i think we get better visibility now than we ever have and it s a result of a couple of things obviously we have always had access to permit data just like you all do so that s one of the things that we track but given the tightness of supply of the major components in pool construction whereas in the past there was plenty of inventory in the pipeline builders didn t put a lot of orders in advance saying hey i m going to need this product and this day so we have in order to make sure that we can accommodate their needs and that we have the equipment set on the day that they needed in the future or that we have the plaster there to deliver on the day that they re are going to deliver the builders are sharing more information with us now about hey here these are the jobs i have in the pipeline so oftentimes when they go sell a job get a contract they re coming into us saying ok here s the job that i sold i m going to need equipment i m going to need the plumbing kit here the steel kit here and i m going to need the equipment and finished kit on these date so one of the benefits of the situation that we re in as we do have better visibility to what the backlog is in the industry david macgregor longbow research analyst right i guess one of the reasons i ask is just thinking about new construction there s always the question out there with respect to what extent has stay at home pulled forward into 2020 in 2021 and therefore it may be creates some risk around new pool sales in 2022 i realize and you walked through some factors i mean it s very helpful in that sense but i m just trying to get a sense of what the downside scenario might look like and is it would it be return back to the 95 000 96 000 pools or maybe a little bit better than that and how are you thinking about kind of the risk around that that s all peter arvan president chief executive officer i think you got to consider like what could cause that i mean the builders have significant backlog in place as we mentioned and from a macro trend people moving to the south the work from home those things are going to continue millennials entering the housing market a strong housing market in terms of value and frankly people valuing having the backyard escape so frankly i don t but for a major economic issue i don t think that there is anything in the near term that would say well the 110 000 is going to drop back down to 95 000 that s really not how we read the tea leaves today mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer one potential exception is weather of course having favorable weather sellable days particularly in the shoulders of the season that allows more construction days david macgregor longbow research analyst great okay thanks for that and then just a follow up question i guess just regarding texas and florida what extent did the quarter benefit from kind of one time spending on the repair replacement of equipment damaged in the freeze earlier in the year are you able to size that peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah it didn t affect florida right it was really a texas issue in terms the freeze and we said that there was a lot of repair that was done in the first quarter and then due to equipment shortages i think it s still going on i think it s going to go on between now and the year end although at a much smaller pace than what we saw in the first quarter so i think it s something that we ll see continue tailwinds on albeit at a much smaller level than we saw in the first quarter david macgregor longbow research analyst okay thank you very much peter arvan president chief executive officer yep operator the next question comes from garik shmois with loop capital please go ahead garik shmois loop capital analyst great thanks for taking my questions squeezing me in just wanted to follow up on the inflation comments you mentioned you haven t seen any impact from inflation on demand but if we re going to be in a modest inflationary environment again next year i mean is there a point in which inflation is going to start to impact volumes i mean i guess do you worry at all about price necessity at all or learned your lessons from this experience this year that makes it feel even more confident about the pool owners ability to withstand much higher pricing peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah i think you got to break down the inflation and where it and how it impacts the business so in terms of maintenance and repair if you need a filter you need to filter and if you need a pump you need a pump and if it cost 5 more than it did last year a that s not typically for a pool owner an insurmountable amount so it s nothing you d say well i m not going to change the filter because it costs 5 more i have to do it in order to keep the pool operating so in terms of maintenance and repair we see very little impact your question on inflation as it relates to construction it s a little bit different because depending on the type of pool construction it can have a bigger impact on the total project but one of the things that we have you have to consider when you think that through is that most of the cost of a backyard project whether it s a renovation or whether it s a new construction project most of that cost in most cases is labor right so in terms of a material cost increase and if there is inflation next year is again what we think above normal i don t think it will have a material impact on demand and somebody deciding that i am going to do the project or i m not given how the cost lays into the project garik shmois loop capital analyst helpful i guess my follow up question is i know it s relatively minor considering the revenue base of about 5 billion now but how quickly do you expect the 30 million to 40 million in revenues from the variable speed pump legislation that s going to affect how quickly do you think that might structural and up peter arvan president chief executive officer so as we ve mentioned before the way the rule is written it says that if they can t make the pumps anymore right so they now had to switch to only variable speed pumps but the product that is in the pipeline can be sold i guess fortunately for us in this case there isn t a lot of inventory left in the pipeline so we think that we ll start to see the benefits this year and we should essentially see the full benefit next year in terms of what the opportunity is so it s a given the shortages in this case it basically it pulls that in but you also have to consider the seasonality to and the impact on us is earlier in the year right sorry during the peak season so most of the effect that you would see i wouldn t look for a meaningful bump in 2021 i think you re going to see it in 2022 garik shmois loop capital analyst okay thanks again great quarter and mark best of luck on your time mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer yeah thank you garik operator the next question comes from ken zener with keybanc please go ahead ken zener keybanc analyst hello everybody peter arvan president chief executive officer good morning mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer good morning ken ken zener keybanc analyst look forward to seeing you guys in new york on september 15 i m sure you re going to give us a lot more insight however let s talk about a few things now how do you guys measure stock outs how much it s a way to think about how disruptive the supply channels close at can you tell over 4th of july and their hot tub wasn t working because they didn t have parts i mean how do you measure stock outs relative to a stress level in the supply chain mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer yeah so our goal around stock outs is to be at less than 5 right that s been the goal that we ve been chasing for many years and we in terms of our attention to it and waiting of it as a business we actually put much more emphasis on it during the peak season that we do on the shoulders of the season so we do kind of a weighted average in our measurement so the goal is 5 on some products it is higher than that and i would say overall obviously because of the shortages the number has come up and it really varies by location and it varies by product ken zener keybanc analyst but you re not suggesting it s actually something meaningful i guess in terms of backlog mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer meaningful so it is we treat every one of those stock out situations as a really bad situation so to us they are all very meaningful because anytime that a customer and says hey do you have something and i have to say no but now we look at the system and we can tell the customer hey here s when it is here s wanted to schedule to arrive so that we can coordinate with the customer on what and provide an expectation in some areas that s been very challenging and the chemical side because we certainly don t have the same visibility as we do on the equipment side so it is elevated and i would tell you in some cases it could be some crazy products that can be approaching 10 but by and large i would say the increase is slightly above the 5 target that we have established ken zener keybanc analyst okay you talked about gross margins a little bit mark i think you talked about positive gross margins as we re moving into the second half you could you talked about product mix and stuff but it seems as though if you re moving into a positive mix in the second half a that would have a positive carry into the first half of 2022 given those variables but related to that your sg a has come down quite a bit is my assumption here while we see it certainly versus the prior years so can you and i tend to think about your company is going to get a grosser sg a not such a concern to me but i mean we are getting questions around that gross margin so can you talk to if that sg a is kind of something has changed in that relative to where you were a few years ago or is that you another covid metric that could be such normalized kind of a two part question there as it relates to ebit but could you expand on that a little bit mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer well yeah a little bit i guess i got your question or your comment about gross or sg a coming down you re referring to sg a as a percent of sales sg a is obviously a business has grown and people and the support added to locations facilities vehicles our sg a has obviously gone up it s come down as a percent of sales last couple of years in part i think i ve mentioned this before at some point leverage is easier when sales growth is higher so we ve had obviously great sales growth over the last year and this year and that makes getting that sg a leverage a little bit easier but at the same time we ve talked a lot about capacity creation initiatives and those are things that we do throughout the organization to focus on getting more out of existing investments and that is a big part of our operational initiatives and we ve made good progress there we have more to come we also paired back expenses during the pandemic initially we talked about that last year we are seeing some growth in those costs and gross and other cost areas as pete mentioned things like leases and labor insurance is another area and then incentives we talked about incentive costs were up substantially last year we thought it d be down this year year over year we talked about that earlier in the year and in fact they re going to be up so those are a big component of the cost structure and should be coming down next year most likely it will be a tailwind for us so a lot of different components there i think that as i look at our long term model i feel good about the opportunity to continue to provide operating leverage and that is going to continue to be a big focus for us which is in that kind of mid teens plus area in terms of operating leverage we expect so i don t know if that covered both parts of your question but that s kind of how we see it ken zener keybanc analyst yeah it s interesting right because i mean the fact is you re running 200 plus basis points below i m not sure if your gross margins hold rise a little bit this year your sg a is basically going to be down about 200 basis points and maybe you guys will address this at the analyst day more so but operating leverage needs to come through your gross margin or your sg a but it seems like it fell off a lot so there s something structurally different but i look forward to exploring that a little more in time i ll shift topics here for you pete you came from obviously roofing which is a different category before that you re doing other things in distribution but in roofing in 2008 had this as it relates to the manufacturers they had high oil input cost the distributors were always going after price pre buying creating these swings in demand which affected pricing privilege came to that category via needing to get price and then they just realized margins can be better is there anything that you see relative to your competitors and you all and the manufacturers given how high demand is and how there is input cost and that s perhaps creating a structural shift in the industry given how much demand we ve had an even as volatility peter arvan president chief executive officer let me see how i m going to answer that we have a lot in there ken zener keybanc analyst as your competitors i mean it s just they came from they don t have as good a supply chain as you do and especially things like hardscape much less the core parts of the business it just seems like this has been a very structural benefit to you all peter arvan president chief executive officer yeah so we have taken share as i mentioned we think we ve taken in 3 to 4 points of share this year and that s based on the fact that in a particular market we have in most markets we have multiple locations so if i don t have it in one location i may have it in another i mean the irony of the situation that we re in now with that we use that to benefit our customers but it is creating a lot more work for our teams i mean i can t express how hard our teams are working to do what we do in a tight constraint environment because they are having to move product from one location to another and coordinate deliveries and really look very specifically at what days people need things so that we get product to them this is where we separate ourselves though because in most markets we re the only ones that have multiple locations and nobody has as many locations as we do nobody has the buying power to place the orders as big as we do in the beginning anyway so we re doing that and we re working very hard to make sure that we can take care of the customers and certainly it s creating a benefit for us and i think the benefit for the customers as well ken zener keybanc analyst thank you very much see you guys soon peter arvan president chief executive officer thank you mark joslin senior vice president chief financial officer thanks ken operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to peter arvan for any closing remarks peter arvan president chief executive officer

palo alto calif july 22 2021 prnewswire a federal judge in san francisco today denied wisk s request for a preliminary injunction against rival archer the court determined that wisk failed to make its case wisk has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits that defendant archer aviation inc has misappropriated its particular asserted trade secrets click here to read the ruling the ruling reinforces what archer has said all along wisk did not have a good faith basis to bring this lawsuit and did not file the litigation to defend or protect any legitimate intellectual property rights the record makes it clear that wisk has provided no evidence not a single document not a single witness that archer ever received or used any wisk trade secret archer s deputy general counsel eric lentell said wisk s charges of massive theft are based entirely on conspiracy theories and outright misrepresentations of the actual record contrary to the story wisk crafted the evidence in this case has also made it clear that archer with input from its outside expert design consultant evaluated and selected the 12 tilt 6 design of its maker demonstrator aircraft independently and well in advance of any effort by wisk to develop a similar evtol aircraft he said indeed wisk evidenced no interest in developing such an aircraft until after learning about archer s design in an archer recruiting meeting in december 2019 then wisk rushed to file a provisional patent application that depicted but did not claim to have invented the 12 tilt 6 configuration that archer disclosed to it wisk argued to both law enforcement authorities and the court that the patent application provided evidence of wrongdoing by archer but the court s ruling today rejected that argument holding instead that wisk has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits that defendant archer aviation inc has misappropriated its particular asserted trade secrets wisk s evidence was too uncertain and equivocal mr lentell continued what is equally clear is that wisk s nefarious attempts to paint their former engineer dr jing xue as the poster child for the covert theft of wisk s trade secrets have failed on all accounts the reality couldn t be further from the truth the goal of boeing backed startup wisk with its lawsuit has always been an improper and malicious attempt to disrupt archer s momentum as a means to compensate for its own lack of success wisk has lacked a focus on bringing to market aircraft that were commercially viable recognizing that archer and others were intent on making evtol aircraft a reality of urban transportation wisk is now abusing the judicial and criminal justice system in hopes that a court can help wisk slow down the pace of innovation while wisk struggles to keep up at a time when our president is taking aim at just these kinds of anti competitive tactics by big business we find this deeply disturbing mr lentell added we will continue to vigorously defend

franklin tennessee one of tennessee s top restaurant representatives and the owner of a historic restaurant chain says his business is already built back better thanks to the state s forward thinking politicians andy marshall ceo of a marshall hospitality the company that owns puckett s grocery restaurant detailed reasons he believes puckett s six restaurant locations are thriving after the hospitality industry was hit harder than any other industry in 2020 we had a lot of forward thinking politicians in tennessee our governor our senators our congress people all working to try to help us balance the pandemic and the economics of opening and making sure we kept our employees employed marshall said the middle tennessee eatery has become a staple among locals and tourists and in addition to smaller name musicians country stars like keith urban and vince gill have graced the restaurants stages marshall s interview which took place at his franklin location came on the same day breitbart news interviewed sen marsha blackburn r tn at the restaurant as part of breitbart news s on the hill series marshall specifically noted gov bill lee r who announced in may he was terminating the state s use of the extra 300 per week federal unemployment benefit early i give a lot of credit to our governor first of all he asked questions he formed groups to talk about it i was asked to be on an economic recovery group a subcommittee for restaurants said marshall who also heads the tennessee hospitality tourism association and is a leading advocate for restaurants in his state the department of labor s june jobs report showed signs that ending the extra weekly federal benefit was contributing to recovery as of the beginning of the month 26 states all republican led with the exception of louisiana had announced they did end or planned to end the 300 per week program early breitbart news s john carney pointed to an increase in workforce participation in prime aged workers and an increase in reentrants to the workforce as two indicators on the jobs report that scaling back federal benefits was working an american action network survey of 1 009 registered voters conducted june 22 29 in 51 battleground congressional districts reinforced the notion as it summarized conservatives have clear winning arguments over liberals on economic issues and concerns rising prices and inflation are the cornerstone of this economic argument with a secondary element focused on the labor shortage due to the democratic pushed extended unemployment benefits lee said may 11 he was ending the use of federal coronavirus related unemployment programs because tennesseans have access to more than 250 000 jobs in our state families businesses and our economy thrive when we focus on meaningful employment and move on from short term federal fixes marshall also commended tennessee s congressional delegation which is almost entirely republican for placing emphasis on business recovery he said they acknowledged to him we can t just shut down our economy he told breitbart news his sales in recent weeks have been soaring up 18 percent over 2019 there was a lot of treading water there for a long time what has happened really in the last four weeks is people were just pent up a lot of pent up demand really in the last four weeks it s really exploded it s just really come back strong marshall said the interview in june with the tennessee restauranteur comes amid a series of devastating economic indicators on a national scale for biden s agenda including skyrocketing inflation and the worst stock market selloff of the year which occurred monday it also comes as former vice president mike pence in his first exclusive interview since leaving office told breitbart news in iowa that biden s policies are dampening what was a strong recovery from the pandemic that began under former president donald trump the extension of the plus up on unemployment benefits by the biden administration has worked a real hardship on small businesses and our recovery pence said in the interview look this economy started to recover in the summer of 2020 with tax cuts and rolling back regulations and unleashing american energy and america first trade deals we had laid a foundation within the first three years that created seven million jobs i believe it also was the foundation on which america has made this historic recovery and in so many ways what the biden administration has done and continues to do and adding to that they re pushing for the largest tax increase in 50 years to pass the largest spending bill in american history i think what the biden administration is doing threatens to short circuit the american recovery we all long to see and that is underway it is but i think the fact that inflation is now rising at the most rapid pace in 13 years is evidence of the fact that markets are starting to respond to the big government solutions higher taxes more regulation being planned and coming out of this administration that s why we got to fight back and fight back hard write to ashley oliver at aoliver breitbart com
new york stocks rallied to records on wall street friday and the dow jones industrial average closed above the 35 000 level for the first time as the market continued to roar back from its short lived swoon at the start of the week the s p 500 index climbed 44 31 or 1 to 4 411 79 to top its prior all time high set early last week the dow rose 238 20 or 0 7 to 35 061 55 and the nasdaq composite gained 152 39 or 1 to 14 836 99 all three indexes finished with gains of better than 1 for the week completely brushing aside the sharp downturn that trimmed 1 6 off the s p 500 on monday that drop was caused by worries about a potentially sharp slowdown in the economy due to a fast spreading variant of the coronavirus but the s p 500 has since climbed four straight days as big companies reported better profits than expected and as investors once again saw any dip in stocks as merely a chance to buy low

closing a strong q4 we were profitable ex onetime items for the full year and we are well poised for fiscal year 2022 in our specific businesses book fairs continues to tailor the fair experience to meet the needs of schools as they reopened in the spring and intensified marketing through positive results while we hope for even stronger opportunities to host our premium in person fairs in the fourth quarter the increased appetite from schools to include fairs in their calendar planning keeps us cautiously optimistic for the fall season this summer we are focused on our operational readiness as bookings increase ensuring we have the right offerings marketing and strategies to meet schools where they are this fall and beyond clubs had a very positive quarter a reflection of more teachers resuming in classroom activities to reengage and excite students around learning through books with increased teacher sponsorship and streamlined marketing and processes revenues improved in

development and is gaining recognition in the industry for excellence still water on apple tv plus based on the picture books by jon j muth just recently won a peabody award and earned a daytime emmy award the series strikes an important tone for today s parents bringing mindfulness to their children during this constant state of change in september we look forward to unleashing clifford the big red dog in theaters and introducing him to new audiences in this larger than life format and story just as our trade divisions across the world have keen insight into what kids want to read our education division has the pulse on what teachers need in their classrooms to best support their students the success of the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year is because of the close partnerships we ve made over the years with state district school and classroom leaders those relationships and the insights they provide guide us to customize our products quickly to match the ever changing landscape of education particularly in the pandemic as well as to be forward thinking driving our strategic and upfront investments in areas of growth such as early education with prek on my way social emotional learning through our yale child study center partnership and more all of this with the backdrop of unprecedented federal funding we are leaning into this climate and evolving with it evidence of how well our efforts and education support our customers and our business is in the result of a 9 full year growth in revenues the fourth quarter showed higher sales in comparison to the previous year in those channels led by the district level need and innovation around summer learning and classroom refreshes as children return to school and still keeping the needs of at home learning net teaching resources is up by 10 million year over year and digital bookings are also up led by products such as scholastic first our international division continues to benefit from our global strength in trade publishing two highly anticipated books globally in the coming fiscal year are from australian based aaron blabey s the bad guy series similar to the u s international clubs and fairs are beginning to recover and cost reductions support forward growth in the coming year and asia remains a growth opportunity as we continually expand our reach through franchise schools and direct sales to parents looking ahead in fiscal year 2022 we are feeling positive about back to school season and beyond particularly as we rebuild our fairs business there is positive momentum around fall bookings with the understanding that the climate remains somewhat uncertain though becoming clear in the fourth quarter success in clubs keeps us optimistic for our distribution channels at large trade will continue its stellar track record of publishing books that resonate with kids and become part of the contemporary culture in an increasingly broad way as our content continues to be adapted for streaming television and film education will benefit from its streamlined approach to serving customers as a combined group and we are well poised to help them navigate a new normal and new streams of funding international will continue to have a diverse approach tailored to its markets covering trade publishing education content including english language learning tools and our global distribution channels finally welcome peter you ve been a crucial voice on our board these past seven years and i m confident that working with you will help us take advantage of our many opportunities for progress and growth with that i d like to turn the call over to ken cleary kenneth j cleary chief financial officer thank you iole and good afternoon today i will refer to our adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year excluding onetime items unless otherwise indicated please refer to our press release tables and sec filings for a complete discussion of onetime severance closure and settlement costs the unprecedented nature of the pandemic created challenges for all scholastic s businesses the actions taken by the company during the past 1 5 years while drastic were necessary we focused our efforts in two distinct areas first and foremost we pivoted our resources to meet our customers change needs as a result of the pandemic when teachers and students could not receive book clubs orders in the classroom we offered ship to home options when schools could not run our valued in person book fairs we offered virtual fairs when parents needed easy to deploy learning at home we provided teacher resources and digital content when school districts identified the greater need for independent reading during the pandemic we offered individual book packs that could be distributed to students from the school district when our classroom magazines couldn t be delivered to students and schools we offered digital only magazines these solutions demonstrate the company s ability to pivot to our customers needs but moreover these newly developed distribution methods demonstrate that demand for the company s content remains strong regardless of how it is distributed all told these new distribution methods supported over 140 million of our revenues in fiscal 2021 second we re able to drastically reduce costs in the face of a severe downturn in revenues as a result of the pandemic early in the pandemic we initiated a project to reduce cost by 100 million a target we exceeded we continued our furlough program through the first quarter we consolidated functionality and combined resources across the company streamlining many processes we leveraged lower cost options to execute various functions throughout the company we eliminated substantial discretionary spending during the pandemic we permanently closed 13 distribution facilities and consolidated our new york city office footprint into a single facility and we temporarily closed other distribution facilities we focused our technology and capital projects on those projects deemed essential and we better matched inventory purchases to expected demand the result of these efforts were significant exclusive of onetime severance facility closure and other costs our sg a decreased over 170 million compared to the prior year our capex decreased to 47 2 million for the year compared to 62 7 million in fiscal 2020 our net cash position of 176 3 million was relatively flat compared to the prior year end balance of 175 3 million and our free cash flow as defined was 20 5 million compared to a free cash use of 89 1 million last year many of these costs will return to the company as our revenues increase post pandemic but approximately 50 million of these cost savings will be permanent in nature when our revenues return to historical levels allowing for better margins in the future and the opportunity to dedicate resources were needed while the above pandemic related actions were necessary given the conditions more important to the company before during and after the pandemic is the value we provide to our customers through our brand our content creation as evidenced by strong trade results in fy 2021 and our distribution capabilities our revenues in the important fourth quarter grew to 401 4 million or 41 versus the prior year period which included the first few months of the pandemic fiscal 2021 revenues declined 13 versus last year to 1 3 billion also driven by decreased revenues from fares domestically and abroad due to covid restrictions still we believe the sequential improvements and results relative to the third quarter is indicative of the success of our covid response and generally improving market conditions operating income for the fourth quarter was 41 6 million versus a loss of 39 4 million in q4 of last year for fiscal year 2021 operating income was 39 million versus an operating loss of 32 3 million in fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 63 6 million compared to a loss of 17 3 million last year while adjusted ebitda for full fiscal year 2021 was 139 6 million compared to 56 6 million in fiscal 2020 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share was 0 90 compared to a loss per share of 0 23 in fiscal 2020 full year earnings per diluted share was 1 02 versus a loss per share of 0 08 in the prior year now turning to our segments where i will review the drivers of our fourth quarter results our fiscal year results are detailed in our tables and sec filings in children s book publishing and distribution fourth quarter revenue increased 46 to 192 2 million while the spring school season did not allow as many book fairs as we had hoped due to continued covid concerns there were substantially higher levels of in person book fair since the third quarter and in comparison to the prior year s fourth quarter trade revenues grew from the third quarter with an impressive 78 4 million which had an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period by 2 million only because of the strong sales of the ballad of songbirds and snakes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 fourth quarter operating income was 14 3 million as compared to an operating loss of 46 5 million in the prior fiscal quarter in education revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter grew 32 to 124 9 million versus the prior year period education results benefited from a heightened and expanded need for summer learning programs schools and districts increasing book access both at home through book pack distributions and in school through level book room and classroom collections in addition to strong demand for teaching resources and digital subscriptions fourth quarter operating income was 40 8 million versus operating income of 27 3 million in the fiscal 2020 quarter in our international segment fourth quarter revenues grew 47 to 84 3 million versus prior year our major markets of canada and australia both had higher sales as did asia across most channels direct sales trade and education in the fourth quarter international had an operating income of 5 1 million versus a loss of 9 1 million in the fiscal 2020 quarter we also benefit from certain covid related wage and rent subsidies of 11 2 million in our international business corporate overhead expense was 18 6 million in the fourth quarter an increase of 7 5 million versus the prior year period largely due to technology investments and the absence of furlough savings for the fiscal year lower overhead expense overall 71 9 million versus 81 million in fiscal 2020 is a reflection of the company s cost savings initiatives many of the company s cost savings initiatives were enabled by the technology and related process changes that we ve been implementing over the past five years regarding our facilities our headquarters in soho has started welcoming back employees to their working stations as restrictions have been lifted we look forward to even more of our new york based employees collaborating in person as we adjust to an increasingly hybrid environment which will further enhance productivity as employees benefit from this new found flexibility we will continue to strategically manage our assets as the manhattan rental market bounces back as previously disclosed we sold two surplus facilities in fiscal 2021 and we expect to sell two more facilities in fiscal 2022 finally as previously announced the company paid its regular quarterly dividend in each quarter of fiscal year 2021 uninterrupted by the pandemic for a total of 20 6 million we are turning the corner on the pandemic in the fourth quarter and continuing into the month of june we have seen strong demand for education solutions as districts principals teachers parents and students prepare for in person learning in the upcoming school year this includes increased summer reading programs and the replenishing of classroom materials there is substantial federal funding available for states districts and schools to spend on education solutions we are currently experiencing strong demand for our digital and print offerings our book fairs team is seeing a similar reaction from their customers who are anxious to host an in person scholastic book fair in the upcoming school year the ramp up of this business is expected to be sequentially better from last spring to this fall and then to this coming spring as such we are closely assessing our demand and creating capacity when and where we need it for the fall season this entails reopening distribution facilities that have been closed for over a year in some instances including hiring and training warehouse and transportation staff members we are optimistic that our book fairs business will recover but we do not expect a full recovery to historical revenue levels in fiscal 2022 and we are managing our resources to meet our expected demand as we come out of the pandemic we look forward to continuing the company s mission and to grow our business scholastic now has a more scalable operating model as a result of our cost saving programs in both a growing customer base and a global footprint all resulting in strong cash flow generation we re investing in digital growth opportunities across e commerce and online applications as well as pursuing numerous strategic solutions to meet the growing need for new digital education solutions adaptable for school and at home to develop and support literacy in fiscal year 2022 we intend to focus our growth with the following significant opportunities leveraging our ip across platforms direct sales and marketing to parents investing in long term education solutions growth growth in asia through english language learning solutions and the continued simplification of processes we re currently borrowing 175 million under our credit facility but expect to reduce our borrowing levels as our revenues return in fiscal 2022 and receive outstanding tax refunds from the federal government we will be negotiating a renewal or extension to our bank credit facility which expires in january 2022 as i previously mentioned we expect much of the cost savings we achieved in fiscal 2021 to be permanent adjusted ebitda will continue to benefit from the lower operating cost base partially offset by higher inflationary costs for labor materials transportation and other services as well as the discontinuation of covid related government subsidies we are not issuing financial year guidance today since there is substantial uncertainty in the expected recovery rate and the course of the pandemic in the coming quarterly calls we will continue to provide additional detail as uncertainties due to the pandemic continue to subside in closing i want to express my heartfelt appreciation for having had the opportunity to work side by side with dick for many years and benefit from his vision and ability to empower his management team to see through this pandemic and continue our mission into the future we remain focused on the execution of our strategic plan for fiscal year 2020 which dick

steve wyant releases a brown trout he caught in the yampa river in march just below stagecoach reservoir photo by dylan anderson with multiple area agricultural reservoirs at extreme lows and some predicted to drop to only streams running through reservoir basins by fall some fish populations could be threatened during this time of drought if reservoir levels get very low fish survival may come into question and fish loss could occur said colorado parks and wildlife aquatic biologist bill atkinson fish in agricultural reservoirs may escape downstream through outlets as water levels drop and fish may survive in lower level waters remaining in reservoirs atkinson said if water conditions improve next year cpw can quickly reestablish fish populations from fingerlings or small fish raised in hatcheries in yampa rifle or glenwood springs atkinson said adding cpw plans fish stocking schedules two years in advance cpw employees tackle tricky fish work such as netting pike out of casey s pond each spring and performing fish counts on the yampa river but taking fish out of shrinking reservoirs is not really an option atkinson said the mucky reservoir bottoms are not easily navigated fish salvage is very complicated he said you can be up to your knees in mud logistically it s not that easy fish salvage from drawn down reservoirs and lakes can be difficult and unsafe even if fish can be rescued it is risky to attempt to transplant fish transportation of fish from one water body to another has potential risks such as transporting disease pathogens there are strict regulations about moving fish said atkinson who has worked in the cpw aquatics section for 22 years other lakes may not have the capacity to handle more fish and cpw fish hatcheries have very limited isolation unit space that is reserved for conservation of unique fish populations and preserving native cutthroat trout atkinson said at the 128 acre agricultural stillwater reservoir west of the town of yampa the reservoir capacity is at 11 this week or only 700 acre feet but the outlet does not have a fish screen so fish may pass through to bear river as the water level lowers if that happens fishing below stillwater and in bear lake downstream could be good later this summer atkinson said stillwater is usually stocked with small cutthroat trout raised at the fish hatchery in glenwood springs but atkinson said no new fish were stocked at stillwater this year due to the lower fill level cpw staff worked diligently during this drought year to protect fish as much as possible by monitoring populations as well as river and reservoir levels to alter stocking plans and educate anglers atkinson said he plans to evaluate at stillwater again this weekend to make population management decisions which can include temporarily removing fish bag limits to encourage more anglers to fish the lower level waters in situations where fish populations could be threatened due to extremely low water levels cpw implements a management action such as removing bag limits to allow anglers to harvest more fish atkinson said in yamcolo reservoir downstream on the bear river the reservoir is currently at 24 capacity some anglers are finding safe places to fish from rocky areas to the muddy shoreline of the low reservoir cpw did stock fish at 175 acre yamcolo earlier this year since the reservoir maintains a base of water including municipal water rights and a deadpool yet fish concentrated in less water may compete for resources growth rates of fish may be hampered during water levels with a lower carrying capacity atkinson explained sheriff reservoir northwest of yampa owned by the town of oak creek currently is being gradually reduced in water levels due to upcoming grant funded maintenance work that reservoir should be lowered to 40 capacity by oct 1 town officials said at 78 acre gardner park reservoir located east of yamcolo the water only filled to two thirds of capacity this year and the shallow agricultural reservoir may drain to only a stream running through by fall said yampa resident andi schaffner a reservoir water rights owner so cpw only stocked a limited number of fish at gardner park this year and atkinson said bag limits also will be reviewed other fish stocking this drought year was diverted from agricultural reservoirs to larger recreation based lakes such as steamboat lake which does not vary as much in water levels atkinson said this year cpw officials encouraged river anglers to explore high country lakes atkinson said he continues to witness abnormally high afternoon water temperatures in the 70s in the yampa river through steamboat which is closed for fishing and recreation with the warm water temperatures higher ambient air temperatures and lower river water levels fish in local rivers are stressed fish in larger lakes avoid the heat too so anglers will have more luck fishing earlier and later during the cooler parts of the day or in deeper waters this time of year atkinson said during july and august typically the fish will occupy habitat in deeper waters such as 15 to 20 feet deep in steamboat and stagecoach atkinson said

pm unc helicopter deal left government tied up prime minister dr keith rowley the prime minister has advised the unc against speaking about a sikorsky helicopter procured while it was in office between may 2010 and september 2015 which he said tied up the government like the proverbial market crab and caused millions of taxpayers dollars to be wasted addressing the issue at the post cabinet news conference at the prime minister s official residence in blenheim tobago on thursday dr rowley said the opposition would do well to keep quiet on that matter that is one of the albatrosses that we found around our neck someone in the last government the unc led people s partnership coalition he said made an arrangement with that helicopter that cost millions of dollars for a helicopter which largely could not be utilised the contract was such he charged that the government was so tied up the proverbial market crab would be a laughing stock as compared to that rowley said when the pnm returned to office in september 2015 and saw the arrangement in place for the helicopter the government could not continue those arrangements for an item which was largely unusable he said when parliament resumes in september the relevant minister will make a statement in the parliament on that matter in january minister in the office of the prime minister stuart young said this matter is currently the subject of litigation and it would be imprudent for me to say any more at this time save that the contract was never in favour of the people of trinidad and tobago on may 8 2019 young said taxpayers have to pay out 44 million owing to a civil court settlement related to the acquisition of two helicopters by the pp he said after investigations it appeared there might not have been proper approval and there certainly was not cabinet approval for the two contracts young said one of the helicopters never came to tt because the certificate for it to leave delaware us could not be provided it cost the taxpayers of tt hundreds of thousands of us dollars every month they could not even utilise the helicopters he said the licence of the other helicopter which was provided to the national operations centre noc by the former administration ran out within a few months of its arrival so by november 2015 it was no longer licensed to fly in tt he said legal advice from international lawyers freshfields was that the government and by extension the people of tt had absolutely no defence to this contract that was entered into by the former administration he recalled the company that leased the helicopter brought proceedings against the minister of national security in the courts of new york and made a claim of us 16 18 million young said the legal advice from freshfields was to settle the matter and this was done after negotiations
nature based solutions nbs provide a promising means to a climate resilient future to guide investments in nbs stated preference studies have become a common tool to evaluate the benefits of nbs in developing countries due to subsistence lifestyles and generally lower incomes sp studies in developing countries increasingly use time payments as an alternative to the traditionally implemented money payments it remains unclear however how time values should be converted into money values how the payment affects willingness to pay wtp estimates and how this influence varies across settings with different levels of market integration we compare the results of choice experiments that use either time or money payments and that are implemented in urban and rural ghana the choice experiments target to value different nbs aimed at erosion prevention and other ecosystem service benefits along the highly erosion prone ghanaian coastline time payments are converted into monetary units using two generic wage based conversion rates and one novel individual specific non wage based conversion rate we find higher wtp estimates for the time payments moreover we find that the underlying implicit assumptions related to the currently commonly applied generic wage based conversion rates do not hold finally we find higher levels of market integration and smaller wtp disparities in the urban site providing evidence that market integration allows for convergence of wtp estimates these results provide guidance on the accurate estimation of nbs benefits through the implementation of stated preference studies with time payments introduction over the years nature based solutions nbs have increasingly gained interest from both scholars and decision makers due to the role that these measures can play in the transition to a sustainable and climate resilient future nbs are defined as measures that aim to protect sustainably manage and restore ecosystems thereby addressing societal challenges while providing both human well being and biodiversity benefits e g cohen shacham et al 2016 wwf international 2020 however current investment in nbs is limited wwpap un water 2018 deutz et al 2020 even though both the physical and cost effectiveness of nbs have been proven ferrario et al 2014 narayan et al 2016 reguero et al 2018 because developing countries are generally more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and natural hazards ipcc 2014 jongman et al 2015 hossen et al 2019 developing countries may benefit more from nbs still compared to developed countries progress on transitioning to a sustainable and climate resilient future in developing countries is lagging behind hinkel et al 2012 ipcc 2014 to guide investments in nbs stated preference sp studies have become a common tool to evaluate the benefits of nbs brouwer 2008 bockarjova and botzen 2017 sp studies are especially suitable for this purpose since they allow for the valuation of non marketed goods such as erosion prevention the damage cost avoided approach is another method that is commonly applied to estimate benefits related to ecosystem services as erosion prevention however non marketed goods are commonly neglected in applying this approach and one needs ample existing data to be able to apply the approach the latter is especially challenging in developing countries where data availability is generally lower to exemplify an imdc 2017 study that adopted the damage cost avoided approach in ghana identified 11 benefits and describes that reliable data is available for only two of those benefits therefore applying the damage cost avoided method instead of a sp method would increase the risk of underestimating the benefits of nbs in sp studies respondents are asked to make trade offs between positive negative changes in ecosystem services and a payment compensation this payment is commonly monetary due to subsistence lifestyles and generally lower incomes a monetary payment complicates trade offs in developing countries and may therefore lead to issues with the estimation of the willingness to pay wtp for nbs more specifically using money payments could lead to an underestimation of wtp alam 2006 o garra 2009 hagedoorn et al 2020 meginnis et al 2020 a failure in accurately representing the preferences of certain groups in society alam 2006 and various methodological problems gibson et al 2016 time payments serve as the most popular alternative to money payments e g gibson et al 2016 tilahun et al 2017 pondorfer and rehdanz 2018 owour et al 2019 rai et al 2019 alfredo and o garra 2020 endalew et al 2020 hagedoorn et al 2020 meginnis et al 2020 navrud and vondolia 2020 van oijstaeijen et al 2020 the reasoning is that overall wtp is not only a function of a person s monetary ability to contribute e g money but also of their non monetary ability to contribute e g time especially in developing countries non monetary goods can also serve as a means of payment after all similar to money time is subject to a budget constraint and can have high opportunity costs moreover time payments are found to be highly accepted by respondents e g o garra 2009 abramson et al 2011 casiwan launio et al 2011 rai and scarborough 2013 alfredo and o garra 2020 girma et al 2020 hagedoorn et al 2020 meginnis et al 2020 despite these advantages of using time payments challenges remain especially on the conversion of time into monetary values thereby facilitating incorporation of time payments in economic analyses so far studies mostly apply a generic wage based conversion approach to convert time values to monetary ones for instance studies use an average wage value to convert time or apply a fraction to this wage value to estimate a leisure rate as based on cesario 1976 e g o garra 2009 casiwan launio et al 2011 vondolia et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 these studies thereby implicitly assume that the value of time is the same across all respondents that all respondents would sacrifice the same activity i e wage or leisure time and that the value of leisure time is equal to a generic fraction of the wage rate1 however all these assumptions can be questioned furthermore ambiguous results from previous studies on wtp disparities resulting from time and money payments raise questions on the drivers and impacts of these disparities e g casiwan launio et al 2011 vondolia et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 expanding the knowledge on the drivers of the wtp disparities from time and money payments can be useful in guiding future payment vehicle use in developing countries research questions in order to address the challenges related to time payments in sp studies and thereby guide future decisions on payment vehicle use in valuation studies we compare wtp estimates of time and money payments in a developing country context ghana additionally we also compare these results across a rural and an urban setting with the aim to examine the effects of market integration on wtp disparities we implement an identical choice experiment in both a rural and an urban study site aimed at valuing erosion prevention and related co benefits we measure market integration by examining a range of aspects based on different strands of literature moreover we add to the literature and discussion on converting time to money by comparing two traditional generic wage based conversion rates to an individual specific non wage based conversion rate the four research questions that we address in this study are as follows 1 research question 1 how do wtp estimates from an experiment with a time payment vehicle differ from wtp estimates from an experiment with a monetary payment vehicle 2 research question 2 do the underlying implicit assumptions related to a generic wage based conversion rate hold when comparing these values to those resulting from a non wage based conversion rate 3 research question 3 how do market integration levels differ across urban and rural settings 4 research question 4 how do differences in wtp estimates from time and money payment vehicle experiments correspond to differences in market integration levels the results of this study contribute to the existing literature on stated preference studies and valuation of nbs with a specific focus on a developing country context our approach and findings provide useful guidance on how to convert time to money and we provide a discussion on when to use a time or a money payment vehicle by improving the applied methodology and thus generating more accurate and reliable values for nbs benefits the results of our study can be used by future sp studies to improve the quality of economic information provided to the decision making domain to guide investments in nbs in developing countries the remainder of this paper is structured as follows first we continue this section by introducing the case study sites literature review provides a review of the literature on the conversion of time to monetary values and discusses market integration as potential driver of wtp disparities from time and money payment vehicles methods describes the data collection and presents the methods in data and analysis we describe the data characteristics followed by our approach to analyze the data results presents the results finally discussion and conclusion provides a discussion of the results and presents the main conclusions case study sites to compare wtp estimates from time and money payments in a developing country context we selected two coastal study sites in ghana see figure 1 the first is the coastal stretch between the communities of fuveme and anloga in the volta delta a rural site that includes eight smaller communities the second is the community of sakumono situated in tema city an urban site that includes one larger community ghana is a developing country whose coastal areas are changing rapidly a major issue along the ghanaian coast is the high erosion rates to which local geology human activities and climate change all contribute laïbi et al 2014 gomez et al 2020 the ongoing erosion negatively affects coastal ecosystems and puts pressure on local livelihoods that depend on these ecosystems and the services they provide in order to mitigate these negative effects several nbs focused on erosion prevention were selected prior to this research based on meetings with the community leaders site visits and insights from local researchers and ngo staff the potential restoration activities include beach nourishment restoration of coastal lagoons and recovering mangrove forest in the volta delta these restoration activities are expected to prevent erosion and provide other ecosystem service benefits figure 1 figure 1 map with the locations of the study sites in the volta delta the selected study site is situated between the keta lagoon volta river and gulf of guinee and is thus surrounded by water and mangroves the people depend on the different ecosystems for fisheries fuelwood and protection from erosion and floods the development institute 2016 due to overharvesting of fish stocks and mangrove wood in addition to ongoing erosion the ecosystems are degrading erosion in the volta delta is occurring at rates between two and 10 m per year ly 1980

converting time values into monetary values is required to compare wtp estimates from time and money payments as well as to use the outcomes of a sp study with time payments in cost benefit analyses so far studies mostly apply a generic market wage as conversion rate alam 2006 o garra 2009 vondolia et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 meginnis et al 2020 or estimate a leisure rate based on the study by cesario 1976 o garra 2009 casiwan launio et al 2011 both approaches can be criticized since they assume that the value of time is the same for all respondents while in reality we often find heterogeneity in wage and leisure rates tilahun et al 2015 therefore apply individual specific wage information while hagedoorn et al 2020 compose a conversion rate that is based on individual specific wage information as well as on information about how a respondent spends his or her time on an average day despite these improvements there are still several other problematic issues with wage based conversion rates first in developing contexts it is common that not all respondents earn a wage these respondents appear in the dataset as a missing value or as if their value of time is equal to zero an assumption that poorly reflects reality lloyd smith et al 2019 second for the conversion rate proposed by hagedoorn et al 2020 you need a lot of information from respondents including income information that respondents might not want to provide third composing the wage and leisure based conversion rates requires making assumptions with potentially large effects on the value of leisure time lloyd smith et al 2019 hagedoorn et al 2020 finally there is a lack of insights in the type of activity that respondents are willing to sacrifice in order to contribute time and thus whether we should use wage or leisure time as a proxy of opportunity costs alternatively there are studies that value time using information that is not based on wage data for instance through modeling approaches e g jara diaz et al 2008 revealed preferences e g fezzi et al 2014 combined revealed and stated preferences feather and shaw 1999 and stated preferences alvarez farizo et al 2001 larson et al 2004 eom and larson 2006 palmquist et al 2010 rai and scarborough 2013 czajkowski et al 2019 lloyd smith et al 2019 meginnis et al 2020 this paper focusses on the stated preference part of this literature lloyd smith et al 2019 asked each respondent for their willingness to accept wta a payment for time spent on specific activities via a questionnaire while others used the results of choice formats that include both time and money attributes to calculate the opportunity cost of time alvarez farizo et al 2001 larson et al 2004 eom and larson 2006 rai and scarborough 2013 czajkowski et al 2019 meginnis et al 2020 the observed individual specific values of time only weakly correlate with wage values and show high degrees of heterogeneity czajkowski et al 2019 lloyd smith et al 2019 a review of the literature indicates that most studies that use time payments in developing countries implement separate stated preference questions for both time and money payment vehicles e g gibson et al 2016 khanal et al 2019 endalew et al 2020 girma et al 2020 hagedoorn et al 2020 navrud and vondolia 2020 alemu et al 2021 this research design feature is likely due to the fact that combining both time and money attributes in one choice format rarely suits applications other than transportation and recreation demand studies therefore including a separate stated preference question on the value of time in the accompanying questionnaire provides a way forward in standardizing the conversion of time to money in valuation studies and reduces the risk of making false assumptions in the investigated research context these potentially false assumptions include that the value of time is the same across all respondents that all respondents would sacrifice the same activity that respondents either earn a wage or that their value of time is 0 and that the value of leisure time can be measured by taking a generic fraction of the wage rate until now such a valuation of time approach is unexplored in the context of payment vehicle use in developing countries wtp disparities from time and money payment vehicles previous studies that convert time values into monetary ones and consequently compare these results to wtp estimates based on money payments provide ambiguous results regarding the difference in wtp estimates five studies find higher wtp estimates for the time payment vehicle alam 2006 o garra 2009 casiwan launio et al 2011 hagedoorn et al 2020 meginnis et al 2020 four studies find similar time and money based wtp estimates o garra 2009 vondolia et al 2014 tilahun et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 and two studies find lower wtp estimates for the time payment vehicle vondolia et al 2014 navrud and vondolia 2020 when observing this variation in findings two things stand out first in the case of o garra 2009 and vondolia et al 2014 the findings are highly sensitive to the applied conversion rate second since this explanation cannot explain all variation in findings it seems that the specifics of the study sites also affect the wtp disparities in short the literature on differences in wtp across time and money payments is sparse and fails to explain what drives the disparities market integration levels are an example of site specific factors that may affect wtp disparities gibson et al 2016 observe from the literature that the disparities between wtp from time and money payments are greatest in rural sites and argue that relatively lower levels of market integration in these sites may be driving the larger disparities the reasoning is that the absence of well functioning labor markets and high transaction costs in some areas may mean that people are not able to sell their labor and therefore allocate more time to leisure or self employment casiwan launio et al 2011 tilahun et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 this in turn may decrease opportunity costs of time and lead to higher relative preferences for money limited access to credit markets may further increase the preference for money over time consequently the willingness to contribute time compared to money will be higher and lead to the divergence of wtp estimates obtained from time and money experiments the empirical evidence on the effects of market integration on the divergence of wtp from time and money experiments is limited to three studies o garra 2009 gibson et al 2016 hagedoorn et al 2020 gibson et al 2016 investigate the differences between wtp from time and money payment experiments in a rural site in cambodia in their study they do not find differences in wtp from the two experiments they argue that the close connection between their rural study site and a nearby urban area precluded any divergence and that future studies should investigate areas more remote from urban centers in a study in fiji o garra 2009 finds that people that are employed in an urban setting are willing to pay more in money terms and less in time likewise in a study in vietnam hagedoorn et al 2020 find that households with more income from wage labor are less willing to contribute time the results from the latter two studies confirm the reasoning in the literature but more extensive analyses are necessary to confirm the effect of market integration on wtp disparities both gibson et al 2016 and o garra 2009 furthermore transform time values to monetary values using a generic market wage conversion rate and neither of the studies provides a measurement of local market integration levels methods we used a discrete choice experiment dce embedded in a household survey which was implemented in the selected study sites as described in the previous section to develop the dce and questionnaire we started with an exploratory pre test survey followed by a qualitative and quantitative pilot survey both serving as input and testing of the design of the main study in the following sections we will discuss the data collection the design of the dce and the household survey data collection data collection took place between october 2018 and april 2019 the pre test survey was implemented during october 2018 and the pilot survey during february 2019 both among 50 respondents in each study site the main study was implemented during march and april 2019 for which we interviewed 480 respondents in the volta delta and 490 in sakumono community based on population data obtained from community leaders we interviewed every 10th household in the rural site and every second in the urban site thereby ensuring random sampling those that participated in the pilot survey were excluded from the main survey respondents were randomly assigned to the money or time experiment and evenly divided across both experiments respondents were interviewed at their home and were asked to answer the questions on behalf of themselves as individuals except for the questions that targeted household food consumption income and income sources and resource extraction we targeted to interview the household head or the partner of the household head the interviews were executed face to face by two teams of each 12 local enumerators the enumerators were trained for one day before the pre test survey two days before the pilot survey and another day before the main study before implementation the dce and questionnaires were translated into the local language ewe in the volta delta and twi in sakumono community insyt esoko software2 was used to record the interview answers on mobile phones to maintain a high quality data collection survey responses were checked upon submission and a continuous feedback loop was established between the enumerators and the principal investigator discrete choice experiment dce is a stated preference valuation method in environmental sciences that is often applied to value ecosystem services the main theoretical underpinnings come from the theory of value lancaster 1966 and random utility theory mcfadden 1974 hanley et al 1998 it includes asking respondents to make repeated choices between descriptions of a good or service that are defined by a number of attributes johnston et al 2017 provide guidance for stated preference studies on environmental goods and services according to their recommendations we started with qualitative and quantitative testing of our survey and dce among people from the target population by doing so we developed a clear baseline and description of the ecosystem restoration activities avoided behavioral anomalies and ensured a payment vehicle description that is perceived by respondents as realistic credible familiar and coercive the test procedures served to reach the goal of presenting respondents with an incentive compatible valuation exercise that involves a plausible consequential decision vossler et al 2012 note that truthful preference revelation is possible when respondents believe they have at least a weak chance of influencing the decision to ensure consequentiality of the valuation scenario the introductory text to the survey and framing used in the dce laid out the project partners and funding agencies and it was explicitly explained that the answers to the survey and dce can serve as input for the design of future environmental management plans see supplemental appendix a for the included statements in the design of the questionnaire we follow the recommendations of johnston et al 2017 by including auxiliary and debriefing questions as well as numerous questions concerning demographics pre test survey the pre test survey served four specific goals the first goal of the pre test survey was to investigate the suitability of different payment vehicles the list of payment vehicles included in the pre test survey consisted of payment types that are familiar to the communities the two most credible and realistic payment vehicles proved to be a monthly contribution to a community fund and time spent tending and cleaning the ecosystems this was measured through respondent scores on trust acceptability practicality and coverage for each type of payment morrison et al 2000 the second goal of the pre test survey was to identify the most important ecosystem services affected by the restoration activities in both of the selected study sites the three ecosystem services that are most important are erosion control fish abundance and visitors i e tourists as well as local visitors third the results of the pre test also served as input for the levels and framing of the payment vehicles and attributes lastly an initial value of time was estimated by comparing the results of pre test survey questions that asked for the respondents maximum wtp via the community fund and the maximum wtp via time contributions similar to hagedoorn et al 2020 this value of time was used to link the levels of both payment vehicles in the dce design pilot survey the main goals of the pilot survey were to test the clarity of the choice questions credibility and realism of the presented situations plausibility of the attribute levels and clarity of the pictograms and the attribute descriptions we first conducted five informal interviews in each study site during these interviews we introduced the research asked basic survey questions and presented a draft version of the experiment through these interviews we gained a more qualitative understanding of how the respondents perceive the different aspects of the experiment based on this understanding we improved the experiment before the survey was piloted among 50 respondents in each study site after which further adjustments were made for instance during this phase we adjusted the business as usual bau level of the fish abundance attribute from 0 change to a reduction of 10 since this better reflected the respondent s perceptions of the bau scenario design the design of the dces is presented in table 1 an identical fractional factorial orthogonal design was used for both experiments one with money payments and one with time payments the initial generated fractional factorial design included 60 choice cards after which dominant choices were identified and adjusted the quality of our pilot survey results was not sufficient to base priors on for the creation of an efficient design but we did learn that respondents generally perceive all changes in ecosystem services as positive and payments as negative based on this a choice was identified as dominant if one option in a choice card had higher levels for all ecosystem services attributes and a lower level for the payment attribute as compared to the other option on that choice card there were five of such choices for which we switched the payment levels across the two options and thereby eliminated the dominant choice the 60 choice cards were divided over six versions so that each respondent was asked to answer ten choice questions besides a bau option each choice card included two management options a and b these management options describe situations in which the ecosystem restoration activities are implemented and managed by the households in the community the attributes are described by four levels and the payment vehicle by five the levels that are included in the bau option did not appear in any of the management options the levels of the attributes were selected based on current erosion and fisheries trends and changes in visitor rates that were perceived as plausible by the respondents judging by the pre test and pilot survey results the levels of the payment vehicles were based on the results of the pre test and pilot survey and are related by the value of time obtained from the pre test survey results the payment vehicles are presented to the respondents as coercive and are similar in terms of framing this implies that the tasks that would have to be performed would otherwise be paid for with the money collected through the community fund these tasks include cleaning guarding building fences or look outs enforcing regulations and planting trees example choice cards for both experiments are shown in figure 2 and figure 3 table 1 table 1 attributes and attribute levels for the discrete choice experiments one for each payment vehicle figure 2 figure 2 example choice card for the time payment vehicle used in both the rural and urban study site figure 3 figure 3 example choice card for the money payment vehicle used in both the rural and urban study site household survey the questionnaire that was used in the household survey consisted of six main sections covering 1 ecosystem use and environmental perceptions 2 dce and 3 dce debriefing 4 participation in environmental projects 5 risk perceptions and 6 demographics the survey was developed in close cooperation between local and international ngos and universities improvements were made based on the results of the pre test and pilot surveys the questionnaire is identical for both study sites except for the questions on mangrove ecosystem use due to the lack of mangroves in the urban site time to money conversion rates in this study we compare three different time to money conversion rates the first two conversion rates are generic wage based conversion rates these conversion rates serve as a default that we compare to the third conversion rate we base the default rates on common practices in the current literature and the study of vondolia et al 2014 in particular due to the proximity of our study sites the third conversion rate is inspired by the approach of lloyd smith et al 2019 and includes individual specific values of time that are not based on wage information conversion rate 1 minimum wage time mw the minimum wage rate in ghana during 2019 equaled 10 65 ghc for an 8 h work day for this conversion rate this value is applied to convert the time values similar to several previous studies alam 2006 o garra 2009 vondolia et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 conversion rate 2 sample earnings time se for this approach we use data collected through the household survey on wages and hours worked per week to calculate each respondent s wage for an 8 h day spent on wage labor we also use data collected on trade profits and hours spent on trading per week to calculate each respondent s profit for 8 h of trading however more than half of the respondents either does not earn a wage or does not make any money through trading therefore we combine the variables on wages and trade profits to estimate an individual s opportunity cost of time and refer to this new combined variable as earnings if a respondent only earns income from wages and not from trade profits we include the value of an 8 h day spent on wage labor in the earnings variable if a respondent only earns income from trade profits and not from wage labor we include the value of an 8 h day spent on trading in the earnings variable for those that earn income from both wage labor and trade profits we include the highest value in the earnings variable in the rural site 65 of respondents reported earnings from either wages or trade profits and is thus included in the earnings variable this number equals 70 in the urban site since this still means we are missing large portions of our samples we apply a generic value instead of individual specific values to estimate the generic value of time we eliminate those respondents that did not report any earnings i e those that do not earn income from wages or trade profits and take the median of the remaining sample as the time to money conversion rate similar as vondolia et al 2014 did for wages only conversion rate 3 non wage based individual value of time time ivot to compose the individual specific non wage based value of time we used the approach of lloyd smith et al 2019 as inspiration and ask respondents for the compensation they would require for an 8 h day of working on the restoration projects the study by lloyd smith et al 2019 was conducted in a different context i e fishing trips in the united states and therefore we had to adjust the approach to fit the ghanaian context the main adjustment relates to the use of a stochastic payment card during the testing phase we learned that working with such a payment card causes difficulties due to low familiarity with the use of probabilities within the ghanaian communities see also navrud and vondolia 2020 therefore we decided not to use a stochastic payment card but to include an open ended question format instead due to practical reasons i e limited internet and otherwise increased complexity on the enumerators side we were not able to include other types of format such as the double bounded dichotomous choice format adopting an open ended format over a stochastic payment card means that we simplified the valuation approach and increased the potential for methodological issues nonetheless we believe that this is a small yet valuable step forward with regard to conversion rates in developing countries our approach is similar to lloyd smith et al 2019 in that we describe the formulated activities as if they would comprise a part time job we also included a yes no filter question to allow respondents to opt out an option that was also embedded in the stochastic payment approach of lloyd smith et al 2019 this yes no filter question furthermore prevented people from stating unrealistically high values as a result of protest beliefs an issue that we identified during the test phases when we did not include a yes no filter question which guided people that simply did not want to contribute time to state extremely high values out of protest as a result the following question formulation was included in the main study imagine a situation in which an environmental management project is implemented in your community this could be the replanting of mangroves deepening and cleaning of the lagoon defending the beaches so that they do not decrease in size and keeping all areas including the sea waste free you and other community members could be asked to work between 1 and 6 days per month on this project after implementation to ensure that the natural areas will remain in good condition after these measures are taken this work includes tasks such as picking up trash guarding the natural area building fences or look outs enforce regulations and planting trees would you be willing to conduct this work answer yes or no if yes there might be some compensation available for this work as if it would be a part time job in that case how much would you want to be paid for one day of such work 8 h answer in ghc per day in this question formulation the descriptions match the framing in the dce the question was presented to the respondents in a later stage of the questionnaire after the dce and dce debriefing questions the results of the second question were used to convert time to money values for each respondent for those that answered no to the first question we did not obtain a value of time this valuation approach proved to be efficient since it only requires two additional survey questions compared to a long list of questions such as in hagedoorn et al 2020 the approach is also effective in that each respondent is able to express a value of time also those that do not earn a wage or trade profits over 30 in our samples and would therefore otherwise be recorded as a missing value and thus excluded from the analysis moreover the observed value of time is specifically related to the activities that the respondents are asked to conduct in the dce we included additional questions related to the certainty of the stated value of time and in regards to which current activity would be given up market integration measures currently there is no consensus in the literature on whether a single measure can be applied to accurately represent market integration levels and if yes what that measure should be studies conducted in different contexts and with different purposes have used different market integration measures for example the literature on amazon tribes market integration focuses more on selling resources and labor division whereas studies that are applied in a wider spectrum of locations focus more on participation in and income from wage labor and trade profits e g godoy et al 2010 ensminger and henrich 2014 therefore we included multiple survey questions that measure variables that are related to market integration based on different strands of literature first the studies conducted in the amazon rainforest aim to investigate indigenous people s market integration by applying measures including the likelihood of requesting a loan fraction of income from wage labor and the sale of natural resources godoy et al 1997 godoy 2001 godoy et al 2005 godoy et al 2010 vasco and siren 2016 vasco et al 2017 the latter measure is also found in the behavioral economics literature e g siziba and bulte 2012 and in the experimental economics literature e g ensminger and henrich 2014 ensminger and henrich 2014 conducted a large scale study across all continents except for europe and focused also on market integration measures such as the frequency of engagement in wage labor and trade the amount of income from wage labor and trade profits and the percentage of food bought within the household finally the accumulation of durable goods is regarded to be a result of increased market integration boughton et al 2007 godoy et al 2010 based on this literature review we developed a range of market integration measures as presented in table 2 table 2 table 2 market integration measures data and analysis in the following sections we first present the data characteristics this chapter then describes the specifications of the models that we apply to the collected data and concludes with the statistical analysis for the differences in urban and rural wtp disparities data characteristics prior to the analysis we excluded protesters from the dataset they were identified by their choice to select the opt out in all of the presented choices combined with their answer to a debriefing question that focused on the reason for this choice if the reason was either a lack of responsibility lack of trust or unwillingness to weigh the different attributes against each other we excluded the respondent e g meyerhoff and liebe 2010 meyerhoff et al 2014 nine protesters were identified in the rural sample of which three in the time sample and six in the money sample in the urban sample five protesters were identified in the time sample and zero in the money sample for the calculation of time ivot we excluded another 20 of the respondents from both the rural and urban time samples since they stated that they do not want to work on the restoration projects answering no to the filter question the datasets without these respondents are referred to as converted time payment samples the key characteristics of the data are presented in table 3 applying kruskal wallis and chi square tests we found no significant differences in any of the variables included in table 3 between the samples that either answered to money or time payments in both sites in the remainder of this paper we compare the money payment samples with the converted time payment samples in comparing these samples we only find a higher age in the rural converted time payment sample compared to the rural money payment sample furthermore we measure the perceived credibility of the valuation scenario through a follow up question more specifically we asked respondents for their level of agreement with the statement i believe that the changes shown in the experiment can take place in reality the results of this follow up question indicate that on average the respondents perceive the valuation scenario as credible which furthermore suggest that they perceive their choices as consequential table 3 table 3 data characteristics for the three samples money payments time payments converted time payments sample in each area model specification we estimated five models for each study site one for the money payments one for the time payments and one for each of the three different conversion rates the conversion of time values to money values was performed before model estimation by applying the three time to money conversion rates to the time values in the converted time payment sample dataset the converted time attribute was then included in the model instead of the original time attribute the converted time payments sample dataset is used for all conversion rates to ensure comparability across these model results and to exclude uncertainties related to the answers provided by respondents who stated that they do not want to contribute time but did answer to choice cards that included time contributions we convert the time values before model estimation to be able to also run the krinsky and robb 1986 procedure and obtain the information necessary for the statistical comparison of differences in wtp across the urban and rural study site as described in the next section to allow for preference heterogeneity and obtain coefficient estimates at the individual level we analyzed each choice dataset using a random parameters logit rpl model train 2003 in this model the probability p that individual i chooses alternative j out of k 1 k alternatives is equal to p i j δ β i b d β i j k 1 in which x is a vector with choice attributes and β is a vector with attribute parameters to be estimated by the model these parameters vary per respondent hence β i with probability density δ β i b this density can be a function of any set of parameters but in our case it represents the mean and variance of β in our sample because the model in eq 1 has no analytical solution simulations are needed with which draws are taken from a pre specified distribution for each β i in our models all attributes are included as continuous variables and for each attribute 3 200 halton draws are taken from the triangular distribution number of draws are based on czajkowski and budziński 2019 we use triangular distributions instead of normal distributions to allow for clearer visualization of the wtp distributions and to ensure finite coefficient bounds for all attributes and the payments which is of relevance for the analysis described in statistical approach to compare wtp disparities across the study sites as well as for obtaining finite moments for the wtp estimates rai et al 2015 however the main patterns and conclusions are very similar for both distributions 4 for erosion control the preferences are restricted to negative values since the attribute is coded as increases in erosion for which negative preferences can be expected for increases in fish abundance positive preferences can be expected and thus here the draws are restricted to positive values for visitors there is no restriction on preferences since positive as well as negative preferences can be expected related to increases in tourist numbers the payment vehicle values are redefined to be the negative of the variable and thereafter included in the model with a lognormal distribution and the standard deviation restricted to 0 following the newest model to estimate wtp from carson and czajkowski 2019 carson and czajkowski 2019 suggest this approach to overcome the problem that exists with the ratio of coefficients approach to calculate wtp being that it results in an undefined standard error for wtp the krinsky and robb 1986 procedure was applied to obtain 95 confidence intervals of mean wtp estimates by doing this for each of the five models we obtained values for wtp money and wtp time days as well as for the converted time payment samples resulting in wtp time mw wtp time se and wtp time ivot furthermore respondent specific parameter estimates were used to estimate wtp for each respondent for each attribute for all estimated models the wtp values on respondent level are used to visualize and statistically compare the wtp distributions by applying mann whitney u tests statistical approach to compare wtp disparities across the study sites we statistically compare the differences in wtp from time and money payments between the rural and urban sites to identify in which study site wtp disparities are larger it was not possible to ask respondents to do both time and money choice experiments since this would increase the cognitive complexity of the survey too much based on observations and assessments made during the pre test and pilot stages we are therefore not able to compare differences in wtp money and time based wtp on a respondent level however through a combination of statistical methods we can still statistically compare wtp disparities across the rural and urban study sites in a meaningful way we describe the steps taken briefly below and provide a more extensive description in supplemental appendix b 1 take 10 000 random draws from the triangular distributions of attribute coefficients obtained from the rpl models by taking into account the full distribution of the attribute coefficients as an alternative to only the mean estimates we include as much information as possible in our analysis 2 calculate a wtp value for each draw for all attributes 3 use the wtp values to calculate percent differences pds between wtp estimates derived from the money experiments and from the experiments with different time to money conversion rates 4 apply mann whitney u tests to statistically compare the pds between the rural and urban site per attribute we apply a non parametric test here since we do not know the distribution and standard error of the pds results time to money conversion as described earlier we calculated three different conversion rates the first conversion rate time mw is based on publicly available information on the ghanaian minimum wage equaling 10 65 ghc per day for the second conversion rate time se data from the household survey resulted in a median sample earnings of 50 ghc per day in the rural study site and 60 ghc per day in the urban study site the distributions of time se are statistically different across the study sites mann whitney u test p 0 001 the estimated values of time for the third conversion rate time ivot resulted in a median of 50 ghc in both study sites the distributions of time ivot are not statistically different across the study sites mann whitney u test p 0 123 the results of a follow up question reveal that respondents feel certain about their stated individual value of time i e average of 4 48 out of 5 in the rural site and 4 34 out of 5 in the urban site to be able to contribute time to the environmental projects most respondents would give up leisure time urban 50 rural 68 followed by subsequently housework urban 22 rural 9 and income generating activities such as wage labor urban 3 rural 9 trading urban 12 rural 8 and fishing or farming urban 6 rural 6 in the urban study site compared to other activities the distribution of the values of time are significantly different for wage labor mean 65 ghc and for leisure mean 50 ghc mann whitney u test p 0 098 p 0 008 in the rural study site compared to other activities the distribution of the values of time are significantly different for fishing and farming mean 33 ghc mann whitney u test p 0 008 figure 4 and figure 5 visualize the relation between time ivot and the individual specific values underlying time se including individual specific wages trade profits and overall earnings we find positive correlations between time ivot and the individual specific wage trade profit and earnings variables in the rural site spearman s rho 0 188 with p 0 019 spearman s rho 0 156 with p 0 060 spearman s rho 0 181 with p 0 006 respectively in the urban site we find a positive correlation between time ivot and individual specific trade profits spearman s rho 0 172 with p 0 014 the percentage of people whose time ivot is below or equal to their individual specific earnings is 67 in the rural site and 57 in the urban site in comparing the results of time ivot to people s individual specific earnings we find that at the median people s time ivot equals 74 of their earnings in the rural site and at 83 of their earnings in the urban site the percentage of respondents whose time ivot is below or equal to the minimum wage used for time mw is 12 in the rural site and 4 in the urban site figure 4 figure 4 kernel density plot of time ivot and individual specific wage trade profit and earning values in the rural study site figure 5 figure 5 kernel density plot of time ivot and individual specific wage trade profit and earning values in the urban study site model estimation and wtp results the results of the rpl models are presented in table 4 and table 5 positive preferences are identified for all ecosystem services in both study sites results of the krinsky and robb 1986 simulations are included in table 6 higher wtp values are found for the time payments for each conversion rate in both study

visitors attribute are about 46 times larger for wtp time se than for wtp money the wtp values for the urban erosion attribute are about 20 times larger for wtp time ivot than for wtp money the

visible when combined with wtp time days and wtp money the distributions of wtp time days and wtp money are included in separate figures in supplemental appendix c the results of mann whitney u tests

across study sites the results of the analysis on the differences in market integration measures across our study sites is presented in table 7 these results show that the two sites differ significantly in terms of market integration levels we find that people in the urban site participate more frequently in wage labor and trade and also earn more income from these sources both proportionally and in terms of actual income moreover a higher percentage of the urban respondents has requested a loan before and urban respondents source more of their food from stores and markets rather than from subsistence activities however one market integration measure resulted in a significantly higher value for the rural study site sale of natural resources measure 8 table 7 table 7 results of the comparison of market integration measures across the urban and rural study site analysed through kruskal wallis and chisquare tests in table 8 the results of the analysis procedure to statistically compare wtp disparities across the rural and urban study sites is presented this procedure is described in detail in supplemental appendix b we find that the results of the mann whitney u tests all indicate that there are significant differences in wtp disparities across the study sites in table 8 we also included the median of the pds which represent the size of the randomly generated wtp disparities for each conversion rate in both the urban and rural study site here we present the median to avoid outlier effects the results show that for all attributes the pds between wtp money and time based wtp values are smaller in the urban study site than in the rural study site for instance we find that for the erosion control attribute at the median wtp time mw is about 7 2 times larger than wtp money in the rural study site and about 3 5 times larger than wtp money in the urban study site supplemental appendix d includes two additional sensitivity analyses on this matter discussing differences across samples in terms of market integration measures and whether the full time or converted time samples are used table 8 table 8 results of the analysis procedure to

site discussion and conclusion the aim of this study was to investigate differences in wtp estimates from choice experiments with time and money payments with the overall goal to estimate more accurate wtp estimates related to nbs benefits more accurate wtp estimates means higher quality of information on the value of ecosystems and benefits of investing in nbs current investment in nbs is low even though nbs have the potential to contribute to a sustainable and climate resilient future this is especially the case in developing countries where the impact of climate change and natural hazards is generally higher therefore we use the results of separate dces using time and money payments to value ecosystem services related to nbs in rural and urban ghana the nbs include beach nourishment restoration of coastal lagoons and recovery of mangrove forest these nbs are expected to affect the delivery of ecosystem services including erosion prevention fish abundance and visitors to the ecosystems the investigated communities currently face high erosion rates and decreases in fish abundance both of which are expected to exacerbate with climate change and thereby increase the need for alternative livelihoods we first discuss our findings structured by the four central research questions and then continue to summarize our conclusions discussion generally our results comply with studies that have found higher wtp values for the time payment vehicle alam 2006 o garra 2009 casiwan launio et al 2011 hagedoorn et al 2020 meginnis et al 2020 but contrast others vondolia et al 2014 tilahun et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 navrud and vondolia 2020 what is particularly interesting is that our rural study site volta delta is nearby the ones used in vondolia et al 2014 and navrud and vondoli 2020 vondolia et al 2014 found lower wtp estimates when time was converted using the minimum wage and comparable wtp estimates when time was converted using the sample wage navrud and vondoli 2019 found lower wtp estimates when time was converted with a wage rate as estimated via a pre test questionnaire the main difference between our study and the one from vondolia et al 2014 is that their respondents were already used to contributing time as well as money to the management of the irrigation channels this provides a possible explanation for the difference in results5 details on the type of work that would be conducted by the respondents are lacking in navrud and vondoli 2019 but the study considers different payments for flood insurance that will pay insured farmers after a flood with bags of rice the difference in results between our study and the one from navrud and vondoli 2019 can potentially also be explained through experience with payments where it is likely that respondents have more experience with money payments for insurance compared to time payments more research would be needed to identify how experience with payments for different types of goods affects wtp disparities with regard to the size of the wtp disparities large differences in wtp from time and money experiments have been identified in the literature before casiwan launio et al 2011 hagedoorn et al 2020 furthermore previous studies find that the application of individual specific conversion rates results in higher wtp estimates compared to generic conversion rates tilahun et al 2015 hagedoorn et al 2020 however the results of both wtp time se and wtp time ivot can be perceived as somewhat extreme so we put these values into perspective by comparing the wtp estimates for the fisheries attribute to the household income in the rural study site mean household income equals 924 ghc and about 25 of this income is related to fishing in the urban study site mean household income equals 1 280 ghc and about 32 of income is related to fishing therefore mean wtp time se and wtp time ivot values for 1 increase in fisheries of 10 ghc in the rural site and 40 ghc in the urban site are not unrealistic especially since much of the fish catch is used for subsistence and is therefore not included in the households monetary income survey data shows that around 20 of the households food consumption comes directly from their own fisheries and that between 19 and 25 of the harvested resources never reaches the market due to subsistence use nonetheless on average respondents only work or trade around 3 h per day which could have led to reduced belief in payment consequentiality in regards to having to work 8 h days this would also mean that accounting for 8 h of a person s time in time se and time ivot resulted in an overestimation currently it is common practice in the stated preference literature in developing countries to apply a generic wage based conversion rate either the market wage rate or a leisure rate e g alam 2006 o garra 2009 casiwan launio et al 2011 vondolia et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 meginnis et al 2020 our findings strongly suggest that the underlying implicit assumptions made in using such a generic wage based conversion rate do not hold first we identify high heterogeneity in both wage trade profit and earnings data and time ivot indicating that values of time differ across respondents second we find that there is diversity in the type of activity people would be sacrificing to enable the contribution of time therefore assuming that all respondents would sacrifice the same activity is wrong moreover our study shows that other activities besides wage or leisure may be sacrificed and that different activities hold different values third we find variance in how people s time ivot relates to their earnings suggesting that applying one fraction of the wage rate to obtain a leisure rate i e 1 3 of the wage rate based on cesario 1976 to all respondents does not reflect reality additionally we find that to compose an individual specific wage based conversion rate we would have to eliminate more than 30 of our sample or assume that their value of time is equal to 0 which does not comply with our time ivot results nor with previous studies results czajkowski et al 2019 lloyd smith et al 2019 therefore further research on individual specific non wage based conversion rates is recommended to elaborate more on this the results of the non wage based conversion rate time ivot replicate those of previous studies in the sense of high levels of heterogeneity czajkowski et al 2019 lloyd smith et al 2019 furthermore we also observed weak correlations between time ivot and wage and profit data that are within the range of the results of lloyd smith et al 2019 compared to lloyd smith et al 2019 who identified a value of time that averages about 90 of the wage rate we identify values of time equal to slightly lower fractions of the wage rate i e 74 and 83 however for the urban study site we do not detect significant correlations between data on individual specific wages and time ivot furthermore we find that the values for the individual specific wage and trade profit variables are more dispersed compared to the values of time ivot these results potentially indicate anomalies in our collected wage data or that part of the respondents answered strategically to the time ivot question potentially stimulated by our consequentiality statement and the involvement of local representatives enumerators and a local ngo which could have led respondents to believe that actual paid job opportunities would arise we were not able to identify nor rule out this behavior based on our data therefore we recommend future studies to include specific consequentiality statements and to work with a more advanced question format for the measurement of time ivot as opposed to the open ended format that we applied by using an open ended question we likely face a lack of incentive compatibility and the measured values of time may present an under or overestimation carson and groves 2007 an overestimation seems more likely in our case since income per capita is low in the study sites and therefore respondents may have stated larger values for time ivot than that they would be minimally willing to accept as compensation for participating in the restoration work applying this method to value time in developing countries could therefore be improved by a different question format i e double bounded dichotomous choice if the practical circumstances allow for reliable estimation of time values through such a format when researchers face a similar situation to ours i e a situation in which it may be complicated to apply different question formats a simple yet potentially effective qualitative adjustment could come from the inclusion of a provision point mechanism such as described in bush et al 2013 turning to the market integration measures the urban study site scores higher on 9 out of 10 of the measures and it therefore seems clear that the urban site is more integrated into the market however there is one market integration measure where the rural study site scores higher the sale of natural resources since selling self produced resources serves as one of the few income opportunities in this area it makes sense that the rural study site scores relatively higher on this measure as discussed there is not a uniform way of measuring market integration in the literature however most of the relevant literature on wtp disparities from time and money payments focuses on labor and credit market integration as the type of market integration that could reduce these disparities casiwan launio et al 2011 tilahun et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 therefore we argue that measures 1 to 6 and 9 and 10 in table 8 are more suitable for measuring market integration for this specific purpose measure 7 and 8 which are arguably more related to the level of subsistence of the household might be better suited for measuring market integration in more remote areas such as studies conducted regarding amazon tribes market integration the combination of the results on differences in market integration across both study sites and those on differences in the size of the wtp disparities across both sites provides qualitative evidence on the negative effect of market integration on wtp disparities from time and money payments this result resonates with previous findings presented in o garra 2009 and hagedoorn et al 2020 and confirms the theoretical argumentation as laid out in gibson et al 2016 we provide a qualitative conclusion on this matter since different respondents answered to different payment types so we were not able to analyze these effects on an individual level moreover we argue that a household s level of market integration is determined by a combination of the ten market integration measures which are difficult to combine in one composite variable that could thereafter be added to the rpl models therefore we suggest future studies to further investigate the range of wtp disparities from experiments with time and money payments across settings with varying levels of market integration an aspect that has received less attention in our study is the identified heterogeneity in wtp based on time and money payments we detect heterogeneity in our rpl models which may arise due to a number of underlying cognitive processes and may have affected our comparison of wtp disparities across study sites for instance urban or rural respondents may benefit more from the different ecosystem services and may therefore have stated different wtp thereby affecting the wtp disparities differences in benefits can be related to a respondents distance from the ecosystems but also to a respondents occupation for instance in both sites households live close to the coastline median 200 400 m in the urban study site and median 400 600 m in the rural study site and visit the beaches frequently median once a week in both study sites meaning that the benefits of erosion prevention are likely to be perceived similar across the study sites although there may still be differences within the study sites for the fishing attribute we find that a similar fraction of the respondents is fisher 47 in the urban study site and 56 in the rural study site as well as fish monger 25 in the urban study site and 29 in the rural study site for the visitors attribute where most benefits are likely to end up with the traders we also identify similar fractions across the study sites 47 in the urban study site and 45 in the rural study site this means that the effect of heterogeneity on our across study sites comparison is likely to be limited but within the study sites some respondents may have higher preferences for the fishing attribute whereas others may prefer the visitors attribute additionally heterogeneity in the expected productivity and effectiveness of the contributions may also affect wtp as do general attitudes towards contributing and more specifically via time or money and trust in the managers of the contributions the latter was partly covered by selecting a payment context that receives most trust of the study population as based on the pre test survey however we recommend future studies to investigate the underlying causes of heterogeneity and the effects of this heterogeneity on differences in wtp from time and money payments conclusion in this study we find substantially larger wtp estimates when a time payment vehicle is used compared to when a money payment vehicle is used thereby answering research question 1 furthermore we answer research question 2 by showing that the underlying implicit assumptions related to wage based conversion rates do not hold in the investigated context through a comparison of these conversion rates to a non wage based conversion rate overall the identified large wtp disparities from time and money payments likely reflect the problem that financially constrained households cannot freely express their values when monetary payments are required simultaneously it shows that nbs provide highly valued benefits to substantial parts of the population our answer to research question 3 is that market integration levels are higher in an urban setting than in a rural setting since the urban study site scores higher on all but one market integration measure this result adds to the identification of larger wtp disparities in the rural study site compared to the urban study site which allows us to conclude that larger smaller wtp disparities correspond to lower higher market integration levels thereby answering research question 4 however even though wtp disparities are smaller in the urban study site we still find significantly higher wtp estimates for the time payment vehicle in this site based on our results we provide two recommendations to those that work on valuing nbs in developing countries first we recommend to consider implementing sp studies with time payment vehicles the two alternative approaches for valuing nbs in developing countries i e sp studies with money payments and the avoided damage cost approach pose a higher risk of underestimating the values of nbs and may therefore hamper investments in nbs while considering implementing an sp study with time payments we recommend to investigate market integration levels during the testing phase of such a valuation study to guide this decision when low market integration levels are observed a time payment vehicle is arguably more suitable and when high levels of market integration are observed one may want to question the use of a time payment vehicle yet since we still find large wtp disparities in the urban area where market integration levels are higher we cannot provide an indication of a standard range regarding the level of market integration for which a time payment vehicle would not be suitable anymore second we suggest to convert the estimated time values to money values through a combination of wage based and non wage based conversion approaches and use both results in cost benefit analyses as a means of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis on the one hand we find evidence that the assumptions made in generic wage based conversion rates do not hold in reality on the other hand we also acknowledge that improvements would have to be made to our non wage based conversion approach to solve potential issues related to incentive compatibility and strategic bias these adjustments in the approach to value the benefits of nbs can lead to more accurate welfare estimates of nbs projects trigger investments and thereby reduce the finance gap that exists for nbs and contribute to a more sustainable and climate resilient future we also provide recommendations for future lines of research based on the results of this study first we recommend to further explore individual specific non wage based conversion rates we encourage more comparisons of similar and different types of conversion rates as used in this study this could include similar individual specific non wage based conversion rates or approaches that are based on more advanced question formats but also individual specific wage based conversion rates if the sample characteristics in terms of monetary income sources allows for this second we also encourage studies to further investigate the relation between market integration and wtp disparities for this purpose it would be useful to replicate this study in areas with high levels of market integration and measure both wtp disparities and market integration as a kind of benchmark subsequently further replications of our approach in areas with different levels of market integration can contribute to studying the relationship between the level of market integration and the disparities in wtp from time and money experiments alternatively studies may want to pose separate sp questions with time and money payments to one respondent and use this information to analyze the relation between market integration levels and wtp disparities from time and money payments on the individual level third we see potential for further research lines in terms of drivers of wtp disparities in the direction of experience with different payments for different goods protest behavior related factors such as trust differences in hypothetical bias across both types of payment and heterogeneity in benefits received from nbs benefits ultimately these endeavors can contribute to discovering the values of natural resources to people in different contexts and different market integration settings data availability statement the raw data supporting the conclusions of this

currently experimental animals are widely used in biological and medical research however the scientific community has raised several bioethical concerns such as the number of animals required to achieve reproducible and statistically relevant results these concerns involve aspects related to pain discomfort and unwanted animal loss retrospectively we compare two different approaches for anesthesia dosage a mobile app for dose calculation and a standard dose calculation a total of 939 c57bl 6j and swiss mice were analyzed we collected data on intraoperative and anesthesia related mortality as described in electronic or physical handwritten records our results showed that the mobile app approach significantly reduces anesthetic related deaths upon using doses of ketamine and xylazine the results suggest that anesthesia related mortality can be minimized even more using information technology approaches helping to solve an old but transversal challenge for researchers working with experimental mice the mobile app is a free and open code which could be implemented worldwide as an essential requirement for all anesthetic procedures in mice using xylazine and ketamine combination as an open code app the labinsane initiative could also represent the starting point to unify and validate other anesthetic procedures in different species and strains introduction annually millions of animals are used for experimental purposes 1 3 experimental mice are usually anesthetized intraperitoneally with a ketamine and xylazine solution 4 7 an intraperitoneal procedure permits rapid application and fast anesthetic effect however the reasons why mice die during the anesthetic procedure could be attributed to the inappropriate ketamine and xylazine dosage the lack of supplemental oxygen and attention to details such as body temperature stress associated with handling and incorrect intraperitoneal technique moreover previous intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine combinations have caused several challenges related to a low margin of safety prolonged recovery and persistence of lost reflexes in mice 5 8 9 the ketamine and xylazine doses range from 60 to 200 mg kg 1 of ketamine and 4 to 26 4 mg kg 1 of xylazine 4 5 8 11 however serious inconsistent rates of anesthesia related mortality 0 100 have been reported 5 8 11 recent studies have shown that the mit app inventor a free and open source software can improve the performance and quality of the data analyzed helping operators to make well informed decisions 12 a previous report validated a smartphone app for the calculation of co 2 in inhalational anesthesia 13 supporting the concept that a mobile app could help operators to calculate individual anesthetic doses here our objective was to develop a mobile app to improve the accuracy of intraperitoneal anesthetic doses for mice in this way we used a range of previously tested safe doses 5 11 herein ketamine mg kg 1 and xylazine mg kg 1 in the following proportions 70 7 80 8 and 100 10 which are now contained in the labinsane mobile app then we compared the labinsane anesthetic protocol to the protocol of 133 mg kg 1 ketamine with 27 mg kg 1 xylazine materials and methods retrospectively anesthetic procedure records from c57bl 6j and swiss mice were included we collected electronic and physical handwritten records written between 2015 and 2021 from eight researchers figure 1 the records included from different projects were approved by the ethical committee of the university campinas 4330 1a 5521 1 5425 1 5349 1 4637 1 4072 1 3826 1 5414 1 4930 1 and 4699 1 records of anesthetic procedures were conducted according to the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals 14 the mice were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions in individual cages in a regimen of 12 h dark and 12 h light cycles and room temperature of 21 c all mice had ad libitum access to food 3 7 kcal g 1 and water figure 1 figure 1 anesthetic records from c57bl 6j and swiss mice collected records from standard or mobile app approach of anesthesia related mortality records were collected between 2015 and 2021 criteria for inclusion anesthetic records from intraoperative mortality were collected anesthesia related mortality was defined as lost breath or rigor mortis up to 2 h after the induction of anesthesia the anesthetic procedure characteristics were as follows intraperitoneal route using an insulin syringe 31g needle sterile saline solution or distilled water for injections 10 g 100 ml stock ketamine and 2 g 100 ml stock xylazine c57bl 6j or 10 g 100 ml stock ketamine 2 g 100 ml stock xylazine and 0 5 g 100 ml stock diazepam swiss the animals were on a chow diet and individual weights were measured on the same day of the anesthetic procedures we collected records from animals of two procedures two symmetrical full thickness excisional wounds 6 mm biopsy punch created on the back of each mouse as described previously 15 and stereotaxic surgery carried out using a stereotaxic frame 16 all surgeries were conducted up to 1 h after anesthesia induction immediately after surgery the mice were placed on a new germ free surface in a temperature controlled room 25 c without oxygen supplementation or monitoring of the temperature of the animal furthermore only male mice were included the anesthetic injections are a routine procedure in our lab records with the following pattern were selected using only a mixture of xylazine anasedan brazil ketamine dopalen brazil with or without diazepam and saline 0 9 solution intraperitoneal injections were performed in mice in the dorsal recumbent position the anesthetic combination was made up as a single injection criteria for exclusion all incomplete records were excluded from the analysis anesthesia related mortality lost breath or rigor mortis occurring after 2 h after induction of anesthesia mice fed with a high fat diet or animals treated with different specific care support before during or after the anesthetic procedure such as oxygen supplementation anesthetic procedure screened for both the standard dose and individual dose the animals were weighed on the same day of the anesthetic procedure the anesthetic combination was freshly prepared for each experiment as previously described 10 the final solution was used immediately standard doses were prepared as previously described 6 with some local adaptations briefly the final solution of the standard dose was prepared with 400 μl xylazine 2 g 100 ml 400 μl ketamine 10 g 100 ml and 200 μl saline solution the standard dose combination 80 100 μl of the mixture according to weight was administered intraperitoneally once by procedure the final solution of the individual dose was prepared and calculated by the labinsane mobile app briefly the mobile app processes body weight calculates a master anesthetic combination and then indicates the individual volume in μl to administer for each individual mouse figure 2 a specific individual dose adjusted to the body weight of the mouse was administered intraperitoneally once by procedure for the c57bl 6 strain a range of previously tested safe doses was used herein ketamine mg kg 1 and xylazine mg kg 1 were in the following proportions 70 7 80 8 and 100 10 3 7 while for the swiss strain we added diazepam 5 mg kg 1 12 figure 2 figure 2 labinsane schematic workflow individual animal weights were processed by the labinsane mobile app a master anesthetic cocktail was calculated based on the total number of animals and weights the mobile app approach showed an adjusted to weight anesthetic dose for each animal statistical analyses data extracted from the original records were pooled on a microsoft excel spreadsheet microsoft corporation 2007 all statistical tests were performed in graphpad prism 6 0v data were analyzed with fisher s exact test two sided and odds ratios statistical significance was set as alpha 0 05 and 95 confidence interval ci for the linear model we used a modified poisson regression model with robust variance 17 the model was adjusted considering death as the dependent variable the variables app used strain and age were also considered as independent variables in the results the estimates obtained from the prevalence ratio were presented as well as their respective confidence intervals and p values labinsane formula x a b c y a b c d the x formula describes the final master anesthetic solution for the c57bl 6 mice the y formula describes the final master anesthetic

following proportions 70 7 80 8 and 100 10 with the same prescription for diazepam 5 mg kg 1 the anesthetic dose prescription was defined according to the need for long or short procedures for the standard protocol we collected records describing 133 mg kg 1 ketamine and 27 mg kg 1 xylazine of dose prescription results labinsane mobile app decreased anesthesia related mortality over the 6 years of the study 939 anesthetized mice were evaluated 754 c57bl 6 and 185 swiss mice table 1 this study identified 25 intraoperative and anesthesia related deaths within all anesthetic procedures the individual protocol showed an anesthesia related mortality rate of 1 03 on the other hand mice anesthetized using the standard protocol showed an anesthesia related mortality rate of 10 24 table 2 the association between the mobile app and survival outcome was statistically significant table 2 moreover the mobile app approach suggests a protective effect table 3 with a prevalence ration of 0 06 fold the anesthesia related deaths compared to the standard dose procedure odds ratio 0 06 95 ci 0 02 0 13 p 0 0001 we excluded 123 electronic records of mice fed with a high fat diet or of animals that received different specific care support such as oxygen supplementation table 1 table 1 characteristics of mice table 2 table 2 multivariables table 3 table 3 poisson regression different doses of ketamine xylazine for the mobile app protocol 70 7 80 8 and 100 10 mg mg per kg or standard protocol 133 27 mg mg per kg were evaluated identified as the higher anesthesia related mortality dose was 133 mg of ketamine 27 mg of xylazine per kilogram when compared to the other weight adjusted doses table 2 next it was evaluated whether different strains c57bl 6 or swiss age or surgical procedure could influence the anesthesia related mortality rate no significant difference in anesthesia related mortality was identified between c57bl 6 and swiss mice 7 and 8 week old or between full thickness excisional biopsy and stereotaxic surgery tables 2 3 labinsane mobile app matched all anesthetic dose calculations to validate the mobile app anesthetic dose calculation the labinsane app was challenged to reproduce the results of the individual doses calculated by a microsoft excel formula the microsoft excel formula was chosen because it is one of the top stable software available randomly 449 mice were tested showing that the labinsane mobile app matched all 100 the individual anesthetic doses calculated by the microsoft excel formula table 4 with no statistical difference p 0 9 these results suggested no errors in the labinsane mobile app code table 4 table 4 labinsane validation discussion the principles of humane experimental technique published in 1959 by russell and burch proposed that all efforts should be made to minimize the use and suffering of experimental animals in biological and health research 3r today after 60 years we are still struggling to achieve the high standards idealized by russell and burch despite the recommended anesthetic doses being well known worldwide the final injected doses could be different than those calculated several animals for experiments preparation of master anesthetic solutions small drug volumes and the volumetric limitations of syringe systems could interfere in the proper application of the recommended dose rates we asked whether we could improve the reported average mortality using a ketamine and xylazine combination first it was tested in a microsoft excel spreadsheet containing the proper prescription formula however after implementation adherence to the new ms excel based dose calculation brought new difficulties for operators for instance animal biosafety limitations aseptic concerns about personal computers in laboratories performing animal procedures low volumes of anesthetic to remove from the flask highly concentrated residual anesthetic volumes in the syringe and limitations of syringe systems without the capacity to fractionate small volumes of anesthetics to solve some of these complexities we tried a different approach and developed a mobile app using the labinsane mobile app on personal mobile phones researchers and operators were able to use personal devices in the workplace mobile phones were easily disinfected and speeded up master anesthetic calculations as well as the individual anesthetic dose calculation several advantages of volatile anesthetics over injectables have been shown however anesthetic procedures using airways require specific equipment which can interfere with the experiment result and increases both cost and workspace usage if volatile anesthetics cannot be applied injectable anesthesia is indicated 18 intraperitoneal anesthetic protocols based on the injection of ketamine xylazine solution are widely used in experiments with rodents due to the low cost minimum training and the fact that no equipment is being required 4 nevertheless there is a wide variation in the recommended dose which is possibly due to differences between mouse strains type and duration of the procedure health conditions age and research goals 4 8 10 19 previous reports compared the efficacy of the intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration of ketamine 100 mg ml and xylazine 20 mg ml solution for inducing surgical anesthesia among c57bl 6 balb and icr mice no death occurred in the subcutaneous administration groups while 16 7 10 of 60 mice of mice injected intraperitoneally died 10 specifically more females died after the intraperitoneal injection compared with males 10 previous reports have also shown that the ketamine xylazine and diazepam combination is effective to induce anesthesia for surgical procedures 20 24 the principal causes of unsafe medication in humans are related to failures in drug preparation and lack of treatment standardization 25 experimental animal safety should also ensure the proper anesthetic dose calculation and administration in this way the labinsane mobile app seeks to ensure the safety of c57bl 6 and swiss mice by pursuing proper individual anesthetic dose calculation and administration we decided to use 4 and 3 as dilution factors in the mobile app formulas with the aim to increase the total volume to administer by increasing the dilution factor we decreased the anesthetic agent concentrations in every microliter of the final cocktail in this way if any operator mistake occurs the volume of the anesthetic agents is low in μl protecting the mice from overdoses these dilution factors helped the operators with anesthetic volumes that were easier to fit in common insulin syringes 1 ml this altogether protects the mice from human mistakes this approach suggests that the mobile app could improve mice safety related to anesthetic administration we believe that this method could be better than just calculating the drug dosages on a milligram per kilogram basis with standard protocol because it is ready to use already tested and could be an open initiative to automate the drug calculation process in other species and strains the mit app inventor platform appinventor mit edu allows researchers to easily create new mobile apps indeed app inventor apps have been shown to improve data analysis and help in making well informed decisions 12 the use of the app inventor has also contributed to children s learning 26 home automation 27 and self care actions 28 our study established that labinsane a mit based mobile app helps researchers to markedly reduce anesthesia related mortality we encourage researchers to validate new experimental animal strains and species based on modular collaboration with labinsane to decrease anesthetic related death due to the retrospective nature of this study we recommend limiting the interpretation of our results to the variants herein described as well as avoiding extrapolation to other scenarios the mice in the mobile app protocol received a lower ketamine xylazine drug concentration compared to the standard protocol we also collected records only from male mice and previous reports 10 showed that female mice mortality is higher than male mortality in this way future studies will be needed to determine the mobile app accuracy for female anesthesia induction the xylazine and ketamine dose regime proposed by the mobile app protocol is lower than the standard dose used and even the ratio between the dose of xylazine and ketamine between groups is different in fact the mobile app protocol proposes a reduction especially of the xylazine dose similar to previous studies the mobile app protocol introduced a different dose regimen in accordance with the duration of the procedure 4 8 10 19 the xylazine dosage used in the standard protocol was also 0 6 mg kg higher than the higher dose reported in the literature in this way future studies will be necessary to determine the relationship of anesthesia related mortality with a similar ketamine xylazine concentration using this mobile app initiative conclusions the current study was conducted to validate a mobile app for anesthetic dose calculation the results of the study demonstrated that a mit app inventor based app decreased anesthesia related mortality and matched all anesthetic dose calculations the results suggest that anesthesia related mortality can be minimized even more using information technology approaches the open code of labinsane will be available after publication on the github site for future protocol

financial industry regulatory authority president and ceo robert cook said he wants examinations of firms branch offices to stay remote into next year speaking at the securities industry and financial markets association s sifma virtual compliance legal forum this week finra is currently in talks with the securities and exchange commission about extending the remote exam option what i d like to see happen here at least where my thinking currently is is we would extend it into next year and that we would also step back and look at that rule more holistically and think about whether it could use some updating to accommodate a thoughtful risk based approach to when in person exams would be necessary cook said in the conversation with ira hammerman an executive vice president and general counsel for sifma cook stressed that while this was what he currently thought the agency still had significant work to do with other stakeholders and it would need to be approved by the sec cook did not give a timeline on when that decision would be finalized though he said the agency was moving expeditiously and acknowledged that firms needed time for advanced planning to prepare for exams of their firms originally remote exams were allowed for 2020 and 2021 with guidance published in the federal register in november of last year stating that firms that had to conduct inspections of offices of supervisory jurisdiction branch offices or non branch locations could satisfy that mandate remotely the rule cited the compelling health and safety concerns and the operational challenges firms faced by the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns in may finra executive vice president and chief legal officer bob colby said that such an extension could buy a little time for firms and regulators to consider how inspections should be done in the future cook noted that firms had learned a lot on how to conduct remote exams in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic and suggested a risk based approach could allow firms to ensure their osjs and branch offices maintained compliance standards while not necessarily going on site in every instance hammerman also asked whether the agency would reconsider the definitions for branch offices and osjs which some financial services firms have requested changing the definitions could impact when how and even if those offices would be inspected cook said those questions were one element of a broader exercise and that the agency was examining its rulebook to see if there were requirements that no longer made sense and whether there were areas where further guidance would help we talked about this not very far into the pandemic we knew this was going to be something the pandemic would bring to the forefront it really accelerated some trends that have been in the making for some time he said and those trends really call into question the long term efficacy of rules that have a basic brick and mortar underpinning to them like much of the industry regulators like finra are navigating their return to the workplace according to cook the agency had already opened some offices and was expecting to be able to open up more offices in the coming weeks while acknowledging that the agency would have a lot of remote work for some time going forward lisa hopkins the president for the north american securities administrators association nasaa and west virginia s senior deputy securities commissioner said state securities regulators were responding in various ways according to hopkins one state s regulators had told her that they would be performing job duties exclusively remotely from now on and would have to justify any reason for holding in person meetings other states are trying hybrid solutions of two to three days in the office while other state regulators are entirely back in the workplace the states have not figured that out completely at this point she said during a separate panel during the sifma forum cook also touched on the agency s response to the recent market structure developments raised by the gamestop saga from earlier this year cook noted that the sec was the federal policymaker to respond to the issues with finra creating rules aligning with the direction that the commission courses cook noted the agency had undertaken a zero commission sweep that was still ongoing focusing on whether the model affected firms ability to fulfill best execution obligations he also said finra was considering sweeps around options account opening compliance conflicts in the spac space and fin fluencers looking into how firms supervise activities related to paid social media influencers so again innovation is great but compliance with the rules is not optional and it can t be sacrificed for the sake of innovation he said and i think that s where you ll continue to see us
by alwyn scott new york reuters new jersey business owner adenah bayoh told a u s senate committee hearing on wednesday she paid about 275 000 a year to insure her group of restaurants only to discover the limits of her policy during the coronavirus pandemic when the pandemic hit and the governor ordered my businesses to close i was shocked that my insurance company and coverage was not there for me said the liberia native who immigrated to the united states at age 13 and now owns seven restaurants insurers have largely denied claims for business interruption caused by the pandemic saying the virus did not cause the physical damage that policies require the hearing spurred by hundreds of thousands of experiences like bayoh s highlighted the challenges of insuring overwhelming risks like coronavirus and drew on industry leaders for possible solutions shutting entire economies down for an extended period and spending the kinds of trillions of dollars we ve spent as a way of managing a pandemic is not a future solution chubb nyse ltd chief executive evan greenberg told the subcommittee that deals with insurance preparation and better response would shorten shutdowns and may allow insurers and government to share the risk he added other ideas ranged from adapting the system used to insure terrorism risk after 9 11 also being discussed by house members allowing insurers to cover initial losses and government to cover longer term claims insurers also could help distribute government support without covering risk one proposal would do nothing noting that in hindsight government support and stimulus largely healed the economy a reasonable assessment is that no program is needed said robert hartwig a professor at the university of south carolina bayoh who struggled to get a paycheck protection program loan disliked that solution i hope that i m not sitting here in the next pandemic hoping for another ppp she said
it s vital jackson browne on why we must preserve the planet for everybody s children with his floppy centre parting and big brown eyes jackson browne was the quintessential sensitive singer songwriter in the seventies when bruce springsteen inducted him into the rock roll hall of fame in 2004 he spoke of a guy in baggy jeans and t shirt singing his serious songs and his hair was perfect 2 at 72 the long time los angeles resident who wrote take it easy for the eagles still exudes west coast cool and is highly regarded by the next generation of singers credit pr handout 2 jackson in his younger days credit pr handout he continued i also noticed jackson drew an enormous amount of good looking women while the e street band and i were drawing rooms filled with men not that great looking men either when the boss was on the way up he opened several shows for browne the troubadour selling millions of albums with his socially aware songs about life s big issues but what most people don t realise is that jackson browne was a bona fide rock n roll sex star affirmed springsteen and my wife patti says he still is today the dark brown locks are greying and the matching beard helps give browne the appearance of a distinguished elder statesman but at 72 the long time los angeles resident who wrote take it easy for the eagles still exudes west coast cool and is highly regarded by the next generation of singers i m that old geezer on the edge of the photo jackson browne having duetted with the singular phoebe bridgers on her song kyoto she returns the favour by appearing in the video for my cleveland heart from his first album in seven years the thought provoking beautifully realised downhill from everywhere in typically self deprecating fashion he says i see myself on the periphery of this scene of younger musicians i don t hang around with them but i get to see them from time to time i m that old geezer on the edge of the group photograph who prompts people to say what s he doing there calling me from la browne adds phoebe s unique in the way she uses language and the way she sings the way she inhabits the narratives she s giving you is a wonderful development because decades go by and you re thinking where s the next warren zevon coming from the late zevon is still best known for his laugh out loud hit werewolves of london browne name checks bright eyes singer conor oberst and rilo kiley s jenny lewis then he singles out another collaborator taylor goldsmith of dawes for songwriting that connects the dots between now and the seventies golden age you can t describe him as a writer like joni mitchell though he decides there s nobody like her there s just joni mitchell since he started out a strong theme in browne s music is his love of the planet and his alarm at man s destruction of it over the decades he has joined campaigns against nuclear power and the build up of plastic in the world s oceans his new album s title track bears the lines do you think of the ocean as yours because you need the ocean to breathe every second breath you take is coming from the sea it s an evocative moment from a fine album which recalls his early laidback country tinged triumphs yet also belongs very much in the present the warmth of the music belies the burning passions in the lyrics as the image on this page suggests his songs serve as profound prayers for humanity browne makes clear that downhill from everywhere is not just about the world his own amazing beautiful grandson will inherit it s really important to preserve the environment for everybody s children he stresses but there are so many young people active in politics now that it s really a source of hope for me i ask if he follows the progress of greta thunberg the swedish teenager who brilliantly berates world leaders for not doing enough about climate change killings have been going on a long time jackson browne she has inspired people to redouble their efforts he replies it s vital they campaigners understand they have power that they have a voice we re at an important moment greta has demonstrated the kind of influence one young person can have he also draws my attention to those kids who survived the stoneman high school shooting in florida fourteen students and three staff were killed they are powerful activists with undeniable authority having lived through a massacre having seen their classmates murdered it s their world that they re trying to improve another strong new song until justice is real was written before the murder of george floyd but still resonates with that horrific event he says all these songs have a social justice component and these killings have been going on for a long time a good black friend of mine says it s just now that we have cameras his aim is to make his compositions as intimate as love songs despite their wider threads on a deeper level until justice is real finds the singer asking himself a series of questions to do with the difference between wealth and wellbeing the eternal dreamer yearns for equality rather than craving the finest trappings of our materialistic world for himself i mean i m guitar rich he admits but i don t have stocks and savings i guess by modern standards i m rich but that just happened through following my dreams the point wasn t just to amass a fortune if you do that then you lose sight of what makes life good another key aspect of browne s album is the sense of place whether it is harrowing scenes at the mexican border troubled but inspirational haiti beautiful barcelona where he keeps an apartment to decompress or the los angeles urban sprawl the breezy minutes to downtown is about his love hate relationship with his home city for ever on this freeway dreaming of my getaway don t know how i m still in la he sings browne tells me it s a place i ve been trying to leave most of my life there are things about it that drive me nuts there s so much driving and it s getting more and more crowded when i was making my first record in 1971 i assumed i d get a place out in the country as soon as i could it was a part of the counter culture ideal of the day walls manipulate people s fears but i m still here i ve lived all over this city the east the west and the suburbs browne feels an emotional connection to highland park echo park and silverlake which he says are basically mexican neighbourhoods despite some gentrification they still have great cultural identity and a sense of pride he also remembers times as a young man when he would drive through huge expanses of orange trees to go surfing at places like sunset beach it s all city now housing developments and malls he adds i realised the malls in orange county had the same stores same restaurants as in austin texas or detroit michigan that culture is springing up everywhere the principled browne believes in looking after the wildlife that remains and says you have to protect the green spaces inside the city and preserve the bluffs overlooking the ocean in santa barbara where monarch butterflies gather this brings us to gorgeous song the dreamer sung in both english and spanish and written with eugene rodriguez of la collective los cenzontles and los lobos legend david hidalgo against the backdrop of donald trump s infamous border wall it tells the story of a mexican migrant who settled in the states as a child only to receive a deportation order when she was older i know lucina says browne of the deportee all i can say is how good these people are they ve given so much to our country he believes the wall is there to manipulate people s fears and a blatant disgusting attempt to portray the united states as being under siege only last year a film called linda and the mockingbirds showed browne and mexican american icon linda ronstadt travelling by bus from the bay area of san francisco to the small town where her grandfather grew up he says on that trip we saw concertina wire strung up across the border you see lucina sitting at the crossing talking about what it s like to come to the states as a young person only to be discriminated against it s heartbreaking your heart gets engaged and that s what i want from a song to appeal to people s emotions another effort ticking that box is love is love inspired browne s trips to poverty stricken trouble torn haiti where he witnessed the blossoming of both a school and a music studio the poverty is so omnipresent but what you re left with is this incredible spirit he says the song focuses on a young couple who fall in love despite their surroundings where communities live in tin shacks with mud floors the final verse speaks of father rick frechette a selfless soul who has devoted his life to making haiti a better place browne says the guy went there as a priest but they said we don t need a priest we need a doctor so he became a doctor came back and built

by xinhua writer liu yanan new york july 22 xinhua inflation in the united states is reaching decade highs and drawing concerns from investors and experts as well as ordinary consumers who believe the country s inflationary pressures are underestimated and the federal reserve s inflation management framework should be questioned impacts on decision making high flying inflation in the country in the last few quarters not only made many people delay big ticket purchases but also drove investors into assets to hedge inflation risks now the higher inflation is beginning to create explosions and affect economic decision making and so i think it s a problem right now said mickey d levy chief economist for americas and asia with berenberg capital markets llc levy said the fed is missing the point on the impact of inflation and the higher inflation is gonna start digging into disposable income so we have to really start thinking about these real effects consumers complaints about rising prices on homes vehicles and household durables have reached an all time record said the university of michigan in a recent report on consumers survey the index of consumer sentiment dropped to 80 8 in july from 85 5 in june according to preliminary results of the survey meanwhile 57 percent of respondents believe inflation would accelerate in the next 12 months with 35 percent of respondents seeing flat inflation according to the latest quarterly survey of 900 u s investors each with at least 1 million u s dollars of investable assets by swiss banking giant ubs the share of u s investors believing inflation would speed up in the next 12 months is higher than 39 percent in latin america 38 percent in asia 46 percent in switzerland and 48 percent in other parts of europe according to the survey issued by ubs on wednesday as many as 58 percent of u s investors said they were personally impacted by inflation in the last six months according to the survey by ubs with 88 percent of investors believing that increased inflation could impact their portfolio significantly or somewhat u s investors are inclined to buy stocks or adjust their portfolio in other ways according to the survey investors looking for ways to build inflation protection into portfolios can consider stocks with pricing power or commodities including oil which typically fare relatively well in periods of higher inflation said mark haefele chief investment officer with ubs global wealth management in a recent note longer inflation prospect part of the price increases reflect supply constraints and will prove to be temporary although that temporary may last a little longer than people expect said levy at an online panel discussion organized by the manhattan institute on tuesday but at the same time strong demand and all the monetary and fiscal stimulus point toward underlying and mounting inflation pressures that will persist levy said the united states has the highest risk of higher inflation in the medium term in comparison with the united kingdom and european union according to mervyn king former bank of england governor and professor of economics with new york university s stern school of business consumer price inflation is too narrow of a measure to judge inflationary pressures within an economy and underlying vulnerabilities are built up in the process said investment research firm mrb partners in a recent research note the surge in u s core inflation in the second quarter has defied all expectations the possibility of inflation surprising on the upside on a 12 18 month basis will gain more traction ahead said analysts with mrb partners the underlying trend of personal consumption expenditure pce inflation will be at or above 3 percent by the end of next year in comparison with the fed s expectation of around 2 percent by then according to mrb partners mrb partners estimated that aggregate inflation in the u s economy is now running at a 9 percent annual rate which is about twice that of the core cpi inflation and the highest reading since 1980 inflation targeting questioned the fed s prevailing management framework for inflation is being questioned as experts worry it could not control inflation precisely or repeat policy mistakes the concern that i have is that central banks have become overconfident about their ability to control inflation precisely said king king said he is concerned with the framework of flexible average inflation targeting fait announced by the fed in 2020 because it implied that it was possible to control inflation that precisely and as we ve just seen it isn t the kind of calculation behind the inflation targeting framework may work in a model but doesn t actually work in the world according to king king added he is also concerned about central banks ability to forecast interest rates two or three years ahead the fed can manage expectations in financial markets but they cannot influence price setting behavior in the non financial sector said levy but the fed presumes it can one of my real concerns is the fed is looking at inflation through its perception of what inflation may be appropriate for its long run macro stabilization policy said levy there are widespread inflationary pressures in the united states and in most developed market economies particularly asset and credit inflation according to mrb partners in recent decades central banks myopic focus on cpi central bank inflation to guide policy has created persistent asset bubbles and then economic or debt crises when the bust phase develops warned mrb partners central bank inflation targeting has frequently missed rising imbalances and led to painful global policy blunders added mrb partners citing the biggest mistake in this respect that occurred in japan in the 1980s

like like love haha wow sad angry 1 thyblackman com imagine a world where workers have real power in this world workers are paid a living wage are protected by a strong union and wield enough political clout to ensure congress passes pro worker laws corporations can t treat them like robots and abandon communities to find cheaper labor elsewhere it is a world of low inequality where workers have a bigger share of the fruits of their labor this world is america in the 1950s this world was far from perfect black people and women were still second class citizens windows of opportunity were still small or shuttered that s why it s not enough to just go back in time we must build upon it and expand it for the past 40 years this world has been dismantled the voice of workers has been steadily drowned out in both the workplace and on the national political stage by the voice of big corporations this massive power shift wasn t the result of free market forces but of political choices now it s time to make the political choice to strengthen the voice of all workers start with one of the biggest sources of worker power unions every worker in america has a legal right to join a union free from interference from their employer a hard fought victory that workers shed blood to secure but corporate america has been busting unions to prevent workers from organizing in bessemer alabama for instance amazon used every trick in the anti union playbook to prevent its predominantly black workforce from forming the first amazon union most union busting tactics are illegal but the punishment is so laughably small that it s simply the cost of doing business for a multi billion dollar company like amazon in addition 28 states now have so called right to work laws on the books thanks to decades of big business lobbying these laws ban unions from requiring dues from non union workers although non union workers still benefit from these union contracts this obviously makes it much harder for workers to unionize corporations are also misclassifying employees as independent contractors and part time workers so workers don t qualify for unemployment insurance worker s compensation or the minimum wage and don t have the right to form a union and corporations are waging political fights to keep employees off the books uber lyft and other gig companies shelled out 200 million to get proposition 22 passed in california exempting them from a state labor law cracking down on misclassification it s a vicious cycle corporations crush their workers to protect corporate bottom lines then use their enlarged profits to lobby for policies that allow them to keep crushing their workers preventing workers from having a voice in the workplace and in our democracy this vicious cycle began in the 1980s when corporate raiders ushered in the era of shareholder capitalism that prioritized shareholders above the interests of other stakeholders they bought up enough shares of stock to gain control of the corporation and then cut costs by slashing payrolls busting unions and abandoning their home communities for cheaper locales all to maximize share values the ceo of general electric at the time jack welch helped pioneer these moves in just his first four years as ceo a full quarter of ge s workforce was fired the reagan administration helped block legislation to rein in these hostile takeovers and refused to lift a finger to enforce antitrust laws that could have prevented some of them i wish i could report that the clinton and obama administrations reformed labor laws to make it harder for corporations to bust unions but either because bill clinton and barack obama lacked the political clout to get this done or didn t want to expend the political capital the fact is neither president led the way the result of these political choices corporate profits have soared and wages have stagnated but it doesn t have to be this way we can turn the tide by making new political choices that restore the voice and centrality of american workers the most important is now in front of us it s called the protecting the right to organize act passed in the house in march with bipartisan support the pro act is the toughest labor law reform in a generation it prevents misclassification of full time workers bans corporations from harassing or intimidating workers who want to form a union prohibits employers from replacing striking workers with non union workers and beefs up penalties for breaking existing labor laws among other provisions empowering workers beyond the pro act american businesses need to be restructured so workers have a say at every level at the top that means a voice on corporate boards in many european countries worker representation has been shown to boost wages skills and corporate investment in communities at the local level we should make it easier to establish worker owned cooperatives which have been shown to increase profits wages and worker satisfaction and our trade and foreign policy can center on american workers without falling into the kind of xenophobia and nativism donald trump promoted reversing 40 years of shareholder capitalism won t be easy but remember this you the working people of america outnumber the corporate executives and big investors by a wide margin together you can change the rules and build a world where workers have real power written by robert reich official website share post twitter facebook email

not to see elitch s is not to see denver those nine words which have served as elitch s slogan for most of its more than 100 year history have been printed on ferris wheels carousels and in flower beds and it s beckoned to the generations of locals and tourists alike who flocked to the park in the decades after it was first built in northwest denver that slogan was true when elitch s became home to one of the first zoos west of chicago in the 1890s it was true when the first roller coasters were built in the 1920s it was still true when my dad worked as an usher at the old elitch s theatre in the 1970s and 80s then the oldest continuously running summer stock theatre in the country it was even true when i was a young kid visiting the city each summer i d ride the twister ii with my dad laughing hysterically beside me wooden coaster induced tears streaming from our eyes but the stan kroenke backed river mile development is looming and thanks to the multi billion dollar project which promises to replace elitch s with a modern neighborhood and reimagined skyline over the next 25 years it seems denver is outgrowing elitch s again the iconic park at the edge of denver s skyline didn t always sit along the south platte river for its first 100 years it was a 28 acre sanctuary at 38th avenue and tennyson street a full bodied amusement park with lush botanic gardens live theatre picnic pavilions barrels of 50 cent dill pickles and the best roller coasters around but the park ran up against its west highland neighborhood with no room to expand and while the neighborhood was poised to evolve in the late 20th century the family that owned elitch gardens began looking for a new location that s when the grand slogan nearly died according to archives of the douglas county news press a deal was all but inked that would have moved elitch s to a 150 acre parcel of land in highlands ranch in may 1988 and if not for the people of highlands ranch rejecting it denver would have lost the park almost from the moment elitch gardens owner sandy gurtler made the announcement highlands ranch a group of residents in the area mobilized to see that it would never happen a local columnist wrote in 1986 one ponders whether douglas county will ever be ready for anything suburban petulance was denver s gain with the lower downtown revitalization underway and business leaders like john hickenlooper then the purveyor of wynkoop brewing company and mayor federico peña advocating for the project denver officials stepped up with an enticing proposal elitch s could stay in the city and more than double in size by moving to a 70 acre railyard on the south platte river keeping the park in denver was neither swift nor inexpensive relocation costs totaled 94 million and it took years to cobble it all together while voters approved a 14 million bond in 1989 the rest of the financing a patchwork of private financing and federal loan money took longer to secure the relocation was slated for 1992 and amidst a years long delay sandy gurtler even considered giving up and negotiating with the suburbs again eventually elitch s 2 0 opened in 1995 with modern rides and a water park but without a summer stock theatre or botanic gardens at least a new version of the mr twister roller coaster was reconstructed downtown though soon after elitch s became part of the six flags franchise some argue the spirit of elitch s vanished when it moved rose lewis who worked alongside my dad as an usher in the 70s and wrote a master s thesis about the theatre s history hasn t been back since it moved downtown i won t go it s not really elitch s she says it was astounding what it used to be like inside those gates it wasn t all asphalt and concrete even if the platte valley location lacked the charm and history of its old home at least denver still had an amusement park within the city limits one of the few american cities that could make such a claim but depending on what happens in the near future denver might not be able to make that claim much longer revesco properties bought the land where elitch s sits in 2015 and received approval from the city to turn it into the river mile development the company has vowed to keep elitch s open but it s unclear exactly when the downtown location will close or where it will move rhys duggan president and ceo of revesco didn t reveal much more about a potential move when reached for comment i don t have a crystal ball he says but he did confirm that the initial timeline that elitch s could relocate by 2025 is still a sound projection and he said that his team is already looking for a new site to build the third iteration of elitch gardens it s possible the park could stay within the city limits we re looking at a number of sites right now he says all are obviously in the metro but they re located in different jurisdictions denver being one of them if a site outside of denver is ultimately chosen the venerable slogan might finally be retired i had all this in mind when i visited elitch s this summer first i went to the old location off tennyson where the elitch s theatre and the old carousel house still remain separated by a long lawn and flanked by condos i took a few pictures of the theatre and texted them to my dad it s strange to see that building sitting there like a preserved mayan temple in a green space when it was always cradled and crowded by the objects and pulse and energy of a thriving amusement park he responded it appears rather like a preserved seashell on someone else s shelf a few weeks later i visited the downtown park where i went in search of a lasting memory of elitch gardens in denver i made a beeline to the twister ii and waited in line for 40 minutes for a three minute thrill it was worth it in fact it was more than worth it as i reached the apex of the coaster s first climb i had a clear view to my right i saw denver s soon to grow skyline to my left i looked out on the treetops and hills of the city s northwest neighborhoods below me was the ground where the river mile will soon be built the whole city was momentarily laid out before me the old slogan ringing so true i was seeing elitch s and i was seeing denver no sooner had i taken it all in when the rickety coaster abruptly lurched and launched on its wooden frame barreling me back through the past eventually depositing me again in the present it s hard to know if or when or where the twister will be lifting lurching and plunging people a few years from now but chances are visitors to denver will be seeing the city from someplace other than elitch s as the park rides once again back to an uncertain future

percent of investors believing that increased inflation could impact their portfolio significantly or somewhat u s investors are inclined to buy stocks or adjust their portfolio in other ways according to the survey investors looking for ways to build inflation protection into portfolios can consider stocks with pricing power or commodities including oil which typically fare relatively well in periods of higher inflation said mark haefele chief investment officer with ubs global wealth management in a recent note longer inflation prospect part of the price increases reflect supply constraints and will prove to be temporary although that temporary may last a little longer than people expect said levy at an online panel discussion organized by the manhattan institute on tuesday but at the same time strong demand and all the monetary and fiscal stimulus point toward underlying and mounting inflation pressures that will persist levy said provided by xinhua the united states has the highest risk of higher inflation in the medium term in comparison with the united kingdom and european union according to mervyn king former bank of england governor and professor of economics with new york university s stern school of business consumer price inflation cpi is too narrow of a measure to judge inflationary pressures within an economy and underlying vulnerabilities are built up in the process said investment research firm mrb partners in a recent research note the surge in u s core inflation in the second quarter has defied all expectations the possibility of inflation surprising on the upside on a 12 18 month basis will gain more traction ahead said analysts with mrb partners the underlying trend of personal consumption expenditure pce inflation will be at or above 3 percent by the end of next year in comparison with the fed s expectation of around 2 percent by then according to mrb partners mrb partners estimated that aggregate inflation in the u s economy is now running at a 9 percent annual rate which is about twice that of the core cpi inflation and the highest reading since 1980 inflation targeting questioned the fed s prevailing management framework for inflation is being questioned as experts worry it could not control inflation precisely or repeat policy mistakes the concern that i have is that central banks have become overconfident about their ability to control inflation precisely said king king said he is concerned with the framework of flexible average inflation targeting fait announced by the fed in 2020 because it implied that it was possible to control inflation that precisely and as we ve just seen it isn t provided by xinhua the kind of calculation behind the inflation targeting framework may work in a model but doesn t actually work in the world according to king king added he is also concerned about central banks ability to forecast interest rates two or three years ahead the fed can manage expectations in financial markets but they cannot influence price setting behavior in the non financial sector said levy but the fed presumes it can one of my real concerns is the fed is looking at inflation through its perception of what inflation may be appropriate for its long run macro stabilization policy said levy there are widespread inflationary pressures in the united states and in most developed market economies particularly asset and credit inflation according to mrb partners in recent decades central banks myopic focus on cpi to guide policy has created persistent asset bubbles and then economic or debt crises when the bust phase develops warned mrb partners central bank inflation targeting has frequently missed rising imbalances and led to painful global policy blunders added mrb partners citing the biggest mistake in this respect that occurred in japan in the 1980s

economic review investment strategy 2021 iii despite stocks posting all time highs and bonds having largely shrugged off inflation concerns concerns abound among investors surveys note fear over an increase in the covid delta variant sticky inflation high levels of government debt and spending a sluggish recovery in employment and so on yet if we face and examine these fears we find that they are not so scary after all delta danger covid remains in the headlines with newly increasing case numbers albeit off a very low base since the problem is mostly confined to the unvaccinated if cases continue to rise federal and local governments likely will respond by emphasizing the importance of vaccines rather than pushing for renewed lockdowns the u k and singapore governments have made statements consistent with that approach if followed the negative effects on economic activity should remain relatively minor particularly in countries like the u s with high vaccination rates petrifying prices inflation just reached a level of 5 4 the highest since 2008 a noteworthy time where history suggests one major driver of current elevated readings during an economic contraction slowed activity yields less production laid off workers and idled plants when recovery begins that process must be reversed due to massive stimulus in this covid driven cycle spending power for consumers remained largely intact allowing demand to recover quickly outpacing supply some of that stimulus will fade in the fall prompting the economy to work through logistical and supply chain issues as an example of a disrupted metric increased prices in used vehicles accounted for more than one third of the overall rise in the consumer price index cpi our evaluation remains focused on whether inflation is spiking spreading and sticking around although there are some narrow pockets of price spikes such as used cars inflation does not seem to be spreading and we don t think it will stick around much longer we anticipate elevated though lower inflation levels to linger for the coming quarters and return closer to the fed s 2 00 target level by the end of 2022 gauging the timeline on inflation readings is an inexact science however we gain some context by examining inflation before during and after the global financial crisis at that time inflation climbed roughly one year leading into the crisis followed by drops in prices for about one year it took approximately six months to recover from deflation and then we withstood twelve or so individual months of inflated rates over two and half years in the covid crisis the first phase of deflation and recovery was quick lasting about one year and it would be reasonable to expect about one year of continued disruption in pricing trends that timeline is consistent with consensus expectations for rates to be nearing peak levels now and returning to normal levels by the middle of next year in recent quarters the money supply has increased significantly and while it has not yet led to inflation pressures it bears close monitoring as the economy re opens and supply issues are resolved the chart below shows prices for three commodities oil copper and lumber each has risen in recent months owing to a rebound in economic activity only lumber prices solidly exceeded highs from prior cycles though they have come down dramatically in recent weeks we expect this trend of production problem solving to help the supply side of the equation across the economy leading to a moderation in prices lumber copper oil prices normalized 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 100 200 copper oil lumber dastardly debt if inflation normalizes at 2 00 higher than the past ten years but lower than recent readings we expect interest rates to gradually rise to 1 75 2 25 those levels are supportive of economic activity and strong valuation metrics for equities further 2 00 is an important interest rate level to keep the cost of servicing the federal debt at a manageable level at 128 debt gdp the u s must keep a close eye on debt servicing costs provided that rates remain low high levels of debt are unlikely to cause problems for investors nonetheless debt is a potential constraint on responses to future economic calamities and can be a detriment to the global reserve status of the u s dollar these issues will unfold over coming decades and significantly depend upon future levels of economic growth along with policy choices made in the years to come federal debt as of gdp 10 year treasury rate 150 8 130 110 6 90 70 4 50 30 2 10 10 0 federal debt as of gdp u s 10 year treasury 2 job jitters currently 7 million fewer people are employed 146 million as compared to peak employment in february 2020 of 153 million this is despite the fact that the size of the u s economy has largely recovered with the u s bureau of economic analysis reporting gdp of 22 trillion as of march 31 2021 eclipsing the prior high of 21 trillion before the pandemic participation in the workforce has declined with some workers retiring earlier than planned other workers have been reluctant to enter the workforce due to a combination of factors including continued health concerns difficulties with childcare education historically elevated stimulus and or career change friction most of these factors will resolve in coming months though even quick job creation means a full recovery will take several quarters at best the two handed economist would note that on the one hand this is frustrating as all would like jobs to return as quickly as possible on the other hand there is now a high probability of job gains over an extended period of time markets tend to like long term visibility and a path forward with strong job gains over an extended period rather than all at once is usually preferable for equities the great transition the economy and the market are going through a transition and transitions are often choppy and volatile looking back to the spring of 2020 we find that the stock market began to recover about one month before the economy hit bottom similarly stocks rebounded to prior highs about seven months before the economy did in other words investors have returned to their normal behavior of looking ahead a few quarters this transition is especially jarring coming off a long and slow economic rebuild following the global financial crisis in 2008 and the extremely rapid economic deceleration and acceleration around covid transitions mark a time that is no longer part of the past and not yet part of the future as investors we must consider the future and our view is optimistic we see an economy that gets back to a better version of normal long term economic growth is driven primarily by population growth and productivity global population growth is slowing as is u s population growth nonetheless the pew research center expects the u s population to expand slowly from about 330 million to 430 million over the next eighty years until year 2100 pew recently reported that in 2019 the millennial cohort surpassed boomers as the largest demographic group this has favorable implications for future growth immigration policy is a challenging problem and it is unclear how much the workforce will grow through immigration trends in years to come taken together u s population growth will be modest at best and absent any other changes growth will remain slow albeit better than many other countries we anticipate continued strong productivity gains due to two major forces in play the first is the painful process of job loss and company closure that often accompanies recessions or in this case a pandemic bust boom cycle that pain is typically followed by gain as new forms of business are invented and additional jobs are created one statistic that has been especially encouraging is the number of new business formations 3 united states new business applications 600 000 500 000 400 000 300 000 200 000 100 000 0 second the forced shutdowns of the pandemic caused businesses and individuals to re invent their workflows there was an abundance of investment in technology and a focus on process improvement as the economy has re opened the ability to do more with less is readily apparent in the comparison of the size of the economy to the total employed gdp per person employed 140 000 120 000 100 000 80 000 60 000 40 000 20 000 as businesses and workers push through this transition they are backed by the tail end of massive stimulus as well as ample savings deutsche bank reports that cash and savings have increased by an amount equal to 10 of gdp while much of this is in higher income groups and less likely to be quickly spent some excess savings will continue to flow through to the real economy this combination of savings continued job growth economic re invention and productivity is likely to fuel economic growth at levels slightly above trends that were in place prior to the pandemic indeed economic forecasts from the service consensus economics reports projected gains of 4 for 2022 4 investment outlook an earnings and valuation framework helps assess outlook we anticipate strong earnings growth in coming quarters consensus is 10 earnings growth for 2022 below we review key factors influencing valuation levels component outlook comments inflation improving readings are nearing peak levels and will likely subside interest rates less positive interest rates are likely to rise slightly though still supportive monetary policy positive strong monetary support may slow somewhat but will remain favorable sentiment neutral sentiment is already favorable equity exposure neutral positive exposures are generally elevated though cash is available domestic policy neutral negative tax and regulatory policy is slow moving but not favorable to corporations or tax rates geopolitical neutral for now plenty of issues but minimal action keeping an eye on u s china relations earnings drive stock returns in coming years overall we see the most significant driver for equities being earnings growth into next year productivity gains employment gains and reversal of high savings rates will all contribute looking ahead over our three year forecast horizon it seems that at least the next 1½ years through year end 2022 will see strong economic growth and earnings that is a very favorable outlook for potential returns we expect modest advances in interest rates with the rate on the u s 10 year slowly grinding higher to a range of 1 75 to 2 25 from its recent range of 1 15 1 40 corporate balance sheets are generally sound opening the possibility of continued buybacks and dividends as another source of support for stocks maintain balance between growth and value due to the differences in approach to the pandemic and the multiple company specific actions taken or not we believe stock selection to be an essential component of success and advocate a balance between growth and value exposures for example consider this quote from a soda and snacks company a lot of the things we did through the pandemic continuing to invest in the business are now paying dividends equities outside the u s will have some time in the sun while most countries are lagging the recovery timeline of the u s we anticipate firms globally will see a resurgence of activity rebounding earnings and stock performance and partially closing a longer term valuation gap between the u s and foreign stocks this metric while distorted by the covid cycle has historically favored u s companies with higher valuations a trend that is likely to continue though likely at a smaller gap when non u s economic recoveries begin in earnest considering the ample opportunities for great global companies this recovery convergence and some diversification across different economic cycles makes a modestly sized non u s allocation appealing

quick take in the klamath basin some farmers hope to head off potential violence by repopulating fish that are part of a decades old water and wildlife conflict it s a strange place to find fish deep in the high desert where drought baked earth butts against scrubby mountains but water spews from the hot springs on ron barnes land near the california oregon border pure and perfect for rearing c waam and koptu two kinds of endangered suckerfish sacred to native american tribes barnes who holds an advanced degree in aquaculture from uc davis has dug dozens of ponds on his property and filled them with thousands of young suckerfish he hopes raising and releasing them into the wild will end the region s epic water wars or at least get federal regulators out of the mix before his neighbors descend into violence we have to take a pragmatic view of this thing said barnes standing near his black bottomed lagoons under an intense morning sun the single most effective way to get the government off our backs is to restore the fish population the suckerfish which are on the endangered species list are at the heart of a rancorous water controversy they typically spawn in nearby upper klamath lake an agricultural reservoir that is growing increasingly dry and toxic to ward off their extinction federal regulators have cut off every drop that normally flows from the lake to the klamath reclamation project a federally built web of irrigation canals that once held the promise of almost limitless water for nearby farms the gone fishing complex is home to thousands of endangered sucker fish that will eventually be released back to the upper klamath lake robert gauthier los angeles times growers and landowners in the region are divided between those who are furious but want a peaceable path forward like barnes and those who are threatening to take water by force extremism from white nationalism to anti government militancy to secessionism has long had a foothold here and some are worried that with no compromises in sight their neighbors will push the situation to an armed confrontation with government authorities we re doing our damnedest to keep cooler heads here to let cooler heads prevail said scott seus a family farmer who relies on water from the lake there s a sense of desperation right now and not many people who want to listen federal scientists and wildlife officials have asserted that maintaining a healthy lake is critical for preventing extinction of the suckerfish as the u s endangered species act requires them to do but families who have homesteaded here for generations say their problems stem not from the degraded lake or climate change which many of them dismiss but government ineptitude they say federal regulators keep doing the same things year after year benefiting neither fish nor farmers i just wish we could look at it and say we ve been doing this and we re not getting any success can we try it a little different said paul crawford a local grower after farmers were told this year that they wouldn t receive any water from the lake a small contingent of land owners formed an alliance with people s rights a group backed by militant anti government activist ammon bundy that contingent has set up a red and white striped circus tent on private property next to the federal irrigation gates in klamath falls ore and is threatening to take over the plumbing works releasing water in a symbolic act that has the potential to turn into an armed conflict there is a feeling inside the tent and in the fields that nobody at the federal level is listening to the concerns of farmers as their lives and legacies deteriorate i lost my next generation on my ranch said farmer tracey liskey whose only son left the farm after the last water shutoff they took the water away and he said dad i ve got to go find a job i can depend on his son moved to boise and became a diesel mechanic liskey a friend of barnes who has excavated many of the ponds on his property said he agrees with the people in the tent but thinks they have gone too far toward the radical right when you start bringing bundy in and that kind of stuff you ve lost what you re protesting because he isn t us liskey said we don t want outsiders trying to come in and run their politics on our issues barnes and liskey s rearing ponds part of a complex called gone fishing where barnes raised tropical aquarium fish until that market crashed in 2008 have been so successful that the u s fish and wildlife service partnered with them in 2015 after an earlier pilot program it has plans to expand the operation with the hopes of eventually releasing 60 000 c waam and koptu into the lake each year at an age when they are old enough to survive the difficult conditions i really don t care about the sucker myself but it has control of my water liskey said replenishing their numbers is the only ray of hope he said under the trump administration farm advocates made headway in revising federal policies but they have little confidence that president biden who has pledged stricter enforcement of environmental regulation will come to their aid supporters of biden say the seriousness of drought presents few pathways for easy fixes the reality is throughout the west we have a climate crisis and there is not enough water to go around and business as usual will not work sally jewell u s secretary of the interior under barack obama from 2013 to 2017 told the times the klamath tribes who also have fish hatcheries of their own say the c waam and koptu are indicator species that show the entire klamath basin is in ecological jeopardy simply adding stock to upper klamath lake they say doesn t fix larger problems like pollution runoff from cattle grazing above the lake or less water coming in from snowmelt that no longer flows reliably from the nearby mountains but jewell understands that it is difficult for farmers to hear that the old ways of doing business may not work in the future especially when the government hasn t made an alternative clear it s hard to let go of the from if you don t know what the to is she said she said she was concerned about involvement in the klamath water crisis by the bundy family who she said are people that are exploiting grievance and ramping up extremism bundy who has said he supports the klamath basin farmers has been involved in two armed standoffs over land rights issues with the federal government both under jewell s tenure one of which ended with a fellow militant being killed by authorities near the malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon inside the tent bundy followers regularly preach of government overreach and corruption depicting regulators and environmentalists as enemies who have stolen water that rightfully belongs to farmers though the senior water rights in the lake are held by the klamath tribes who consider the c waam sacred farmers have junior rights that they believe are being violated though courts have not agreed a similar militant protest took place at the klamath headgates during a 2001 drought after federal officials cut off water several times that summer protesters forced open gates that had prevented supplies from flowing from upper klamath lake into irrigation canals farmer dan nielsen who pitched the circus tent this spring set up camp near the same spot back then with supporters who included liskey the camp drew hundreds of people while federal law enforcement officers stood guard at the headgates tim evinger the newly elected sheriff of klamath county at the time was suddenly thrust into the national spotlight as tensions between local protesters and federal agents mounted he said the situation was like navigating a minefield my constituents in many cases thought that the government was overreaching and they felt like they were being wronged he told the times evinger said he faced enormous pressure from federal agencies to arrest the protesters for trespassing and vandalism he declined like many in klamath falls he viewed the protest as a 1st amendment right as long as there was no violence the protests then as today drew the attention of the far right according to the southern poverty law center militia members decrying the u s gestapo in emails volunteered to fire the first shot at the feds but evinger said locals did a good job in preventing their cause from being hijacked by outsiders something easier to do before social media there were a few radical folks and hotheads that would show up and take the bullhorn or mic occasionally evinger said and you just didn t know what that was going to create he said he would urge caution to the protesters today to not have their issue taken over this time though there are fewer farmers and more anti government outsiders present i m not a believer that everything the federal government does is bad they have a role that s why i stressed the separation of power he said after the terrorist attacks on sept 11 of that year the protesters in klamath falls decided to pack up and leave the standoff helped push hard discussions around the klamath basin which ultimately led to what many hoped was a historic albeit complicated compromise that involved years of negotiations and dozens of participants hammered out over countless meetings it ultimately fell apart when congress failed to fund it in 2015 largely because the local congressman backed out of supporting it at the last moment goodwill evaporated litigation renewed many now wonder if any compromise is possible the agreement really called on people s better angels and the dispute that is trying to be exploited right now calls on our dark sides said jewell who helped forge the later part of the klamath agreement she said she believes a compromise can be found but it would require agricultural interests to acknowledge that the abundance of the past is gone it s a different time and so i think many people who are inclined to protest are protesting something that is so changed fundamentally from what it was she said farmer mike mckoen opens a water valve to spray a field of onions as high winds threaten to blow topsoil away and damage the young plants robert gauthier los angeles times mike mckoen a third generation farmer who like liskey and barnes is advocating for a compromise said he fears a future in which the water remains cut off when people start looking down the barrel of foreclosures which is going to happen when their livelihoods are drying up and going away what choices do they have he said all around barnes unlikely oasis fields once lush with alfalfa onions and mint are dusty and fallow irrigation canals are filled with weeds except in places where ice blue well water provides a shrinking lifeline for a lucky few some farmers are so desperate that they are using tractor engines running 24 hours a day on diesel to pump that water uphill through jerry rigged pipes that groups of farmers have laid themselves forming collectives of ingenuity and need after the last shutoff california funded the drilling of wells along the county line but that groundwater can t sustain agriculture indefinitely on a recent day unexpected wind threatened to kill the onion sprouts in one of the only fields mckoen has been able to irrigate he needs the crop to survive since he has young twins to support and has already lost multiple fields of mint when the gusts blew up from the north billowing dry dirt into clouds that battered the inch tall stalks it seemed like the stress might be mckoen s undoing he gunned his truck bouncing it over the rutted lane that led to his sprinklers where he flipped on a pump the water lines came to life spraying into the airborne dirt mckoen did not know if it would be enough the worry he said felt like it could kill him they think that we are a bunch of rich farmers that don t care about the environment that don t care about the tribes that don t care about the fish he said but am i the guy that s going to lose it my generation is going to waste what those before me nearly killed themselves to build that s not a good feeling chabria reported from tulelake and branson potts reported from los angeles this story originally appeared in los angeles times

los angeles based zevia has been on the market since 2007 but is still generating strong double digit growth growing net sales by 29 to 110m in 2020 and generating a profit in q1 2021 although it made a net loss of 6m in fy 2020 said spence when you even look at some of the mature food companies a lot of them have gross margins in the mid 30s we were at 43 in 2019 45 in 2020 and 46 2 in q1 2021 so you can see a progression added spence who said two things consumers are consistently looking for are less sugar and natural ingredients higher margin innovation items are also increasing as a proportion of our mix when you look at a category like energy that offers really exciting gross margins relative to soda asked when zevia might become consistently profitable he said we re addressing a massive global 770bn opportunity so right now it s prudent to invest in growth and continue to scale this business but our business model does offer attractive profitability we re fortunate to be in beverage where there are high gross margins there are 50 jurisdictions around the world with taxes on sugar soda or sugary beverages looking at growth opportunities from a channel perspective he said zevia had distribution in 25 000 locations in the us and canada but sees significant white space in convenience and foodservice as well as international markets and e commerce we started in the natural channel where we ve been dominant for a decade and even there we re still growing at double digits and then we went for food drug and mass and there s still a tremendous amount of upside there zevia recently recruited former red bull exec amy taylor as president to help it build its brand and enter international markets said ceo paddy spence amy has only been on our team full time for about four weeks but what an incredibly productive four weeks it s been picture credit zevia we also see opportunities in immediate consumption channels in food service and convenience amy taylor our new president came from red bull north america and has strong experience in immediate consumption channels like food service and convenience as well as this massive opportunity of global expansion zevia is not providing a timeline but says it is eyeing up markets including the uk australia and mexico where pressure is intensifying to cut sugar there are 50 jurisdictions around the world with taxes on sugar soda or sugary beverages and so we re seeing not only huge consumer demand but also retail demand for products that meet those regulatory structures e commerce accounted for 13 of sales in 2020 e commerce which accounted for 13 of sales in 2020 is also a significant growth opportunity and works together with the bricks mortar business said spence who said the brand has taken off on amazon recently entered walmart com and is also building a subscription business direct to consumer on zevia com we truly believe that the whole discovery consideration and selection process for packaged goods has largely migrated online in part because of the pandemic and zevia is a brand that the more you learn about it the more you love we ve got the number one soft drink item on amazon and 50 of our purchasers online also buy our brand in brick and mortar so e commerce is about transactions but it s also a trial opportunity our leading items on amazon are variety packs so it reinforces that variety strategy and continues to support our retail infrastructure formulation stevia expert dr mel jackson now working for zevia full time when it comes to formulation zevia has been constantly refining its sweetening system dropping erythritol and monk fruit and now just working with a stevia leaf extract that combines the best tasting steviol glycosides he said zevia only uses four ingredients in its core range water stevia leaf extract natural flavors and citric acid stevia was a novel ingredient back in 2008 but even 13 years later we re still refining and improving the taste profile of our products in the last two months we brought on one of the world s leading experts in stevia beverage formulation dr mel jackson who has led innovation at our stevia supplier sweet green fields for a decade as a supplier he helped us formulate these incredible products now he s working full time on our behalf and continues to keep us ahead of the competition aluminum prices started rising steadily in spring 2020 peaking in early summer 2021 source mintec stockpiling cans when it comes to raw materials costs and transport he said there are inflationary headwinds but we re less exposed to commodity inflation than many of our peers when it comes to aluminum cans which were in short supply in early 2020 prompting sharp price increases he said we maintained a 95 service level throughout the pandemic and we did that by identifying challenges early on diversifying our can supply and ensuring we stockpiled cans to maintain safety stock zevia s core zero calorie soda range still accounts for the majority of sales while its cola sku alone accounted for 24 of its retail sales last year however brand extensions launched since 2016 sparkling energy kidz mixers organic tea

akron based firstenergy will pay a 230 million fine for bribing key ohio officials in a calculated quest to secure a 1 billion ratepayer funded bailout for two nuclear plants and fend off future rate hikes firstenergy s fine while far from the 1 1 billion the company earned last year is still the largest criminal penalty ever collected as far as anyone can recall in the history of this office acting u s attorney vipal patel said thursday the penalty surpassed 200 million imposed on illinois comed in 2020 read the deferred prosecution agreement below the principle here is trying to come up with a number that stings but doesn t annihilate patel said in fact firstenergy s stock soared after the three year deferred prosecution agreement was announced the 49 page agreement details how firstenergy bought key ohio public officials notably former ohio house speaker larry householder and former public utilities commission of ohio chairman sam randazzo with millions of dollars funneled through dark money groups to turn a profit using ohio ratepayers pocketbooks ohio statehouse corruption who you need to know in the federal bribery case timeline selling out in the statehouse at times they were brazen in that pursuit after house bill 6 nuclear bailout passed former firstenergy ceo chuck jones listed as executive 1 in the federal filings sent a photo shopped image of faces on mount rushmore including randazzo s the caption read hb 6 f anybody who aint us randazzo replied that his photo was smaller than the others then responded funny firstenergy fired jones and vice presidents michael dowling and dennis chack in october 2020 over a 4 3 million payment made to randazzo shortly before gov mike dewine appointed him to lead the puco none of those individuals were charged thursday and vipal declined to answer questions about the open investigation jones in a statement from his attorney said he did not engage in any unlawful activity or violate any of firstenergy s policies randazzo whose columbus condo was searched by fbi agents in november issued a statement thursday that said in part i executed my duties as puco chair conscientiously lawfully and mindful of striking the right balance between competing interests at no time prior to or after my appointment to the puco was i asked or did i agree to exercise authority as a public official or perform any official action in my capacity as chair to further firstenergy s legislative regulatory or other interests more a humbling moment firstenergy chief responds to 230 million penalty watch his statement the quest for power starting in 2016 firstenergy and its affiliated companies had several goals pass a 1 billion bailout for two firstenergy solutions owned nuclear plants secure money for firstenergy corp through a decoupling provision and ward off a rate distribution case scheduled for 2024 house bill 6 signed into law in july 2019 solved the first two problems in november 2019 the puco under randazzo s leadership terminated the requirement that firstenergy s subsidiaries file a new rate case in 2024 firstenergy also tried to influence federal officials to solve those problems wiring 5 million to a dark money group in may 2017 to influence department of energy or federal energy regulatory commission regulations that ultimately failed and firstenergy set its sights on a state solution to bail out the nuclear plants how the dark money donations worked between 2017 and march 2020 firstenergy corp and firstenergy solutions now called energy harbor donated 59 million to generation now a dark money group controlled by householder firstenergy paid for householder s return to power in the ohio house of representatives helped him pass house bill 6 to bail out the nuclear plants and bankrolled a counter campaign to stop the ballot initiative that would have stalled the law firstenergy also donated 2 million to householder s effort to expand term limits potentially giving him 16 more years in power a firstenergy executive said householder s continued presence extends and stabilizes existing leadership good for the home team householder s attorneys in a statement maintained that firstenergy s donations were not bribes or illicit payments but rather legal donations protected by the first amendment the company entered into thursday s agreement to protect its share price our client larry householder pleaded not guilty for a simple reason because he is not guilty he did not enter into a quid pro quo agreement with firstenergy and he has never been bribed we look forward to our day in court to defeat the government s allegations they said in addition to householder firstenergy also paid 4 3 million to randazzo through his company firstenergy corp executives pushed randazzo as a puco pick so he could further the company s interests according to the filing federal investigators say randazzo helped firstenergy craft language in house bill 6 and pass legislation favorable to the company to achieve its ends firstenergy set up a dark money group called partners for progress in february 2017 forming it in the state of delaware to avoid scrutiny firstenergy executives chose the three directors for partners for progress two of whom were lobbyists for the company dewine s current legislative director dan mccarthy was president of partners for progress in 2017 and 2018 at the time he was a firstenergy lobbyist firstenergy leaders directed where the money was spent according to the federal filings between 2017 and 2019 firstenergy funneled 25 million through partners for progress and 15 million of that was paid to generation now organizations formed as 501 c 4 nonprofits are known as social welfare organizations that can t spend more than 49 of their resources on political causes do you all see a lot of social welfare going on i don t patel said we can do better we don t need obfuscating names for our 501 c 4 organizations the settlement the 230 million fine will be split 50 50 between federal and state governments ohio s 115 million will go toward a program that helps ohioans pay their utility bills firstenergy cannot charge its customers to pay its fines firstenergy also must disclose all political donations dark money or otherwise made during 2021 and for the three years of the agreement the company does not need to disclose donations made in 2019 and 2020 while the alleged bribes occurred firstenergy must forfeit nearly 6 5 million in the accounts of partners for progress this resolution and the actions we have agreed to implement build on the substantial steps we have taken over the past several months to strengthen our leadership team ensure we have a best in class compliance program and significantly modify our approach to political engagement as we work to regain the trust of our stakeholders said donald t misheff nonexecutive chairman of firstenergy s board of directors firstenergy distributes

a regional grand jury vested with sweeping powers to investigate and issue indictments appears to have been exempted from the push to ensure racial equity in criminal justice instead of diversity richmond state sen joseph d joe morrissey said that he has been advised this grand jury is a majority white club of elderly people a substantial number of whom have served for years he said reforms to alter that picture could be in order for the richmond multi jurisdictional grand jury and similar bodies across the state whose membership has been controlled by prosecutors and judges for decades the general assembly authorized such regional grand juries in the early 1980s to speed the indictment process in serious felony cases involving drug dealing and other major crimes richmond s regional grand jury considers criminal indictments involving cases from the city and three counties chesterfield hanover and henrico though the city relies on it the most sen morrissey said his concern about the grand jury s composition and tenure was aroused by information he received that offered a glimpse into an operation that by law is shrouded in secrecy he said he was told that only three members of the regional grand jury are black and that there are no asians or latinos or representatives of other relevant community groups he said he was told that virtually all of the members range in age from their 70s to early 90s i m concerned about the lack of diversity and about the lack of turnover said sen morrissey who serves on the senate judiciary committee which deals with issues related to courts and criminal justice he said the grand jury which is the last checkpoint before a case can head to the circuit court needs to have a membership that better reflects the community sen morrissey a former richmond prosecutor whose license to practice law in virginia was revoked in 2018 said that having regulars on a grand jury can distort the process he said people who serve for years are prone to become too cozy with the grand jury s special counsel and the police officers who offer the bulk of testimony in support of an indictment he said he was told that the longest serving members of the regional grand jury become testy if a new person seeks to raise questions about the facts and testimony presented a free press review of court records found that three of the current members of the regional grand jury have served for at least 10 years while another has served for seven years richmond circuit court judge beverly w snukals has been the regional grand jury s presiding judge during a major portion of her 19 year tenure on the court and has issued the jurors reappointments every six months she declined to comment on the grand jury or the appointments based on state law judge snukals makes the appointments based on recommendations from judges in richmond and from the three other jurisdictions to ensure each locality is represented and from the grand jury s special counsel david stock an assistant commonwealth s attorney in henrico county who has held the post for nine years according to state law members of the regional grand jury are to be drawn from the pool of area residents who are called to serve on regular grand juries in each of the four jurisdictions however nothing precludes judge snukals from reappointing the same people no central database is maintained to provide racial or gender information on those appointed to serve on any grand jury in richmond or elsewhere sen morrissey said he is considering introducing legislation that would prevent routine reappointments and require people from different backgrounds and various age groups how much impact such reforms would have is uncertain created to speed up the indictment process in serious criminal cases the regional grand jury like most grand juries tends to issue indictments according to legal experts and state law that is because grand juries in virginia only hear the prosecution s side of the case and because the standard for an indictment is low the grand jury does not decide guilt or innocence instead virginia law states that the grand jury only must find there is probable cause that the person under consideration for indictment was involved in alleged wrongdoing and should be face a trial that standard is far short of the beyond a reasonable doubt that is required to convict the grand jury also is not required to be unanimous only a majority of members must agree that there is probable cause according to state law still it might preclude the appointment of people who fall asleep during testimony as the free press was told is not uncommon in the richmond regional grand jury mr stock did not respond to a request for comment about whether grand jurors nod off during hearings henrico county commonwealth s attorney shannon l taylor who is mr stock s boss said that although she does not personally attend the grand jury s sessions i have not heard any concerns about how mr stock has handled and continues to handle the multi jurisdictional grand jury from any of the other jurisdictions

hours after the call details for listening to the replay are available in today s news release and with that i ll now turn the call over to kevin long kevin kevin t longe president and chief executive officer thank you jeff and good afternoon everyone dmc s second quarter sales of 65 4 million were up 18 sequentially and 51 versus the second quarter of 2020 the increase reflects improved economic conditions within several of our end markets dynaenergetics our energy products business reported greater demand for its ds perforating systems due to a stronger energy prices and a corresponding increase in well completions nobelclad our composite metals business reported increased product shipments and the receipt of a large order from the chemical industry fundamentals in the oil and gas industry are improving and leading operator and service companies are accelerating their adoption of fully integrated perforating systems that simplify operations reduce costs and enhance well performance dynaenergetics has led a technical revolution in the perforating industry in recent years and it s is2 initiating systems and ds factory assembled integrated perforating systems remain the safest most efficient and best performing solutions on the market integrated perforating systems deliver just in time to the well site lower manufacturing and assembly costs reduce personnel and trucks lower the cost and complexity of the supply chain and increase overall service quality and result in better performing wells for the operator during the downturn several machine shops took advantage of the industry s instability and incomplete transition to integrated systems by introducing low cost undifferentiated carrier assemblies the components for these pre wired carriers are supplied by various shaped charge and energetic manufacturers that have not fully commercialize their own integrated perforating systems we believe many of the pre wired carriers in the market incorporate features that violate dynaenergetics patents and we are taking aggressive legal action against the companies that make these products dynaenergetics has made significant investments in technologies and products that have improved the safety efficiency and performance of its customers well completions and have enhanced the effectiveness and profitability of the industry as a whole our patent strategies designed to protect these investments and provide transparency so others can innovate without violating our intellectual property as we previously have stated it the intellectual property is now protected the incentive to innovate is lost and the sustainability of our industry is at risk dmcs second quarter sales were approximately 2 below our forecasted range and this shortfall was directly related to continued weak pricing across north america s oilfield services industry in february dynaenergetics took an initial step toward restoring margins by announcing a 5 price increase that was implemented at the beginning of the second quarter however by the end of the quarter it became apparent few if any other manufacturers supported a return to acceptable margins and we decided to push full implementation of the increase into the second half of the year north america s exploration and production industry is healthier today than it has been in several years many operators have said they are anticipating price increases from their service providers particularly in light of escalating raw material costs we expect price increases during the second half of the year will hold especially for companies selling differentiated products and services that significantly improve the performance of the industry during the second quarter nobelclad was awarded an 8 8 million order for titanium clad plates that will be used to fabricate specialized pressure vessels and heat exchangers this equipment will be used in the construction of chemical plants in southeast asia that will produce pta ptas and organic compound used in a variety of products including polyester the european firm that engineered the plant selected nobelclad based on its ability to meet the end users exacting manufacturing specifications and tight delivery schedule the place will be produced at nobelclad s product pennsylvania facility then shipped to china for fabrication shipments have scheduled for this year s third and fourth quarters the order s one of several large projects nobelclad has been pursuing over the last several quarters and we are optimistic there will be several more to follow a side effect of the covid19 pandemic has been a slowdown in nobelclad s repair and maintenance work which is principally performed for the downstream energy industry activity in this sector tends to lag the cycles of the broader economy so the timing of the large pta quarter will help offset the effects of this slowdown we expect downstream activity will begin to recover during the coming year this week nobelclad announced a new clad pipe product designed to provide greater fracture toughness and better overall performance versus solid zirconium or titanium pipe the product called datapipe will be marketed for use in high pressure high temperature chemical and metal processing environments the datapipe introduction is another example of how nobelclad s product and application development group is successfully expanding our addressable markets in recent years this team has developed innovative solutions for the engineered wood sector and for the gold processing industry where nobelclad s titanium clad plates are currently being used to construct two of the world s largest pressure oxidation autoclaves the improving conditions in our markets is encouraging and dynaenergetics and nobelclad are ready to capitalize on the growing demand in addition the follow on equity offering we completed during the second quarter further enhanced our financial position as well as our ability to pursue long term strategic growth objectives with that i ll turn the call over to mike for a review of our second quarter financial results and a look at third quarter guidance mike michael l kuta chief financial officer thanks kevin second quarter sales were 65 4 million up 18 sequentially and up 51 versus last year s second quarter dynaenergetics reported second quarter sales of 42 3 million up 11 sequentially and 79 versus the same quarter last year international sales increased 13 sequentially while north america sales increased 10 sequentially sales at nobelclad were 23 2 million up 33 sequentially and 18 versus last year s second quarter consolidated gross margin in the second quarter was 26 up from 23 in the first quarter of 2021 and 15 in last year s second quarter the increase from the year ago second quarter primarily relates to better fixed cost absorption and receipt of employee retention credits under the cares act dynaenergetics reported second quarter gross margin of 25 versus 22 in the 2021 first quarter and 8 in last year s first quarter the margin improvement from last year primarily relates to improved fixed cost absorption higher average selling prices cares act credits nobelclad reported second quarter gross margin of 28 versus 26 in the first quarter and 25 in the year ago second quarter primarily due to improved product mix cares act credits also contributed to higher gross margin versus last year looking at our second quarter expenses consolidated sg a of 14 million increased 6 versus the first quarter and 15 versus the year ago second quarter we reported consolidated operating income of 2 7 million in the second quarter second quarter net income was 1 7 million or 0 10 per diluted share versus a net loss of 5 6 million or 0 38 per diluted share in last year s second quarter adjusted ebitda was 7 5 million versus negative 1 8 million in last year s second quarter dynaenergetics reported second quarter adjusted ebitda of 5 3 million while nobelclad reported adjusted ebitda of 4 3 million we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of 181 3 million after raising 123 5 million in a follow on offering in may our total outstanding share count is now at 18 7 million looking at guidance third quarter sales are expected to be in the range of 70 million to 73 million versus the 65 4 million reported in the 2021 second quarter at the business level dynaenergetics is expected to report sales in the range of 46 million to 48 million versus the 42 3 million reported in the second quarter we expect continued improvement in north america to be partially offset by lower international sales at dynaenergetics nobelclad sales are expected in the range of 24 million to 25 million versus the 23 2 million reported in the 2021 second quarter consolidated gross margin is expected in the range of 24 to 26 versus 26 in the second quarter third quarter selling general and administrative expense is expected to be approximately 14 5 million to 15 million versus the 14 million reported last quarter the sequential increase primarily relates to head count additions for commercial resources digital initiatives restoring variable compensation and resuming travel amortization expense is expected to be approximately 225 000 interest expense is expected to be in the range of 80 000 adjusted ebitda is expected in the range of 6 5 million to 8 5 million versus 7 5 million in the 2021 second quarter third quarter capital expenditures are expected in the range of 4 million to 6 million dmcs full year tax rate is expected in the range of 31 to 33 we are not providing full year financial guidance however pricing at dynaenergetics is expected to improve during the second half of the year which should offset the impact of inflation on materials labor and benefits from employee retention credits under the cares act that are expected to roll off in the fourth quarter of 2021 with that we re ready to take any questions operator questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen your first question is coming from stephen gengaro your line is live stephen gengaro stifel analyst thanks and good afternoon gentlemen kevin t longe president and chief executive officer good afternoon stephen stephen gengaro stifel analyst so i have two or three things that all well i ll just start quickly because michael was just talking about gross margins in the next quarter and the guidance can you give additional color on kind of how you think gross margins can play out over the next several quarters and i understand the raw material side and it just it seems conservative to me the third quarter but it s probably good i don t have as much color on some of the moving pieces behind the gross margin guide so is there anything you can add there to shed some light on kevin t longe president and chief executive officer yes stephen so when i gave the guidance 24 to 26 in both businesses we re getting a bit of unfavorable mix i ll start with dynaenergetics so that s really geographic mix in the third quarter if you look at the second quarter what we call international was essentially 7 5 million international sales we think that s going to probably be 5 5 million to 6 million in the third quarter so you re getting more growth on the north american side call it 15 to 20 and then we re going to step back in international that s more timing of orders we did pull some forward into the second quarter so you re getting that on the dynaenergetics side and you re also getting that on the nobelclad side so a bit better of mix in nobelclad in the second quarter than in the third quarter now there is definitely upside to the margins over the short medium and long term and so we ve had it modeled much in the way of price increases in there and so we should get price increases coming out of the third quarter fourth quarter and moving forward so we expect price increases to take hold so there is definitely some ability to move up from those numbers of price increases stephen gengaro stifel analyst you said international dyna in the second quarter was 6 5 kevin t longe president and chief executive officer in the second quarter dynaenergetics international was 7 5 so that s everything except the us and canada was 7 5 million and that s probably going to step to that will probably 5 5 or 6 in the third stephen gengaro stifel analyst okay okay the other thing we ve seen some consolidation on the wireline front and i was just kind of curious about how you re thinking about the impact of some of that consolidation on your business like are you thinking about maybe they get better pricing which is good for you but then i think at least one of the deals there s a perth business which came with it i m just trying to think about how how the landscape is evolving and how that plays into dynaenergetics share and growth as we move forward kevin t longe president and chief executive officer we stephen we fully expect or expected the consolidation to begin taking place in this year the consolidation is required or needed and in addition to consolidation there will be attrition and rationalization of some of the supply in the wireline service market and that s healthy for the industry it s healthy for our company and so we re pleased to see it happen and regarding the i think they re worth there are two acquisitions public company in the second quarter were recently announced those companies use our products or have used our products and so we re encouraged by the strengthening of that business quite frankly stephen gengaro stifel analyst and just as we think about the share and may be if you look at the total current market and then the integrated systems separately how do you think your shares evolved and how do you think it does evolve going forward kevin t longe president and chief executive officer yes our share has been fairly constant during this difficult marketplace and it grew quite a bit from 17 18 into 19 20 it s held in 20 and currently held in 2021 and we did not expect to pick up share or increase our share significantly in a market that was in turmoil and price was the primary driver as we go into the second half of this year and into next and performance and quality service delivery availability is more important than price we d expect to see our share pick up from its current levels and right now it s plus or minus 20 of the perforating systems market stephen gengaro stifel analyst great thank you operator your next question is coming from tommy moll your line is open tommy moll stephens analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions kevin t longe president and chief executive officer yes hello tommy tommy moll stephens analyst kevin i wanted to start on the topic of the litigation that you referenced and you mentioned a couple of times what s going on among the machine shops and some of the large energetics manufacturers in your industry i guess just on the litigation what can you provide just to update us on where things stand and what s on the docket looking ahead to the extent you can give us that visibility and then as a related point kevin and maybe premature to know but is there a potential pathway here that s a win win win for all industry participants that could occur outside the context of that litigation kevin t longe president and chief executive officer so first of all the litigation is quite extensive and so it s hard to get into any one particular case or situation and nor do we want to do that publicly at least in an earnings conference call and we the litigation particularly intellectual property takes time and we ve been involved with this for quite some time so we re starting to see more action taking place within the court system and everything that we ve seen to date we believe supports our position and we re confident that we re going to prevail in the medium to long term on these cases of infringement we ve had a couple of smaller cases settled in the recent quarter which we are pleased to see and we would expect more of that to take place as we go forward and we are making every possible effort to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution with those who infringe our technology and we just feel that we innovated and have the intellectual property and expense in developing better solutions for the market and it s our responsibility to make sure that others don t infringe our innovations tommy moll stephens analyst thank you kevin that s helpful shifting gears to capital allocation you ve got substantial dry powder on the balance sheet now so i wondered if you could give us any insight on capital allocation priorities and specifically around m a what do you want folks to know in terms of your current pipeline potential timing on any deals that are in front of you to the extent you could comment and how it all ties together under the broader platform strategy that you ve been pursuing for some time now kevin t longe president and chief executive officer on our capital allocation are two existing businesses dynaenergetics and nobelclad they are self supporting in terms of their growth capital through their earnings the capital that we ve raised through the atm and the offering that we did in the second quarter is there for longer term growth opportunities we re actively reviewing opportunities it s not a short term initiative it s a medium to longer term initiative and it s one of those things that the color around it really is quite limited until we have something that we ve completed tommy moll stephens analyst very helpful i ll turn it back thank you operator your next question is coming from taylor zurcher your line is live taylor zurcher tudor pickering analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question i just wanted to first circle back on some of the pricing comments you made which i think you described pretty well and i guess my question is is some of this irrational behavior if you look at the market today versus maybe a month or two months ago or even three months ago has the pricing situation improved at all over that trailing three month basis and if not just curious if you could flush out how we should be thinking about the competitive landscape from a pricing standpoint over the back half of the year kevin t longe president and chief executive officer so the industry during the pandemic the significant drop in demand and a significant amount of inventory that existed in the marketplace led to very extensive price competition and in the margins not just for ourselves but the other companies in the industry declined during that time period and now we re in an inflationary market to some degree labor and materials and we also see the cares act coming off in terms of supporting some of the decisions that other companies have made in the market we re optimistic that we ll see a net price increase coming in the third and fourth quarter we attempted to get price in the second quarter we realized we announced 5 we realized 1 7 surprisingly and we did not see or hear of any other oilfield service company following with price increases in the second quarter we re optimistic that it s going to take place in the third and fourth quarter it s required it s needed for the long term support of capital coming into our companies and into this industry taylor zurcher tudor pickering analyst got it and just to clarify some of the comments you made there clearly there s a lot of inflationary items out in the market today with respect to the supply chain and also labor so am i reading your response to my prior question correctly in that you do expect to get some net pricing over the back half of the year above and beyond the some of these inflationary items that you re seeing today kevin t longe president and chief executive officer we do and however we need to see that reflected in actions of the broader industry moving in the same direction that we re trying to pull poland in and we did not see that in the second quarter taylor zurcher tudor pickering analyst understood thanks for the answer operator your next question is coming from matthew galinko your line is live matthew galinko sidoti company analyst hi thanks for taking the question i guess moving to the data pipe business if we could get a little more color on that can you talk about the pipeline that you see for new product that and how the gulf market shapes up does that add on project work that you re already involved in is it mostly stand alone orders that you see yourself getting involved in and i guess the second follow on question to that is how does the margin profile of the pipe business look compared to the consolidated clad segment thank you kevin t longe president and chief executive officer yes so that product is just being announced it goes into applications that we re currently working on for other plate like products and so we re very close to this market and it has a very strong value proposition versus solid zirconium or titanium so we expect to as we work with companies to adopt this product we feel that it s going to be successful and the development period is relatively long when you re going into process environments and so it will take time to ramp but we do see this product and several of the other applications that we ve been working on increasing the market for us for nobelclad in the range of 20 plus percent on a longer term basis and the margins are at or above the current contribution margins that nobelclad is currently achieving which are in the low to mid 40s matthew galinko sidoti company analyst got it appreciate that color and maybe just a follow up i think you referenced there might did i understand correct that you have additional product development at nobelclad and if so do you expect those to be unveiled this year or is that for more distant launch kevin t longe president and chief executive officer i think we re starting to see it already enter into our backlog this year for some of those applications having said that the everyday business is low or have been impacted by the effects of the pandemic we should see it adding to revenues in 2021 and the coming year as we go forward from where we ve been historically matthew galinko sidoti company analyst right thanks operator your next question is coming from stephen gengaro your line is live stephen gengaro stifel analyst thanks thanks for taking my follow up so i was just i know yes this question was asked a little bit earlier but i was curious on the equity deal and the potential for consolidation can you give us any thoughts on either timeframe and or the types of things you re looking for and whether the market dynamics since you raised capital how they ve evolved and how things are looking sort of on that front as we think about the timing of something that s in the pipeline or could be in the pipeline kevin t longe president and chief executive officer yes the timing will be medium to longer term stephen possibly end of this year most likely next year it s a longer term process and so there is nothing right around the corner i want to be clear on that and on the things that we look for are things that add to our total available market have a similar margin profile to what we have in a normalized market with our current products and we re interested in stable to growing markets differentiated products niche market segments and companies that we can get behind and help to accelerate their growth by going from regional to national national to global and people are an important part of it strong r d engineering and product development capabilities and low cap capital intensity and we re actively reviewing a number of opportunities but again they take time and there is a lot of variables in this process that are outside of our control stephen gengaro stifel analyst thank you and then just one follow up on the dynaenergetics business you guys clearly have a very good product and we saw this kind of rapid share gain for a couple of years and then you had last year s sort of macro debacle and then this expectation that we have for kind of a reacceleration and the adoption of integrated systems in general and then more specifically yours and maybe one or two other sort of leading the way but clearly it looks like it seems to me you guys have the leadership position what are you seeing there what are you seeing as far as the component inventory causing price issues late last year and just sort of a whole dynamic of that business and whether we should think about your growth trajectory in that business outpacing completion fast paced growth in the back half of this year particularly in 2022 kevin t longe president and chief executive officer yes well again we re pleased that we ve held our market share in a very difficult price environment we do get a premium over most if not all products in this area when we came out of the last downturn we had 3 market share that grew to 20 plus or minus our estimates we ve maintained that 20 in a very very difficult demand situation over the last 18 months and going into this current cycle where things are improving we re in a much stronger position today than we were in 17 and 18 both in terms of the breadth of our product line our manufacturing capability as you know we ve got the capacity in place in the vertical integration and all the components and we feel we are strongly positioned going into second half of this year and to next year to serve the market in a way that provides the products just in time to the well site at higher performance lower total cost less working capital for the people that are deploying those products it s very a very difficult value proposition to not accept if you re interested in succeeding in this market and we expect our market share to grow and we re not trying to be all things to all people i think that s important we re our objective is to build our market share to roughly a third of the market which also means two thirds of the market is available to other people and different technologies and so we re very pleased with the position that we have and in the strength of our balance sheet going into what we see is a beneficial up cycle stephen gengaro stifel analyst okay great and maybe just one quick one for michael the costs around the patent infringement lawsuits are they rising and then where are they showing up on the corporate line or in the dynaenergetics line michael l kuta chief financial officer yes the dynaenergetics line and sg a so in the g a section of sg a and there is around 1 250 in the second quarter about 1 million in the first quarter and we re seeing a run rate we ve been talking about 1 million and a half run rate as we move forward stephen gengaro stifel analyst okay great thank you gentlemen kevin t longe president and chief executive officer yes you re welcome operator there are no further questions from the lines at this time i would now like to turn the floor back to kevin long for closing remarks kevin t longe

archer wins defeats wisk s motion for preliminary injunction judge denies wisk s motion for preliminary injunction against archer judge finds wisk s evidence too uncertain and equivocal palo alto calif july 23 2021 prnewswire a federal judge in san francisco today denied wisk s request for a preliminary injunction against rival archer the court determined that wisk failed to make its case wisk has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits that defendant archer aviation inc has misappropriated its particular asserted trade secrets click here to read the ruling the ruling reinforces what archer has said all along wisk did not have a good faith basis to bring this lawsuit and did not file the litigation to defend or protect any legitimate intellectual property rights the record makes it clear that wisk has provided no evidence not a single document not a single witness that archer ever received or used any wisk trade secret archer s deputy general counsel eric lentell said wisk s charges of massive theft are based entirely on conspiracy theories and outright misrepresentations of the actual record contrary to the story wisk crafted the evidence in this case has also made it clear that archer with input from its outside expert design consultant evaluated and selected the 12 tilt 6 design of its maker demonstrator aircraft independently and well in advance of any effort by wisk to develop a similar evtol aircraft he said indeed wisk evidenced no interest in developing such an aircraft until after learning about archer s design in an archer recruiting meeting in december 2019 then wisk rushed to file a provisional patent application that depicted but did not claim to have invented the 12 tilt 6 configuration that archer disclosed to it wisk argued to both law enforcement authorities and the court that the patent application provided evidence of wrongdoing by archer but the court s ruling today rejected that argument holding instead that wisk has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits that defendant archer aviation inc has misappropriated its particular asserted trade secrets wisk s evidence was too uncertain and equivocal mr lentell continued what is equally clear is that wisk s nefarious attempts to paint their former engineer dr jing xue as the poster child for the covert theft of wisk s trade secrets have failed on all accounts the reality couldn t be further from the truth the goal of boeing backed startup wisk with its lawsuit has always been an improper and malicious attempt to disrupt archer s momentum as a means to compensate for its own lack of success wisk has lacked a focus on bringing to market aircraft that were commercially viable recognizing that archer and others were intent on making evtol aircraft a reality of urban transportation wisk is now abusing the judicial and criminal justice system in hopes that a court can help wisk slow down the pace of innovation while wisk struggles to keep up at a time when our president is taking aim at just these kinds of anti competitive tactics by big business we find this deeply disturbing mr lentell added we will continue to vigorously defend

many of the world s biggest asset managers say they re increasingly struggling with some of the rules guiding the 35 trillion market for environmental social and governance investing much of the confusion revolves around defining the social aspect the guideposts are generally seen as confusing and this is going to become a bigger issue going forward according to rick redding chief executive of the new york based index industry association he points to a survey by the iia which shows that 56 of 300 investment professionals in europe and the u s some managing more than 1 trillion say they re having a hard time keeping up with edicts intended to steer capital into esg assets at the same time 85 say esg is a high priority for them the s is becoming the problem redding says referring to socially responsible investing what we are seeing is potentially different regulatory approaches to s across various jurisdictions he says the concern is that you have a lot less quantitative data available which makes it hard for investors to back up their strategies with numbers redding says andy howard who helps oversee more than 920 billion as the global head of sustainable investment at schroders plc says he s hoping for clearer european union rules to help guide the industry investors in the bloc already have a green taxonomy they re now waiting for a social taxonomy to help them define and measure the social risk in everything from how a company treats its workers to its exposure to child labor as well as basic parameters like equality but that won t be ready for a while for now a so called subgroup appointed by the eu is still exploring what should go into a social taxonomy with a report on its findings due at the end of this year mairead mcguinness the eu s financial markets commissioner says the bloc s work to produce a social taxonomy will include taking a forensic look at supply chains how businesses treat their employees and issues of diversity and inclusion more details about this work should be available before 2022 she said at a recent bloomberg summit on sustainable investing redding at iia says that countries and regions look set to apply different standards for how they expect their asset management industries to approach the s in esg north america has really good data for gender and board participation he says but in parts of the world it is just not there he also notes that the underlying assumptions behind social considerations can vary greatly things like gender diversity it just doesn t mean the same thing in some parts of the world he says howard at schroders says investors can t afford to ignore the social dynamics of the businesses they help fund in the end social trends or challenges underpin the performance of companies he says the problem is measuring it society is a broad term and spans a huge range of issues howard says nathan fabian chief responsible investment officer at the principles for responsible investment and chair of the eu permanent sustainable finance platform says it s clear that the e is more advanced than the s when it comes to rules around esg investing but fabian says the pandemic has added a sense of urgency to coming up with an adequate rulebook we are running late on achieving the sdgs the united nation s sustainable development goals he says and the pandemic has shown how deep the inequalities in society have become

despite another wave of deadly covid 19 coronavirus infections ravaging moscow and spreading out into the provinces the russian authorities went ahead with staging the maks 2021 air and space show on the outskirts of moscow in zhukovsky on opening day july 20 president vladimir putin visited the exposition observed the stands and watched demonstration overflights by military and civilian aircraft according to official kremlin reports putin has been fully vaccinated against covid 19 but he still observes a strict isolation regime at maks 2021 the russian president strolled through the exhibition without a facemask surrounded by a screen of body guards according to a member of his personal press pool he was at all times inside a clean zone bubble no person or official was allowed anywhere near the president if he or she was not clean of covid 19 a negative test is not enough anyone no matter who permitted close to putin must first spend two weeks in total isolation under the watchful eye of the federal protective service fso to be proclaimed clean and allowed into the russian leader s presence kommersant july 21 apparently putin sees himself constantly and ubiquitously surrounded by deadly threats and the same kind of paranoia seems to influence russia s external internal and defense policymaking maks international aerospace shows have been held every two years in zhukovsky since 1993 to demonstrate russia s capability to build modern civilian and military aircraft air defense systems and space missiles a decade ago at maks 2011 all the major world civilian aircraft producers were present as aeroflot and other russian aviation industry companies were at that time massively buying up foreign airliners that year washington and moscow were still pursuing their so called reset revamping bilateral relations following the 2008 russian invasion of georgia the united states air force sent to maks 2011 a sizable array of military aircraft c 130j super hercules and с 5 galaxy transport jets a b 52 stratofortress strategic bomber and a р 3с orion intelligence anti submarine aircraft all stood on the tarmac in zhukovsky together with an a 10 thunderbolt ii attack jet and f 15e and f 16c fighters which additionally put on a show by flying together with their russian counterparts today in 2021 washington and moscow s relationship is at a critical low and a new cold war style arms race seems to be in full swing no us representation attended maks 2021 while the russian defense industry presented its latest weaponry that it claims is specifically designed to counter the us and allied militaries the most promoted entry at maks 2021 was a mysterious new stealth fighter photos of the aircraft partially covered up were circulated before maks 2021 with a provocative slogan do you want to see me naked kommersant july 21 the new plane revealed and demonstrated to the public and putin on july 20 turned out to be a model of a light one engine fighter jet designed by the sukhoi aircraft design and production company which is part of the united aircraft building corporation obyedinyonnaya aviastroitelnaya korporatsiya oak oak in turn is a subsidiary of the rostec state owned defense industry conglomerate the two corporate entities say they plan to have a flying prototype of the new jet by 2023 and hope to begin production in 2026 before the opening of maks 2021 lots of speculation circulated in the pro kremlin press about whether the new light fighter jet suddenly speedily and secretly constructed by sukhoi could seriously enhance the overall fighting composition of the russian aerospace forces vozdushno kosmicheskiye sily vks instead of relying almost exclusively on heavy two engine jets of the su 27 family which includes the further modified su 57 stealth jet and a diminishing stock of increasingly mothballed light but also two engine mig 29 family the vks would possess heavy fighter air superiority jets and a large array of cheaper tactical one engine fighters like the us air force does with its f 15s and f 16s or now f 22s and f 35s vzglyad july 19 this assumption turned out to be mistaken the vks did not order the new jet and apparently does not want it the so called stealth jet has been dubbed checkmate which in russian is a three letter sentence shakh i mat not practical as a name for a weapons system defense industry representatives say the checkmate plane may receive the designation su 75 but that has not been officially confirmed rostec and oak disclosed that they are promoting and producing the checkmate on their own initiative practically exclusively designed for export to african and asian nations the checkmate s production run is planned to be up to 300 units if there will be enough orders according to rostec the jet will be cheap in exploitation compared to the us f 35 lightning ii and the price tag will be under 30 million apiece rostec is offering african and asian countries possible co production of the fighter russia s vks may also procure the checkmate according to rostec but that would most likely involve just a handful of jets to promote them abroad as part of the vks inventory militarynews ru july 20 interfax july 22 it remains unclear how good a fighter the vigorously marketed but still in development checkmate may turn out its producers are certainly underscoring its stealth capabilities but just how stealthy the russian industry will manage to make it is uncertain the checkmate is reportedly built around the al 41f jet engine used in the su 35 which does not have a particularly low signature in the infrared spectrum but its production is steady if the checkmate is primarily designed to be used by developing countries against each other s militaries or by india and vietnam to deter china that kind of technology might suffice the director general of oak yury slyusar boasted that the checkmate will obliterate its opponents including the us f 35 stealth fighter interfax july 20 but such a matchup may be more friendly to the russian side in the marketplace rather than on the battlefield by providing a cheaper product to customers that cannot afford or do not have access to anything more advanced

by xinhua writer liu yanan new york july 22 xinhua inflation in the united states is reaching decade highs and drawing concerns from investors and experts as well as ordinary consumers who believe the country s inflationary pressures are underestimated and the federal reserve s inflation management framework should be questioned impacts on decision making high flying inflation in the country in the last few quarters not only made many people delay big ticket purchases but also drove investors into assets to hedge inflation risks now the higher inflation is beginning to create explosions and affect economic decision making and so i think it s a problem right now said mickey d levy chief economist for americas and asia with berenberg capital markets llc levy said the fed is missing the point on the impact of inflation and the higher inflation is gonna start digging into disposable income so we have to really start thinking about these real effects consumers complaints about rising prices on homes vehicles and household durables have reached an all time record said the university of michigan in a recent report on consumers survey the index of consumer sentiment dropped to 80 8 in july from 85 5 in june according to preliminary results of the survey meanwhile 57 percent of respondents believe inflation would accelerate in the next 12 months with 35 percent of respondents

believing inflation would speed up in the next 12 months is higher than 39 percent in latin america 38 percent in asia 46 percent in switzerland and 48 percent in other parts of europe according to the survey issued by ubs on wednesday as many as 58 percent of u s investors said they were personally impacted by inflation in the last six months according to the survey by ubs with 88 percent of investors believing that increased inflation could impact their portfolio significantly or somewhat u s investors are inclined to buy stocks or adjust their portfolio in other ways according to the survey investors looking for ways to build inflation protection into portfolios can consider stocks with pricing power or commodities including oil which typically fare relatively well in periods of higher inflation said mark haefele chief investment officer with ubs global wealth management in a recent note longer inflation prospect part of the price increases reflect supply constraints and will prove to be temporary although that temporary may last a little longer than people expect said levy at an online panel discussion organized by the manhattan institute on tuesday but at the same time strong demand and all the monetary and fiscal stimulus point toward underlying and mounting inflation pressures that will persist levy said the united states has the highest risk of higher inflation in the medium term in comparison with the united kingdom and european union according to mervyn king former bank of england governor and professor of economics with new york university s stern school of business consumer price inflation is too narrow of a measure to judge inflationary pressures within an economy and underlying vulnerabilities are built up in the process said investment research firm mrb partners in a recent research note the surge in u s core inflation in the second quarter has defied all expectations the possibility of inflation surprising on the upside on a 12 18 month basis will gain more traction ahead said analysts with mrb partners the underlying trend of personal consumption expenditure pce inflation will be at or above 3 percent by the end of next year in comparison with the fed s expectation of around 2 percent by then according to mrb partners mrb partners estimated that aggregate inflation in the u s economy is now running at a 9 percent annual rate which is about twice that of the core cpi inflation and the highest reading since 1980 inflation targeting questioned the fed s prevailing management framework for inflation is being questioned as experts worry it could not control inflation precisely or repeat policy mistakes the concern that i have is that central banks have become overconfident about their ability to control inflation precisely said king king said he is concerned with the framework of flexible average inflation targeting fait announced by the fed in 2020 because it implied that it was possible to control inflation that precisely and as we ve just seen it isn t the kind of calculation behind the inflation targeting framework may work in a model but doesn t actually work in the world according to king king added he is also concerned about central banks ability to forecast interest rates two or three years ahead the fed can manage expectations in financial markets but they cannot influence price setting behavior in the non financial sector said levy but the fed presumes it can one of my real concerns is the fed is looking at inflation through its perception of what inflation may be appropriate for its long run macro stabilization policy said levy there are widespread inflationary pressures in the united states and in most developed market economies particularly asset and credit inflation according to mrb partners in recent decades central banks myopic focus on cpi central bank inflation to guide policy has created persistent asset bubbles and then economic or debt crises when the bust phase develops warned mrb partners central bank inflation targeting has frequently missed rising imbalances and led to painful global policy blunders added mrb partners citing the biggest mistake in this respect that occurred in japan in the 1980s
ailsa chang host this pandemic has created an army of new investors with people stuck at home a record 10 million new brokerage accounts were opened last year the market got a little wobbly earlier this week but stocks are still near record highs so we thought this was probably a good time for people to get their ducks in a row and figure out a good plan for the future and to help us with that we re going to bring in npr s chris arnold who covers personal finance for our life kit podcast and joins us now hey chris chris arnold byline hey ailsa chang so a lot of new investors are out there trying to pick hot stocks what could go wrong right arnold yeah what could possibly go wrong with that right chang laughter arnold you know so i mean investors are out there they re watching youtube videos and they re in reddit chat groups and you know they re probably getting a mix of some good some bad some ugly advice but overall the market over the past year and even going back before that has been going up and up and up so a lot of people have been able to make some money i talked to one couple mollie and chad wood in st paul minn chad used to wait tables in restaurants and when things shut down he opened his first stock investing account chad wood there s a marijuana stock that i found to be like significantly underpriced and i said oh this looks like it might work and i made like 1 500 on that one trade mollie wood yeah it was a decent amount c wood it was a good one so i felt like i was the smartest person in the world when i closed that out and then i was like oh jeez no i m not i just got really lucky laughter chang is chad the smartest person in the world or not i mean there are a lot of people like him right now who jumped in did well betting on a hot stock like gamestop or even buying and selling bitcoin but tell us why maybe we shouldn t all go out right now and try to be like chad arnold well i mean look it can be exciting to try to be like chad but as a long term strategy investing is the most powerful way that we can save for retirement and our kids college and stuff like that so the most brilliant investors around for a long time have said that for everyday investors like you and me making short term bets on what a stock is going to do next it s just too hard to know and it s not the right approach and it s too risky so we are much better off investing for the long term and investing in index funds these are very low fees so it doesn t cost much to go this route and they let you buy the entire stock market basically so if any one stock crashes that just doesn t affect you at all chang but what if somebody does want to buy some individual stocks arnold yeah so people do i talked to a former financial adviser who now works for the personal finance site nerdwallet her name s tiffany lam balfour and she says look just do that with a very small amount of your portfolio tiffany lam balfour my dad liked to gamble and my mom would like give him 200 and be like there you go you know and that s it laughter and take the rest of his credit cards and anything else away right so it s a very similar thought process you have your core responsible portfolio if you have some excess cash ok open a separate account but don t let it intrude and interfere with that core portfolio chang ok that sounds sensible but what should be in that core responsible portfolio arnold the key idea is that you want to own lots of different types of investments so you can make money in different ways and spread risk around it s called diversification i talked to paula volent at rockefeller university she s had some of the best returns of any endowment manager in the country and she tells everyday investors this paula volent i always think of it as if you were in a beach town and you had a little stand you would want to sell suntan lotion as well as umbrellas because you don t put all your eggs in one basket so you want to have stocks maybe you have u s stocks you have some european or emerging market stocks and then you need to have things that are going to do well in down markets arnold that is when stocks are going down so you own some treasury bonds a real estate fund this might sound a little complicated so there are age based index type funds where you just pick the year you want to retire they figure out the rest for you that s one way to make this a lot more simple chang sage advice from npr s chris arnold thank you chris arnold thanks ailsa transcript provided by npr copyright npr
