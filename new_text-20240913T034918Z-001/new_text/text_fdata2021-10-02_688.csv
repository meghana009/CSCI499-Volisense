president of exploration stated we are encouraged by what we see from this first pass drill program at white point especially with the length of the vein intervals ranging up to 126 5 meters in the drill holes as the results generated from surface sampling at white point show a strong gold correlation with the veins we are now looking forward to the assay results in october white point target white point is located in nevada 400 meters west of the grey eagle resource along the same strong northwest trending ztem high resistivity measuring 800 meters wide and 2 000 meters long the grey eagle resource occupies the southern portion and white point the northwest extension of this ztem anomaly white point is characterized by an outcropping gold bearing sheeted vein zone consisting of individual veins ranging from a few centimeters to over 5 meters in thickness this vein zone is over 200 meters wide and can be followed along strike for 400 meters with possible extensions under the younger post mineral rocks several historical mines exploited both the individual veins and sheeted vein zones and grc sampling has generated grades of up to 8 4 g t gold from these historical workings and 13 9 g t gold from individual veins the 9 holes were drilled to test the subsurface in the areas of vein exposures and some of the projections under the younger cover of the 9 holes 8 encountered significant vein intervals with composited lengths ranging from 24 4 meters to 126 5 meters averaging 67 4 meters these same quartz calcite veins are exposed on surface along with silicified breccias and extensive stockwork veining the drill coverage tested an area 250x250 meters which will be expanded once the assays are received in october and the interpretation of the

deny everything has delivered his fourth win in a row with yet another impressive performance at addington last night beating the likes of darling me and suzie rocks in the process the son of a rocknroll dance has won a hat trick this campaign such has been his form that his breeder owners might be in for a bit of fun over the summer for damian love and his father neil they are just thrilled to see the mark jones trained pacer back at the races after almost two years between his first and second win it was really great to get a winner at addington again said damian love the five year old gelding started racing in october 2019 winning his first race at start number 4 at oamaru his next wins weren t until his recent double at methven and addington in september this year he s had a few problems which have meant we ve had to be patient but time has been his best friend being such a big horse we were never too worried about rushing him back when he had some niggles in 2019 and i guess he is repaying us for it now he said deny everything isn t just paying back his owners patience but rewarding the faith they placed in his dam lecerne lil in giving her a shot at stud it might be cliché but deny everything is proof of the fact there are no rules in breeding start with the fact his mother is by the three time derby winner in ginger man a total of 98 foals produced 18 winners for ginger man in this country but nothing of any notoriety for lecerne lil s 12 060 in stakes to be his highest new zealand earner from his two decent crops suggests he will be remembered much more favourably for his racing career then he will his siring accomplishments they say it takes two to tango however the maternal family of deny everything doesn t jump out at you either having to go back three generations to find a winner besides his dam lecerne lil unperturbed and blissfully unaware of her paternal shortcomings lecerne lil is fashioning herself a fine record in the new zealand studbook as a 100 producer for the loves last friday night s winner is one of six for lecerne lil and spans a near two decade breeding journey for damian love and his father dad neil lives in dunedin but he is very much still getting a kick out of the horses having gotten involved with his workmates with shares in some pacers way back in the 80 s said love the love family s connection to harness racing doesn t stop there damian s brother mike co trains with graeme anderson at westwood beach neil acquired a mare and bred a couple of self described slow ones and the passion for the sport was passed down from father to son which ultimately led damian love to taking out his training licence in 2003 my partner is sally graham and we live at her father bruce s property at kilsyth lodge he s had a lot of good horses over the years like quality invasion and racey product and has a heap of knowledge when it comes to racing and breeding i work as a printer in the evenings and just do the horses during the day i usually have one or two in work and have a couple in work for bruce and it works out quite well he said love s sole training victory came in the shape of a trotter called war george peoples blue chip kinvarra in 2006 at motukarara and led to love breeding from her dam kinvarra without a lot of luck however lecerne lil has managed to fill the void quite nicely in the years since i used to help andrew stuart out at his stable and have a couple in work myself dad and i had a two year old with andrew called ochil hills 1999 g road machine bell s butler that we qualified and sold to australia we were looking for another horse to race and andrew had this ginger man mare available who was showing a bit at the time so we bought into her as a replacement he said she showed a lot of promise but delivered only a little i guess when you look at her racing record she won a couple of races at nelson and another at thames but it was becoming apparent she wasn t going to be a star when she started to have some issues we decided to retire her and send her to the broodmare paddock he said lecerne lil retired in 2005 with a record of two wins and five placings from 36 starts which was more than her three siblings out of agenda payson s brother rosa bella could say with a full brother and two half sisters by tinted cloud being unraced while the maternal line for lecerne lil was sparce with winners she had some good blood further back with the likes of lordship bachelor hanover and light brigade in her pedigree providing an engine room to be built upon by vance hanover out of the smooth fella mare smooth ginger undoubtedly added further building blocks to the foundation of lecerne lil s production that was to come above all else her genetic makeup meant that regardless of the consort the resulting cross was likely to be very much an outcross with a lot of hybrid vigour as jim dalgety likes to say after missing twice to mach three and i am a fool lecerne lil produced her first foal to the unassuming sire cammibest with a colt by the name of definitely maybe in 2005 he was a lovely horse who won a race for us here and basically never missed a cheque in six starts before we sold him to australia he went to west australia and won another nine over there and was good enough to race in the golden nugget against the likes of bonavista bay and captain joy he came back a few months later and won fresh up in a 1 55 mile rate but broke his leg a day later which was awful he probably could have done some much better things said love her second foal indefinite was by live or die and typical of a lot of the stock by that sire was an honest bread and butter type who picked up a win and 10 placings from 39 starts i trained him for a lot of his career but it was greg and nina hope that had a bit of success with him and won a race at reefton he could always trot around home so i qualified him as a square gaiter but we only managed the one placing in that gait he said the dual gaited nature of indefinite was the inspiration for a breeding experiment down the line from lecerne lil which we will come to in due course the third foal was a falcon seelster filly called swiss lass who love trained himself for a good chunk of her 20 start career i qualified her myself and did a lot of the work with her before giving her to greg and nina hope for a little while and she managed to win a race at addington in their colours by five lengths he said i got another couple of placings out of her but she wasn t showing a lot and being by falcon seelster was one we always wanted to breed from so we retired her pretty early and she has a two year old colt by a rocknroll dance on the ground and a weanling filly by vincent the two year old out of swiss lass is a three quarter in blood to the impressive addington winner deny everything but that is where the similarities end he s just a completely different horse and just an honest average size whereas the other guy is a bit of a monster he said the fourth foal by lis mara was the last the father and son bred in conjunction with andrew stuart and the mating produced a filly called forgot to remember andrew stuart ended up taking ownership of forgot to remember and she was quite a neat wee thing she was dual gaited and won a race as a pacer but also won a couple of races trotting and a couple more races trotting in australia after she was sold there he said in 2013 damian and neil love took over stuarts share in lecerne lil and decided it was time to up the ante and give their mare a date with the best available before being served by bettor s delight she had produced four winners for four foals with only falcon seelster being what you might deem a commercial stallion he wasn t standing for 25 000 like he is now but as we were only breeding every second year it makes it a bit easier financially to turn them over the result was get it on who won his second start for anderson and dexter dunn at forbury park in march 2018 he s always had his fair share of problems that horse he had colic as a yearling which i think may have stuffed him a bit but he s my hobby horse now and he goes a few good races and can go a few average ones as well but that s racing isn t it he quipped get it on may never end up in the pantheon of top performers sired by bettor s delight but he has a race win to his name and more importantly put runs of the board for mum and continued her 100 strike rate the only progeny out of the mare who is yet to get on the board is a trotting bred filly by the name of lil miss muscles she qualified at rangiora back in may as a three year old before being given time to strengthen up and given some of her pacing bred siblings have won races in the trotting gait the decision to send her to muscle mass wasn t exactly a random experiment lecerne lil could always trot a wee bit at home and i use to joke with andrew all the time about breeding her to sundon i was reading up on muscle mass a little while ago and thought bugger it we might as well give it a crack she qualified pretty good about five seconds under time for mark jones and i m just jogging her up a bit at home before i send her back to him he said watching the qualifying trial it s hard to imagine the filly being out of a pacing mare such is the fluidity in her gait and will be one to watch as she looks to keep up the 100 record of her dam while this is a family that doesn t necessarily have any star power as of yet you get the sense that it doesn t worry love and his father in the slightest lecerne lil has already defied any reasonable expectations and can lay claim to providing ginger man with over 70 of his credits as a broodmare sire lecerne lil is set to go to stud one last time and it looks like she will have a date with leading north american two year old sire downbytheseaside with the loves yet to decide on whether her daughter swiss lass will be bred this season after last night s win deny everything is likely to be given a spell to be set for a race over cup week for a family that could easily have never been the best might be yet to come for the progeny of lecerne lil and the loves by brad reid hrnz breeding manager

kitchen mistakes whether you re a home cook or a michelin starred chef we ve all made them in real life sometimes you reach for the salt instead of the sugar or a teaspoon gets swapped for a tablespoon what to do when the inevitable happens is perhaps one of the most important and least talked about facets of cooking a mistake is a bad thing only until it is fixed at which point it becomes not only good but magic says chef and author cal peternell mistakes are the swept up stardust that success sparkles with peternell is all about taking inspiration from disappointment why throw away burnt toast for example when you can blend it into a grind for meatballs thicken soup or make a simple onion panade peternell s new book burnt toast and other disasters a book of heroic hacks fabulous fixes and secret sauces delves into the world of possibilities behind everyday culinary snafus he joins host evan kleiman to discuss the work and other tricks for remedying kitchen disasters the following interview has been edited for length and clarity kcrw you live in the bay area and have been the chef at chez panisse for a couple of decades it s pretty easy for folks like us to access optimal ingredients what was the circumstance that made you cook outside of your bubble like this cal peternell primarily it came from when i would travel visiting family or on vacation and i didn t have the amazing access that i usually have here i would try and do my usual i m going to cook for everyone and that means it starts at the market and i go and see what looks good but i realized well what if nothing really looks that good then what do you do so i started to try and figure that out i also felt like it s a book about mistakes and sometimes it s the mistake that you made because maybe you burnt the toast or you overcooked the rice but sometimes the mistake was that the ground beef has been sealed up in a package for a little too long and it s not gone bad but it s just not great anymore or maybe the only vegetables you could get were the same old ones you always get or maybe they were good vegetables but that was like a week ago and now you ve got them and you ve got to make something great talk about this onion panade and the options for burnt toast panade is a dish that i ve made for many years i learned from one of my former colleagues russell moore who now has a wonderful restaurant here in berkeley called the kebabery panade is almost like a lasagna that you make with bread instead of pasta you sort of layer toasted bread with flavorful ingredients and then you bake it and it all comes together the one i have in here is just a really simple version where you re using some bread that s a little bit too burnt or maybe you toasted it yesterday for something and now it s still around and it s kind of stale you can layer it with lots of onions that you ve cooked and a little bit of cheese if you want and some herbs if you ve got them i like to pour a really good chicken stock over it you bake it and it s just one of those things that is better than the sum of its parts and then i have another option where instead of just using a stock you use a kind of a custard mixture of cream and milk and eggs onion panade serves 6 if you have homemade stock make panade the onions well cooked but not browned counter the bread s overtoastiness ingredients ¼ cup olive or vegetable oil or a combination of oil and butter plus more for the baking dish 3 large yellow onions thinly sliced 1 teaspoon fine sea salt or kosher salt ground black pepper 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves or sage leaves optional 6 cups good chicken stock 12 to 16 ounces very much toasted bread about a loaf s worth 4 ounces cheese gruyere cheddar and or gouda grated 2 tablespoons butter cut into thin slices instructions heat a large skillet over high heat and add the oil then the onions and ½ teaspoon of the salt stir until the onions get going then reduce the heat to medium and cook stirring occasionally until the onions are soft and very lightly browned 15 to 20 minutes cover with a lid or add a splash of water if the onions color too much before getting soft add some black pepper and the thyme or sage if using and cook a minute more set aside heat the oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit bring the stock to a boil in a large pot over high heat add the remaining ½ teaspoon salt and keep hot over low heat while you build the panade brush a 3 quart baking dish or casserole or a large cast iron pan with oil and then fit in a layer of bread breaking up the slices as necessary to fill in any gaps arrange a third of the onions over the bread and sprinkle with a quarter of the cheese repeat until there are four layers of bread and three of filling set aside the final quarter of cheese press the layers down with your hands and then pour in enough hot stock to just reach the top layer cover with foil and bake until very hot in the middle about 45 minutes remove the foil dot with butter sprinkle with the remaining cheese and return to the oven until bubbling and browned on top 25 to 30 minutes the panade should be quite wet under the top crust almost soupy add leftover hot stock if needed to make it so scoop into bowls and eat hot from burnt toast and other disasters a book of heroic hacks fabulous fixes and secret sauces by cal peternell copyright 2021 by cal peternell reprinted by permission of william morrow an imprint of harpercollins publishers what hacks do you recommend for mushy rice i have a couple of them one is that you can make a rice pudding i like this one where i mix ginger and coconut milk in and you can either eat it hot or you can let it get cold which is what i prefer and then the other one that s really fun is rice pancakes you mix in some flour and a little baking soda and then i like to put in lots of turmeric because it makes it a beautiful color and other spices like cumin and paprika scallions and egg and then you just fry them up just like you would pancakes but they re savory i usually have a jar of some kind of mango pickle or lime pickle in the back of my fridge that tastes great with those and they re good as a side with meat chicken or other vegetables they re also good as a little hors d oeuvre kind of thing you can make little tiny ones and just pop them in your mouth what are some ways to jazz up the blank canvas of a chicken breast yeah i don t know when it happened that suddenly chicken was often sold without the skin but if you find yourself with the version that doesn t have any skin the thighs are a little more forgiving because they re a little fattier but i cook them with lots of dijon mustard and a little bit of flour and kind of fry them up and then braise them and that makes this nice kind of thickened sauce that s tangy from the mustard another one that i like is i take chipotles just out of the can and marinate the thighs with those and some kumin and a little bit of honey and then roast it it s sort of barbecue tasting and really pretty delicious great with lime squeezed over it one of the things that was such a fun challenge about this book is taking apart some of the dishes that i ve done forever and thought what if you skipped some steps how would that work out and it often works out pretty well talk about suggestions for what to do with completely un elevated ingredients like a box of macaroni and cheese yeah i call it hackaroni and cheese the one that my teenage son loved the most was the one that has corn cilantro and lime which was this pasta that we used to make in the cafe at chez panisse of course we used hand cut noodles and had beautiful creme fraiche but i was thinking what if you just use a little less of the cheese stuff and added corn and a little cream and lots of lime and cilantro and scallions that one is really great and by the way you can take that leftover cheese packet if you didn t use the whole one and sprinkling it over popcorn works really well

a u s effort to regulate stablecoins favors policing them like lenders which could jeopardize the future of tokens from firms that refuse to seek federal banking licenses led by the treasury department the president s working group on financial markets is aiming to issue a report on stablecoins by the end of the month an expected recommendation is that congress establish a limited charter allowing new crypto banks to manage stablecoins as deposits according to a senior official involved with the report who asked not to be named because it hasn t been finalized the group of regulators has also been considering urging the financial stability oversight council to examine whether stablecoins pose a systemic threat that option would be another approach to impose banklike rules on the tokens particularly if lawmakers fail to act signage outside the u s treasury building in washington d c u s on friday march 19 2021 treasuries trimmed this week s losses bringing a hint of relief to the inflation fueled selloff across global bond markets photographer samuel corum bloomberg samuel corum bloomberg the wall street journal earlier reported that treasury is considering ways to regulate stablecoins like banks anxieties in washington have been ratcheting up dramatically over stablecoins which are pegged to the u s dollar and other fiat currencies to avoid the wild price swings of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin federal officials are worried that an investor run could trigger a financial panic and that crypto firms are using stablecoins to offer banking services without consumer protections relying on congress or the fsoc would likely be a slow process for bringing oversight to stablecoins which already have a market value exceeding 120 billion treasury officials have also been considering shorter term alternatives to address the unregulated tokens in the interim people familiar with the work have said but details of those options aren t clear imposing banking rules could run counter to securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler s recent campaign to declare many cryptocurrencies securities that should follow sec rules a few crypto firms have already sought and won conditional bank charters from the office of the comptroller of the currency but it s uncertain whether those licenses will allow them to issue stablecoins in a way that satisfies regulators the occ has more recently slammed the brakes on granting such charters and acting comptroller michael hsu has publicly warned that cryptocurrencies could threaten the financial system

only by improving contact but also as an instrument for common action fdr torpedoes the london conference fdr s war on wall street the real new deal wall street sabotages the new deal coup attempt in america thwarted fdr said some speak of a new world order but it is not new and it is not order fdr s anti colonial post war vision the decision to write this book was taken more recently and impelled by urgent events winston churchill s speech at fulton missouri had a hand in this decision the growing stockpile of american atom bombs is a compelling factor all the signs of growing disunity among the leading nations of the world all the broken promises all the renascent power politics of greedy and desperate imperialism were my spurs in this undertaking and i have seen the promises violated and the conditions summarily and cynically disregarded and the structure of peace disavowed i am writing this then to you who agree with me that the path he charted has been most grievously and deliberately forsaken the four freedoms in future days which we seek to secure we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms the first is the freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world the second is the freedom of every person to worship god in his own way everywhere in the world the third is the freedom from want which translated into world terms means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants everywhere in the world the fourth is freedom from fear which translated into world terms means a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world that is no vision of a distant millennium it is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our time and generation that kind of world is the very antithesis of the so called new order of tyranny which dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb to that new order we oppose the greater conception the moral order a good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear since the beginning of american history we have been engaged in change in a perpetual peaceful revolution a revolution which goes on steadily quietly adjusting itself to changing conditions without the concentration camp or the quicklime in the ditch the world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries working together in a friendly civilized society this nation has placed its destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of millions of free men and women and its faith in freedom under the guidance of god freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or to keep them our strength is our unity of purpose churchill vs fdr the clash of two paradigms i m talking about another war elliott i m talking about what will happen to our world if after this war we allow millions of people to slide back into the same semi slavery don t think for a moment elliott that americans would be dying in the pacific tonight if it hadn t been for the shortsighted greed of the french and the british and the dutch shall we allow them to do it all all over again your son will be about the right age fifteen or twenty years from now one sentence elliott then i m going to kick you out of here i m tired this is the sentence when we ve won the war i will work with all my might and main to see to it that the united states is not wheedled into the position of accepting any plan that will further france s imperialistic ambitions or that will aid or abet the british empire in its imperial ambitions this clash came to a head during a major confrontation between fdr and churchill during the january 24 1943 casablanca conference in morocco at this event elliot documents how his father first confronted churchill s belief in the maintenance of the british empire s preferential trade agreements upon which it s looting system was founded of course he remarked with a sly sort of assurance of course after the war one of the preconditions of any lasting peace will have to be the greatest possible freedom of trade he paused the p m s head was lowered he was watching father steadily from under one eyebrow no artificial barriers father pursued as few favored economic agreements as possible opportunities for expansion markets open for healthy competition his eye wandered innocently around the room churchill shifted in his armchair the british empire trade agreements he began heavily are father broke in yes those empire trade agreements are a case in point it s because of them that the people of india and africa of all the colonial near east and far east are still as backward as they are churchill s neck reddened and he crouched forward mr president england does not propose for a moment to lose its favored position among the british dominions the trade that has made england great shall continue and under conditions prescribed by england s ministers you see said father slowly it is along in here somewhere that there is likely to be some disagreement between you winston and me i am firmly of the belief that if we are to arrive at a stable peace it must involve the development of backward countries backward peoples how can this be done it can t be done obviously by eighteenth century methods now who s talking eighteenth century methods whichever of your ministers recommends a policy which takes wealth in raw materials out of a colonial country but which returns nothing to the people of that country in consideration twentieth century methods involve bringing industry to these colonies twentieth century methods include increasing the wealth of a people by increasing their standard of living by educating them by bringing them sanitation by making sure that they get a return for the raw wealth of their community around the room all of us were leaning forward attentively hopkins was grinning commander thompson churchill s aide was looking glum and alarmed the p m himself was beginning to look apoplectic you mentioned india he growled yes i can t believe that we can fight a war against fascist slavery and at the same time not work to free people all over the world from a backward colonial policy what about the philippines i m glad you mentioned them they get their independence you know in 1946 and they ve gotten modern sanitation modern education their rate of illiteracy has gone steadily down there can be no tampering with the empire s economic agreements they re artificial they re the foundation of our greatness the peace said father firmly cannot include any continued despotism the structure of the peace demands and will get equality of peoples equality of peoples involves the utmost freedom of competitive trade will anyone suggest that germany s attempt to dominate trade in central europe was not a major contributing factor to war mr president he cried i believe you are trying to do away with the british empire every idea you entertain about the structure of the postwar world demonstrates it but in spite of that and his forefinger waved in spite of that we know that you constitute our only hope and his voice sank dramatically you know that we know it you know that we know that without america the empire won t stand churchill admitted in that moment that he knew the peace could only be won according to precepts which the united states of america would lay down and in saying what he did he was acknowledging that british colonial policy would be a dead duck and british attempts to dominate world trade would be a dead duck and british ambitions to play off the u s s r against the u s a would be a dead duck or would have been if father had lived fdr s post war vision destroyed while the world s attention is absorbed by tectonic shifts unfolding across military coup threatens to undo both the elections and the very foundations of the republic itself something very ominous has appeared off of the radar of most onlookers this something is it is this collapse that underlies the desperate efforts being made by the neo con drive for total war with russia china and other members of the growing mutlipolar alliance today in recent articles i have mentioned thatas a cover for the imposition of a new post covid world order operating system since the new rules of this new system are verymechanism to impose it onto the masses i wish to take a deeper look at the causes and effects of weimar germany s completely un necessary collapse into hyperinflation and chaos during the period of 1919 1923 in this essay i will go further to examine how those same architects of hyperfinflation came close to establishing a global bankers dictatorship inthrough a bold fight which has been written out of popular history books we will investigate in depth how a major war broke out within america led byand we will examine how this clash of paradigms came to a head in 1943 1945 this historical study is not being conducted for entertainment nor should this be seen as a purely academic exercise but is being created for the simple fact that the world is coming to a total systemic meltdown and unless certain suppressed facts of 20century history are brought to light then those forces who have destroyed our collective memory of what we once were will remain in the drivers seat as society is carried into a new age of fascism and world war just as the british oligarchy managed the war so too did they organize the reparations conference in france which among other things imposed impossible debt repayments upon a defeated germany and created the league of nations which was meant to become the instrument for a post nation state world order lloyd george led the british delegation alongside his assistant philip kerr lord lothian leo amery lord robert cecil and lord john maynard keynes who have a long term agenda to bring about a global dictatorship all of these figures were members ofafter the 1918 armistice dismantled germany s army and navy the once powerful nation was now forced to pay the impossible sum of 132 billion gold marks to the victors and had to give up territories representing 10 of its population alsace loraine ruhr and north silesia which made up 15 of its arable land 12 of its livestock 74 of its iron ore 63 of its zinc production and 26 of its coal germany also had to give up 8000 locomotives 225 000 railcars and all of its colonies it was a field day of modern pillage germany was left with very few options taxes were increased and imports were cut entirely while exports were increased this policy reminiscent of the imf austerity techniques in use today failed entirely as both fell 60 germany gave up half of its gold supply and still barely a dent was made in the debt payments by june 1920 the decision was made to begin a new strategy increase the printing press rather than the miracle cure which desperate monetarists foolishly believed it would be this solution resulted in an asymptotic devaluation of the currency into hyperinflation from june 1920 to october 1923 the money supply in circulation skyrocketed from 68 1 gold marks to 496 6 quintillion gold marks in june 1922 300 marks exchanged 1 us and in november 1923 it took 42 trillion marks to get 1 us images are still available of germans pushing wheelbarrows of cash down the street just to buy a stick of butter and bread 1kg of bread sold for 428 billion marks in 1923 with the currency s loss of value industrial output fell by 50 unemployment rose to over 30 and food intake collapsed by over half of pre war levels german director fritz lang s 1922 film dr mabuse the gambler exposed the insanity of german population s collapse into speculative insanity as those who had the means began betting against the german mark in order to protect themselves thus only helping to collapse the mark from within this is very reminiscent of those americans today short selling the us dollar rather than fighting for a systemic solution the dark effects of versailles were not unknown and germany s nazi stained destiny was anything but pre determined it is a provable fact often left out of history books thathad their efforts not been sabotaged from america itself a new presidential team under the leadership of william harding quickly reversed the pro league of nations agenda of the rabidly anglophile president woodrow wilson a leading us industrialist named washington baker vanderclip who had led in the world s largest trade agreement in history with russia to the tune of 3 billion in 1920 had called wilson an autocrat at the inspiration of the british government after months of organizing leading representatives of russia and germany agreed to an alternative solution to the versailles treaty which would have given new life to germany s patriots and established a powerful russia german friendship in europe that would have upset other nefarious agendas under the leadership of german industrialist and foreign minster walter rathenau and his counterpart russian foreign minister georgi chicherin the treaty was signed in rapallo italy on april 16 1922 premised upon the forgiveness of all war debts and a renouncement of all territorial claims from either side by a terrorist cell called the organization consul on june 24 1922 the success of the rapallo treaty lost its steam and the nation fell into a deeper wave of chaos and money printing the organization consul had taken the lead in the murder of over 354 german political figures between 1919 1923 and when they were banned in 1922 the group merely changed its name and morphed into other german paramilitary groups such as the freikorps becoming the military arm of the new national socialist party when the hyperinflationary blowout of germany resulted in total un governability of the state a solution took the form of the wall street authored dawes plan which necessitated the use of a london trained golem by the name of hjalmar schacht first introduced as currency commissioner in november 1923 and soon president of the reichsbank schacht s first act was to visit bank of england s governor montagu norman in london who provided schacht a blueprint for proceeding with germany s restructuring schacht returned to solve the crisis with the very same poison that caused it first announcing a new currency called the rentenmark set on a fixed value exchanging 1 trillion reichsmarks for 1 new rentenmark germans were robbed yet again ig farben thyssen union banking brown brothers harriman standard oil jp morgan and union banking took control germany s finances mining and industrial interests under the supervision of john foster dulles montagu norman averill harriman and other deep state actors this was famously exposed in the 1961 film judgement at nuremburg by stanley kramer on useless spending 390 000 civil servants were fired unions and collective bargaining was destroyed and wages were slashed by 15 as one can imagine this destruction of life after the hell of versailles was intolerable andunhindered by the republic s democratic institutions to force schacht s economics onto the people an up and coming rabble rousing failed painter who had made waves in a beerhall putsch on november 8 1923 was perfect though hitler grew in power over the coming decade of schachtian economics one last republican effort was made to prevent germany from plunging into a fascist hell in the form of the november 1932 election victory of general kurt von schleicher as chancellor of germany by january 30 1933 hitler gained chancellorship where he quickly took dictatorial powers under the state of emergency caused by the burning of the reichstag in march 1933 by 1934 the night of the long knives saw general schleicher and hundreds of other german patriots assassinated and it was only a few years until the city of london wall street frankenstein monster stormed across the world while everyone knows that the 1929 market crash unleashed four years of hell in america which quickly spread across europe under the great depression not many people have realized that this was not inevitable but rather a controlled blowout the bubbles of the 1920s were unleashed with the early death of president william harding in 1923 and wall street was deregulated investments into the real economy were halted during the 1920s and insanity became the norm in 1925 broker loans totalled 1 5 billion and grew to 2 6 billion in 1926 and hit 5 7 billion by the end of 1927 by 1928 the stock market was overvalued fourfold predictably no one could pay them resulting in a collapse of the markets these financiers had a tight allegiance with the city of london and coordinated their operations through the private central banking system of america s federal reserve and bank of international settlements throughout the great depression the population was pushed to its limits making america highly susceptible to fascism as unemployment skyrocketed to 25 industrial capacity collapsed by 70 and agricultural prices collapsed far below the cost of production accelerating foreclosures and suicide life savings were lost as 4000 banks failed this despair was replicated across europe and canada with eugenics loving fascists gaining popularity across the board time magazine had featured il duce over 6 times by 1932 and people were being told by that corporate fascism was the economic solution to all of america s economic woes in the midst of the crisis the city of london removed itself from the gold standard in 1931 which was a crippling blow to the usa as it resulted in a flight of gold from america causing a deeper contraction of the money supply and thus inability to respond to the depression british goods simultaneously swamped the usa crushing what little production was left it was in this atmosphere that one of the least understood battles unfolded in 1933 in germany a surprise victory of gen kurt schleicher caused the defeat of the london directed nazi party in december 1932 threatening to break germany free of central bank tyranny a few weeks before schleicher s victory franklinseeing their plans for global fascism slipping away the city of london announced that a new global system controlled by central banks had to be created post haste their objective wasin december 1932 an economic conference to stabilize the world economy was organized by the league of nations under the guidance of the bank of international settlements bis and bank of england the bis was set up as the central bank of central banks in 1930 in order to facilitate wwi debt repayments and was a vital instrument for funding nazi germany long after wwii began the london economic conference brought together 64 nations of the world under a controlled environment chaired by the british prime minister and opened by the king himself a resolution passed by the conference s monetary committee stated echoing the bank of england s modern fixation with mathematical equilibrium the resolutions stated that the new global gold standard controlled by central banks was needed to maintain a fundamental equilibrium in the balance of payments of countries the idea waschancellor schleicher s resistance to a bankers dictatorship was resolved by a soft coup ousting the patriotic leader in favor of adolph hitler under the control of a bank of england toy named hjalmar schacht in january 1933 with schleicher assassinated the following year in america an assassination attempt on roosevelt when a woman knocked the gun out of the hand of an anarchist freemason in miami resulting in the death of chicago s mayor cermak without fdr s dead body the london conference met an insurmountable barrier as fdr refused to permit any american cooperation roosevelt recognized the necessity for a new international system but he also knew that it had to be organized by sovereign nation states subservient to the general welfare of the people and not central banks dedicated to the welfare of the oligarchy before any international changes could occur nation states castrated from the effects of the depression had to first recover economically in order to stay above the power of the financiers by may 1933 the london conference crumbled when fdr complained that the conference s inability to address the real issues of the crisis is a catastrophe amounting to a world tragedy and that fixation with short term stability were old fetishes of so called international bankers that objective means more to the good of other nations than a fixed ratio for a month or two exchange rate fixing is not the true answer the new president laid down the gauntlet infdr declared a war on wall street on several levels beginning withpecorra s highly publicized success empowered fdr to impose while creating an alternative lending mechanism outside of fed control called the reconstruction finance corporation rfc which became the number one lender to infrastructure in america throughout the 1930s one of the most controversial policies for which it s manipulation by international financiers made it a weapon of destruction rather than creation at this time since commodity prices had fallen lower than the costs of production it was vital to increase the price of goods under a form of controlled inflation so that factories and farms could become solvent and unfortunately the gold standard held that back fdr imposed protective tariffs to favor agro industrial recovery on all fronts ending years of rapacious free trade fdr stated his political economic philosophy in 1934 the old fallacious notion of the bankers on the one side and the government on the other side as being more or less equal and independent units has passed away government by the necessity of things must be the leader must be the judge of the conflicting interests of all groups in the community including bankers once liberated from the shackles of the central banks fdr and his allies were able to start a genuine recovery by restoring confidence in banking within 31 days of his bank holiday 75 of banks were operational and the fdic was created to insure deposits ffdr s first fireside chat was vital in rebuilding confidence in the government and banks serving even today as a strong lesson in banking which central bankers don t want you to learn about which fdr termed the four quarters featuring zones of megaprojects such as the tennessee valley authority area in the south east the columbia river treaty zone on the northwest the st laurence seaway zone on the north east and hoover dam colorado zone on the southwest these projects were transformative in ways money could never measure as the tennessee area s literacy rose from 20 in 1932 to 80 in 1950 and racist backwater holes of the south became the bedrock for america s aerospace industry due to the abundant and cheap hydropower as i had already reported on the saker fdr was not a keynesian although it cannot be argued that hives of rhodes scholars and fabians penetrating his administration certainly were those who criticize the new deal today ignore the fact that its failures have more to do with wall street sabotage than anything intrinsic to the program for example jp morgan tool lewis douglass u s budget director forced the closure of the civil works administration in 1934 resulting in the firing of all 4 million workers wall street did everything it could to choke the economy at every turn in 1931 ny banks loans to the real economy amounted to 38 1 billion which dropped to only 20 3 billion by 1935 where ny banks had 29 of their funds in us bonds and securities in 1929 this had risen to 58 which cut off the government from being able to issue productive credit to the real economy when in 1937 fdr s treasury secretary persuaded him to cancel public works to see if the economy could stand on its own two feet while steel fell from 80 capacity back to depression levels of 19 two million jobs were lost and the dow jones lost 39 of its value this was no different from kicking the crutches out from a patient in rehabilitation and it was not lost on anyone that those doing the kicking were openly supporting fascism in europe bush patriarch prescott bush then representing brown brothers harriman was found guilty for trading with the enemy in 1942 the bankers didn t limit themselves to financial sabotage during this time but also attempted a fascist military coup which was exposed by maj gen smedley butler in his congressional testimony of november 20 1934 the american liberty league onlyone of the greatest living testimonies to fdr s anti colonial vision is contained in a little known 1946 book authored by his son elliot roosevelt who as his father s confidante and aide was privy to some of the most sensitive meetings his father participated in throughout the war seeing the collapse of the post war vision upon fdr s april 12 1945 death and the emergence of a pro churchill presidency under harry truman who lost no time in dropping nuclear bombs on a defeated japan ushering in a soviet witch hunt at home and launching a cold war abroad elliot authored as he saw it 1946 in order to create a living testimony to the potential that was lost upon his father s passing as elliot said of his motive to write his book even before america had entered the war the principles of international harmony which fdr enunciated in his january 6 1941 four freedoms speech to the u s congress served as the guiding light through every battle for the next 4 5 years in this speech fdr said upon hearing these freedoms outlined american painter norman rockwell was inspired to paint four masterpieces that were displayed across america and conveyed the beauty of fdr s spirit to all citizens fdr s patriotic vice president and the man who should have been president in 1948 henry wallace outlined fdr s vision in a passionate video address to the people in 1942 which should also be watched by all world citizens today elliot s account of the 1941 1945 clash of paradigms between his father and churchill are invaluable both for their ability to shed light into the true noble constitutional character of america personified in the person of roosevelt but also in demonstrating the beautiful potential of a world that should have been had certain unnatural events not intervened to derail the evolution of our species into an age of win win cooperation creative reason and harmony in as he saw it elliot documents a conversation he had with his father at the beginning of america s entry into wwii who made his anti colonial intentions clear as day saying it was an argument that could have no resolution between these two men the following day elliot describes how the conversation continued between the two men with churchill stating this story was delivered in full during an august 15 lecture by the author while fdr s struggle did change the course of history his early death during the first months of his fourth term resulted in a fascist perversion of his post war vision rather than see the imf world bank or un used as instruments for the internationalization of the new deal principles to promote long term low interest loans for the industrial development of former colonies over his dead body and they were recaptured by the same forces who attempted to steer the world towards a central banking dictatorship in 1933 the american liberty league spawned into various patriotic anti communist organizations which took power withthis is the structure which is out to destroy president donald trump and undo the november elections under a military coup and civil war out of fear that a new fdr impulse is beginning to be revived in america which may align with the 21century international new deal emerging from china s belt and road initiative and eurasian alliance on humanity s carrying capacity in defense of saving nature from humanity have nothing to do with franklin roosevelt s new deal and they have less to do with the bretton woods conference of 1944 these are merely central bankers wet dreams for depopulation and fascism with a democratic face which their 1923 and 1933 efforts failed to achieve and can only be imposed if people remain blind to their own recent history

springfield since moving to springfield just over a year ago barb louden and her husband greg have spent several hours a week volunteering at the central illinois foodbank in the sprawling 56 000 square foot warehouse on the city s east side they and other volunteers sort and box food that will be sent to more than 160 partner agencies across a 21 county region including macon county in central and southern illinois when they distribute they go north south east west louden said they go all over to deliver it to different organizations so yeah it s really been an eye opener for how much people are in need of food more than 120 000 people in the region or about one eighth of the population are food insecure according to the food bank it s a problem that pre existed the covid 19 pandemic but has nevertheless been made worse by it long lines outside food giveaways became the norm food banks are serving about 55 more people than before the pandemic according to feeding america a nationwide network of food banks during the pandemic people had higher medical bills they had increased childcare costs they may have been in between jobs said tim kirsininkas spokesman for the central illinois foodbank so the food bank and our partner agencies exist as that safety net for if people need a little bit extra help just to get by use the buying power in 2020 the food bank distributed more than 10 3 million pounds of food enough for 8 6 million meals the food is sourced in three major ways donations which can come from farmers grocery stores and regular folks government programs like the emergency food assistance program and purchased products which is when the food bank purchases directly from suppliers at a reduced cost using grant funds and donations once the food is at the warehouse volunteers and food bank employees work to get it in the hands of those who need it though the central illinois foodbank participates in several food giveaways a year this is mostly done by distributing food to partner agencies across the region we are basically a distribution site said adam handy partner resource coordinator at the central illinois foodbank we are an organization that collects resources that then get distributed out to the people who are fighting food insecurity in their neighborhoods food that s donated provided through government programs or covered by grants is often distributed for free but partner agencies also have the ability to purchase directly from the food bank if they are in need of specific items or want to bulk up handy said there s no bad way to help out whether it s donating food items or volunteering but monetary donations allow the food bank to use the buying power that we have with distributors to make that money go very far partner agencies from soup kitchens to pantries can purchase food at about 19 cents a pound this means for every donation about six meals can be purchased kirsininkas said with demand still strong due to the lingering impact of the pandemic many organizations are looking to stretch their dollar further 3 2 million pounds of food in decatur for instance organizers of the wsoy community food drive to be held oct 8 will only be accepting monetary donations for a second year in a row last year more than 600 000 was collected enough for 3 2 million pounds of food the salvation army has benefitted from the monetary donations they received after last year s wsoy community food drive according to kyle karsten director of development we are so grateful to the community for making this happen he said we are able to park this money over at the central illinois foodbank and actually order what we need when we need it at a better cost he said all three of those are so significant the cost efficiency is important to food pantries and their agencies we can make a dollar go a lot further than just cans of food karsten said we are seeing more and more families that need certain items certain diets certain specifications on what their family likes with the monetary contributions food pantries are able to provide perishable items such as milk meats and eggs we can get those things at a great cost at the central illinois foodbank karsten said morgan huffman salvation army s director of social services directs the food pantry the springfield facility works with her to organize the deliveries she receives a list of choices twice a week it has whatever items they have in stock huffman said we choose the items we need in our pantry and the quantity the scheduled deliveries often arrive every other friday angel lawrence executive director of the northeast community fund said the group has a weekly food list they present to the central illinois foodbank we are given the autonomy to pick the items that we would like to have as part of our food pantry lawrence said lawrence was given a tour of the central illinois foodbank shortly after she was hired as director last year during the visit she witnessed the large amounts of food items from perishable to nonperishable products a lot of those items we have as part of our food pantry here in decatur she said wesley ridgeway partner resource coordinator at the central illinois foodbank said the warehouse is always kind of changing with influx of what we get in and what we get out we re a distribution center so we don t want to keep anything here for a long amount of time ridgeway said we get it in and our goal is to get it out to all of our agencies as quick and efficient as possible photos wsoy community food drive through the years

company the people who spoke to cnbc did so on condition of anonymity fearing retribution or loss of job opportunities the experience of those who spoke to cnbc and their view of the company s management in many ways matched that of the 21 current and former employees who published an essay about blue origin on thursday alleging a toxic work culture smith responded internally to the essay in a company wide email that was obtained by cnbc seeking to reassure the company and emphasize that there is no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind smith runs the company for founder bezos who hired him from honeywell in 2017 many of those leaving blue origin do so reluctantly cnbc learned loving the technology s potential and having bought into bezos vision several people emphasized the exodus is a huge concern for blue origin as the space industry has become incredibly competitive additionally its headquarters in the seattle suburb of kent washington means that the

losses than others the new shepard program has had people leave in droves one person said the finance team has also had steady personnel losses with a source describing budgeting as a nightmare at blue origin one example of budgeting issues told to cnbc was the jacklyn ship which blue origin bought from swedish shipping company stena line to turn into a landing platform for its new glenn rocket boosters jacklyn has had number of setbacks during retrofitting one person said and the project is 21 over budget according to another who noted that delays were related to the covid pandemic the company s vice president of finance lisa graham is leaving next week two people familiar said blue origin s human resources team used to perform exit interviews for anyone who left the company but hr representatives have largely stopped doing so two people said with the few still doing exit interviews drowning in people leaving the return to office push blue origin the central sticking point and cause cited by many people who recently left was smith s strong push this year for all blue origin employees to return to the office called blue back together the plan came despite a petition signed by hundreds of employees to at least implement a hybrid work model a petition people familiar said was never acknowledged by smith instead smith spent millions of dollars this year renting out expansion office space near the company s headquarters sources told cnbc he wanted every single employee back into the office by september with no flexibility for a hybrid model and planned to effectively ban remote work these sources said additionally as part of smith s rush to return employees to the office people familiar with the matter said the ceo in may began a covid vaccination disclosure program through green dots on company badges but smith s initiative was on a good faith basis multiple people said employees simply had to ask the office receptionist for the circular green stickers to add to their badge with no proof of vaccination required later blue origin added a paper sheet for employees to sign before they could get a green dot but still no one had to show a vaccine card or indicate when they received it blue origin while bezos in the spring was supportive of bringing employees back a person familiar said he later overruled smith s push aside from a limited number of essential workers blue origin employees continue to work fully remote two sources said with the full return to the office now delayed to january smith there s nothing you guys can

musk smith has rapidly grown blue origin s headcount from just over 1 000 employees when he joined in 2017 but smith s time has also seen the company struggle to deliver on multiple major programs highlighted by blue origin s chief operating officer leaving late last year the company s biggest win this year was the first crewed new shepard launch which was a smooth success but the milestone for the suborbital rocket came after years of delay with blue origin having previously said new shepard would launch people by the end of 2017 michael sheetz cnbc new glenn is the reusable next generation rocket that blue origin is developing for orbital launches a marketplace dominated by spacex and united launch alliance the rocket was originally slated for its inaugural flight in 2020 but was

award of a multi billion dollar lunar lander contract to spacex pressure from delays and contract losses might explain why some see smith s leadership style as gruff or heavy handed but one person close to the ceo emphasized a disparity between smith and the expectations of the largely washington based workforce who are often very competitive and don t need to move to find similarly technical well paying jobs that person also highlighted disjointedness in the team around smith at one meeting for instance smith told his team there s nothing you guys can teach me that i don t already know according to two people with knowledge of this discussion another person close to smith told cnbc said that at one point the relationship between the ceo and his senior team deteriorated so much that blue origin hired a leadership consultant to examine the situation after doing hours of one on one interviews with smith s executive team the consultant began their feedback presentation to smith with the line it is the unanimous opinion of your senior leadership team that you are a micromanager smith responded simply you think you re telling me something i don t know i m damn proud of it and have no intention to change according to two people who were in the meeting and a third who heard about his comments after the fact a blue origin spokesperson denied those comments saying in a statement we have checked with the entire leadership team and the leadership consultant you referenced and we can 100 confirm that those statements were never said while the specifics around blue origin s turnover have not been previously reported the broad internal distaste for smith has it s reflected in the job site glassdoor which shows that just 19 of employees approve of smith s leadership that s sharply below the approval for other space executives as glassdoor shows 91 of spacex employees approve of ceo elon musk and 77 of united launch alliance approve of ceo tory bruno bezos who is investing

a challenging period for the markets nerves are starting to creep into the markets which will make the final months of the year very interesting the list of downside risks for the economy and markets is growing all the time something investors have been relatively comfortable with but it seems something is pushing them too far over the years many have questioned whether central banks have been a backstop for the markets ensuring that investors continue to buy dips and sell offs don t turn into anything more serious during troubling times which makes their current situation all the more challenging for more than a decade central banks haven t been able to generate enough inflation to hit their targets often not even close which has allowed them to be patient as their economies get back to full strength with inflation in many countries now running above target and policymakers seemingly less confident in how temporary it is the theory may be put to the test as the stimulus is withdrawn and rates start rising jobs report eyed as fed prepares to taper sterling struggles as markets price in multiple rate hikes evergrande risks remain after missed coupon payments country us risks to us economic recovery are growing as inflation pressures intensify an energy crisis abroad might push oil prices to levels that threaten growth and the battle in washington dc over the debt will likely go down to the wire when the last cent is almost exhausted around october 18th congress was able to pass a stopgap bill that avoided a government shutdown at least till early december it

announcement is widely expected with robust employment reports likely accelerating the pace of tapering eu the german election was won narrowly by the spd as expected but coalition talks will take some time the most likely result is the traffic light coalition with the greens and free democrats but a grand coalition can t be ruled out pmis and retail sales early next week are the standout data points but ultimately focus will be on the central bank ahead of the meeting in a few weeks others are looking to remove stimulus even raise rates and we are seeing some inflation in the region the fate or the pepp program in march and what if anything will replace it is what traders want to know uk a little light on the data side next week with the pmis on tuesday and wednesday the only releases of note key for the uk at the moment is interest rate expectations with the market s pricing in three by the end of next year despite the country facing an energy crisis this winter fuel crisis currently brexit related challenges the end of the furlough and universal credit top up schemes and a national insurance hike in march not the ideal environment to be tightening unless of course policymakers aren t being entirely honest in their assessment of the stickiness of inflation the pound has been under pressure even as hike expectations rise not what you would expect in that

africa next week is looking very quiet with pmi data on tuesday the only notable release turkey the lira came under more pressure this week after the decision by the cbrt last week to cut interest

further pressure asia pacific china china is on holiday all week until friday and thus there are no significant data releases this week although the evergrande story has ebbed from headlines it has not gone away despite some recent asset sale announcements and partial payments to retail investors evergrande has missed two foreign currency coupon payments any deterioration or signs of a

joe biden who has good days and bad days was apparently lucid enough to appear in public today amidst all the chaos on capitol hill over the far left reconciliation package the president set forth in order to help the negotiations if reports are any indication he did the opposite but that was to be expected biden s ability as a legislative mastermind has always been a myth after all and is it really surprising that he didn t convince kyrsten sinema or joe manchin to betray their constituents when this is the kind of commentary he brought ap in his private talks with legislators biden suggested a d defeat on the current bills would be a gift to rs empowering a party that he has judged a threat to democracy itself defeat he warned would embolden the same forces who tacitly blessed josh kraushaar hotlinejosh october 1 2021 biden is right in one regard a defeat of both bills would indeed be a gift to republicans who are more than content to let democrats destroy themselves yet he couldn t just leave it at that instead he had to invoke january 6th because the left in this country literally has nothing left further biden essentially saying do what i want or there will be violence is as anti democratic of a position as i can think of this guy is a tyrant at heart using lies and veiled threats in order to get his way that is when he s not passed out in the white house basement because he s so addled do you know what people suffering under the current runaway inflation don t care about january 6th do you know what people who have their retirement in stocks don t care about january 6th no one outside the beltway is still obsessing over a three hour ordeal in which the only person who was purposely killed was shot by a police officer there are also serious questions about what actually transpired after a judge forced the release of surveillance footage prosecutors had tried to keep hidden see the feds are forced to release january 6th surveillance footage and narratives crumble regardless nothing biden said today moved the needle in fact he seemed to double down on the very aspects of the reconciliation process that are so offputting to the moderates that hold all the leverage biden is classic bser and he s learning quickly that he can t c mon man his way past this legislative roadblock flailing about bringing up january 6th isn t going to convince manchin to nuke his state s economy and we all know sinema just doesn t care about anything i would posit that what we are witnessing is the last gasps of a broken party that knows it s about to get shellacked in next year s elections the disarray we are seeing right now didn t develop overnight it s been building for a very long time going all the way back to the trump years things are just now starting to boil over and i don t think there s any putting the water back in the pot the democrat coalition is too damaged and their leader is a senile old man who can t do anything but mumble about january 6th and vaccine mandates

lander contract to spacex pressure from delays and contract losses might explain why some see smith s leadership style as gruff or heavy handed but one person close to the ceo emphasized a disparity between smith and the expectations of the largely washington based workforce who are often very competitive and don t need to move to find similarly technical well paying jobs that person also highlighted disjointedness in the team around smith at one meeting for instance smith told his team there s nothing you guys can teach me that i don t already know according to two people with knowledge of this discussion another person close to smith told cnbc said that at one point the relationship between the ceo and his senior team deteriorated so much that blue origin hired a leadership consultant to examine the situation after doing hours of one on one interviews with smith s executive team the consultant began their feedback presentation to smith with the line it is the unanimous opinion of your senior leadership team that you are a micromanager smith responded simply you think you re telling me something i don t know i m damn proud of it and have no intention to change according to two people who were in the meeting and a third who heard about his comments after the fact a blue origin spokesperson denied those comments saying in a statement we have checked with the entire leadership team and the leadership consultant you referenced and we can 100 confirm that those statements were never said while the specifics around blue origin s turnover have not been previously reported the broad internal distaste for smith has it s reflected in the job site glassdoor which shows that just 19 of employees approve of smith s leadership that s sharply below the

abortion aca health care budgets climate change state lawmakers face a terrible hangover of problems from 2020 first and foremost is the pandemic which is at its worst even as vaccinations are rolled out across the country caseloads and death tolls are adding uncertainty to the economy which in turn is hampering state budgets as legislatures began to meet this month some convened virtually due to concerns about covid 19 while capitols were boarded up or surrounded by perimeter fences and swat teams because of the ongoing threat of political violence anger about the election and its bloody aftermath is leading to partisan divisions about how to handle voting democrats would like to see more mail voting and other expansive measures while republicans argue that even the suspicion of widespread voter fraud while shot down repeatedly in dozens of court cases in recent weeks is reason enough to push for a more secure system there s a sincere need for us to look at voting says robin vos the republican speaker of the wisconsin assembly we need to do a better job so that either side that is not successful feels that the result was legal and secure changes to election law will not be the only overtly political question facing legislators this is a redistricting year republicans have held onto their advantage in terms of overall legislative control but several states will see district lines drawn by independent commissions for the first time thanks to recent ballot initiatives in many states 2021 also offers the first chance for legislatures to weigh in on policing measures following the death of george floyd and the mass protest movement against police brutality and racism the events of this past summer captured the nation s attention and the attention of policymakers and power holders at many levels says massachusetts state sen sonia chang díaz a democrat and sponsor of a policing regulatory bill signed into law at the very end of 2020 measures addressing other areas of criminal justice from sentencing law to drug decriminalization will also be on the agenda so will abortion with red and blue states continuing to move in opposite directions as they wait to see what approach an increasingly conservative u s supreme court will take on the issue states are also waiting on a ruling from the supreme court in the latest case challenging the constitutionality of the affordable care act it appears likely that the law so often challenged in the decade since its passing will survive yet again certainly a biden administration will work to expand it following the trump administration s efforts to weaken or repeal it the aca aside states will have to come up with ways of financing medicaid unemployment and other programs that are in greater demand due to the economic downturn an estimated 5 million individuals lost coverage last year due to job losses stemming from the pandemic housing will also remain a top of mind concern evictions have increased but millions more could be at risk as various federal state and local moratoria expire on top of the covid related issues there are many perennial topics that lawmakers will want to address many sessions were cut short last year meaning there s pent up demand to address ongoing challenges in areas such as pension costs infrastructure and climate change just in my committee as chair of the energy and telecommunications committee we have everything from carbon pricing to expanding access to broadband across the state particularly for kids now being forced to learn remotely says new york democratic sen kevin parker how much bandwidth will remain for all that remains an open question no one predicted at this point last year that the coronavirus would shut down much of the nation for weeks and months on end assuming the nation gets through 2021 without facing any further challenges that are now unknowable coping with the ones already at hand will be difficult enough it s going to be triaging covid and economic recovery and setting our state budget says republican kurt daudt the minority leader in the minnesota house we re still operating remotely beyond those issues it s going to be difficult to get much more done than those three things even where there s will and desire to address policy concerns there s also the question of how much money will be available to fund new initiatives state and local governments eliminated 1 4 million jobs between february and november of last year nearly double the total number of layoffs at the low point of the great recession although revenues generally aren t as dire as predicted last spring there are still shortfalls in the billions some states though not all are in a serious hole all states face increased spending pressures due to the pandemic from social services and vaccine distribution to retrofitting schools due to health concerns the pandemic may well be over or at least under control as the year progresses but it remains the dominant challenge for states when sessions began one front of mind concern for legislators was limiting the emergency powers of governors and other executive branch officials much of this is playing out on a partisan basis but there s been a fair amount of frustration among legislators on both sides of the aisle who feel they ve been sidelined at the same time republican lawmakers are interested in providing private companies with protection against covid litigation fifty to 60 percent of everything we talk about is going to be covid related says republican caleb rowden majority leader of the missouri senate our response to it how to handle money from the feds and liability protection in short lawmakers face a challenging year and difficult circumstances in which to do their work it has been nearly 50 years since the u s supreme court in roe v wade struck down a texas statute banning abortion effectively legalizing the procedure across the nation ever since that decision has acted as a lightning rod galvanizing those for and against a woman s right to choose an abortion especially in the last decade conservative states have sought to impose ever greater abortion restrictions between january 2011 and july 2019 nearly 500 new state abortion restrictions were enacted mostly in the south and midwest many of these involved parental notification for minors counseling mandates limits on public funding and strict regulation of clinics polls show that nationally a majority of adults think abortion should remain legal at least to some degree and that roe v wade should not be overturned last summer chief justice john roberts joined four liberal colleagues as the supreme court struck down a louisiana law designed to restrict access to abortion potentially shutting down all but one clinic in the state now that there is a six to three conservative majority on the high court states will likely continue to enact restrictive abortion laws attempting to force the court to revisit roe v wade if roe is reversed abortion would be immediately illegal in the ten states that have passed trigger laws enacted to ban abortion automatically whenever roe is overturned the center for reproductive rights says that if roe v wade were weakened or overturned abortion rights would be protected in less than half of the u s states while some states are working to restrict access to abortion others are going in the opposite direction passing laws to protect abortion rights new york vermont connecticut california oregon washington hawaii and virginia have all expanded access to abortion in recent years voters in colorado one of seven states without a cut off date for abortion rejected a proposal in november that would have limited abortion to the first 22 weeks of a pregnancy more than a tenth of colorado s abortions are performed on out of state patients in the waning days of 2020 the massachusetts legislature overrode gov charlie baker s veto of legislation that increases the number of weeks during which abortion is available and lowers the age of consent it was the consent provision that the governor objected to abortion law will be debated in several state legislatures in 2021 prior to the new year and the 2021 legislative session the arkansas unborn child protection act was pre filed in november the bill would ban abortion outright except to save the mother s life as of january pregnant women in indiana will be required to undergo an ultrasound procedure at least 18 hours before getting an abortion abortion access is also expected to come up in the 2021 arizona montana and texas legislative sessions several other states are waiting to see what happens to legislation that has been blocked in federal court nearly 2 3 million americans lost health insurance during the first three years of the trump administration including 1 6 million living in swing states it s been estimated that job losses contributed to more than 5 million americans losing their insurance between february and may 2020 making single year coverage losses the greatest in american history with the pandemic overwhelming families communities and the health care system it could have been worse republicans have worked to overturn the affordable care act aca and up until the supreme court heard oral arguments in texas v california it seemed possible it might succeed the suit brought by 20 states and two individuals seeks to negate the entire aca on the basis that its individual mandate for coverage accompanied by a financial penalty is unconstitutional in 2017 congress reduced this penalty to zero the plaintiffs argue that the mandate is not severable from the law and thus aca is not enforceable oral arguments left observers with the impression that even if the court rules that the mandate is unconstitutional the remainder of the aca will stand i think it s hard for you to argue that congress intended the entire act to fall when the same congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act supreme court chief justice roberts said to the texas solicitor general leading the case a final ruling is not expected until the spring even though the danger may be past it s important to consider what s at stake an urban institute analysis outlines the consequences that overturning aca would have by 2022 including a 69 percent increase in the number of uninsured americans a decrease of more than 150 billion in federal spending on health care and a 135 billion decrease in spending by and for the nonelderly states local health care networks providers and citizens would suffer greatly it s almost impossible to imagine overturning the affordable care act at this point because the pieces are inextricably intertwined with how the public and private health insurance systems operate says health economist linda blumberg phd a fellow at the urban institute s health policy center and a coauthor of the report thirty eight states have expanded medicaid under the aca and even though the federal government pays only 90 percent states save medicaid expansion is a financial winner for the states says blumberg it has been demonstrated to reduce their other spending on health care significantly enough that they come out financially ahead the providers want it and the low income population needs it there are other benefits a report from the square one project highlights the advantages of investing medicaid expansion funds in a coordinated continuum of care that includes case management and services that address the full range of determinants of health with effects as far reaching as reducing mass incarceration and recidivism medicaid is underused it can be a health reform housing reform and justice reform tool says report author lynda zeller a senior fellow at the michigan health endowment who has decades of experience as a state health official every medicaid program has a state plan and each state red or blue can build a plan that adds more tools and serves more people if challenges to the aca have subsided what will the coming year bring president elect biden has expressed opposition to the single payer systems proposed by others in his party at the state level cost transparency and containment will be priorities as citizen need for care is increasing and their ability to pay declining heading into 2020 just about every state was anticipating revenue growth in 2021 very few states are in that situation the economic fallout of the virus driven recession has hit states hard although not as hard as initially expected states were highly conservative with their own forecasts as the pandemic struck last spring meaning the picture looks rosier than it did back in the spring but still not great the brookings institution estimated in december that state shortfalls would total 350 billion from fiscal 2020 through 2022 that s well below brookings own estimate just three months earlier states were very cautious with this situation says dan white director of government consulting at moody s analytics a financial research firm we re seeing a number of states seeing revenues higher than they thought they were going to be that doesn t mean they re up or they re doing well heavy stimulus spending from the federal government has helped prop up economic activity and with it state budgets the other surprising factor is the unusual nature of this downturn the stock market is reaching new records while corporate profits are high even as main street businesses struggle similarly more affluent professionals able to work remotely have fared better than lower income service workers in california what was projected to be a 54 billion shortfall last spring has morphed into a 15 billion surplus we re in this very odd situation because of the intense dichotomy that the pandemic has brought in terms of economic effects says chris hoene executive director of the california budget and policy center a watchdog group our progressive tax system is yielding unexpectedly strong revenues because people at the very top of the income spectrum and corporations are thriving and if anything doing better than they were before thanks to changes in law states in general have captured more revenue from online sales than would have been the case just a few years ago those that tax groceries are also faring pretty well but many states dependent on sales taxes are struggling along with those reliant on oil production white predicts states in general could still be in for a rude awakening when personal income tax returns are filed in april with tourism dependent states hurting worst of all the governor s initial budget that was just recently presented to the legislature contemplates four years of furloughs and program cuts says della au belatti majority leader of the hawaii house that s the depth of our budget crisis every unhappy state is unhappy in its own way even in california where revenues have improved things are just climbing back to where they would have been had the pandemic never happened meanwhile that state and all the others face unanticipated spending costs in areas such as unemployment benefits health care school safety and vaccine distribution states face an additional problem they may have entered 2020 with record reserves but those have been in many cases depleted although not entirely drained if you look at budget actions taken to close out 2020 budgets a lot of them were one time solutions delaying the reckoning says tracy gordon a senior fellow at the urban brookings joint tax policy center that s the logic of recessions you do the easy things first with one time solutions then have to get down to business in the next year of the crisis while everyone s attention was understandably focused on covid last year the impact of climate change continues to be felt across the country and around the world exacerbated by exceptionally hot dry weather some 10 million acres were lost to wildfires in the west displacing thousands and creating a toxic cloud that hung over several states for weeks a record breaking number of named hurricanes and storms battered the east and gulf coasts including laura which killed dozens and caused billions of dollars worth of damage to louisiana including 1 6 billion in losses to the state s agriculture sector extreme weather events from 2017 through 2019 cost the country over 460 billion in damages storms are expected to increase in frequency and intensity as temperatures continue to rise rising sea levels are already encroaching on a number of atlantic and gulf coast cities the federal government s diminished response to climate change over the last four years has left a leadership void that a number of cities and states have attempted to fill after president trump pulled the u s out of the paris agreement in 2017 a coalition of 25 governors mostly democrats formed the u s climate alliance committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the paris goals at the local level 470 u s climate mayors have banded together with the same intention it is difficult though for local jurisdictions to be as effective as efforts taken at the federal level a recent report by the brookings institution determined that less than half of the country s 100 largest cities are currently addressing emissions reductions in total their cutback targets equal only about seven percent of u s goals set forth in the original paris agreement another 22 large cities have committed to reducing emissions but have yet to set targets los angeles has seen the greatest decrease in emissions followed by san francisco tucson experienced the largest increase in emissions mostly due to that city s rapid growth but there is only so much that cities can do since they have little control over many of the factors that contribute to the problem transportation being one example last april virginia joined nearly a dozen other states with a legislative commitment to a 100 percent clean energy future but just like cities there are limits to what states can do budgets must be balanced at a time when cash strapped states will be looking for ways to cut spending thanks to the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic help may come at the federal level the most significant climate change legislation in a decade arrived as part of the covid 19 relief bill passed by congress in december the bill includes billions for research and development of clean renewable energy plus continued tax credits for existing technologies a key component of joe biden s 2 trillion plan to achieve 100 percent clean energy by 2035 the new president s intention to update the country s energy infrastructure is a key component of his plan to revive the economy after covid change can t come soon enough for fans of winter fest in caro mich scheduled for february the annual outdoor event was canceled the past two years due to a lack of ice and snow this year organizers aren t waiting on the weather to decide if it will happen the 2021 event was recently canceled this time because of the coronavirus covid shields criminal justice election reform housing medicaid pensions policing race and racism redistricting transportation and infrastructure could businesses and health care providers already overwhelmed financially and operationally be crippled by lawsuits blaming them for covid injuries the concerns and exposure of these stakeholders has taken on a new urgency with the ongoing surge in cases and related deaths from the pandemic in september an insurance risk evaluator estimated that claims regarding the spread of workplace contagion to family members could cost businesses as much as 21 billion if the covid death toll reached 300 000 the covid 19 death count is now approaching 400 000 but a crushing wave of lawsuits has not materialized more than 7 000 cases are listed in a covid 19 complaint tracker from the law firm hunton andrews kurth less than 200 lawsuits relate to malpractice wrongful death and workplace exposure however more than 700 complaints focus on business closures stay at home orders public gathering bans and efforts by private parties to enforce government orders a ballotopedia database devoted entirely to cases protesting state actions and policies reflects the fallout from federal messaging that has undermined scientific bodies experts and advisors while politicizing public health best practices such as mask wearing and social distancing republicans hoped to include a liability shield in the recent 900 billion stimulus bill but the provision was cut ncsl s covid state legislation database includes more than 120 bills from 20 states that attempt to limit the liability of businesses health care providers and schools including manufacturers and distributors of ppe gross negligence or reckless misconduct void these shields massachusetts also excludes conduct with an intent to discriminate based on race ethnicity national origin religion disability sexual orientation or gender identity from protection the declaration of a national public health emergency meant that under the public readiness and emergency preparedness act prep health care professionals are shielded under both state and federal law in regard to the administration of covered countermeasures against covid 19 these can include vaccinations diagnostic tests and respiratory devices worker advocates worry that liability shields could cause employers to be less vigilant placing workers and customers at risk even if the actions of employers don t meet the gross negligence standard they object to any laws that might interfere with the ability of osha or similar state entities to establish safety protocols and enforce them schools pose a particular challenge relating to liability they operate in a complicated landscape pushed in every direction by government officials parents and teachers even though public schools may be protected if they are following public health guidance many districts are purchasing additional liability insurance says patrick lyons a policy specialist at the national conference of state legislators districts are asking even if we follow the best guidance now what if it turns out to not be right and we have a bunch of spread can we be held liable for standards that weren t yet developed he says it s not that schools expect to lose covid suits but that the legal fees alone could inflict serious damage louisiana and tennessee have enacted bills specifically to protect schools but there hasn t been a big push for more legislation aimed at protecting this sector we re not really sure until someone challenges this in court says lyons but most people don t think it would be easy to prove whether covid 19 transmission happened in the school or outside of the school understanding the coronavirus its long term effects and best practices for treatment and prevention is still evolving so far there are more lawsuits against government efforts to protect public health than claims of injury over the coming year it may become more obvious who needs to be protected there are over 2 million people behind bars in the united states representing a quarter of the world s prison population the vast majority of these are confined within state prisons putting a major strain on budgets the cost of food security health care and infrastructure can amount to as much as 70 000 a year per inmate after decades of spending increases and tough on crime policies prison populations have continued to grow and recidivism rates have remained high further straining state budgets in the last 20 years public officials and policymakers have been looking for ways to reduce the number of prisoners keep communities safe and lower associated costs last year saw a significant reduction in incarceration due more to covid than prison reforms the country s prison population has been hit hard by the pandemic at times dealing with a rate of death three times higher than the general population last spring over 100 000 inmates were released from state and federal prisons directly and indirectly because of the virus rhode island reduced its prison population by nearly a third connecticut north dakota west virginia and vermont populations are down by 15 percent court closures parole leniency and a halt to accepting new prisoners from county jails contributed to the declines the numbers are expected to rise again once the pandemic has been addressed several states last year enacted changes intended to keep people from entering the criminal justice system in the first place many ended the suspension of driver s licenses for failure to appear in court or for violations not related to unsafe driving a practice that can trap people in a cycle of jail time and mounting fines and fees driving without a license is the third most common reason for going to jail in michigan according to a task force convened by gov gretchen whitmer in 2019 a year when 365 965 michigan drivers had their license suspended at least ten states now have laws ending license suspension for unpaid fines and fees including virginia which had suspended nearly a million licenses before ending the practice in 2020 referendums on marijuana legalization and decriminalization passed in four states last year voters in arizona montana and new jersey approved recreational use as they did in south dakota where the governor is backing a legal challenge voters in oregon made that state the first to decriminalize possession of small amounts of cocaine heroin and methamphetamine locally voters also approved initiatives in san jose seattle pittsburgh philadelphia and portland ore designed to strengthen civilian oversight of police departments many proposals had been in the works for years but recently gained traction after a spring and summer of social unrest voters in columbus ohio approved a new police review board the first for that city regretting his past support for a 1994 crime bill that is widely seen as contributing to mass incarceration president elect joe biden now endorses an end to mandatory minimum prison sentences he has proposed a 20 billion grant program to fund state mental health and substance abuse programs in an effort to reduce prison populations already on alert to prevent a repeat of russia s interference in the 2016 presidential voting election officials in 2020 also faced the challenge of protecting voters during the biggest public health emergency in a century learning from missteps in primary elections they succeeded safely delivering an election with record turnout that intelligence officials proclaimed to be the most secure in american history there were scant moments of glory for them however amid attacks from the president conspiracy theorists extremist news outlets and foreign actors on the changes implemented to make voting safe and to ensure that citizens would not be disenfranchised rather than being praised many election officials received hate mail and even death threats a november politico poll following the announcement of joe biden s victory found that 70 percent of republicans did not believe the election was free and fair making accusations against mail in voting and ballot tampering a quinnipiac poll in december found that 77 percent of republicans believed there was widespread election fraud though 60 percent of all registered voters accept that biden s victory is legitimate despite the failure and outright dismissal of dozens of court cases purported to prove the election had been stolen this false narrative gained enough traction to inspire thousands of the president s supporters to storm the capitol on jan 6 with the hope of preventing the certification of electoral votes the president s role in fomenting this lawlessness at rallies via twitter from the white house and in person on the morning of the attacks has cost him the support of prominent republican allies as well as members of his cabinet but some party leaders at federal and state levels remain concerned that practices implemented in 2020 including no excuse and universal vote by mail and drop boxes are not in their best interests democratic victories in the senate runoff elections in georgia in january added to the dispute republicans there blame liberalized access to voting for these losses and plan to introduce legislation to eliminate no excuse absentee voting drop boxes and mailings of ballot applications the rhetoric that we ve seen in the wake of the election is going to add fuel to calls to limit the franchise in ways that are not necessary to actually make elections more secure things like limiting curbside voting limiting the use of drop boxes for absentee ballots or narrowing early voting periods says daniel i weiner of the brennan center s election reform program hundreds of bills relating to elections have been introduced in state legislatures since november including bills intended to use the lessons learned in 2020 to increase voter participation u s house speaker nancy pelosi has announced that democrats will lead their 2021 agenda with hr1 the for the people act which would establish uniform national standards for voter registration voting by mail early voting and election security hr1 would be transformative says weiner it s not going to codify all of the changes made to account for the pandemic but the changes it would make are tried and tested ways of making voting more accessible that are popular with both democrats and republicans the maxim housing is health care coined in the early years of the aids epidemic has never had more significance sheltering in place requires a place to shelter and homelessness was already on the increase before the economic shocks of the pandemic the daunting challenges of dealing with the health problems of more than 500 000 homeless americans have been compounded by the potential for tens of millions of evictions to swell their ranks in 2020 state legislators made efforts to stem an eviction crisis through dozens of bills suspending evictions and foreclosures funding for rental assistance was included in the cares act last spring researchers from ucla and johns hopkins who studied the impact of eviction moratoriums on death rates confirmed that such policies save lives mortality rates in 27 states that kept moratoriums in place were compared to those in 17 that lifted them after sixteen weeks death rates were more than five times greater in states that had ended renter protections the crisis is far from over a december 2020 survey by the census bureau found that 14 million adults 20 percent of renters and 25 percent of households with children are not caught up on their rent payments the share of black and multiracial households in this destabilizing situation approaches 30 percent the 900 billion covid 19 economic relief bill signed into law in december includes 25 billion in emergency rental assistance to be distributed to states and extends the cdc eviction moratorium through the end of january however a recent urban institute analysis points out that accumulated back rent alone which must be paid when moratoriums end may be as much as 34 billion it s time for policymakers to adopt the viewpoint that housing is a basic human need says steve berg of the national alliance to end homelessness there s no waiting list for the supplemental nutritional assistance program he says we don t set up schools for half the people and put everyone else on a waiting list everyone who is eligible gets medicaid during his campaign biden signaled an intention to invest 640 billion in housing providing support for renters and homeowners and addressing the inadequate supply of affordable housing the big question will be whether it s possible to get republicans on board with the idea that government has an obligation to help in addition to cementing the connection between housing and public health pandemic stresses have created opportunities a softening in the rental market means that government funds might stretch further and house more homeless vacated urban buildings could be reconfigured as affordable housing units making it possible for tenants to have easier access to jobs and services ever since the supreme court made medicaid expansion voluntary for states under the affordable care act there has been ongoing debate about whether or not to participate in 2014 when the law took effect 23 states immediately expanded medicaid eligibility over the years other states said yes to expansion after overcoming initial reluctance today there are still a dozen states that have neither adopted nor implemented medicaid expansion with the country in the midst of a massive public health emergency and economic crisis arguments for and against expansion are now set against a very different backdrop since the pandemic started millions of americans have lost their livelihoods and with that their health insurance putting strains on a health care system already stretched thin a recent study by the urban institute found states that expanded medicaid are able to cover 35 8 percent of unemployed adults in the states that chose not to expand only 16 4 percent of unemployed adults are eligible resulting in an uninsured rate of 42 5 percent double the rate in expansion states efforts to enlarge medicaid have been made in each of the holdout states but it seems unlikely any will approve expansion in the immediate future legislators in wyoming voted in support of a medicaid bill in committee over a year ago but it died on the first day of the 2020 legislative session the bill will be considered again when legislators meet this year in the meantime covid and a shrinking coal market are taking a toll on the state s economy causing an increase in unemployment claims the wyoming department of health estimates expansion would cost 154 million to cover 19 000 wyomingites in the first two years the state s share would be 18 million never enthusiastic about expansion gov mark gordon nevertheless told the casper star tribune that if the legislature passes a bill he will give it a fair hearing like their counterparts in wyoming the florida legislature has so far shown little interest in expanding medicaid with attempts by democrats having been consistently blocked by their republican colleagues the pandemic has spurred renewed efforts by health officials to reconsider but so far without success by not expanding florida is projected to forfeit 66 billion in medicaid funding from the feds according to a study by the robert wood johnson foundation and the urban institute more than any other state recalcitrant legislators and governors are not always able to thwart attempts to bolster medicaid maine utah nebraska idaho oklahoma and missouri have approved expansion through ballot initiatives florida on the other hand just passed a law intended to limit ballot initiatives spurred in part by the legislature s desire to thwart expansion the effects of the pandemic will be many and long lasting not the least of which is how we fund health care joe biden campaigned on improving the affordable care act reversing the previous administration s attempts to chip away at the program having failed to stop it altogether expansion dissenters in the dozen holdout states say they can t afford it proponents think they can t afford not to expand new jersey has long had one of the worst funded pension systems in the country last year the state made a record 4 7 billion pension payment that sounds pretty good until you realize that new jersey borrowed 4 5 billion from the feds the loan didn t go directly to pensions but money is fungible and clearly state lawmakers didn t come up with any new funds to cover pension obligations funding for state and local government pension plans is a perennial problem that hasn t gotten any better the performance of the stock market in recent months after its precipitous fall last february and march has helped ameliorate things a great deal what could have been a terrible year for pensions was a middling one instead still pension systems fell short of their growth targets altogether state and local pension funds are underfunded by more than 1 trillion after a decade long bull run in the market their solvency hasn t changed much says leonard gilroy senior managing director of the libertarian reason foundation s pension integrity project there s been a lost decade in pensions low interest rates have sent pension managers hunting for more lucrative and thus more volatile investments some states and a number of local entities not just cities but nursing home districts and the like have been exploring pension obligation bonds these allow states or localities to borrow large sums of money which can fill immediate funding holes issuers can come out ahead in the long run if they achieve market returns that are larger than the rate they re paying bondholders but pobs are risky they contributed to the insolvency of puerto rico s public employee pension system and the bankruptcies of detroit and stockton calif this is a tough year for dealing with pension finance budget pressures led state and local governments to shed 1 4 million jobs between february and november that has resulted in savings but also presents a problem to pension systems generally it s younger workers who are let go meaning there will be fewer people working and making payments to support those who are retiring after the last recession it took almost 10 years to regain all the jobs that were lost says dan white director of fiscal policy research with moody s analytics a financial research firm if it takes as long this time that sets you back almost a generation to get a new wave of workers paying into those systems there ll be even more mismatch between older employees taking out of the system and fewer younger paying in with states still navigating difficult fiscal straits it will be tempting for some to forego or reduce contributions to the pension system there s been less talk along those lines than some analysts feared with legislators having learned a hard lesson about skipping payments during the great recession that doesn t mean it hasn t happened in its budget passed last year for example colorado withheld a 225 million payment called for by a sweeping pension overhaul law enacted just two years earlier a one year suspension can be a blip two becomes an issue and three becomes a problem gilroy says given all the other demands that the pandemic and an uneven economy present the temptation to underfund pensions will remain a factor this year this is a huge long term problem says timothy little an analyst with s p global ratings that short term political problems are not going to allow addressing george floyd died on may 25 2020 his death along with other officer involved killings sparked a massive nationwide protest movement most legislatures have barely met since that time however the 2021 legislative sessions will be the first chance for many states to weigh in says adam gelb president of the council on criminal justice we expect that they will in a big way legislators are considering a wide range of approaches to address policing and complaints about brutality including bans or limits on chokeholds and no knock warrants many are thinking about limiting or ending qualified immunity a legal doctrine that generally shields law enforcement officers from civil liability for their actions it s possible that state attorneys general will either be allowed or mandated to investigate officer involved killings while the idea of giving civilians a greater say in terms of oversight and training standards is also on the table cities and states across the country have restricted the ability of police to use force in a way that s truly remarkable says deray mckesson co founder of campaign zero an umbrella group that advocates for policies to eliminate police violence but he adds it s a ceiling not a floor on new year s eve massachusetts gov charlie baker signed a sweeping bill that will among other things ban chokeholds racial profiling the use of tear gas during large demonstrations and no knock warrants when children or seniors are home it also creates a civilian led commission in charge of police officer standards and training as well as imposing other limits on use of force sponsors of the bill had to compromise to win baker s signature and intend this year to address qualified immunity and police use of military grade equipment while increasing availability of social service responses addressing these issues while race and policing are front burner issues is paramount says massachusetts sen sonia chang díaz george floyd s death and other cases helped create a tragic window of opportunity there s just a mountain of injustice out there that has been accumulating for 400 years she says we should have a sense of urgency at taking as big a bite out of that mountain as we can the protests of last summer however have largely faded away policing as an issue has been shunted from atop the national agenda by the election and its aftermath along with the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic also it s not as if support for changing the rules regarding the police has universal acceptance defund the police is a slogan that democrats from joe biden and barack obama on down believe hurt the party s chances in november law enforcement agencies and police unions are pushing back hard against attempts to regulate policing they re arguing that a bill just passed in illinois which would limit qualified immunity and cash bail and strip away collective bargaining rights could lead to mass retirements and the death of policing they are basically going to war with the police unions in illinois says retired police sgt betsy brantner smith spokesperson for the national police association a nonprofit that works to educate the public about policing legislators in some states will shy away from such confrontations mckesson predicts looking to chiefs and sheriffs to clean up their own acts rather than taking on major fights at the capitol other states will push for new policies on a piecemeal basis while some lawmakers believe that omnibus bills have the best chance of being signed into law no one strategy will get us there mckesson says he argues that state action is necessary because the number of police killings is rising fastest in suburban and rural areas rather than the major cities that typically draw media and policy attention there are 18 000 police departments across the country which have long had a fierce independent streak with not only state but federal lawmakers looking to change the ground rules for how they operate however law enforcement knows it faces greater political challenges this year than any in recent memory there is such significant pressure to act gelb says that state and federal governments are going to be wading into waters that have previously been reserved for local jurisdictions in 2020 waves of protests created global support for black lives matter which has been building since 2013 citizens called for police reform including an expanded look at how public funds could be used to create safe communities the covid 19 pandemic may have done even more to expose the impact of institutional and structural racism black and hispanic citizens who contract covid are being hospitalized about four times as often as white americans and are three times more likely to die even if they manage to avoid serious illness they face other life changing risks disparities in economic opportunity food security housing health care access and other social determinants of health are behind these outcomes recent research suggests that the stress of racism itself is shortening black lives the ferguson commission formed after the 2014 shooting of michael brown found that life expectancy in the st louis area varied as much as 40 years between suburban and inner city zip codes to date more than 170 jurisdictions have made declarations that racism is a public health crisis according to the american public health association apha this trend which began several years ago and accelerated in 2020 is expected to continue in the coming year health is a shared value regardless of political leaning says tia taylor williams who leads apha s racial equity work as director of its center for public health policy and center for school health and education these declarations are public and historic acknowledgment that racism is a major driver of public health outcomes she says they create a window for applying a racial justice and racial equity lens to decision making while some states have made efforts to turn racial change into legislative action local governments have taken the lead in addressing structural inequities that covid has laid bare says gordon goodwin director of the government alliance on race and equity they end up with the gnarliest problems with the fewest resources but they have to deal with them he says they can t just turn their eyes away local governments have tools such as gis mapping that can help pinpoint where risks to minority citizens are greatest and where programs and funding should be concentrated a health and equity report from louisville ky includes maps showing county by county death rates infant mortality life expectancy and other indicators jurisdictions are working to identify things that unintentionally contribute to racialized outcomes says goodwin these include fees and fines that the poor can t afford to pay even library fines which don t lead to more book returns can cut access to books and library based services such as blood testing for diabetes and afterschool programs divisive racial messaging from washington has played into the worst fears of citizens on the fringes says goodwin adding to their distrust of government it has also intensified the feelings of those who see social welfare programs as handouts healing and unity are in the air as national themes for 2021 if this change in tone inspires focused data driven policies progress toward equity may be possible possessing control of the legislature in at least 30 states republicans will dominate redistricting for the next decade at the congressional level they will be able to draw maps for 175 house seats up from 98 following the 2010 census while democrats will draw just 47 seats a slight decline from 51 seats back in 2011 thanks to partisan gerrymanders republicans are in good shape to continue their dominance of several legislatures where gop majorities have endured despite growing democratic vote totals the republican party will be able to secure a decade of power across the country austin chambers then the head of the republican state leadership committee said following november s elections in which democrats failed to flip a single chamber republicans have a green light to press their advantages as do democrats wherever they are in control in 2019 the supreme court ruled that federal courts have no role to play in determining whether maps are so one sidedly partisan as to be unconstitutional that does open the door for really blatant and outward partisan favoritism says yurij rudensky redistricting counsel at the brennan center for justice partisan gerrymandering can still be stopped by state courts in recent years state courts have ordered new congressional maps in north carolina and pennsylvania as well as new lines for the virginia house and the florida senate in all cases that meant help for democrats the prohibition against federal courts ruling on partisan gerrymandering has led to some fears that legislatures will engage in racial gerrymandering which can still be challenged while insisting they are acting out of permissible partisan self interest the supreme court made clear its continued opposition to racial gerrymandering over the past decade in cases involving alabama north carolina and virginia maps we now have better guidance for avoiding racial gerrymandering says jeff wice a democratic redistricting attorney legislatures have been put on notice not to pack more black and latino voters into districts than necessary although republicans clearly have the upper hand nationwide there are factors that complicate the picture in some states congressional and legislative maps in california will be drawn by a nominally independent commission so it looks like democrats will be able to dominate the process there conversely while gop legislators will run redistricting in florida state law mandates some measure of competitiveness commissions and other new redistricting systems are in place thanks to ballot initiatives enacted over the past decade in colorado michigan new york virginia and utah in ohio voters passed a measure in 2018 that requires maps drawn by legislatures to receive a three fifths vote including majority support from the minority party since 1980 iowa has run a process widely considered a model with districts drawn by nonpartisan staff barred from taking an incumbent s residence into account the legislature has to accept or reject these maps on up or down votes but can make changes if the first two versions are rejected gop legislative leaders have not ruled out making changes at the end of the process this time around no i m absolutely not going to make that commitment house speaker pat grassley said on jan 7 saying it was ludicrous to expect approval before any maps or census data are even available census data is nominally due to states by april 1 there have already been delays in releasing data as there have been throughout the census process due to the coronavirus pandemic that could create tight deadlines for new jersey and virginia which hold legislative elections in 2021 half the states face constitutional or statutory deadlines to complete redistricting this year the other major legal change during this cycle stems from the supreme court s 2013 decision in shelby county v holder which gutted parts of the federal voting rights act the law had required seven southern states as well as jurisdictions in four others to obtain preclearance from the federal justice department before making any changes in voting laws since the shelby decision the formerly monitored jurisdictions have imposed new voting and registration restrictions and closed hundreds of polling places this will be the first redistricting cycle where federal approval won t be required in those places it covered things like school boards and city councils and county commissions rudensky says the civil rights community just simply doesn t have the resources to police what is happening at every level of government when it comes to redistricting after nearly a year of lockdowns and stay at home orders the country s transportation system is slowly gearing up for a return to normal it remains to be seen however what normal will look like in 2021 covid has been especially harmful to mass transit which saw national ridership in april of last year fall to less than a fifth of what it was in 2019 according to the american public transportation association ridership rebounded over the summer to almost 40 percent of the 2019 level until the coronavirus surged again in the fall the reduced number of passengers and the resulting loss in fare revenue will make it difficult to provide pre pandemic levels of service anytime soon depending on the locality fares can provide up to half of a system s income adding further strain to budgets lower sales and income taxes threaten operating subsidies provided by state and local governments that are grappling with budget shortfalls of their own according to a recent brookings institution report state and local government revenues will continue to fall declining 167 billion in 2021 and 145 billion in 2022 the new york city transit authority the country s largest is facing a 6 billion deficit the bay area rapid transit system in california reports a nearly 90 percent drop in riders since last summer compared to pre pandemic levels with lost fares totaling 500 000 a day as systems cut routes and schedules riders may be less likely to return making it even more difficult to restore service an expected federal focus on infrastructure never materialized over the past few years passing ever increasing responsibility to state and local governments according to the center on budget and policy priorities even before covid state and local spending on schools water treatment plants highways and bridges was at a 30 year low infrastructure spending as a share of gdp in the vast majority of states is down significantly a recent survey by the national league of cities found that 64 percent of cities have already cancelled or delayed capital expenditures and infrastructure projects every four years the american society of civil engineers issues a report card on the condition of infrastructure in the states all state roads bridges rail infrastructure and waterways are graded along with wastewater facilities energy sources and dams capacity funding and resilience are all considered america s cumulative grade in 2017 was a d the same as it had been four years earlier given the general lack of attention paid to infrastructure since then it is doubtful that the next report due this year will show much progress presidents run on promises and joe biden is no exception the new administration hopes to put the country on a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 to achieve that goal the new president plans to create millions of good union jobs building and upgrading a cleaner safer stronger infrastructure including smart roads water systems municipal transit networks schools airports rail ferries ports and universal broadband access for all americans whether they live in rural or urban areas some help is on the way in the form of the covid 19 relief bill signed into law in late december the package includes 2 billion for airports 10 billion for highways and 14 billion for mass transit

listen to this article listen to this article editor s note business content from the new york times will now be included with your subscription to finance commerce not a subscriber start your subscription here when the pandemic hit irene zhu decided to explore switching careers from tourism to finance a lifelong math whiz zhu 37 set her sights on becoming a chartered financial analyst a highly coveted professional qualification in the investing world but to do so she would need to pass three notoriously difficult tests the first of which she sat for in february after staying up well past 1 a m on many nights studying she failed i have to say it was pretty messy zhu said in a video chronicling her experience what made the cfa exam really challenging for me is the time and effort that i needed to put in she said the process of earning a cfa after one s name has always been grueling candidates are expected to master 3 000 pages of material and demonstrate their ability to analyze companies financial statements forecast investment profits and manage conflicts of interest alongside a vast swath of concepts and scenarios the pandemic made that slog harder zhu based in melbourne australia was among roughly 140 000 people who sat for one of the three qualifying exams required for a cfa this year only 35 passed of those who took their first exam in the most recent round in july the pass rate was 22 the lowest on record since the nonprofit cfa institute began administering the tests in 1963 on average fewer than half of cfa test takers across all levels pass the record lows revived a long standing debate among finance industry veterans how useful is the credential for success on wall street and how does it compare to the industry s most popular graduate degree the mba or master of business administration those questions mba vs cfa vs nothing at all pop up periodically in the industry but this time around they carry more urgency especially with registrations for the cfa program down from their 2019 peak in the midst of the pandemic wall street s biggest firms have also been forced to rethink some of the rites of passage that have long gone unquestioned like long hours at the mercy of bosses or buttoned up attire cfa candidates whose exams were canceled or postponed because of lockdowns and hardships during the pandemic had poorer results the institute said after auditing data from the last two rounds of subpar scores although the tests are typically offered twice a year they were offered several times this year because of the pandemic people have had in many cases their lives upturned we know they re working from home virtually there s a fatigue setting in said margaret franklin the chief executive of the cfa institute which is based in charlottesville virginia there s kind of the optimal study conditions and then there s the reality of covid she said many of today s top financial managers hold cfa credentials including marty flanagan the chief executive of invesco which manages 1 5 trillion and heather brilliant chief executive of diamond hill capital management other top leaders in the asset management business including the blackrock chief laurence d fink do not howard marks the billionaire investor and co chairman of oaktree capital management a fund that specializes in distressed debt holds both a cfa title and an mba degree a firm supporter of the cfa program marks said the title was valuable because it was the closest thing the money management business had to an industry qualification the cfa doesn t tell anybody whether so and so is a good investor it only goes to the question of academic preparation but it s clearly a plus marks said you can take an mba and not have any investment courses so an mba is clearly not sufficient he added a recent round of poor results prompted jared dillian the author of an investing newsletter to write an essay last month with a pointed headline wall street s cfa program is a colossal waste of time dillian was blasted by cfas who were quick to defend the merits of their hard won credential but he said he also received many private messages that concurred with his assessment early in his career dillian passed the first level cfa exam but later failed the second level he considers his mba from the university of san francisco more valuable because it enabled him to network and learn from business leaders while at school it s better than sitting at your desk at home banging your head against the wall memorizing formulas dillian said the cfa institute first offered exams in the 1960s as a way to set professional standards for financial analysts who manage investments for clients during that decade an average of 1 500 people took the tests each year of those 73 to 94 passed over time the cfa curriculum came to be seen as foundational knowledge for analysts and portfolio managers who were willing to plow through the material to gain an edge but as the designation became more popular pass rates dropped the number of candidates peaked above 270 000 in 2019 and an average of 44 2 passed while exam registrations are down from their 2019 peak exacerbated by the pandemic roughly 1 7 million people remain enrolled in the program of which 236 000 people are booked for coming tests each exam clocks in at 4 1 2 hours registration exams and materials cost about 3 000 far cheaper than the average cost of an mba program holders of the cfa designation have to pay annual membership fees to keep their titles it s a great certification to have but given the time and demands to obtain it it does make sense to plan appropriately said paul sorbera president of the wall street executive search firm alliance consulting advanced qualifications can lift an employee s earning power but higher compensation isn t guaranteed sorbera said michael lin a 28 year old amateur boxer who received the cfa designation in august after passing all his exams on the first try compared the effort to training for an athletic tournament lin who was working at wells fargo s wealth management division at the time started by studying several hours a day outside of work then added weekends and took one to two weeks off before each exam to study full time the pandemic lockdown allowed lin to hunker down and hit the books unlike some of his colleagues and friends who had bigger disruptions mentality is a huge part of it said lin while a cfa is highly specialized for money managers and analysts it is also a solid credential that is much more cost effective than a master s he said now that he is a chartered financial analyst i definitely don t want to drop a couple hundred grand for an mba lin said florian campuzan an independent stock trader in versailles france was not as lucky campuzan is pursuing a cfa in hopes that the knowledge and prestige gained from the credential will bolster his consulting jobs such as advising companies about their commodity hedging but he fell short on his final exam because busy equity markets took up more of his time in the first quarter campuzan appeared to take the news in good humor posting on twitter failed cfa level 3 with a thumbs up emoji in an interview later he was more philosophical trading is the school of hard knocks and it teaches you to be humble it teaches you to be a hard working person and it teaches you to accept failure as a part of the journey campuzan said this time i failed but next time i will succeed zhu who took her first cfa test in february hoping to switch careers was discouraged whoever wants to take the cfa really needs the mental and physical time to be dedicated to the exam she said toward the end of the six month period she had allocated to herself to prep for the exam with two children at home and a husband also working remotely during the pandemic zhu said she felt that she was running out of time after learning that she hadn t passed zhu decided pursuing the cfa wasn t worthwhile i was a little bit disappointed but then again even if i passed level one it seems to be a long journey to pass level two and level three and the charter instead she plans to build a career in finance partly by making youtube videos where she shares her insights on investing this article originally appeared in the new york

if you ve bought a home you know the life milestone that can be well some realtors have a new prospect for you it s rare and it s definitely unusual but no matter where you live there s probably an option not too far away all these signs are original said christa swartz of fathom realty pointing to old signs for dr pepper and vicks vaporub hanging from a wall this time swartz doesn t have the usual job of giving the key to just one property she s got so much more than that cut out for her we re selling an entire town she smiled i have been a realtor for 14 years and i have never met another realtor who has sold a whole town water valley tennessee comes with seven acres four general stores from before 1900 a stock barn and a little creek it also comes with the little things that make its story the hole in a wall that was once a store s mail slot the chipped away part of the sidewalk where a man used to sit and tap his cane this particular area became famous for the apple orchards that were all through this back in the 1800s said swartz it was thriving so much the railroad came through here swartz said in the 1930s and 40s a bustling time for water valley no one would have guessed the porches would one day be so quiet cedar trees were introduced to the area she said they carried a blight with them that killed off the apple trees and soon after the railroad stopped running through that s the end of probably a lot of little towns across america people moved on water valley became one of several towns in america waiting for its next chapter while on sale so how much do you pay for a town bridgeville california is on the market for 1 5 million you can have henry river mill village in north carolina for 1 4 million then there s cleator arizona for one buck under a 1 million the price for water valley is even lower than all of those coming in at 725 000 and yes towns go for lower than that you can own the 6 acre swett south dakota for 250 000 well below the average cost of a condo in the case of water valley the sale would be going to the four people who have owned the town for the past 20 years and they do have specific buyers in mind they want buyers not bothered by the occasional cow in the road the people who own it do not want to sell it to people who will just raze these and create a development said swartz instead swartz said the idea is to perhaps model it after the nearby leiper s fork a little picket fence oasis in the middle of farmland maybe with antiques homemade ice cream and a wedding venue swartz said the offers are already coming in but just like any other town for sale it s about what buyer s cut out to end up with that key it is very special selling a town she said this is a story this is america s history and i want to drink deeply while i ve got this little period of time i get to be part of the story

via reddit preface as much as this is not a conspiracy folks who are ignorant to the workings of the financial system will think it is a conspiracy hence why i posted it here we live in clown world so most people will see that this goes against the media narrative so they will discount it without looking into the merits evidence of the argument ignorance is a choice i choose to post this here because of the optics of it as well as the fact that r conspiracy is one of the last bastions of free speech on reddit well there is no perfect way to say this so here it is we re f cked our economy is f cked and there is no way out except to let it burn to the ground they have to let it burn to the ground how do i know this they ve done it before march 2020 the stock market starts to crash they say that it s because of covid but it never was we never fixed the problems of leverage that caused the 2008 crash quoting from the beginning of this article below thephilosophicalsalon com a self fulfilling prophecy systemic collapse and pandemic simulation in pre covid times the world economy was on the verge of another colossal meltdown here is a brief chronicle of how the pressure was building up june 2019 in its annual economic report the swiss based bank of international settlements bis the central bank of all central banks sets the international alarm bells ringing the document highlights overheating in the leveraged loan market where credit standards have been deteriorating and collateralized loan obligations clos have surged reminiscent of the steep rise in collateralized debt obligations that amplified the subprime crisis simply stated the belly of the financial industry is once again full of junk 9 august 2019 the bis issues a working paper calling for unconventional monetary policy measures to insulate the real economy from further deterioration in financial conditions the paper indicates that by offering direct credit to the economy during a crisis central bank lending can replace commercial banks in providing loans to firms 15 august 2019 blackrock inc the world s most powerful investment fund managing around 7 trillion in stock and bond funds issues a white paper titled dealing with the next downturn essentially the paper instructs the us federal reserve to inject liquidity directly into the financial system to prevent a dramatic downturn again the message is unequivocal an unprecedented response is needed when monetary policy is exhausted and fiscal policy alone is not enough that response will likely involve going direct finding ways to get central bank money directly in the hands of public and private sector spenders while avoiding hyperinflation examples include the weimar republic in the 1920s as well as argentina and zimbabwe more recently 22 24 august 2019 g7 central bankers meet in jackson hole wyoming to discuss blackrock s paper along with urgent measures to prevent the looming meltdown in the prescient words of james bullard president of the st louis federal reserve we just have to stop thinking that next year things are going to be normal 15 16 september 2019 the downturn is officially inaugurated by a sudden spike in the repo rates from 2 to 10 5 repo is shorthand for repurchase agreement a contract where investment funds lend money against collateral assets normally treasury securities at the time of the exchange financial operators banks undertake to buy back the assets at a higher price typically overnight in brief repos are short term collateralized loans they are the main source of funding for

please subscribe and donate to support us 17 september 2019 the fed begins the emergency monetary programme pumping hundreds of billions of dollars per week into wall street effectively executing blackrock s going direct plan unsurprisingly in march 2020 the fed will hire blackrock to manage the bailout package in response to the covid 19 crisis just like in 2008 we kicked the can and blamed covid however in 2008 kicking the can involved turning on the money printer and now it is stuck in the on position as of this writing if we do not change anything we are doing the money printing will no longer outpace inflation as of march 2022 our legislators on this current episode of the dog and pony show are having a very public temper tantrum about raising or suspending the debt ceiling here s the rub we are heading towards economic collapse due to money printing fiscal policy over leverage etc if we don t raise the debt ceiling we risk economic collapse so either way we are going to have an economic collapse put yourself in the mindset of someone in the position of power you ve been a career politician for the last 40 years of your life you ve passed laws that have benefited your campaign donors you ve capitulated the minimum necessary to the general population as to prevent a common folk revolt now your chickens have come home to roost your sins against the american dream must be atoned for so now you sit here with a three pronged choice stop the money printing that is leading to inflation powell has said that its not the time to start tapering let it all collapse organically the issue with this is that the crimes of the wealthy will be on full display for everyone to see use your best scapegoat for the collapse the debt ceiling fight i believe that using a scapegoat is the most obvious and easiest way out of this mess no one expects a default which is exactly why it s time for us to default on our obligations and start to unwind this whole clusterfuck of global debt after all the model of scapegoating works the most recent test of it being march 2020 idk what comes next but i know that my investments should make me enough money to disappear if needed there is a lot of pain coming to a lot of people and i take zero pleasure in that no matter how much money i m about to make help who you can if you have the means and take care of those you love if you make money off of this coming collapse tell no one p s someone ironed the wrinkles in my brain so in conclusion this is not financial advice edit i m not giving financial advice no matter how many folks ask i super appreciate all the engagement and comments but i m in no position to give financial advice to anyone i m just someone who sees a fuse lit and traveling towards a massive pile of dynamite the economy so i m warning as many people as i can i do not have any solutions to the woes that are about to plague the vast majority of folks i wish everyone the best but again not giving any financial advice

by deena beasley and carl o donnell reuters an experimental antiviral pill developed by merck co could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe covid 19 according to data that experts hailed as a potential breakthrough in how the virus is treated if it gets authorization molnupiravir which is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus would be the first oral antiviral medication for covid 19 merck and partner ridgeback biotherapeutics said they plan to seek u s emergency use authorization for the pill as soon as possible and to make regulatory applications worldwide an oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game changing said amesh adalja senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security current treatment options include gilead sciences inc nasdaq s infused antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone both of which are generally only given once a patient has already been hospitalized this is going to change the dialogue around how to manage covid 19 merck chief executive robert davis told reuters existing treatments are cumbersome and logistically challenging to administer a simple oral pill would be the opposite of that adalja added the results from the phase iii trial which sent merck shares up more than 9 were so strong that the study is being stopped early at the recommendation of outside monitors shares of atea pharmaceuticals inc which is developing a similar covid 19 treatment were up more than 21 on the news shares of covid 19 vaccine makers moderna nasdaq inc were off more than 10 while pfizer nyse was down less than 1 jefferies nyse analyst michael yee said investors believe people will be less afraid of covid and less inclined to get vaccines if there is a simple pill that can treat covid pfizer and swiss drugmaker roche holding ag otc are also racing to develop an easy to administer antiviral pill for covid 19 for now only antibody cocktails that have to be given intravenously are approved for non hospitalized patients white house covid 19 response coordinator jeff zients said on friday that molnupiravir is a potential additional tool to protect people from the worst outcomes of covid but added that vaccination remains far and away our best tool against covid 19 a planned interim analysis of 775 patients in merck s study looked at hospitalizations or deaths among people at risk for severe disease it found that 7 3 of those given molnupiravir twice a day for five days were hospitalized and none had died by 29 days after treatment that compared with a hospitalization rate of 14 1 for placebo patients there were also eight deaths in the placebo group antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with covid 19 out of the hospital are critically needed wendy holman ridgeback s ceo said in a statement a huge advance scientists welcomed the potential new treatment to help prevent serious illness from the virus which has killed almost 5 million people around the world 700 000 of them in the united states a safe affordable and effective oral antiviral would be a huge advance in the fight against covid said peter horby a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the university of oxford the study enrolled patients with laboratory confirmed mild to moderate covid 19 who had symptoms for no more than five days all patients had at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome such as obesity or older age drugs in the same class as molnupiravir have been linked to birth defects in animal studies merck has said similar studies of molnupiravir for longer and at higher doses than used in humans indicate that the drug does not affect mammalian dna merck said viral sequencing done so far shows molnupiravir is effective against all variants of the coronavirus including the highly transmissible delta which has driven the recent worldwide surge in hospitalizations and deaths it said rates of adverse events were similar for both molnupiravir and placebo patients but did not give details merck has said data shows molnupiravir is not capable of inducing genetic changes in human cells but men enrolled in its trials had to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or agree to use contraception women of child bearing age in the study could be pregnant and also had to use birth control the u s drugmaker said it expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021 the company has a u s government contract to supply 1 7 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of 700 per course davis said merck has similar agreements with other governments and is in talks with more merck said it plans a tiered pricing approach based on country income criteria the u s government has the option to purchase up to an additional 3 5 million treatment courses if needed a u s health official told reuters the official asked to

ld in what way lf lubalin loved working on u lc the magazine he started what made him so happy about working on it is that he wrote most of it headlines and text so he really had control over the whole look of it which is great when you re a typographer who s so specific about things fitting so well so the auteur kind of approach was something i was exposed to early ld you left after a couple of years to gain a different kind of experience lf i just sort of walked into the job at pantheon which had a very impressive roster of authors all european but you couldn t appreciate that because the covers were so dull so i had carte blanche after the first book list that i did the editors were so happy that they finally had somebody who was trying to make the books look good that gave me more creative control it was a great opportunity for me to develop my design voice there because i got to experiment with a different period of type history on a daily basis which was wonderful ld it seems to me that with each new area of work you do you think well how can i shake things up lf yes while i was with pantheon i did my first wine label it was just a fluke an upstate winery needed an identity and labels for wine and champagne i looked at what was going on and thought why does it have to look like this why can t i take the elements that are used for this very tired formula that everybody thinks they have to follow for champagne labels which is using gold or silver metallic and script type but no white space so i thought well i can use metallic colours but they don t have to be traditional gold and silver i can use a script but it can be a graceful upright script and how about a little white space for a change so that s where it started ld what was it like to set up your studio in 1989 lf in those days because there was no google people had to find you so you couldn t get too creative with the name of your studio i knew i had to name it after myself although that might be a liability i could have called myself like fili associates to make it look like i was bigger and more important or i could ve come up with a cute name but people were going to have to try to find me in the phone book and so i just named it after myself which i knew would be a problem for some people i really wanted to send a message which was this if you have a problem with my being female then i don t want you as a client i think there were lots of people who haven t called because of that it s less of an issue now but some people do come here and say oh you re so small ld isn t that the point lf yes i like it that way and then you ll have a personal contact with me and i won t just pass you over to a junior designer ld do you have some idea of how many people you have inspired to do the same thing lf that s the other thing when i was in college and i was first starting out in business there were no female role models paula scher was about the first one but she s only a couple of years older than me you really had to look hard there was cipe pineles actually she was very good friends with the people who owned that first small ad agency i worked at and william golden had done their logo ld there s cipe but where are all these other women what happened lf i d love to hear about your process if there is even such a thing because you often seem to put yourself in the context of the work well the first thing i do when a client contacts me is play twenty questions especially if it s a restaurant most of them are not used to dealing with designers or having to articulate what the restaurant is about so i ask them lots and lots of questions whatever they can tell me to help me get a handle on who they are it s in the walkthrough and being able to talk about colour texture or architectural details because really all i need to make the logo work is one tiny little element to latch on to that s why i tend to not do any restaurants out of town i really have to be there

it was almost exactly two years ago that a special purpose acquisition vehicle spac spearheaded by investor chamath palihapitiya took public the space tourism company virgin galactic it was the first human spaceflight company to trade on the nyse or any exchange for that matter and it was so successful with the company s shares trading higher and higher for so many months afterward that it almost immediately kicked off the spac frenzy consider that in the first three months of this year alone spacs raised 87 9 billion exceeding the total issuance in all of 2020 according to data from spac research so far according to spac insider 450 blank check companies have been successfully formed compared with 15 just 10 years ago palihapitiya has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the craze called the pied piper of spacs by the new yorker and the king of spacs by bloomberg he has formed at least 10 blank check companies and publicly shared plans to raise many more on the all in podcast that he co hosts palihapitiya last year revealed he had reserved the symbols from ipoa to ipoz on the nyse of course whenever market activity grows too feverish retail investors get bruised indeed after a number of companies taken public via blank check companies were discovered to have fudged some of their numbers in june for example lordstown motors admitted it did not have binding orders from customers for its electric endurance pickup truck after all fears have grown that spacs don t feature enough disclosures and that they mostly benefit the people organizing them like palihapitiya who joined us last week to talk about that concern and others excerpts from that beginning of that conversation held during techcrunch disrupt have been edited lightly for length you can also catch the full conversation below tc when you successfully helped take virgin galactic public in the fall of 2019 did you foresee what would happen did the market play out in a way that you had anticipated cp to be completely honest i didn t anticipate that there would be this much activity but it somewhat makes sense because i think whenever there is any innovation of any kind you sort of tend to see this euphoric fervor the first phase of something is just all these people getting extremely excited and then you have what people somewhat say is a valley of disillusionment and then you have a long term business that has happened in everything that we know today whether it s internet search or social media the boon with crypto i think spacs are following very much the same trajectory the big important takeaway is that it s a really important tool in the hands of the right people it s so interesting considering the world of companies that you could have chosen that you chose a company that had never sent a space tourist into space had lost a lot of money and was tied to the deaths of a few people because of a rocket explosion why this company let me just clean up some of this history when there was that unfortunate death it was a pilot error when that business was run in part through a third party contractor and it was at that moment and that was many many many years ago that richard branson decided to vertically integrate the business and take complete responsibility not dissimilar to what bezos does or what elon does at spacex so fast forward some number of years and it was a business that had a handful of successful test flights with internal passengers and it had basically validated that it was ready to commercialize the problem was that it needed a large amount of money to do that and the capital markets don t really support that type of activity they don t understand necessarily how to do it now the interesting thing about a spac is that it actually allows you to raise a really large amount of money to go to a broad base of institutional investors and it allows you to tell them what you think the future can look like and why that s very important is when you re talking about that much money i think we raised about a billion dollars for the business investors were able to get under the hood do an enormous amount of their own diligence and underwrite something that s why this company has been successful because people were able to see the technical diligence they were able to build their own models they were able to interact with the company to understand what the financial forecast could look like and then come to their own conclusion the typical ipo doesn t allow you to do that right you can only talk about the past and i think there are many technology entrepreneurs who would say my past is not nearly as good a reflection of the future as i could tell you if you actually ask and so the ipo you re not allowed to talk about the future that doesn t mean you should exaggerate doesn t mean you should lie it just means that you have to have a very thoughtful way of telling the story i think the big concern with spacs is there s a lot of pixie dust if you look at social media there was facebook and then there a bunch of other crappy social networks that went out of business i think spac sponsorship will look the same way i think there will be a handful of groups that prove consistently through their actions that they are doing a great job for investors for disclosure for regulators for these companies check out the video above to hear more about why palihapitiya advocates getting rid of warrants as they relate to spac deals what he thinks of hindenberg research a short seller that published a damning report about one of palihapitiya s deals earlier this year and why he thinks the rich fees that some spac sponsors collect upset industry watchers

a recovery from the record breaking spike in covid 19 cases has been pushed from halloween to christmas according to an oregon health science university forecast released thursday longer hospital stays for those with severe infections from the delta variant and signs of public weariness with pandemic safeguards have delayed the expected pace of a rebound the premature dropping of mask wearing and limits on socializing along with a return to tepid rates of vaccination could slow the rebound further we re in a moment right now where we re going to see what happens as fatigue sets in said peter graven lead data scientist on the ohsu forecast in mid august ohsu accurately predicted that a sharply rising spike in cases from 200 hospitalizations per day in early july would top out at nearly 1 200 by early september but the forecast that the numbers would drop at roughly the same rate as they rose proved overly optimistic the earlier forecast showed daily covid 19 hospitalizations dipping below 200 by the end of october the data at the time showed the numbers falling under 100 by the time the holiday season kicked off with thanksgiving at the end of november in the forecast released on thursday pre spike hospitalization levels won t be reached until the last half of december case levels will remain elevated throughout the holiday season with 600 hospitalizations per day forecast on nov 1 rates below 50 cases per day wouldn t be realized until mid march 2022 ohsu researchers underline that each forecast is just that a model based on data each week s forecast includes a graph overlaying prior forecasts graven said the model was at a tipping point driven by both the resilience of the virus and weariness of the population oregon is wobbling in a fright and fatigue cycle in the pandemic when the delta variant skyrocketed in july many parts of the state returned to masking and limiting contacts the slow growth in immunization rates started to increase in july and august even in counties where vaccine hesitancy or resistance was widespread ohsu said that breakthrough cases of infection in people who had been vaccinated has risen to 20 of new cases but the worst outcomes have remained steady with stark differences for the vaccinated and those who are not ohsu said unvaccinated people accounted for 95 5 of severe cases and over 99 of deaths those numbers hold up as september s 498 covid 19 deaths statewide make it the second most deadly month in the 19 month pandemic while hospitalizations have taken a steep dive it is from the highest point in the covid 19 crisis if this forecast holds up it will take over a month just to get below the peak of the 584 hospitalizations a day during last winter s surge the ohsu forecast this week pointed to some troubling areas estimated mask usage dropped from 84 to 81 based on an analysis of social media traffic people are becoming more active and getting together in larger groups with the colder weather starting to take hold researchers worry that will drive activity indoors where the virus can spread more rapidly vaccinations have also slowed their pace of growth a quarter of all adult oregonians just under 1 million people remain unvaccinated more than nine months after covid 19 vaccines first became available the state is seeing a drop in infections and hospitalizations overall but parts of eastern oregon are seeing an increase in infections which some local health authorities have tied to outbreaks from the pendleton round up in mid september an exception to the drop in hospitalizations is region 7 which includes deschutes crook jefferson grant harney klamath lake and wheeler counties after showing a decline along with the rest of the state hospitalizations this week edged upward in region 7 while declines continued in other regions part of the region has some of the lowest rates of vaccination in the state lake has the second lowest percentage of eligible adults who have been vaccinated 41 7 as of thursday according to oregon health authority reports grant is one of the four counties in the state where less than half of eligible adults have been vaccinated it s currently at 47 1 harney at 50 3 just crossed the threshold this week nine months after vaccines first became publicly available after seeing two consecutive weeks of a decline in cases grant county quadrupled in cases from 30 to 116 between the weeks ending sept 15 and sept 22 the latest data available the case rate per 100 000 people a way to measure the level of infection between areas with different population sizes was 1 596 the percentage of tests that were positive tripled from 5 to 14 6 the highest infection rate in the state is in harney county where one out of every four tests was positive harney s infection rates have remained high for the past month and the most recent survey showed it with a state leading 1 675 8 cases per 100 000 people deschutes county has the fifth highest vaccination rate in the state at 77 of eligible adults jefferson is at 62 while crook is 58 the positive infection rates continue to be high in all three according to the oha s most recent county covid 19 community transmission report crook is at 15 1 jefferson at 12 1 deschutes at 10 8 the statewide average is 8 9 and oha has said throughout the pandemic that any positive test rate above 5 allows for significant growth in cases the statewide impact of the pendleton round up outbreak that began last month is still not completely known state officials said this week while many of the eastern oregon counties have low populations they can be a harbinger of new statewide spikes because of the large percentage of unvaccinated residents that s what happened with the whiskeyfest outbreak in july with infection rates at a low point in early summer and the statewide adult vaccination level near 70 gov kate brown on june 30 lifted most restrictions on businesses and events across the state the move came despite wildly different levels of vaccination and infection among the 32 counties at a time when the highly contagious delta variant had swept across the country and into oregon the whiskeyfest an outdoor country music event on july 16 attracted up to 12 000 people to umatilla county the county s vaccination rate was under 50 at the time it s now 51 5 an outbreak of cases after the whiskeyfest swamped hospitals in eastern oregon and spread to the rest of the state each rise in infections targets the most vulnerable those who have neither vaccination or exposure oshu puts out an immunity index which combines the number of people vaccinated exposed to the virus or both some level of immunity occurs when a person is infected with covid 19 and is asymptomatic has more mild symptoms or has severe illness but survives of the 4 24 million oregonians of all ages ohsu currently estimates that 44 of the population is vaccinated 23 have been infected at some point and 11 have been vaccinated and infected that leaves 23 of the population as unvaccinated and uninfected these susceptible residents are the ones that the delta variant will continue to hit the hardest

even before california declared its goal in 2018 to reach carbon neutrality by 2045 cities and counties throughout the state brainstormed plans to reach net zero carbon emissions on a local level many have responded by creating climate action plans which are strategies to reduce greenhouse gases and eventually achieve net zero carbon emissions otherwise known as carbon neutrality in sacramento county government officials aspire to an even more ambitious goal 2030 the final draft of sacramento county s community wide climate action plan cap which officials say is a first step toward this goal has been in the works since 2016 but it hasn t been an easy road the plan has often faced criticism from local environmental groups who fear that it doesn t push hard enough for reduced emissions now after years of process and conversation it s close to approval and open for public comment john lundgren a senior planner with the county said that publishing the plan is the first step toward the 2030 goal subsequent updates to the plan will be the second step in a process that will definitely lock us down and meet that 2030 carbon neutrality goal it demonstrates that we meet the state targets currently and then it sets a pathway where we re going to be updating the cap over time lundgren said todd smith the county s principal planner said that the first step came in 2011 when sacramento county committed to completing a cap during the course of general plan updates it was then that the county adopted an overall framework for their approach joining dozens of other local governments in california to do so in 2012 a cap was adopted for government operations more specifically that meant looking at how the county could reduce emissions internally like in government buildings and county owned vehicles now the county is considering the final phase of its cap and looking at county wide emissions it combines the first two efforts into one comprehensive document smith said he described the step as adding layers on the community wide emission approach on top of the work that s been done in previous phases lundgren said that the county aims to have final approval by early 2022 but that won t happen without criticism from local environmental groups getting to 2030 critics of the plan argue that it doesn t push for greenhouse gas reductions hard enough there are always differences of opinion about what the worst thing is and how environmentalists should respond to it said oscar balaguer co chair of local environmental advocacy group 350 sacramento s cap team but everyone agrees it s an inadequate plan that will not achieve significant greenhouse gas reductions chris brown coordinator of the sacramento climate coalition echoed these concerns many of our comments are this document is not going to be enough brown said the county has to really commit to a climate emergency plan and to do more than the state basically requires them to while sacramento county s cap does not currently commit to carbon neutrality by 2030 lundgren said that will change in subsequent updates he said that they plan on adding more detail that will eventually ensure that they reach carbon neutrality in the next 8 years he added that regular reports back to the county s board of supervisors among other measures will hold their feet to the fire in keeping these commitments the plan puts special emphasis on reducing emissions in transportation which lundgren said accounts for about 34 of emissions produced in the county priority would also go toward existing building stock which he said account for about 33 of emissions in the county certain measures articulated in the plan like building out infrastructure for electric vehicles or providing aid to residents by offering electric alternatives to gas reliant home appliances could help in addressing these problem areas the existing building and the transportation sector are really key to addressing climate change at the local level smith said supriya patel founder of fridays for the future sacramento said that she s doubtful of the county s assurance that it will provide sufficient updates later to reach the 2030 goal it s an issue patel has had with previous announcements touting this goal like the county s climate emergency declaration which she said has uplifted a 2030 goal without much backup as to how they will achieve the ambitious date something that kind of felt like it was just stuck in there to appease climate organizers patel said in reality she said they aren t actually making any substantial commitment by 2030 meanwhile balaguer said that electric vehicle infrastructure is important but won t address emissions from transportation happening right now he s worried that the county s current plans for housing developments on previously undeveloped land will encourage longer commutes long driving commutes are the largest source of our current greenhouse gas emissions he said and given the future plans that are in the works will be the largest source of growth in those emissions lundgren said that under the cap these housing developments would be subject to fines if they don t meet requirements laid out in the plan they would also see increased mitigation from the county in order to reduce the impacts of emissions from transportation that would come as a result of new developments impacts measured by vehicle miles traveled but balaguer explained that his problem lies in the lack of specificity he said that the plan s language leaves him unsure as to what that mitigation would look like basically they say nothing that you can hang your hat on as far as what they re going to do balaguer said where is the substantial evidence that this will work it s just a promise faye wilson kennedy an organizer for sacramento s poor people s campaign and for the red black and green environmental justice coalition echoed those concerns she noted that the draft often refers to disadvantaged communities without going into detail as to who that involves and how they will reach out to them specifically she pointed to the draft s plans around unhoused people who she said are often the most directly impacted by symptoms of climate change like heat waves while language in the draft shows agreement with this assessment of their vulnerability wilson kennedy said that she saw no area within it that illustrated exactly how the county would reach out to this community and wants to see more detail about community engagement that has been the problem not only with the climate plan but just plans in general she said governmental entities or those organizations working on behalf of the government are going to have to do a better job of community outreach to disadvantaged communities taking steps toward carbon neutrality smith the county s principal planner agreed that the plan is incomplete he said that the county awaits further guidance from the state like in its forthcoming 2022 climate change scoping plan but that the plan as it currently stands is a reasonable first step toward carbon neutrality by 2030 he expects to update the document continuously after it publishes adapting to new information and state mandates as needed i think delaying it really puts us on an even more difficult trajectory to achieve those reductions that are necessary not just for sacramento county but for the population at large smith said what we tried to achieve is something that s balanced and implementable that everyone can play a part in making a better future balaguer also expected that the plan would continue to be updated in years to come but said that it s missing key components that could be addressed with information the county has right now the cap should be a living document things will change new information will develop new threats will emerge he said however there s a tendency for the county to by default defer decisions to a future time he said that some of those decisions like adding more specificity about enforcement can be made now the current cap defers many decisions which should be made can be made there are only a couple more steps before the plan reaches completion first the plan will be presented for approval to the county s planning commission where public comment will be available after that any changes addressing concerns brought up during public comment will be made and it will await final approval from the county board the county s cap draft can be read on their website and public comments which can be sent to will be accepted through october 8 follow us for more stories like this
slowtwitcher and every man jack athlete david morris had a stellar day at ironman 70 3 atlantic city and grabbed the win there on a 1st generation cervelo p5 that belongs to his brother morris was all set and ready to go to kona and his brother who shares the same passion and fit coordinates had offered to let him to his bike initially there but with kona postponed a new target was set and atlantic city it was with the p5 slowtwitch thank you for your time david morris thanks for the honor of an interview herbert st word actually has it that you are taking a bit of time off from racing and training with kona pushed to february and possibly further out david yes thatâ s correct iâ ve started my off season break although it will most likely just be a few weeks before i get back on a regular but somewhat relaxed schedule iâ m definitely a creature of habit and enjoy the routine of training by this point in my triathlon career st what are you up to in your off season david nothing too out of the ordinary i m mostly spending more time with friends and family i m trying to play a little golf which i don t really have time for in season and we ve got a family weekend getaway planned for mid october i ve also made it a goal to explore all the trails that i can run to from my home this fall st but you recently raced im 70 3 atlantic city and really crushed it there david thanks i had a great day there racing is fun and iâ m always happy to be able to have a race where i feel like it represents my current fitness level st was that race even on your calendar mid earlier this year david nope when kona was canceled i wanted to use all of the training i had been doing for that race for something so i signed up for a local sprint at the end of august and then ac 70 3 st it seemed all fell into place for you in atlantic city so maybe you can talk about your race david it did i was able to have my fastest half ironman swim fastest half ironman bike and second fastest half ironman run two days before i turned 40 which as someone who has been doing this sport since my early 20s is something iâ m pretty proud of my plan going into the race was to swim hard because iâ ve been swimming more consistently this year than in any other year i did that and felt strong on the first loop of the bike but when got the end of the first loop at 20 miles into the bike i got a split of 3 minutes to the lead cyclist and thought iâ d better just keep riding hard i started to feel the effects of the effort at 45 miles but i was able to get the leader within sight by t2 we had a good battle the first 4 miles of the run but i was able to steadily pull away and win my first ironman 70 3 race iâ m ecstatic that iâ ve been able to stay healthy and keep seeing improvements in my fitness and racing all these years st we want to know about your race bike david iâ ve been on old technology for a long time now i ride a cervelo p4 with a vision non integrated bar a hed h3 front wheel and a renn disc rear wheel thatâ s been my setup since 2012 which means it is probably time for an upgrade the bike is still fast but i would love to be able to use wider tires have a rear brake that works a little better and have better storage options for atlantic city i was on a borrowed bike i have a very nice older brother who loaned me his p5 to race in kona because his bike is a little bit faster than mine and i used that in atlantic city st you must feel lucky that your brother not only is similar in size but also has a similar passion david i do it s great to have someone to bounce ideas off of and to go riding outside with when we get to see each other we ve also done a bunch of meetups on zwift which definitely is motivating and more fun for me than riding alone st you said that it is maybe time for an upgrade what are you eying david i m definitely a function over form person and one thing i wanted to schedule this offseason was a bike fit get my coordinates and then work my way back to all the options from that point thanks for the reminder to schedule that st lake placid in 2005 was your first longer triathlon i think what bike did you ride back then david i rode an aluminum felt f50 road bike with clip on bars and stock wheels i got the bike before my junior year of college used for the early part of my triathlon racing and absolutely loved it st you apparently were a bit in over your head with that race distance but it somehow inspired you david ahh â a bit in over your headâ is an understatement i had done a couple of sprint tris and then i watched ironman lake placid and naively said â i can do that â i didnâ t have enough respect for the distance at 22 23 years old and i definitely should have considering i hadnâ t really trained for swimming at all iâ d maybe ridden 40 miles a few times in my life and iâ d never run more 8 miles at once at the point when i registered a year out from the race in the course of the next year i fell in love with the training and the sport when i crossed the finish line in 2005 and most times since then when iâ ve finished a full distance ironman iâ m pretty done with ironman but when i start recovering i always get the itch to try to figure out how to do better next time i love challenges and i love puzzles and ironman racing combines those two things unlike anything else iâ ve ever encountered st at what point did you think that you might be good at this sport david thatâ s a great question my brother got a wired powertap hub back in 2006 and i ended up doing my first and only ramp test on that i still remember how much it hurt because who can back down from a brotherly challenge i put out some solid numbers but i had no idea what they meant at the time when i started learning more about the sport i realized that i had the good problem of not getting a lot of speed for my watts and that kicked off a process of trying to improve the slowtwitch forums were an incredibly valuable resource and in the process of trying to figure out how to go faster on my bike i learned a ton about training for the swim and run as well i started producing better and better results from 2008 2010 and it was probably sometime in those years where i realized that i might be able to keep getting better st in 2019 you had a great race at ironman maryland with a time of 8 47 where does that result rank in terms of accomplishments for you david way way up there but i think i would still rank my 2012 ironman lake placid race over that race the 8 47 at ironman maryland was the primary result that allowed me to get on to the every man jack triathlon team and the team has been such a positive experience for me that itâ s a huge point in favor of ironman maryland i had the race lead from a little bit after mile 100 on the bike until mile 25 of the run but i got caught and passed and i ended up 2nd overall after leading for long time iâ m very proud of that day because it was my fastest ironman race by far but in 2012 at lake placid i finished 5th overall and 1st amateur in a race with some quality professional athletes those two races are 1 and 1a for me in terms of the feeling of accomplishment and it probably depends on the day you ask me which one i would choose as my best accomplishment st how much faster do you think is possible and where would that time come from david thatâ s a good one my goal is to try to find a 10 15 minute improvement over my 2019 ironman maryland result course dependent of course i still believe i have gains i can make mostly on the swim and run i think iâ ve gotten almost all the low hanging fruit thatâ s available to me except for maybe my body composition i raced at about 165 pounds and 10 body fat this year and if i can get to 8 body fat i would be faster running after that itâ s hard to point to any one thing and say thatâ ll make me faster i have some symmetry and balance issues in my swim stroke that iâ m working to clean up iâ m going to mix up my bike and run training a little bit this fall to try to get a little bit better in each but given the amount of time that i train and have to train and my advancing age i think iâ m getting close to my potential iâ ve been very consistent with my bike and run training over the past three years and thatâ s likely why iâ m still improving another year of consistent training will hopefully produce some more small gains st talk about your day job david iâ m a partner in small but growing software company that helps doctors practices and hospitals collect data from and communicate with their patients iâ ve primarily been responsible for our quality assurance along with several other operations related responsibilities since i started there in 2004 we were just a few people at that point but now weâ re hiring and will be close to 40 employees by the end of the year itâ s been a fun challenging ride growing a business st tell us about your training and how it is structured david i try to keep things pretty simple i run 5 6 days per week most of which is easy running i have a period where iâ ll do a hill reps once or twice a week and then i try to do 2 3 economy sessions a week e g 12 x 20â fast on 60â or 10 x 30â fast on 90â i probably only roll through 10 different swim sessions over the course of a year and since pools started opening last winter iâ ve been in the water 2 3 days a week for 2500 to 4500 meters depending on the time of the year i ride 3 days a week and i probably do fewer than 10 different bike sessions over the course of the year iâ m able to train in the mornings and then get out at lunchtime for a shorter second session which normally is a run i found complexity created a barrier to consistency for me and finding a routine and schedule that works week after week has been really beneficial for my family life and my fitness i donâ t do rest weeks or â downâ weeks and i donâ t schedule rest days because life has a way of getting in the way every week looks pretty similar to the previous week and i try to make changes gradually to allow my body to adapt to increases in training load st of your cycling training how much is indoor and how much is outside david i have spent over 95 of my time indoors over the past few years itâ s just too convenient for me with children because i can be home and my wife can still get out for whatever she would like to do i can also start in the dark in the morning and get hours done before the rest of my family is awake i only just started using zwift this year and after using it for a few months i decided that i should upgrade to a sweet tacx neo 2t smart trainer i had no idea what i was missing out on all those years on a dumb trainer i was ok with being a hamster without zwift and a smart trainer and with those improvements to my indoor training experience iâ ll be sticking with it for the foreseeable future i do love and miss riding my bike outside but for training indoors is tough to beat for me st what about running david running was my weakest discipline for the longest time but as i mentioned before i try to keep the structure simple i went to the barryp six days a week plan in 2011 and since then iâ ve averaged over 30 miles a week through a few injuries off season breaks and when my children were infants twins born in late 2013 i donâ t do a huge amount of intensity because as bigger guy it always beats me up i try to keep my harder efforts on the short end of the spectrum running is the hardest sport for me to adjust to new training loads so i always try to get back to running consistent mileage as the first step back from the off season st word has it that you like to cook what is your specialty david i love cooking and eating when i was young my mom always asked me for help with menu planning for the week whenever she was stuck and i always liked helping her prepare dinner when i had the chance to itâ s been a passion of mine as long as i can remember i go through phases where i like to experiment with new things and try new techniques but i also enjoy finding easy weeknight meals that are tasty my most recent phase has been smoking different meats going to smoke a brisket this weekend mmm brisket but in the past iâ ve had an indian curries phase a greek phase a sous vide phase a frying phase a french phase and probably some others that iâ m forgetting right now i also like finding simple food that tastes good and my most recent addition there is a recipe for a french country omelet with potatoes onions tomatoes and eggs that i can prepare in 20 25 minutes and will feed the whole family one of my favorite things to relax to is to throw on a cooking show and try to learn something new or find an interesting recipe st is there anything else we should know david you really want to give me an open platform this far in first iâ d like to say thanks to all the race directors and volunteers who were able to make races happen this year i canâ t begin to imagine the challenges associated with race production in a pandemic and i appreciate all those people who were able to make events happen this year second iâ d like to say thanks to every man jack and the rest of the sponsors of the team roka garmin sockguy boco gear lululemon hyperice gu louis garneau felt bicycles enve composites and ism for all of their support i feel privileged to be a part of the team and itâ s inspiring to be surrounded by so many high achievers who are genuinely good people finally thanks to my

hong kong cnn business the endgame for evergrande is still up in the air but the troubled chinese conglomerate is starting to get its priorities in order and foreign investors look to be bottom of the list in recent days the property giant has worked to clear some tabs with domestic lenders as it tries to sort through its 300 billion mountain of debt but the firm has stayed silent on two interest payments to offshore investors that came due in the past few weeks those interest payments were due on dollar denominated bonds one for 83 5 million and the other 47 5 million deadlines came and went with no official update that suggests that the company s priority is to pay back chinese investors first if it can pay them back at all it s also under huge pressure from beijing to protect people who bought its apartments and have not yet taken possession of them china s real estate sector and related industries are estimated to account for about 30 of gdp and officials want to avoid a wider crisis last wednesday evergrande announced it had agreed to sell part of its stake in a local bank to a state owned business for nearly 10 billion yuan about 1 5 billion in a stock exchange filing the developer said that its cash crunch had hurt the operations of shengjing bank in a material way and that the lender had demanded that all proceeds from the sale be used to resolve financial liabilities between the two parties evergrande also recently reached an agreement on interest due on a yuan bond saying the matter had been settled through negotiations it might be some time before the company s future comes back into focus mainland china has just kicked off a major week long public holiday but markets are open this week in hong kong where evergrande s shares and some of its bonds trade and rumors about its fate could continue to rattle stocks evergrande shares were suspended from trading in hong kong on monday a stock exchange notice did not elaborate on the move adam slater lead economist at oxford economics said that investors will keep an eye out for any developments or even rumors global markets may still react he told cnn business no sign of a lehman moment evergrande is china s most indebted developer and its huge liabilities include nearly 20 billion in international bonds according to data provider refinitiv eikon but because foreign lenders hold a relatively small share of evergrande s overall debt their losses won t be large enough to cause any significant international contagion said slater imposing losses on them frees up funds to compensate domestic creditors suppliers consumers he added according to slater the scale of the potential damage to overseas creditors looks manageable he estimated that they could ultimately lose about 15 billion assuming current bond pricing accurately reflects the ultimate recovery value of evergrande s offshore bonds this is not especially large as corporate defaults go he noted in recent weeks international investors have been swayed by fears of contagion from evergrande and a slowdown in chinese growth the situation last month prompted panic in global markets as well as large protests in china some have even raised the possibility that a default by evergrande could turn into china s lehman brothers moment though many analysts say that is unlikely slater said that while a collapse of evergrande would be significant it s not a lehman moment the priority for chinese authorities seems to be to prevent domestic contagion of evergrande s problems especially contagion that would hurt consumers and suppliers he noted markets assume probably correctly that the chinese authorities will contain the impact of evergrande s financial woes beijing has few good choices though it will want to protect the many chinese people who have bought unfinished apartments from evergrande as well as construction workers suppliers and small investors according to recent analysis from bank of america evergrande has sold 200 000 housing units that have not yet been handed over to buyers the government will also want to limit the risk of other real estate firms going under at the same time beijing has long been trying to rein in excessive borrowing by developers and it won t want to dilute that message so far experts say that potential outcomes include a beijing backed bailout restructuring or default china moves to protect consumers in recent weeks the government has turned its focus to limiting fallout from the crisis and protecting ordinary people though it has refrained from commenting on evergrande directly in a statement late last month the people s bank of china vowed to maintain the healthy development of the real estate market and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of housing consumers while it did not refer to evergrande specifically the central bank has been pumping cash into the financial system over the last few days to help stabilize the situation and calm nerves last tuesday it announced that it had added 100 billion yuan approximately 15 5 billion to the system saying it was to keep liquidity going an aerial view of the evergrande changqing community on sept 26 in wuhan china getty images iris pang chief economist of greater china at ing said that the move was a symbolic signal to the market that the chinese government is in control of the incident and is not letting the incident become a crisis but even if losses for overseas investors are relatively contained the crisis could force some to rethink how they lend to other chinese companies in the future according to slater he warned that lenders could decide to re price china in the light of their treatment in the evergrande restructuring and in the light of what the evergrande problems tell them about the broader risk reward trade off in chinese debt that in turn depends quite a lot on the exact way the evergrande restructuring is organized he added cnn s laura he contributed to this report
the october 1 school strike called by uk parent lisa diaz a member of the safeedforall safe education for all parent group met a broad response yesterday thousands registered their support on social media with many making short videos and sharing the hashtags schoolstrike2021 sittingducks and october1st given the widespread pledges of support from parents workers and students all over the globe

fight for justice thank you from all of us from safeedforall_uk backing for the strike came from the uk united states france germany spain israel sri lanka japan australia and other countries a number of those participating posted photos of their children s school uniform hung up alongside a mask to indicate their opposition to sending children into unsafe schools one of the most shared tweets from the day came from a parent in the uk who reported that her daughter has been sick for 18 months from an infection that she caught in school she posted a drawing comparing the reopening of schools to sending soldiers over the trenches in world war i summarizing the significance of the global event world socialist web site international editorial board chairman david north stated october 1 2021 is a date that will live in history the thousands of workers who have responded to lisa diaz s call to action and joined today s global online picket line are acting on behalf of countless millions across the globe while governments and the rich are concerned only with the impact of the pandemic on the stock markets and corporate profits the working class is concerned with the cost to human life covid 19 cannot be lived with it must be eradicated today s action is a great step forward in the fight against the pandemic but it is the beginning not the end of the struggle we must build on today s achievement and increase our efforts to mobilize the working class on a global scale in action numerous video statements were posted from all over the world many of which were compiled by the wsws throughout the day lucy garrard a member of safeedforall said in her video the media and the government are downplaying the effect of covid in children trying to persuade everyone it s over everything s okay it isn t parent fran tweeted i support schoolstrike2021 because it is frankly sociopathic to send innocent children into schools with no mitigations with a highly infectious potentially fatal virus circulating children cannot protect themselves it is up to adults to do so solidarity twitter user little hoppy saul said children are being infected in schools daily in large numbers it s not inevitable that they would contract covid it was a choice a choice that was made by the department for education barbara slaughter a veteran of the trotskyist movement in the uk stated lisa s initiative in calling for today s action is a brave act of defiance she speaks on behalf of millions of working class families all over the world and that s why her call has had an international response because she s telling the truth a uk teacher ruth warned in her video covid is absolutely ripping through our schools through our children and then through our families too we have the right to be safe the right to health and the right to an education and our children can t have all of those things at the moment parent sarah said i m doing this recording in my garage because i don t want my children to know that ten children have already died of covid this month there are no mitigations in schools they re an unvaccinated population it s completely unacceptable hemantha welihena a teacher and member of the teachers students parents safety committee of sri lanka posted a video saying around the world everyone should support the fight against the reopening of schools and the herd immunity policy children are the future generation of society martin mauer a teacher in the state of saxony germany and a member of the network of action committees for safe education said in support of the strike all the establishment parties are implementing a policy of mass infection they are sabotaging the simplest measures such as quarantining sacrificing the health of millions of children in the economic interests of the banks and the corporations cheryl crisp the national secretary of the socialist equality party in australia gave the party s wholehearted support for the school strike stating to force unvaccinated children into schools with no protections has nothing to do with their education but everything to do with the demand that their parents are free to go to work to produce to make profits for their employees she added the working class the only force which stands for the interests of science life and society must now take matters into his own hands this strike is the beginning of that stand uk retired teacher and wsws writer margot miller said i think i can speak for the profession we care passionately about the health the education and the happiness of our children but what happiness is there if children catch covid become ill develop long covid pass the virus to families and lose loved ones adam from london explained i work in the accommodation environment of a well known university it s immoral to send children back to schools under misinformation and lies while the government suppresses the truth in relation to covid and the pandemic david o sullivan a bus driver from london and a founding member of the london bus rank and file committee said lisa s call should be shouted from the rooftops to oppose the government s herd immunity experiment on children it is only through the intervention of the mass of the working class that things are going change the support of the socialist equality group in new zealand was expressed by leading member tom peters who said the strike was setting an example for workers across the world who are seeking to fight back against the murderous policies that are causing covid 19 to spread out of control parent kelly taylor tweeted i support the school strike and am keeping my child at home today 59 000 children were infected in the 1st two weeks of school a national health service worker in southern england posted a video stating as a health worker i fully support the school strike today called by lisa sandyboots2020 i cannot agree more with this courageous action in safeguarding

initiative schoolstrike2021 sittingducks october1st especially when germany is lifting today most of restrictions like allowing big parties full sport events no mask mandate at primary schools all the effort now for nothing socialist equality party uk supporter jude said in her video parents supporting this action are doing a right thing and teachers too they must break totally with those that oppose them and build this wonderful international movement so that we can eradicate covid together across the world significantly the school strike was supported by a number of scientists malgorzata gasperowicz a developmental biologist and a researcher at the faculty of nursing at the university of calgary tweeted a statement from zerocovidcanada declaring we encourage all canadian parents to

daughter commented that she feels for the teachers who are having to teach despite a current covid outbreak in her year professor deepti gurdasani an epidemiologist who is a senior lecturer at queen mary university of london tweeted i wasn t able to participate in this but i fully support parents who are protesting the lack of basic mitigations in schools that have essentially meant 160 000 children with covid 19 in just the last 2 weeks this is reckless endangerment of our young yesterday s strike was the result of initiatives carried out by workers independently of the trade unions and left political parties which at every stage have worked to implement the homicidal policies of the ruling class it marked an important step forward in the struggle of the international working class against the pandemic articulating its striving for a policy based on saving lives not private profit

semi autos are often the preferred gun of choice for wildfowlers semi auto and pump action shotguns have been around for a long time but have not been as popular in the uk as they have in the usa shooters shy away from them mainly because of the uncertainty of how to operate and handle them in a safe way those that use them usually love them and i believe that there are some great benefits to their well thought out design my introduction to fixed barrelled guns was a semi auto back in the 1980s my job as a gamekeeper meant that i used shotguns for work i had a couple of over and unders that did not fit me very well so i purchased a second hand semi auto which came with a set of spacers and washers after asking around as to their purpose i found that i could adjust the cast and drop on the gun by inserting the spacers in between the stock and action having a gun that fitted well was a revelation for my shooting and my love of the semi auto was fired they are also cheaper on the whole due to a manufacturing process that involves less man hours and of course just one barrel this is no reflection on quality some history on fixed barrelled guns i couldn t write an article on fixed barrelled guns without mentioning john moses browning he first designed a pump action shotgun for winchester in 1893 with an external hammer he also designed the winchester 12 a hammerless gun from 1912 by then he had also made a semi auto the browning auto 5 patented in the early 1900s was the first of the long recoil semi autos and stayed in production until 1998 the first semi autos were long action having the barrel and breechblock move back after firing to expel the spent cartridge and load the next the short action followed and then the gas operated autos which bleed off some of the gases from the fired cartridge via a port in the barrel to operate the action this helped with reducing the recoil and removed the long action shuffle as the barrel didn t move just the bolt gas operated semi autos are most common and with self adjusting gas valves that stay cleaner in use and are not as fussy about cartridges as they were safety with fixed barrelled guns when using a fixed barrel shotgun safety is of the utmost importance with a break barrel shotgun when the action is open the barrels point to the ground which we take for granted however we cannot break the action with a fixed barrel shotgun and therefore we have to be more muzzle aware when you are not shooting a fixed barrel gun all effort should be made to point its barrels either up in the air or down to the ground the use of a safety flag breechblock or plug allows everyone to see that the bolt is back and the gun cannot be fired that s no excuse for not having the muzzles pointing in a safe direction however on the clay ground the safety flag should be in until you are on the stand and ready to load the flag should also be replaced in the action before you come out of the stand in the field any time you would open a break barrel gun with a fixed barrel the bolt should be opened unloaded and flag used to check whether a fixed barrel gun is safe and the barrel clear the bolt should be back a visual check of the chamber and the magazine tube conducted this should be followed by a physical check with your fingers that both the magazine chamber and magazine are empty then and only then can you check the barrel from the muzzle end fixed barrel guns generally have a button safety catch rather than a thumb operated one which are manually operated with the trigger finger and usually located by the trigger guard when you push before moving your finger onto the trigger there is usually a red indicator to highlight that it is live to put the safety on you push in the opposite direction in a hide i always use my semi auto when i am pigeon shooting using an over and under in the confines of a pigeon hide feels awkward loading and unloading with a semi auto seems easier and convenient remembering to keep the barrels pointing up and safe the lodge guns where we shoot in argentina are generally semi autos a testament to their capability for high volume of shots and reliability wildfowlers like them partly because if dropped in the mud they can be washed off and will still work anyone who is recoil sensitive should try a semi auto left handers didn t get on so well with them to start with as they ejected spent shells across their face but now most models are made with a left handed option they have been known to be cartridge sensitive but progress has been made on this front too in my job at bisley and coaching at a school i teach skeet trap and sporting clays a big part of the training is safety and to that end we introduce the students to semi auto and pump action guns as well as the more traditional over and unders the fact is there is an increased risk of an accident if you are not competent with any gun you are using so learning how to load unload and handle a gun properly will render a fixed barrel shotgun as safe as any break barrel
we ve all done it sold a firearm because we needed the money or wanted to upgrade but then regretted it bruce potts recalls the ones that got away most of us i m sure will have experienced that sinking feeling at some time or other the one when we realise that we should never have sold that gun a rifle or shotgun is rarely just a tool it becomes a treasured possession but for whatever reason be it monetary necessity or the lure of a newer model i bet every reader remembers at least one gun they regret selling and wish they could own again replacing it years later with a similar model is just not the same sometimes you get lucky and those old guns can resurface in the most unexpected of places i had one such encounter with a rifle i sold some 25 years ago now we are reunited and it s marriage for life first gun first on my list of rifles i wish i still owned has to be my first airgun a weihrauch hw35 in 22 calibre bought second hand for 50 when i was a teenager it took me ages to save up pocket money christmas and birthday money until i could afford it that was in the days when 5 was all you got for christmas i learned everything from that old hw35 including proper sighting and trajectory drop with the only pellets i could get eley wasp and milbro i nearly cleaned away the bluing with the attention i gave that air rifle i kept the hw35 for 30 years and shot hundreds of thousands of pellets with it goodness knows how many rabbits pigeon and rats fell to its unerring accuracy landmark moments such as my first rabbit and first squirrel were taken with this old friend however when my parents were living in scotland a young lad nearby was keen to start shooting so i sold him the hw35 for virtually nothing because i had a few other air rifles i could use it was probably a year later when i started to regret it pining after the hw35 because i missed its unique ring cycle sadly the new owner had moved so it was gone forever i have other hw35s now including the upgraded export model i could never afford as a teenager but i will always miss that original weihrauch second mistake my next tale of woe is about a superb little carbine but it has a better ending ivan hancock and dave pope set up the venom arms company back in the early 1980s their forte was custom spring powered air rifles of the highest quality but as with most shooters ivan and dave liked their rearms and shotguns too ivan had built himself a gorgeous thompson center contender carbine in 730 waters cartridge with his trademark custom walnut stock i was in the right place at the right time ivan was slimming down his collection and up came his little used contender after a handshake and some cash it was coming home with me i loved that carbine its unusual calibre superb accuracy beautiful finish and unbelievable wood the trouble was that it drew the attention of my friends one of whom pestered me to sell it to him i finally relinquished it as i needed the money but as soon as i sold it i regretted it however i am still friends with its new owner and i am allowed to see it at weekends reunited there is a happy ending to another story about a rifle i sold and became reacquainted with by pure chance some 25 years later this was my first custom rifle funded by an inheritance from my grandparents most 21 year olds wanted a car but for me there was no contest i wanted a custom rifle for crow shooting i had delta firearms source the parts in america and project manage the build for me the action was a brand new sako a2 it cost 300 that was sent to shilen to be barrelled with its match grade stainless steel number 5 5 contoured 24in barrel chambered in 22250 with a minimum specification chamber dimensions when completed it was sent to harry lawson in arizona a master custom stock maker with a amboyant are i loved his vision of custom stocks and his cochise thumbhole model was my dream stock design i could only afford grade 4 walnut claro type with lovely colour and ddle back grain harry also custom inlet a diamond maple wood crescent to the fore end and bedded the whole action to the stock with acraglas so it shot as well as it looked you can image my delight when it nally arrived i used this rifle for all my vermin jobs around my uncle s farm in kent and in scotland in my late 20s i set up a wildlife photographic business and needed some cash for camera lenses so with regret i sold the rifle to my friend joe who owns the gunshop in east barnet i had more custom rifles made to that original spec but i wished i had my old friend back one dayi walked into joe s shop and there on the wall some 25 years later was my sako custom joe explained that the owner who bought my rifle all those years ago now needed the money and i had just walked into the shop at the right time i bought it back and it was still in good condition though the barrel was a little worn i had it re barrelled by callum ferguson in scotland to the outrageously large 22284 wildcat round this rifle now shoots 30 gr berger bullets at 5 144fps and i am never letting it out of my sight again a lesson learned there are some rifles i would never sell and my favourite is a well worn tikka m55 rifle in 308 winchester that i bought when i was 17 it cost 140 from leslie bowlers in london s elephant and castle i still have the sale ticket and remember going
