bloomberg the u s securities and exchange commission is giving bond markets at least three more months to prepare for a rule revision that industry insiders say would upend trading for some debt securities the amendment to sec rule 15c2 1 set to go into effect on tuesday is intended to protect investors in over the counter trading markets from pump and dump schemes often seen with penny stocks the change mandates that broker dealers in their role as professional gatekeepers to this market do not publish quotations for an issuer s security when current issuer information is not publicly available previously the rule hadn t been applied to the trading of fixed income securities but the sec didn t exempt debt from the new regulation after a small uproar from bond dealer industry groups the sec announced friday that the rule change won t be enforced for fixed income securities until jan 3 broker dealers weren t prepared to comply with the rule beginning next week anyway and hadn t received guidance on how to do so according to michael decker senior vice president of federal policy and research at the bond dealers of america an industry group the bda called it unreasonable for the sec to expect compliance by next week in a statement we certainly welcome the three month extension without it you simply would have had a rule with no compliance decker said in an interview trying to squeeze fixed income into the rule as it exists now would create a lot of problems not intended in a letter announcing the three month non enforcement period sec commissioner hester peirce said that the rule revision wasn t intended to go after bonds i acknowledge that i thought of the rule s application only in the otc equity context hester wrote in the letter dated friday nobody seems to have contemplated that this rule would affect the fixed income markets in a way different from the pre amendment version of the rule much less that its requirements potentially would render unviable certain recent technological innovations in trading if enforced the rule could cause major disruptions in the trading of mortgage backed securities and junk bonds a market where issuers are often small private and opaque read more a big bond market headache courtesy of the sec brian chappatta the bda has joined forces with the securities industry and financial markets association another dealer industry group to seek a broad based exemption from the rule for fixed income the bda s decker said the groups don t expect to receive the broad based exemption at this point instead the sec needs to create detailed guidance for dealers on how to comply and specific exemptions for situations where the rules don t make sense he says something that s likely to take longer than three months investors don t appear too concerend for now john mcclain a high yield bond portfolio manager at brandywine doesn t expect the sec to move forward with a rule that could curb bond market liquidity something regulators and the federal reserve have worked hard to improve in recent years mcclain said at least one security in his portfolio could be impacted by the rule any type of ruling that would run counter to functioning bond markets wouldn t make a lot of sense to us mcclain said in an interview i don t see regulators really having a lot of teeth behind the kind of stuff that would gum up bond market liquidity 2021 bloomberg l p

substantial liability and compliance consequences opening an international office means asking complex questions about your company s tolerance for legal risk how the enterprise might be taxed and what compliance challenges it might face each market is distinct setting up a subsidiary or branch in germany requires a far different approach than say in brazil making the right decision about your office s legal status requires doing your homework not only about the financial potential of a particular location but also about its politics culture and legal system herewith is an explanation of the basic entities available to companies when they organize new offices overseas a few of the benefits and potential pitfalls of each and other factors to consider before making a final decision a direct extension representative and branch offices first let s define our terms generally companies have three options when they want to enter a foreign market a representative office a branch office and a subsidiary the representative office is in essence a beachhead it is the simplest to establish as it only exists to allow the company s representatives to make contacts in the local market promotional activities are acceptable but companies must take care not to step over the line in most countries a representative office cannot handle transactions or contractual matters a branch office on the other hand is a direct extension of the parent company and can engage in core activities like sales and contracts it is designed to help generate revenue for the company and serves a particular geographic region critically however it is not a separate legal entity from the parent company as one international trade organization describes it the branch office is not able to independently participate in the general business transactions of the head office it performs support and implementation related tasks without having any individual business discretion and is entirely dependent on the head office a distinct entity a subsidiary a subsidiary company is legally speaking more complex than a branch office it is an entirely separate legal entity that has been established by another company to do business in a particular place to qualify as a subsidiary a parent company must own more than 50 percent of the entity s voting shares a wholly owned subsidiary is as the name suggests 100 percent owned by another company a subsidiary also can own shares in and control subsidiaries of its own given the comparative complexity of a subsidiary versus a branch why do so many companies choose it as the operating entity for their international offices the key reason is the subsidiary s separateness as a distinct legal entity the subsidiary gives a parent company an additional layer of protection from liability another advantage because a subsidiary is a separate legal entity it is subject to the tax laws of the country where it is domiciled this allows the company to manage its tax burden more effectively take advantage of favorable tax policies in a particular region or country or limit the impact of tax laws that may threaten the parent company s profits consider the following scenario company x llc is a fast growing u s based financial technology company that s seeing a sharp increase in business with banks in germany the company s executives decide to open an office in frankfurt to serve existing clients and expand company x s european customer base they decide to form a wholly owned german subsidiary deutsche company x gmbh a gmbh is the german equivalent of a limited liability company or llc though the subsidiary is controlled by the u s company it is taxed by germany and subject to germany s laws and those of the european union the german entity can t be held liable for lawsuits filed against the parent company at tax time deutsche company x pays the rates established in germany and does not owe tax on its earnings in the united states and its parent company owes no taxes to germany on revenue it earned outside the country had company x decided to open a branch office any income earned by its outpost in germany would be subject to u s taxes and if the branch outpost ran afoul of the law in germany company x could be held liable for any damages is a branch office easier yet isn t a branch office by its very nature easier to open and operate not necessarily any company making a foray into a foreign market will face regulatory hurdles whether via a subsidiary branch or representative office the u s state department calls germany one of the most reliable countries in the world for business but it notes that the legal accounting and regulatory requirements can be complex and recommends that investors pay attention to their legal obligations for instance before creating a new subsidiary like a gmbh companies in germany must register in public directories the commercial register handelsregister and the trade office register gewerberegister are the two most important the state department says the commercial register includes the names of partners and managing directors capital stock liability limitations and bankruptcies applications for registration at the commercial register are filed through a civil law notary a highly trained lawyer required by statute to intervene in important transactions companies opening a branch office get to skip the commercial register but they must register with the local trade office according to germany trade and invest a government backed trade group documentation can be rather extensive the trade office may require the following a copy of the parent company s certificate of incorporation a copy of its certificate of good standing less than a month old a copy of the parent company s memorandum and articles of association and a resolution by the parent company s board giving evidence about the decision to create a branch office among other paperwork tax and accounting requirements for the branch may also vary depending on the state where it is located pros and cons between branch offices and subsidiaries branch offices and subsidiaries both offer benefits and challenges for a growing company let s tackle first a few of the pros and cons involved in choosing a branch office branch office pros and cons speed pro a branch office can be set up relatively quickly though as we ve noted it is not without its bureaucratic hurdles some companies use a branch office as an interim step using it to gain local knowledge and make sales before acquiring or establishing a subsidiary oversight pro a branch is a part of the parent company and is dependent upon it management decisions flow directly from company headquarters offering executives a greater measure of direct control cost pro branch offices tend to be smaller in size reducing overhead costs liability con because they are not separate entities branch offices provide no liability protection for a parent company the parent is on the hook for any legal issues that may arise tax worries con depending on the applicable tax laws companywide profits may be exposed to taxation in the country where the branch is located subsidiary pros and cons on the subsidiary side pros and cons may include the following protection pro because a subsidiary has its own legal status it provides a parent company with an additional layer of protection from liability tax limitations pro subsidiary companies are taxed under local laws on their own income thus shielding the parent company s profits from taxes in a foreign country credibility pro a subsidiary may open access to capital from banks and investors more comfortable with investing in a local company compliance con because a subsidiary is a separate entity it may require multiple government registrations and may need to maintain a minimum level of capital to operate it is also likely to face more stringent local regulations and annual reporting requirements political exposure con as the tariff disputes pitting the united states against china and others have shown a company s subsidiaries may be exposed to political risks beyond their control as tariffs rose some domestic manufacturers felt the effects because they owned a subsidiary in a country that had been penalized conclusion without proper due diligence a company may choose an entity that stifles rather than encourages overseas growth executives need to be aware of the compliance tax and liability issues that accompany a branch office or subsidiary and choose the one that will help them avoid expensive surprises whatever entity your business chooses it shouldn t act alone entering a new market may be exciting for a growing company but it also means grappling with a whole host of unfamiliar rules and regulations choosing a trusted and experienced global corporate compliance partner can allow your company to smoothly navigate a host of compliance issues provide insights on planning for an international location and help you create and register a legal entity when you ve chosen the right one for your company

kuala lumpur a future of continuous masking testing regularly for covid 19 and quarantining at home when necessary while life goes on as outlined by health minister khairy jamaluddin is almost upon us malaysia plans to go into the endemic phase by the end of october which is when it hopes 100 percent of its adults or 71 6 percent of its total population will be fully vaccinated almost all sectors are expected to open by then despite the fact that malaysia will soon reopen the life people will return to will not be the same as the one they left before covid 19 came into the scene the pandemic has left its mark on us and our lives and many of the things we adopted to prevent the virus from infecting us will likely continue are we ready for it â any particular thing if we keep repeatedly doing it over time it becomes part of us â said prof datuk dr mohammad shatar sabran a social expert â itâ s not going to be a restriction anymore it was but when you get used to it itâ s just nothing â online move experts see people leading a more online and possibly a more isolated life as part of the new normal life went online for the most part due to covid 19 many aspects of work play love comfort and gatherings took place online and experts do not see much of it changing retailer datuk andrew lim said covid 19 has accelerated the move to online as businesses desperately needed to find a way to stay solvent while forced to close their stores during the lockdown â now even the makcik and pakcik our senior citizens know how to use the smartphone and go online â he said mirroring the retail apocalypse in the united states he expects more stores to become a hybrid mix of brick and mortar and online sales lim who is also the executive chairman of sogo and gama group of companies said more stores will turn into fulfillment centres where the majority of shop space will be given to stock to be delivered or picked up with a small place reserved as a showroom or a lifestyle centre to advertise wares and usage to passers by although malls have now reopened he said they are getting 40 percent of the footfall they used to get and does not expect the situation to fully improve until the pandemic is over â where we used to do rm1 million a day we would see rm400 000 of sales a day now because people are afraid you see â he said compounding the problem is the fact that a significant chunk of the usual customers that is the tourists are missing even businesses that require face to face interactions such as salons and spas have integrated an online component to their business model which helped them survive the prolonged lockdown sandie lee salon owner and representative of malaysia affiliation of nail salons industry said they have had to make minimal adjustments for their physical customers now that salons can open their doors to fully vaccinated customers â the beauty line is considered one of the fastest in adapting to the new normal as we have the advantage of practising some of the sops standard operating procedures already since a long time ago such as sanitising and using gloves and masks â she said the big change was in their online presence since nail salons and spas can no longer have more than four customers at any one time they plan to continue selling their beauty products online and delivering the items to their customers invest in connectivity this shift to a more online world is reflected in how we work as well companies planning to reopen their offices are required to make changes to ensure good ventilation and prevent transmission of covid 19 in the workplace in the meantime they have also invested in infrastructure that allows eligible employees to work remotely during lockdowns meetings that once required everyone in a department to cram into small spaces are now conducted online malaysian employers federation mef executive director datuk shamsuddin bardan said it is unlikely employers would go back fully to pre pandemic practices after adopting online communications technology he said while there will be some need for face to face interaction they have also seen the benefits of going online for their employees and for clients â from the employerâ s side it can mean a lot of savings â he said â if they are renting office space for example they may want to go on the hybrid model and of course will not require so much space we can give up some of the space and save some rental â as for employees the benefits include more time saved from being on the road and dealing with traffic to devote to work something reflected in a recent survey by human resource solutions agency randstad according to the hi 2021 workmonitor survey more than two thirds of respondents in malaysia would be happy to continue working remotely as such shamsuddin said the government needs to invest heavily in improving internet access for all malaysians to prevent the digital divide from widening and provide tax incentives to employers and employees alike to help them purchase the necessary equipment he also said the government should increase focus on improving cybersecurity malaysia currently ranks fifth together with russia and the united arab emirates out of 194 countries on the 2020 global cybersecurity index conducted by the international telecommunications union with a reduced need for venues to conduct large conferences he said hotels and conference centres that used to host them will have to recalibrate to attract new customers virtually social as we move our lives online human connections have suffered even more during the lockdown and may continue to suffer during the endemic phase with covid 19 there will be limits to almost every aspect of our lives which will in turn curtail our social habits even if we go back to the office not everyone will be there as there will be limits on capacity we will have to maintain physical distancing and practise other preventative measures at work and at play while it may be a more isolated life experts say it does not need to be more lonely â lonely is months of lockdown â said associate prof dr mas ayu said an epidemiologist at universiti malaya â iâ m still gossiping with my friends even though weâ re wearing face masks you need to keep your distance but as long as the activity is like talking to friends it will still remain the same â mohammad shatar who is also the chief executive officer of the malaysian qualifications agency mqa agreed saying the new normal will become second nature to people â i know in the future the government is not going to say we need to wear masks but automatically people will do it to prevent getting sick â he said he also said people should be fully vaccinated in order to return to society and those who decided against getting the vaccine should be prepared to be sidelined and refused service â when we are doing this vaccination thing it is not for me myself but for the society because if iâ m not doing it that means iâ m not helping the community iâ m not helping the society â he said dr mas ayu said as many people as possible should be vaccinated so that the unvaccinated few like young children could still go out without much consequence social activities may be able to return to close to normal as a result data from the ministry of health shows breakthrough infections are rare occurring more often after 120 days of being fully vaccinated at 5 3 percent while deaths remain low at one out of 10 000 people according to the us centres for disease control vaccinated people are also infectious for a shorter time which means they will end up infecting fewer people than an unvaccinated person who remains infectious for at least 10 days from onset of symptoms dr mas ayu who is also a public health medicine specialist at the department of social and preventive medicine universiti malaya said the governmentâ s decision to give booster shots to those at risk either because of health or occupation will fix the waning protection issue and reduce the transmission rate even further she added the new normal will require people to employ common sense and make a judgment on the safety of a venue before deciding to participate in social activities â just be cautious if someone is coughing badly i think you should just stop and leave â she said bernama
share link copied to clipboard as with other types of medical imaging breast cancer diagnosis has taken great leaps forward with the use of techniques such as 3d screening and ultrasound yet mammograms the standard of care have a miserable reliability rate of between 60 per cent and 85 per cent in this context the recently listed bcal diagnostics asx bdx hopes to reduce the incidence of both false positives and false negatives with a blood based molecular diagnostics based test don t be the last to know get the latest stock news and insights straight to your inbox name email it s free unsubscribe whenever your want hidden email lists morning update lunch update market close update weekend update email this field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged the desired endgame is reducing the number of painful biopsies but also ensuring that the most vulnerable women have access to regular cost effective screening the raw reality is that mammograms miss 20 per cent of all tumors while 80 per cent of follow up biopsies are not needed the goal of the company is to get to market as quickly as we can within the data and compliance requirements for clinical validation and regulatory approvals says executive chair jayne shaw about bcal the company was founded by the lancashire born shaw who is not only a career healthcare professional but an entrepreneurial dynamo all the girls in my family were nurses and all the boys were engineers she said after migrating to australia in 1990 shaw became the director of nursing and ceo of two nsw hospitals at a reasonably young age along the way she noticed the poor clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients especially depending on where they lived in 2000 she co founded the eyecare clinic consolidation play vision group which listed on the asx and eventually was acquired by chinese interests after that foray she invested in the sydney breast clinic where she teamed up with former new south wales liberal party health minister ron phillips we both wanted to make a difference with early diagnosis of breast cancer it was a meeting of minds she says eventually sydney breast clinic was sold to healthscope after which she turned her attention to a blood based test being developed by a company working at the clinic we bought the recruited some scientists and funded some research with the backing of high net worth individuals who knew it was high risk but could make a meaningful impact some of the intellectual property derives from louisville university which was replicating some of the scientific work bcal has an exclusive licence agreement with the kentucky s university of louisville for breast and lung cancer bcal listed on the asx on july 19 2021 having raised 10 million at 25 cents apiece the company funded research in the us for six years but in 2017 re domiciled the program to the university of sydney s charles perkins centre which has the requisite mass spectrometry infrastructure a notable member of bcal s five strong scientific team is dr amani batarseh a molecular biologist and leading expert in lipidomic and mass spectrometry we were blessed to be able to recruit her shaw says a towering inclusion on the board is experienced investment banker and company director mark burrows who has been known more for playing at the big end of town we have to take a few noughts off the numbers because he is used to much bigger figures ms shaw quips about the bcal test the bcal test which like the horse in the desert does not have a name is based on an algorithmic software component the blood sample is drawn from the patient and then the extracellular vesicles evs are enriched from the blood plasma that contain lipids types of fats the blood is then matched against a panel of 18 biomarkers characteristic of the presence of blood cancers initial studies at charles perkins suggests the tests are 91 per cent accurate in identifying patients with the disease and 87 percent right in calling out those without a tumor regulatory approach the company s regulatory and commercial approach is to tackle the local market first through an application to the therapeutic goods administration in parallel with a laboratory developed test pathway to market the bcal test s first market entry will be as an adjunct with mammography certainly not a replacement for it along the way bcal is augmenting its database of 1 000 or so samples with blood specimens from the sydney breast clinic lifehouse the specialist cancer breast surgery centre adjacent to melbourne s epworth hospital and new south wales breast screening controversially closed during the sydney pandemic crisis our gold standard and purpose are to have a routine screening blood test for all women everywhere but you need high volumes of clinical samples and clinical data ms shaw says the aim is to get an australian lab partner to work to develop that bcal is also in discussion with us parties which is not surprising given the us accounts for 60 per cent of the breast cancer diagnostics market of course the proudly parochial us regulators prefer applicants with home sourced samples that are as american as apple pie and annoying family sitcoms we are realistic that there is only so much we can do in australia and we need to start collecting clinical data in the us as well shaw says bcal also has a licencing arrangement with the university of louisville covering a similar blood assay for lung cancer but i would rather get one thing right and then diversify rather than being all things to all people the problem with mammograms poor accuracy aside the wider problem with mammograms is that 50 per cent of eligible women opt not to have them either because of the pain involved or because they are unwilling to bare their breasts for cultural reasons screening is low among women of certain asian middle eastern and mediterranean backgrounds breast cancer is also much more fatal in developing countries where healthcare is of lower quality due to later diagnosis in britain last year s prolonged covid 19 lockdowns resulted in about one million fewer mammograms being carried out and an uptick in late stage cancers because of tardy diagnosis in 12 to 18 months time we will see if the same trend is evident here accuracy aside the problem with mammograms is that in australia they are not funded for women aged under 40 the cut off used to be 50 so unless they are deemed high risk because of a brca gene mutation younger women must rely on inaccurate self examination breast cancers in the under 40s tends to be more aggressive finances and performance bcal s initial public offer raised 2 million more than the targeted 8 million but as is often the case the shares failed to ignite after some of the original investors availed of the opportunity to sell it didn t help that cicada sydney university s commercialization incubator had to sell its entire stake in bcal yep times are tough in academia to date bcal shares have traded between 25 cents july 21 and 14 cents august 23 shaw estimates the americans louisville university spent about us20 million 27 million on the intellectual property with the australian end investing a further 8 million to 10 million she adds that the company has also benefited from pro bono input such as directors and lawyers working for nothing during six years of hand to mouth existence we are very prudent with our cash we treat every dollar as if it is our own she says sizing up the rivals blood based diagnosis is a very active area globally notwithstanding the reputational damage inflicted by us company theranos and its founder elizabeth holmes holmes is currently on trial on fraud charges relating to the us9 billion collapse of theranos which claimed to be developing a pin prick test for multiple indications in the us provista diagnostics has blood based cancer tests on market bcal is being closely compared with the asx listed blood based diagnostics peer bard1 which merged with sienna diagnostics bard1 is targeting breast and ovarian cancers but its tests are based on antibodies rather than lipids shaw admits that bcal is not alone but adds that it s not a winner takes all race as with prostate cancer or colorectal cancer there will be many tests on the market and that s why it s important to have good clinical data and the support of the medical community and we think bcal is well positioned in this regard bcal is also competing with deep pocketed companies such as grail and guardant health of the us which are working on pan cancer tests there are other genomic tests but so far no blood test for breast cancer she suspects the molecular testing efforts eventually will consolidate in favor of the most accurate and cost effective assays it s going to come down to the specificity and sensitivity of the test clinical utility and price shaw says there s also the kiwi based asx listed volpara health technologies which has tools to enable more accurate imaging of dense breasted women tumors on dense breasts do not show up as well as those on fatty breasts we all have the same purpose that earlier diagnosis will lead to improved survivability rates for women with breast cancer dr boreham s diagnosis in a bout of rare honesty for a ceo shaw describes the share performance to date as very turbulent and disappointing c mon jayne cheer up we ve seen a lot worse than a recently listed stock trading at a 28 per cent discount she adds i can t do anything about the share price we can only deliver milestones and we are doing that lest we forget breast cancer is the world s most common cancer for women with two million new diagnoses a year and 627 000 deaths in australia 20 000 cases are detected annually with 3 000 deaths the global testing market is worth about us5 billion and is forecast to rise to us8 7 billion by 2027 but ms shaw has no delusions about the odds of success it s risky there s no question she says i m a realist but we are very focused on getting a test to market disclosure dr boreham is not a qualified medical practitioner and does not possess a doctorate of any sort but he does possess man boobs and does his breast to makes sense of the technical stuff this column first appeared in biotech daily share link copied to

came to america seeking a better life many ended up working in one of the city s many flourishing cigar factories making their homes in shotgun style houses and hastily constructed overcrowded wood frame tenement buildings where they perished in fires and from the yellow fever epidemic in the 1900s during the height of the cigar industry ybor city was producing about a half a billion cigars a

that s the case here hertzog said i ve heard elevators running by themselves footsteps doors opening and closing or pushing against me as i ve tried to close them and many other strange interesting things when i first started doing the tour i didn t give it much stock milton said but after four years i can tell you it s real i know ghosts are real among the stories milton tells on his tour is of a young actor who was performing a play he d written himself on the stage of the cuban club when he forgot his lines out of embarrassment or shame he returned to the club after hours draped a rope across the catwalk of the stage put it around his neck and jumped to his death on his tours milton said visitors have seen flashes of light and orbs floating around the theater he himself has witnessed a man with no face sitting in the front row of the empty theater and an ethereal woman wearing period clothing with strange glowing orange eyes he said the fourth floor of the club is also haunted by a famous dancer who dismissed the advances of an infatuated fan one night the man got drunk and pushed the dancer over the balcony to her death official ybor city ghost tour ghost hunters

are he said i ve come face to face with some of these entities i ve talked with them i ve conversed with them i ve even made them laugh sometimes i ve also made them mad once in a while while herman makes no guarantees that visitors will spot a ghost on the tours he said they will be entertained with some interesting stories about ybor city s colorful history people ask me all the time if they re going to see a ghost i can t guarantee that it s up to the ghosts herman said but more than a few who have taken the tour say they ve glimpsed restless souls dressed in immigrant clothing or zoot

open 1 introduction 1 the humanitarian consequences of the conflict between armenia and azerbaijan have been tragic for both sides it is a conflict grounded in history which has seen two major outbreaks of war from the end of 1991 to 1994 and a 6 week war in 2020 2 on 20 november 2020 the bureau of the parliamentary assembly invited the committee on migration refugees and displaced persons to prepare a report and on 2 december i was appointed rapporteur and conducted fact finding visits to armenia from 18 to 22 may 2021 and to azerbaijan from 25 to 28 july 2021 2 background 3 for an understanding of the history of the conflict and the position of the assembly reference is made to the former work of the assembly and in particular for an understanding of the history of the conflict and the position of the assembly reference is made to the former work of the assembly and in particular resolution 1416 2005 â the conflict over the nagorno karabakh region dealt with by the osce minsk conferenceâ 4 as the title of that resolution notes this is a conflict over the nagorno karabakh region it is also about the return of 7 surrounding districts to azerbaijan in 1991 at the time of its independence the borders of azerbaijan were internationally recognised including by the council of europe while at the same time the armenian population of the nagorno karabakh region claimed the right to self determination as a consequence of the 1991 1994 war the united nations passed resolutions 822 1993 853 1993 874 1993 and 884 1993 urging the parties to comply and to refrain from any armed hostilities and withdraw military forces from any occupied territories as the title of that resolution notes this is a conflict over the nagorno karabakh region it is also about the return of 7 surrounding districts to azerbaijan in 1991 at the time of its independence the borders of azerbaijan were internationally recognised including by the council of europe while at the same time the armenian population of the nagorno karabakh region claimed the right to self determination as a consequence of the 1991 1994 war the united nations passed resolutions 822 1993 853 1993 874 1993 and 884 1993 urging the parties to comply and to refrain from any armed hostilities and withdraw military forces from any occupied territories 5 both armenia and azerbaijan committed themselves upon their accession to the council of europe in january 2001 to use only peaceful means for settling the conflict at the same time armenia committed itself to use its considerable influence over the nagorno karabakh region to foster a solution to the conflict these commitments remain in place 6 the current report takes into account this background and focuses on humanitarian consequences not political consequences or political solutions it looks primarily at the recent 6 week war and ongoing challenges in addition there are certain humanitarian consequences from the 1991 1994 war and its aftermath which need to be considered the current report takes into account this background and focuses on humanitarian consequences not political consequences or political solutions it looks primarily at the recent 6 week warand ongoing challenges in addition there are certain humanitarian consequences from the 1991 1994 war and its aftermath which need to be considered 7 the main issues to be covered include the dead missing and wounded prisoners of war alleged captives allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts landmines and unexploded ordnance displaced persons border tensions cultural heritage hate speech 2 1 the trilateral statement of 9 10 november 2020 8 the war broke out on 27 september 2020 and after 6 weeks the trilateral statement of 9 10â november 2020 provided the main elements of a cease fire and created a framework to solve many of the humanitarian consequences it was signed by the president of the republic of azerbaijan mrâ ilham aliyev the prime minister of the republic of armenia mrâ nikol pashinyan and the president of the russian federation mrâ vladimir putin 9 the statement included an agreement that armenia and azerbaijan the parties remain in their current positions and that there be a phased return of certain regions this effectively led to the return of the seven surrounding districts and parts of the nagorno karabakh region 10 the statement gave a major role of peacekeeping to the russian federation for a five year renewable period deployed in parallel with the withdrawal of the armenian armed forces 11 the statement also provides for guaranteed safety along the lachin corridor to allow communication between armenia and the nagorno karabakh region 12 an important provision provides for the unblocking of all economic and transport links between the western regions of azerbaijan and the nakhchivan autonomous republic 13 essential to this report on the humanitarian consequences of the conflict are two provisions on displaced persons and on prisoners of war and the dead namely â internally displaced persons and refugees shall return to nagorno karabakh and adjacent areas under the control of the office of the un high commissioner for refugees â â an exchange of prisoners of war hostages and other detained persons and bodies of the dead is to be carried out â essential to this report on the humanitarian consequences of the conflict are two provisions on displaced persons and on prisoners of war and the dead namely 3 humanitarian concerns 3 1 dead missing and wounded 14 the military death toll from the recent 6 week war is understood to stand at 3â 945 armenians and 2â 907 azerbaijanis 15 in terms of civilian casualties the armenian human rights defender has signalled 163 and the azerbaijani side has given a number of 548 including 95 civilian deaths 16 one of the major problems following any war is locating and returning the remains of missing persons the 6 week war was conducted partly in a mountainous region heavily mined with the arrival of snow hard on the heels of combat this made the location and return of bodies all the more difficult 243 armenians and 7 azerbaijanis are still missing with the assistance of the international committee of the red cross icrc the remains of 1â 651 armenians have been returned according to azerbaijan and 395 azerbaijanis dead have been returned by armenia 17 the parties can in general be commended on their efforts to find the remains of the missing from the 6 week war this said finding the outstanding missing must not be the subject of politicisation and families of the missing require additional assistance further steps are needed and full ongoing co operation is necessary under article 8 of the trilateral statement which requires the â exchange of â bodies of the dead â to be carried out â 18 from the war in the nineties there are still 3â 890 azerbaijanis unaccounted for 3â 171 military and 719civilians and around a thousand armenians according to figures provided by each side the families of these persons are waiting for the return of their loved ones almost 30 years on little progress has been made on these files over the last decades and more should now be done in the past an intergovernmental commission was created to deal with the missing working with the icrc this has to be reinvigorated so as to continue the work and dna labs need refurbishing and updating so as to provide answers to the families of the missing 19 it is essential that both sides co operate fully in the identification of burial sites and the return of remains the parties should co operate fully with each other with the icrc and the russian peacekeepers who have been playing an important role in enabling access to recent battlefields and facilitating contacts between the two sides 20 families of the missing have the right to know and require social and psychological support women are usually the ones left to pick up the pieces and have particular needs as heads of households both sides should give consideration to preparing a generic law on the missing in co operation with icrc so as to regulate the different issues arising and the needs of the families in this consideration should be given to previous recommendations of the assembly families of the missing have the right to know and require social and psychological support women are usually the ones left to pick up the pieces and have particular needs as heads of households both sides should give consideration to preparing a generic law on the missing in co operation with icrc so as to regulate the different issues arising and the needs of the families in this consideration should be given to previous recommendations of the assembly 3 2 prisoners of war alleged detainees 21 article 8 of the trilateral statement provides that â an exchange of prisoners of war â is to be carried out â 22 of the different humanitarian issues the question of prisoner release has become one of the most difficult its importance has taken on an additional dimension in the light of the inter state cases and individual petitions introduced before the european court of human rights 23 both sides are under an obligation to make lists of the persons detained and share these with the icrc as well as facilitate visits to the detainees 24 azerbaijan has as at the beginning of august 2021 returned 103 captives according to armenia including civilians and armenia 21 captives according to azerbaijan both sides maintain they have returned or released all prisoners of war but this is contested by armenia 25 there are essentially two different issues at play the first is a dispute over the categorisation of those detained by azerbaijan after the signing of the trilateral statement azerbaijan still held around 45 persons at the beginning of august 2021 this includes many of the 62 armenian soldiers captured in the area of hadrut sometimes the area is referred to as caylaqqala khtsaberd after the signing of the trilateral statement the second is the issue of the whereabouts of those said to have been captured during the war and allegedly seen in captivity or filmed in captivity about whom the azerbaijani authorities indicate they have no information 3 2 1 the hadrut 62 and other captives following the trilateral statement 26 according to azerbaijan these persons were captured on 11 12 december 2020 several weeks after the entry into force of the ceasefire it is claimed they were a terrorist sabotage group deployed within azerbaijan which allegedly killed four azerbaijani soldiers and seriously wounded one civilian five of the 62 were returned to armenia on humanitarian grounds a further three were released in may 2021 and others were released in june and july as part of the release of a total of 30 persons in two groups of 15 this happened at the same time as mine maps were handed over the azerbaijani authorities continue to maintain that those detained are not prisoners of war but are terrorists and not covered by article 8 of the trilateral statement 27 the armenian authorities deny these persons were involved in terrorist activities and state they were carrying out legally mandated military service they point to the fact that hadrut was surrounded and it was a military operation by azerbaijan to take control of the area 28 the exact circumstances of their capture remain unclear but would appear to be linked to the 6 week war and its consequences there have been many calls by the international community for the captives to be released and the rapporteur joins these calls the exact circumstances of their capture remain unclear but would appear to be linked to the 6 week war and its consequences there have been many calls by the international community for the captives to be released and the rapporteur joins these calls 29 it is important to note that the icrc has access to these detainees and visits them on a monthly basis the icrc facilitates letters and video calls with family members the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of the republic of azerbaijan has informed the rapporteur that she visited detainees on four occasions and found them to be well treated testimonies from captives returned to armenia paint a different picture it is important to note that the icrc has access to these detainees and visits them on a monthly basis the icrc facilitates letters and video calls with family members the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of the republic of azerbaijan has informed the rapporteur that she visited detainees on four occasions and found them to be well treated testimonies from captives returned to armenia paint a different picture 30 the rapporteur made repeated requests to be able to meet the captives himself before and during his fact finding visit to azerbaijan in july 2021 not only to verify the well being of the persons concerned but also as a means of confidence building for both sides he regrets very much that this request was not granted notwithstanding the explanation given that visits were restricted to specialised bodies in view of the opaqueness of the situation of armenian captives allegations of ill treatment covered later in this report and that the only international body able to visit captives so far is the icrc the rapporteur considers it is essential that the council of europeâ s own monitoring body the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cpt undertakes a visit as soon as possible furthermore as both the icrc and the cpt work under strict codes of confidentiality it is essential that there be more openness about the situation of these captives this is important in the light of the following paragraphs 3 2 2 alleged captives unacknowledged by the azerbaijani authorities 31 figures of hundreds of individuals allegedly held secretly in captivity have been spoken of but there are many who have fallen in the war and who are missing there are others who may have been identified in videos by multiple families wanting to believe the same person in a blurred image is their son 32 nonetheless the rapporteur has been shown alleged evidence of 31 individuals held captive including videos photographs and information on the place and circumstances of their capture and their identities the rapporteur has also been shown alleged evidence of others held in captivity without the means to identify precisely who they are only that they are captives and not persons otherwise identified this information is available to the european court of human rights and in the hands of the armenian and azerbaijani authorities the rapporteur was able to hand over the list of 31â individuals mentioned to the prosecutor generalâ s office of azerbaijan and also the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of the republic of azerbaijan during his visit 33 the azerbaijani authorities have not been able to acknowledge the whereabouts or fate of these individuals which raises serious concerns including the prospect of enforced disappearances this is all the more disconcerting in the light of allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts covered later in this report 34 the azerbaijani authorities have reportedly set up a task force to look into the fate of these persons and other issues relating to alleged human rights violations they have said they will be sending in batches information on their findings to the european court of human rights it is crucial that this is followed up by the authorities without delay and that full co operation is extended to the european court of human rights 3 2 3 the european court of human rights and interim measures 35 the cornerstone of the council of europe is its european convention on human rights ets no 5 it is the single most important commitment of member states to which both armenia and azerbaijan have signed up the findings of its court are judicial and non political and binding on member states 36 since the outbreak of the 6 week war the european court of human rights has received many requests for interim measures in a decision of 29 september 2020 the court applied rule 39 â calling on both azerbaijan and armenia to refrain from taking any measures in particular military

of human rights on 16 march 2021 made a statement concerning alleged captives taking the unusual step of notifying the committee of ministers of interim measures 41 the court informed the committee of ministers that these measures remained in force concerning 188 armenians allegedly captured by azerbaijan and that the azerbaijani government had failed â to respect the time limits â â and commented

recent release of some of the post trilateral statement captives notably the two releases of 15 persons on 12 june and 3 july 2021 most of the remaining captives are facing or have undergone criminal trials and armenia contends that they are being held and tried on trumped up charges without appropriate european convention on human rights safeguards they have petitioned the european court of human rights on this issue 44 at the end of july 2021 it is reported that more than 60 armenian captives most of whom were captured after the cease fire are standing trial or have been convicted thirty nine

russian armenian was detained in baku and sentenced to 10â years in prison for â terrorist actionsâ and â illegal border crossingâ 45 for the rapporteur the types of charges put forward and the speed with which they have been dealt with raise concerns about the fairness of the proceedings and the politicisation of the issue of the captives this frustrates attempts to build confidence between the two countries and affects those held in captivity and their families these captives should be released without delay 3 3 allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts 46 a great deal of information has been circulated on social media recorded by reputed international ngos documented by the human rights defender and ombudsman on both sides and included in inter state cases and individual cases brought before the european court of human rights 47 highly disturbing images videos and post mortem details have been sent to the rapporteur including of alleged horrific executions

killing citizens by the indiscriminate use of weapons including cluster munitions ballistic missiles and imprecise rockets and artillery they also accuse each other of using phosphorous munitions which set fire to forests in the conflict region 58 the chairperson of the committee on migration mrâ pierre alain fridez at the height of the war made a statement calling for missile strikes on civilian areas to stop he referred specifically to armenian strikes on the town of barda reportedly killing 21 and to an azerbaijani strike which hit a maternity hospital and other infrastructure in

picture of the allegations and the weapons used and the destruction on both sides is available from the armenian and azerbaijani sides including from the human rights defender of the republic of armenia and the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of the republic of azerbaijan both sides during the war had a responsibility to respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians from explosive weapons bound to have a wide impact in civilian areas in view of the number of strikes on civilian areas both sides must have been aware of the effect their attacks would have on civilians 3 3 5 use of mercenaries and foreign fighters during the recent 6 week war 62 the un working group on the use of mercenaries has commented on widespread reports that azerbaijan with turkeyâ s assistance used syrian fighters during the six week war including on the frontline the fighters appeared to be motivated primarily by private gain and in the case of death their relatives were reportedly promised financial compensation as well as turkish nationality the chair of the working group indicated that the way these individuals were recruited transported and used in and around the conflict zone appeared to be consistent with the definition of a mercenary the rapporteur has seen photographs and videos and reports which back up these allegations the un working group on the use of

armenians from different countries and a number of other nationals alleged to be involved the un working group also received reports indicating that armenia used foreign nationals during the six week war the rapporteur received a detailed list of armenians from different countries and a number of other nationals alleged to be involved 3 3 6 concluding remarks on allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts 64 while both sides deny the authenticity of certain information there is evidence of an extremely disturbing nature that cannot be put aside and both countries need to fully investigate the allegations and bring to justice anyone including at command level found to be responsible for crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts both countries should co operate fully with the european court of human rights on the complaints lodged against them turkey also needs to co operate fully with the court in relation to accusations made by armenia including on the issue of recruitment of mercenaries unless there is accountability and compensation for victims and unless there is some form of truth and reconciliation these allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts will poison relations between the two countries for generations and the consequences of the conflict will linger 3 4 landmines and unexploded ordnance 65 the conflict over the nagorno karabakh region is said to have resulted in one of the most contaminated regions in the world both sides planted mines in the early 1990s and afterwards new mines were reportedly laid by retreating armenian forces in the 6 week war 66 mines are not generally prohibited under international law the use of mines is however strictly limited by codified general principles of the law of war 67 armenia and azerbaijan are not parties to many of the international texts and as such this complicates the demining of the conflict region nonetheless according to customary international humanitarian law demining is in principle the responsibility of the party that has carried out the mining furthermore in peace agreements plans for mine clearance must be exchanged between the parties and forwarded to the un secretary general and responsibility for mine clearance has to be defined armenia and azerbaijan are not parties to many of the international texts and as such this complicates the demining of the conflict region nonetheless according to customary international humanitarian law demining is in principle the responsibility of the party that has carried out the mining furthermore in peace agreements plans for mine clearance must be exchanged between the parties and forwarded to the un secretary general and responsibility for mine clearance has to be defined 3 4 1 extent of mines and unexploded ordnance 68 it is impossible to give an accurate figure although it can be said that all regions affected by the conflict have been affected by mines and unexploded ordnance it is impossible to give an accurate figure although it can be said that all regions affected by the conflict have been affected by mines and unexploded ordnance 69 mine clearance has been an ongoing struggle for both sides even before the six week war 70 on the azerbaijani side mine clearance has been strengthened since the signing of an agreement between the anama azerbaijan national agency for mine action and the united nations development program undp in march 2021 this co operation is not new and anama and the undp have jointly eliminated more than 800â 000 mines and other explosive objects over the past 20â years on the azerbaijani side mine clearance has been strengthened since the signing of an agreement between the anama azerbaijan national agency for mine action and the united nations development program undp in march 2021 this co operation is not new and anama and the undp have jointly eliminated more than 800â 000 mines and other explosive objects over the past 20â years 71 on the armenian side the british charity halo trust is helping in mines clearance since 2000 it has provided the only large scale mine clearance capacity in the nagorno karabakh region clearing almost 500 minefields 3 4 2 casualties 72 the conflict area remains riddled with mines and casualties are high 73 between 1999 and 2017 147 armenians and 373 azerbaijanis were said to be victims of mines and accidents continue to occur according to the azerbaijani authorities since the end of the 6 week war 140â persons have been injured including 27 killed between 1999 and 2017 147 armenians and 373 azerbaijanis were said to be victims of mines and accidents continue to occur according to the azerbaijani authorities since the end of the 6 week war 140â persons have been injured including 27 killed 74 azerbaijan accuses armenia of not providing maps of the minefields for many months after the end of the war no progress was made on this but on 12 june 2021 armenia provided maps indicating 97â 000 mines in the region of aghdam while simultaneously azerbaijan released 15 armenian captives this was an important step in confidence building and cleared the way to a further handing over of maps of 92â 000 mines in the fuzuli and zangilan districts on 3 july 2021 along with a further release of 15â armenian captives mine maps from other districts could reveal once handed over up to a million further mines according the azerbaijani authorities azerbaijan accuses armenia of not providing maps of the minefields for many months after the end of the war no progress was made on this but on 12 june 2021 armenia provided maps indicating 97â 000 mines in the region of aghdam while simultaneously azerbaijan released 15 armenian captives this was an important step in confidence building and cleared the way to a further handing over of maps of 92â 000 mines in the fuzuli and zangilan districts on 3 july 2021 along with a further release of 15â armenian captives mine maps from other districts could reveal once handed over up to a million further mines according the azerbaijani authorities 75 the situation is clear on a humanitarian front and in terms of international humanitarian law both sides need to co operate fully and armenia is obliged to share without delay the maps that it has in its possession this is essential to minimise the ongoing loss of life and allow the gradual return of displaced persons to these mined areas 76 both countries require assistance in clearing mines this includes human resources equipment training and funding in the latter respect it is important to note that the average cost of removing a single mine ranges from us 300 to us 1â 000 it should also be kept in mind that relevant mine and unexploded ordnance awareness programmes are essential for the civilian population and support for victims has to be provided 3 5 displaced persons 3 5 1 armenia 77 not since the arrival of around 300â 000 refugees and displaced persons from the 1990â s war and events preceding it has armenia faced such a displacement at the height of the 6 week war there were around 91â 000 displaced persons predominantly women and children and elderly men most found accommodation and shelter in yerevan or elsewhere in armenia many staying with host families short term accommodation was also provided in hotels and other places often in regions close to the conflict the spread of covid 19 during the period exacerbated the problem of dealing with the needs of the displaced persons 78 of those who were originally displaced many returned to stepanekert khankendi and other parts of the nagorno karabakh region which remained under the control of armenia 79 as at the end of may 2021 there remained 36â 882 armenians from the conflict living in a refugee like situation 85â of them women and children there are some who will return when they are more certain of security particularly women and children and there are some who plan to move abroad there is a large category of around 24â 615 who come from areas returned under azerbaijani control and the rapporteur understands that there have been no returns to these areas and the persons concerned are unlikely to return returns have now largely dried up to a trickle and even if returns are the favoured option these should be voluntary in safety and in dignity and no undue pressure should be put on persons to return as at the end of may 2021 there remained 36â 882armenians from the conflict living in a refugee like situation 85â of them women and children there are some

trickle and even if returns are the favoured option these should be voluntary in safety and in dignity and no undue pressure should be put on persons to return 80 the first priority that the armenian authorities faced at the outbreak of the six week war was dealing with basic humanitarian needs including shelter food medical matters and education for children in the nagorno karabakh region where the un and unhcr and other international organisations do not have access the icrc was almost the only international presence along with the halo trust demining doctors without borders and a few other ngos 81 for those displaced while they have the same rights as citizens of the republic of armenia they remain socially and psychologically vulnerable similar to those in a refugee situation 82 the armenian government allocated financial support to those affected by the conflict including the displaced the families of civilian victims and persons with disabilities those who lost their homes family members of missing servicemen and injured servicemen they provided medical care and unemployment benefit for displaced persons and assistance for those who hosted displaced persons 83 according to the human rights defender of armenia the education of about 30â 000 school and kindergarten children was affected and 12 kindergartens and 71 schools were damaged or destroyed 84 in the first days of the war once the primary needs of food hygiene and shelter were catered for the authorities started providing cash assistance monthly allowances the rapporteur understands that the continuation of these cash support programmes will be a challenge including for international organisations providing funding as they require guarantees to ensure delivery in line with donor requirements in the first days of the war once the primary needs of food hygiene and shelter were catered for the authorities started providing cash assistance monthly allowances the rapporteur understands that the continuation of these cash support programmes will be a challenge including for international organisations providing funding as they require guarantees to ensure delivery in line with donor requirements 85 alongside cash assistance one of the major priorities is to provide long term shelter for those displaced and unlikely to return this means building new houses and apartments and dealing with in the longer term issues of property rights 86 providing livelihoods for those who cannot return is also a challenge over 50 are women and there is a need to tailor support including temporary job creation schemes in their favour public works are now the main source of employment but this creates a gender challenge as most jobs are seen to be â for menâ many persons are also racking up debts and require income to pay for rent so access to work is important there is also the dimension that employment gives in terms of self satisfaction 87 children make up between 32 42 of the displaced and while their basic needs are being met further access to education for example access to computers and computer tablets and ensuring that shelters are closer to schools and psycho social support is required 88 those who remained in the nagorno karabakh region or returned are facing a range of problems as outlined to the rapporteur by persons from the region when he met with them in yerevan or in on line meetings they feel isolated and frustrated with the international community and as one person said â during the war no one came after the war no one cameâ this is a reference to the lack of access to the territory and presence in the territory by international organisations with the exception of the icrc 89 persons from the region also raised what they felt were existential threats to their future referring to hate speech and alleged atrocities committed during the six week war they spoke as well of insecurity due to the vicinity of azerbaijani troops shots being fired day and night and security concerns when on the road particularly if crossing between sides in the fields and visiting graves threats from mines and unexploded ordnance also remain an issue persons from the region also raised what they felt were existential threats to their future referring to hate speech and alleged atrocities committed during the six week war they spoke as well of insecurity due to the vicinity of azerbaijani troops shots being fired day and night and security concerns when on the road particularly if crossing between sides in the fields and visiting graves threats from mines and unexploded ordnance also remain an issue 90 their basic needs are apparently being met even if there are pockets of problems a number of houses were destroyed during the recent war and the housing stock is insufficient to house those displaced including those from other parts of the conflict region who wish to resettle there are plans to build 1â 600 houses including 1â 000 houses which are to be provided by the russia federation electricity has been a problem as the number of power plants has reportedly been reduced from 36 to 6 due to the war and water supply has also reportedly been a problem furthermore for those injured during the war rehabilitation and health care often means travelling to yerevan 91 in terms of livelihoods there is not much available in the nagorno karabakh region apart from public employment and temporary employment contracts which is why direct financial assistance is required financial strain is however alleviated through the provision of utilities free of charge there is a lack of jobs for women and capacity building is needed to promote livelihoods which is something the international community could support and promote more 3 5 1 1 international assistance 92 in terms of assistance the icrc plays an essential role being almost the only international organisation that has access to the whole conflict region during and after the end of the conflict it has provided medical supplies food parcels hygiene items heaters financial assistance water and habitat support education materials for children as well as briefings on weapons contamination it has also visited prisoners of war undertaken prisoner exchanges and assisted with the location of missing persons and the return of the remains of the fallen the icrc has been financially supported in particular by the european union and at the end of june 2021 the icrc announced an increase in its mission budget for the nagorno karabakh region to a level of â 50 million 93 under paragraph 7 of the trilateral statement it is provided that â internally displaced persons and refugees shall return to nagorno karabakh and adjacent areas under the control of the office of the un high commissioner for refugeesâ however unhcr has so far not been able to negotiate access and the same applies to other un agencies and international organisations including the council of europe this is highly regrettable and both armenia and azerbaijan share a responsibility for the situation which adversely affects the delivery of humanitarian aid the rights of the persons living in the area and the ability to monitor what is happening the rapporteur recognises that his report is weakened by his inability to visit the conflict region and see for himself 94 in order to deal with displacement and other humanitarian issues the united nations has set up a co ordination structure under the lead of a resident coordinatorâ s office and unhcr for current priorities the un requires us 62 1 million it carries out work under a number of working groups and sub working groups these include â protectionâ focusing on those living in a refugee like situation â shelter and non food itemsâ including the â cash sub working groupâ other working groups cover â food security and nutritionâ â healthâ and â early recoveryâ which provides livelihoods to those who cannot return in

armenia in general and stated on 9 july 2021 that it would mobilise a further â 1 billion in assistance which goes beyond the â 1 6 billion previously announced 96 the russian federation has also been providing substantial aid to victims of the conflict and in april 2021 it was reported to have provided us 15 million aid to victims working through its interagency center for humanitarian reaction in addition it has played an important role in securing the trilateral statement and its peacekeeping contingent has helped to guarantee security and stability and assisted in the location of missing

basis of on going needs assessments to be undertaken with international donors focusing in particular on those who are unable to return as well as the most vulnerable the rapporteur understands that armenia is preparing a large scale humanitarian appeal it is important that this focusses not only on recovery but also on peace building the council of europe in its current action plan for armenia and in preparing a new action plan 2023 2026 could provide expertise in designing and implementing policies towards displaced persons to ensure they are human rights compatible consideration should in particular be given to confidence building peace building measures gender equality tolerance and property issues 3 5 2 azerbaijan 98 for azerbaijan the six week war has had major consequences for displaced persons around 40â 000 were temporarily displaced during the recent war almost all of whom have returned the great challenge now is the return and settlement of displaced persons and refugees from the 1990s where estimates are given of around 650â 000 internally displaced approximately 200â 000 refugees and 45â 000 meskhetian turk refugees 99 of the 40â 000 persons displaced during the recent war almost all have been able to return and their homes where damaged have either been repaired or are under repair children whose schooling was disrupted have been able to return 100 in relation to the displaced and the refugees from the 1990s it has taken decades to deal with their transitory durable displacement more than 7 7 billion azerbaijani manats â 3 82 billion including 1 4 billion provided by humanitarian agencies have been spent on this legislation was adopted to deal with their needs housing was provided free of charge monthly allowances were provided and many of the displaced persons were employed by the state or in seasonal work over 315â 000 persons were provided with improved accommodation the assembly had the possibility to look into their situation on various occasions including in in relation to the displaced and the refugees from the 1990s it has taken decades to deal with their transitory durable displacement more than 7 7 billion

refugees and displaced persons in armenia azerbaijan and georgiaâ and recommendation 1570 2002 â situation of refugees and displaced persons in armenia azerbaijan and georgiaâ 101 now that it is possible to plan for returns a new law on returnees is under preparation and the views of unhcr are under consideration before these people return the territories need demining and only then can re construction take place according to a recent survey 65â of those displaced want to go back and the authorities believe more will wish to return once infrastructure is in place the extent of the challenge is huge and there will be many associated issues including providing basic infrastructure livelihoods healthcare education etc to deal with this 17 working groups have been set up across state entities handling the logistics of such a large operation this will take not just years but possibly decades although the first pilot resettlement could occur in 2023 the ministry of economy has developed a draft â state programme on the restoration and sustainable development of the liberated territories of azerbaijan for 2021 2025â it aims to restore and reconstruct the liberated territories integrate them into the country s economy ensure sustainable and balanced development and achieve high standards of social welfare 102 the rapporteur was able to visit one of the areas concerned aghdam and see the total destruction and view the project for reconstruction this will be part of a plan to build 9 10 new cities ensuring sustainable living conditions in smart city projects the project will need to take into account that many of those displaced from the region previously worked in agriculture but are now urbanised the authorities do not plan to rush these projects and sensibly prefer to go at a pace which assures their success 103 there is currently limited assistance provided by the international community to azerbaijan while during the 6 week war the authorities chose to handle the displacement challenge on their own dealing with the return of the displaced from the early 1990s will be a much more complex and expensive issue unhcr and un agencies have offered to help in particular on legal aspects and property issues linked to return the european union has recently put forward an aid package of â 140 million in favour of azerbaijan this is substantially less than that provided to armenia the international community is encouraged to provide assistance to azerbaijan for both recovery and peace building there is currently limited

provide assistance to azerbaijan for both recovery and peace building 3 6 border tensions 104 the trilateral statement provides in article 1 for â a complete ceasefire and termination of all hostilities in the area of the nagorno karabakh conflictâ and for â the republic of azerbaijan and the republic of armenia â to â stop in their current positionsâ 105 the recent border tensions started on 12 may 2021 with alleged border incursions by azerbaijan into the armenian region of syunik and more particular the area of black lake on the same day azerbaijani media reported azerbaijani armed forces would soon be holding military exercises with up to 15â 000 troops 300 tanks and other equipment this created even greater tension in the region 106 in relation to this incident azerbaijan said their troops were taking up positions after the winter and were not deployed on armenian territory and disputed the maps in armeniaâ s hands and put forward other maps 107 armenia triggered article 2 of the collective security treaty which provides â in case of menace to safety stability territorial integrity and sovereignty of one or several member states â â a mechanism of joint consultations to coordinate positions and take appropriate measures can be launched 108 steps were however taken over the next days to ease tension with the involvement of russian peacekeepers and also mediation at a political level with the ministers of foreign affairs of the russian federation france and tajikistan who chairs the collective security treaty organization all sides stressed the importance of resolving tension through political and diplomatic means 109 since then border incidents have continued on a semi regular basis at different points along the border there have been people injured and killed and armenian servicemen have been detained sparking a request for interim measures to the european court of human rights to protect their rights since then border incidents have continued on a semi regular basis at different points along the border there have been people injured and killed and armenian servicemen have been detained sparking a request for interim measures to the european court of human rights to protect their rights 110 incidents have continued throughout june and july 2021 with regular allegations of shots being fired by both sides and further skirmishes leading to injuries and loss of life the rapporteur felt compelled to make a statement on 30 july 2021 regretting the death of three armenian servicemen and one azerbaijani serviceman calling on the parties to de escalate and noting that the long standing humanitarian concerns affecting the lives of individuals each side of the border cannot be addressed unless violence stops the co chairs of the osce minsk group also made a statement calling for immediate de escalation and comprehensive implementation of the truce of 9 november the russian minister of foreign affairs joined in calls on the parties to show restraint incidents have continued throughout june and july 2021 with regular allegations of shots being fired by both sides and further skirmishes leading to injuries and loss of life the rapporteur felt compelled to make a statement on 30 july 2021 regretting the death of three armenian servicemen and one azerbaijani serviceman calling on the parties to de

group also made a statement calling for immediate de escalation and comprehensive implementation of the truce of 9 november the russian minister of foreign affairs joined in calls on the parties to show restraint 111 the rapporteur is not able to assess who is to blame for each incident 112 allegations of shootings in the vicinity of border villages referred to on a number of occasions by the human rights defender of the republic of armenia are of concern this has a destabilising impact on border communities in terms of their security well being access to their pastures and communication links 113 it is essential that there is a de escalation and that both sides adapt to a new proximity and the challenge this creates it is essential that talks on demarcation and delimitation continue and further consideration should be given to having a monitoring mission along the border whether organised by the osce minsk group the collective security treaty organization the un or others both sides should keep to the positions dictated under the trilateral statement and persons captured during border skirmishes should be released 114 while it will take time to regulate and solve border issues the trilateral statement does provide a positive hope for the potential reopening of transport links between armenia and azerbaijan and possibly as an offshoot also between armenia and turkey this will bring benefits to all concerned and could be what is required to start an effective process of reconciliation and peacebuilding both sides will need to negotiate on this and azerbaijan should refrain from any threat to open a right of passage by force 3 7 cultural heritage 115 the long running conflict has had a devastating impact on the cultural heritage of the region affecting both sides 116 azerbaijan points to massive destruction which took place during the 1991 1994 war and its aftermath in the areas of fuzuli aghdam but also in shusha shushi and elsewhere it also refers to looting and destruction at the end of the 6 week war 117 the ministry of culture of azerbaijan is currently carrying out an investigation to determine the degree of cultural damage the results of the preliminary investigation indicate damage or destruction of 706 state registered historical and cultural monuments 6 of world class architecture 5 of world class archaeology 119 of national importance 121 of national archaeological importance along with damage or destruction to other architecture parks monument and decorative applied art of local importance and significance 118 azerbaijan also alleges that more recently artefacts and ancient manuscripts of 13th century khudavang dadivank monastery as well as precious artefacts found during archaeological excavations have been illegally transported to armenia azerbaijan also allegesthat more recently artefacts and ancient manuscripts of 13th century khudavang dadivank monastery as well as precious artefacts found during archaeological excavations have been illegally transported to armenia 119 azerbaijan is currently negotiating with unesco concerning access to the region to carry out an independent technical mission with the aim of assessing the status of this heritage 120 the rapporteur was able to see the extent of some of this damage and destruction during his visit to aghdam the city once home to around 28â 000 residents with the region having well over 100â 000 residents is now an uninhabitable wasteland not just because of land mines but because almost all the buildings have been destroyed and building materials or objects of value even from graves looted the mosque in aghdam with its two minarets is more or less the only building left standing it was allegedly used for a period of time until it was wired off to keep livestock the extent of damage to homes and cultural heritage in particular in the seven districts returned to azerbaijan during and after the conflict is massive and shocking and will take many years and substantial resources to bring the area back to life the first priority will be demining and then infrastructure has to be created homes built services provided livelihoods created and areas repopulated the position is dramatic and as one senior member of the international community commented to the rapporteur â we should all have done more over the last 30 years to prevent this level of destructionâ 121 damage and destruction have also taken place of armenian cultural heritage evidence has been provided of the destruction in the 1990s of armenian cultural heritage in nakhchivan autonomous republic with allegations that 89 medieval churches 5â 840 carved cross stones khachkars and 22â 000 historical tombstones have been vandalized and ultimately erased damage and destruction have also taken place of armenian cultural heritage evidence has been providedof the destruction in the 1990s of armenian cultural heritage in nakhchivan autonomous republic with allegations that 89 medieval churches 5â 840 carved cross stones khachkars and 22â 000 historical tombstones have been vandalized and ultimately erased 122 during the 6 week war armenia alleged the deliberate shelling of the st holy saviour ghazanchetsots cathedral in shusha shushi human rights watch has documented the attack and noted from its nature and the choice of guided weapon that â the church a civilian object with cultural significance was an intentional target despite the absence of evidence that it was used for military purposesâ other alleged deliberate destruction raised by armenia relates to the dome and bell towers of the kanach zham green church following the end of the conflict armenia alleges ongoing acts of destruction including the removal of a recently constructed church st maryâ s church near jebrail jabrayil the demolition of the 18th century armenian cemetery in the village of sghnakh signaq and the demolition of the armenian 19th century cemetery in the village of mets tagher boyuk taghlar during the 6 week war armenia alleged the deliberate shelling of the st holy saviour ghazanchetsots cathedral in shusha shushi human rights watch has documented the attack and noted from its nature and the choice of guided weapon that â the church a civilian object with cultural significance was an intentional target despite the absence of evidence that it was used for military purposesâ other alleged deliberate destruction raised by armenia relates to the dome and bell towers of the kanach zham green church following the end of the

in the village of sghnakh signaq and the demolition of the armenian 19th century cemetery in the village of mets tagher boyuk taghlar 123 the rapporteurâ s meeting with archbishop nathan hovhannisyan of the mother see gave the rapporteur a sense of how important religious monuments churches khachkars stone crosses and other religious heritage are for the people of armenia and the extent of the concern for the cultural heritage under azerbaijani control since the end of the 6 week war this is said to include 161â churches and monasteries 591 stone crosses 345 valuable tombstones 108 cemeteries and sacral sights 43â fortresses and palaces and 208 other types of monuments a further concern raised was for the security of the functioning monastery of dadivank khudavang and for the clergy who have remained under the security of russian peacekeepers 124 armenia has furthermore alleged that azerbaijan is actively engaged in historical revisionism and cultural appropriation by asserting that armenian churches in the region are not armenian but â caucasian albanianâ an ancient christian people from the early medieval period this revisionism armenia claims is also leading to the defacing and destruction of churches and monuments and a general attempt to negate armeniaâ s history and religion the rapporteur met with the state service for protection development and restoration of the cultural heritage of azerbaijan during his fact finding visit to baku the importance of the â caucasian albanianâ heritage for azerbaijan was emphasised and assurances were given that azerbaijan would do nothing to destroy what it considers to be its own cultural heritage armenia has furthermore alleged that azerbaijan is actively engaged in historical revisionism and cultural appropriation by asserting that armenian churches in the region are not armenian but â caucasian albanianâ an ancient christian people from the early medieval period this revisionism armenia claims is also leading to the defacing and destruction of churches and monuments and a general attempt to negate armeniaâ s history and religion the rapporteur met with the state service for protection development and restoration of the cultural heritage of azerbaijan during his fact finding visit to baku the importance of the â caucasian albanianâ heritage for azerbaijan was emphasised and assurances were given that azerbaijan would do nothing to destroy what it considers to be its own cultural heritage 125 it is clear there has been extensive wanton destruction of the heritage of the region by both sides going back decades this spiral has continued during the 6 week war leading to further destruction of cultural heritage important for armenians there is evidence that this destruction is continuing there is an opportunity to stop this cycle and for this it is essential that unesco is given access as soon as possible to all relevant areas in both countries 126 the rapporteur is concerned about the current narrative being developed in azerbaijan promoting a â caucasian albanianâ cultural narrative while seeking to negate an â armenianâ cultural narrative while the whole region was certainly under the influence of different religions and people over history steps to create such a new narrative negating armenian cultural heritage in particular in the light of and in response to a long running 30 year conflict should be avoided this is a matter which unesco should look at to avoid manipulation by one side or the other 127 to conclude both sides have a justified deep sense of grievance but as the director general of unesco audrey azoulay said on 18 november 2020 after speaking to both sides â damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever means damage to the cultural heritage of all mankindâ she also recalled un security council resolution 2347 2017 which stresses that â the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage looting and smuggling of cultural property in the event of armed conflict including by terrorist groups and attempts to deny historical roots and cultural diversity in this context can fuel and exacerbate conflicts and impede post conflict national reconciliationâ â 3 8 hate speech 128 the rapporteur is greatly concerned by hate speech and its consequences during the 6 week war it has been a long standing problem as noted in reports of the european commission against racism and intolerance ecri the advisory committee on the framework convention for the protection of national minorities has also highlighted the issue in relation to azerbaijan the rapporteur is greatly concerned by hate speech and its consequences during the 6 week war it has been a long standing problem as noted in reports of the european commission against racism and intolerance ecri the advisory committee on the framework convention for the protection of national minoritieshas also highlighted the issue in relation to azerbaijan 129 generations of armenians and azerbaijanis have now been raised with the rhetoric of hostility and hate which has contributed to the violence and the alleged abuse and atrocities and destruction committed during the 6 week war 130 during the recent war the level of hate speech and hate crimes on both sides reached a shocking level instances have been documented by both the human rights defender of armenia and the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of azerbaijan during the recent war the level of hate speech and hate crimes on both sides reached a shocking level instances have been documented by both the human rights defender of armeniaand the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of azerbaijan 131 many examples have been put forward ranging from frequent denigrating references to armenians as â dogsâ and the azerbaijanis as â turksâ new and old graffiti on churches and mosques and there have been serious cases of incitement to hatred and killings addressed towards armenians and azerbaijanis including towards children horrendous alleged acts of abuse and executions have been filmed and distributed on social media and should be considered as hate crimes and legislated against in so far as this is not already the case persons responsible for spreading these types of messages should be held accountable 132 the rapporteur heard various statements during his fact finding visit that azerbaijan was proud of its multiculturalism notwithstanding this statements at the highest level continue to portray armenians in such a way that cannot be considered as tolerant with the 6 week war over now should be the time to build peace and reconciliation and not a time of hate speech no matter how bitter the war or the past the way in which azerbaijanâ s victory has been portrayed in the so called military â trophy parkâ in baku in particular the mannequins of armenians shown in a denigrating fashion caricatured and stereotyped is not appropriate as the council of europe commissioner for human rights said on 27â april 2021 â i consider such images highly disturbing and humiliating â this kind of display can only further intensify and strengthen long standing hostile sentiments and hate speech and multiply and promote manifestations of intolerance â the rapporteur agrees while the azerbaijani authorities correctly refer to the existence of war museums in other countries the use of caricatured and stereotyped mannequins exacerbates levels of intolerance and should have no place in any museum or society 133 both sides allege that the other continue irredentist discourse threatening their own territorial integrity and this does not help in terms of confidence building measures both sides should refrain from any such hostile rhetoric 134 the rapporteur understands that the recent war is still raw and that real tolerance will take years and possibly generations but both the armenian and azerbaijani authorities have a responsibility to stop the rhetoric of hatred including for short term political gain and recognise the responsibility they have towards current and future generations 135 the council of europe can play a role in assisting both countries in monitoring and dealing with hate speech this should be a priority action for the council of europe building on work undertaken in the past a needs assessment should be carried out to assess how best council of europe expertise including its standards monitoring findings and co operation efforts can be taken into account and the findings should be reflected in new action plans being prepared for azerbaijan 2022 2025 and armenia 2023 2026 encouraging tolerance and tackling hate speech will require a long term approach going beyond the use of criminal law in view of the sensitivity of the issues involved and will require genuine commitment of the parties and sustained resources this should be an important contribution to confidence building between the two countries 4 conclusions 136 the council of europe will have an important role to play as armenia and azerbaijan work towards a post conflict situation the humanitarian consequences as identified in this report are significant and can only be dealt with over a long period of time some form of truth and reconciliation will be needed to allow both sides to move beyond the trauma fear and intolerance and even hatred that is still present and the monitoring bodies of the council of europe the european court of human rights and the intergovernmental and expert bodies co operation programmes and country offices of the council of europe will each have a role to play the country specific action plans of the council of europe will be essential and the new action plans under preparation for armenia 2023 2026 and azerbaijan 2022 2025 will need to take into account the challenges of dealing with the consequences of a long lasting conflict and the recent 6 week war

beyond single malt scotch rare irish whisky cognac and armagnac are commanding ever increasing prices this beautiful level of whiskies play a hugely important role because what they re doing is bringing depth to the category as well as intrigue and desirability at this top level what you re playing with is rarity and uniqueness posits gordon macphail s stephen rankin from his home in elgin scotland in the same way as limited edition ferraris or bugattis why does one need to exist you can t drive it on the open road it goes too fast but like a car the difference with this whisky as opposed to coins or whatever other stock investment is it is something you can experience you can drink it as director of prestige at the esteemed family owned whisky label it is literally rankin s job to guide the growth and release of their treasured casks founded in 1895 as an elevated shop for luxury goods gordon macphail soon started buying whisky from nearby distilleries casking it themselves in ex sherry and bourbon american oak and meticulously shepherding the aging process they were the first to offer single estate or single malt bottles and even today still only sell whisky which they ve completely aged themselves it s an incredible honour to work with such liquid imagine sitting on the shoulder of leonardo davinci while he paints the mona lisa and then saying to people decades later oh i saw him paint that he says it does feel that we re often exploring very much uncharted waters with a lot of these releases because nobody s ever done something with this age before while venerable maestros like gordon macphail the macallan bowmore and the balvenie have pioneered the surging single malt scotch craze other categories are starting to see their values climb as well just across the north channel from scotland lies the country that is said to have invented whiskey sometime around the 14th century ireland and interest in its rare gems like knappogue castle 1951 have seen significant growth over the past few years as brand director jon dubin tells us and i am very optimistic about the future of the category first made available in 1998 knappogue castle sells a bottle of its treasured 1951 for about us 2 000 with the double digit growth of scotch single malts there s a huge opportunity for the irish whisky category to capture some of that market share says dubin taking a far more precious approach with its juice is the nascent craft irish whiskey co whose second release the emerald isle collection snatches the crown as the oldest triple distilled irish whiskey in the world made in collaboration with celebrated russian jewellers fabergé all seven of its bespoke experience boxes will be sold exclusively via private auction the dark walnut treasure chests come replete with a celtic fabergé egg bespoke oneof a kind fabergé altruist 18k rose gold timepiece a rough uncut zambian emerald presented on a gold guilloché enameled clawfoot base and a humidor with two rare cohiba siglo vi gran reserva cigars and a gold plated cigar cutter naturally the munificent casks also boast a flask a gold plated water pipette obsidian stones and a carafe filled with authentic irish spring water oh and two bottles of 30 year old triple distilled spirit which craft irish whiskey co claims to be the rarest irish whiskey in existence the first auction held in texas in february started at us 2 million outside of whiskey the categories experts look at to experience the most growth at this auction level are cognac and armagnac the reason for this is twofold scarcity as especially armagnac is mostly made by small rustic producers and aging as both cognac and armagnac s complexities only increase the older they stay in the barrel compare this to spirits like bourbon and rum which not only see huge angel s share losses but are spirits which many experts see peaking after 10 20 years of aging but even these french spirits have a ways to catch up which also means either are a fantastic place to potentially start your investment portfolio at a whisky auction event in february a domaine de la vie cognac from 1777 sold for us 56 000 making it amongst the most expensive cognacs in the world but for a spirit that dates back to the american revolution nearly a quarter of a millennium ago that price sounds well reasonable compared to some single malts other bottles in the sale were an 1802 vintage for us 20 000 and a 1906 for us 6 500 over the past year luxury spirits have experienced unprecedented demand and cognac is no exception explains d ussé cellar master michel casavecchia highlighting that not only is cognac the fastest growing spirit sales up 62 from 2019 to 2020 but his d ussé label is the fastest growing in the category recently the brand which belongs to the château de cognac house released a 1969 anniversaire limited edition poured into a 12 cut crystal diamond decanter replete with 24 karat gold foil and signed by d ussé co founder jay z this bottle no 1 was auctioned off by sotheby s in march for us 52 000 casavecchia believes lack of awareness is partly responsible for cognac s slower uptake but that s changing quickly we see single malts at auctions all the time auctioning a fine scotch is nearly as common as fine art or cars so they have the reputation as a spirit high in value as a craft product with extremely limited production he notes that cognac makes up less than one percent of the world s spirits by volume it simply doesn t have the same recognition as other more mainstream options one young label looking to leverage the apparent undervaluation of armagnac is bhakta 50 their first expression is a thing of exquisite treasure blending eight ultra rare armagnac vintages the oldest from 1868 predates the incandescent light bulb even the youngest vintage from 1970 is more than half a century in the making after marrying and finishing in islay whisky casks the ancient armagnac is decanted into a stylish art nouveau bottle the oldest spirits have always been and will likely always be the most valuable offers founder raj bhakta we all love the idea of drinking something that has waited lifetimes to touch our lips when you get it right there is no replacement for age bhakta believes in the soaring valuation of his super aged armagnac so much that he s launched a stockholder program subscription model with only 125 openings subscribers will receive two bottles from each of the thirty eight 400 litre barrels bhakta will release over 12 months a prospectus for the stockholder program estimates a 20 annual price appreciation a bold prediction that allows bhakta to charge 1 000 more for the subscription than you d pay retail for each bottle of course irish whiskey cognac armagnac rum bourbon and others would all like to experience single malt scotch s generous returns but there are key factors in whiskey s financial resilience explains andy simpson a market analyst and co founder of rare whisky 101 scarcity vs demand desirability quality and intrigue passion being the most powerful the small volumes of collectable bottles in the market compared to wine as a good example means acquiring meaningful bottles is becoming harder every year simpson notes couple that with global increasing demand for rare old bottles of scotch and it s almost a perfect storm assetclass having followed single malt scotch prices for over 20 years simpson s rw101 closely tracks the market with indexes like their icon 1000 which calculates a 40 year over year valuation of highly collectible scotch whiskies since it began keeping track in 2008 meaning bhakta s ambitious 20 valuation is possible but so far factors like demand and desirability fall behind single malt scotch the difference is before in scotch you only had the big boys doing these serious super aged limited edition whiskeys now every distillery in scotland are all launching 40 and 50 year old whiskeys and charging some serious prices notes sukhinder singh co owner and founder of the whisky exchange a leading global retailer of fine spirits with an award winning online shop and

with more than 40 million doses of coronavirus vaccines available u s health authorities said they re confident there will be enough for both qualified older americans seeking booster shots and the young children for whom initial vaccines are expected to be approved in the not too distant future the spike in demand expected following last week s federal recommendation on booster shots would be the first significant jump in months more than 70 million americans remain unvaccinated despite the enticement of lottery prizes free food or gifts and pleas from exhausted health care workers as the average number of deaths per day climbed to more than 1 900 in recent weeks federal and state health authorities said current supply and steady production of more doses can easily accommodate those seeking boosters or initial vaccination avoiding a repeat of the frustratingly slow rollout of covid 19 vaccines across the country early this year i hope that we have the level of interest in the booster that we need more vaccines colorado gov jared polis said tuesday that s simply not where we are today we have plenty of vaccines robust supply in the u s enabled president joe biden this week to promise an additional 500 million of pfizer s covid 19 shots to share with the world doubling the united states global contribution aid groups and health organizations have pushed the u s and other countries to improve vaccine access in countries where even the most vulnerable people haven t had a shot among the challenges states face is not ordering too many doses and letting them go to waste several states with low vaccination rates including idaho and kansas have reported throwing away thousands of expired doses or are struggling to use vaccines nearing expiration this fall while most vaccines can stay on the shelf unopened for months once a vial is opened the clock starts ticking vaccines are only usable for six to 12 hours depending on the manufacturer according to the u s food and drug administration moderna vaccines come in vials containing 11 to 15 doses pfizer vials contain up to six doses and johnson johnson vials five doses we are going to see more doses that go unused over time said wisconsin s health secretary karen timberlake they come in multidose files they don t come in nice tidy individual single serving packages state health officials said they have tried to request only what health care providers and pharmacies expect to need from the federal supply those numbers have dwindled since the vaccines became widely available in early spring but u s officials holding out hope that some of the unvaccinated will change their minds are trying to keep enough vaccines in stock so all americans can get them that balancing act is tricky and can lead to consternation around the globe as the u s sits on unused vaccines while many countries in places such as africa can t get enough vaccines somebody sitting in a country with few resources to access vaccines seeing people in the u s able to walk into a pharmacy and get that vaccine and choosing not to i m sure that s causing heartache said jen kates senior vice president and director of global health and hiv policy for the kaiser family foundation dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of the association of state and territorial health officials which represents the public health agencies of all 50 u s states the district of columbia and u s territories said officials anticipate that on hand doses of covid 19 vaccines and manufacturers ability to supply more will meet needs across the country i think states have tried to plan as if everybody s going to be offered a booster he said suggesting they will be overprepared for the more narrow recommendations issued by the fda and the centers for disease control and prevention california for example estimated earlier this month that it would need to administer an extra 63 million doses by the end of 2022 if initial shots for children under 12 were approved and boosters were open to everyone u s health officials late thursday endorsed booster shots of the pfizer vaccine for all americans 65 and older along with tens of millions of younger people who are at higher risk from the coronavirus because of health conditions or their jobs california with nearly 40 million residents has the lowest transmission rate of any state and nearly 70 of eligible residents are fully vaccinated that leaves nearly 12 million people not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated dr mark ghaly california s health secretary said the state will rely largely on pharmacies and primary care providers to give boosters to seniors while some large counties and health care groups will use mass vaccination sites in pennsylvania more than 67 of residents older than 18 are fully vaccinated alison beam acting secretary of health said health authorities now have two missions continuing to persuade people to get vaccinated and serving those eager to receive a booster or initial shots pennsylvania is going to be prepared beam said and we re going to have the right level of vaccine and vaccinators to be able to meet that demand

cnn shantytowns surround caracas venezuela s capital like the walls of a bowl little houses pile on each other on the steep hills some reachable only by vertiginous staircases earlier this month ingrid sanchez tried to rustle up votes here for the ruling socialist party in petare venezuela s largest barrio as parliamentary elections got underway on december 6 she hired motorcycles and jeeps to ferry poor but faithful voters up steep hills to the polling station sanchez has no money to spare a former teacher she lives on a state pension worth just one and a half dollars per month it was the socialist party the late hugo chavez s party that gave ingrid cash to pay for the vehicles but they weren t venezuelan bolivars they were us dollars and as she counted it sanchez realized that the four 20 bills she held were worth more than 50 months of her pension everything is in dollars now she says ruefully a sign of monumental change in the country that she says would have chavez turning in his grave petare venezuela s largest barrio is seen from above on december 6 stefano pozzebon cnn sanchez 57 years old is a faithful member of the socialist party and believes fiercely in the vision of late president hugo chavez who prophesied a marxist utopia where the state would look after the needs of the people raise the quality of life erase inequality and limit private enterprise to a minor role in the economy one never loses hope and that is a project that i still believe in she said but venezuela today hardly resembles the one pictured by chavez hunger is rampant inequality dizzying and public hospitals stand derelict as the country deals with the coronavirus pandemic the us dollar is increasingly taking precedence over the bolivar and while the venezuelan minimum wage is the lowest in the region the country s stock market is booming chavez s successor current president nicolas maduro recently inaugurated an ultra luxury hotel where rooms are the equivalent of 300 per night all of which raises a question that sanchez has clearly been wrestling with is socialism still alive in venezuela i don t know we are doing things upside down she says giving in to the dollar a mural depicting venezuelan late president hugo chavez c saluting and venezuelan president nicolas maduro r holding a child in caracas on december 9 2020 federico parra afp getty images when chavez rose to power in 1998 venezuela s wealth was abundant with some analysts estimating that the country earned almost a trillion dollars from oil revenues between 1999 and 2014 more than eight times today s equivalent of the marshall plan with that kind of money it was easy to imagine the state as the ultimate father figure chavez invested most revenues in programs aimed at increasing living standards and reducing inequality state television would broadcast hours of footage of citizens receiving state funded housing food and subsidies for agricultural cooperatives he sent cuban medical personnel to the barrios to set up clinics for the poor and launched literacy and education campaigns in december 2007 he even sent truckloads of heating fuel to low income americans in new york and boston only 15 months after calling then president george w bush the devil at the united nations throughout his 14 year presidency chavez swung between different economic tendencies though always working to strengthen the state s command of the economy through price controls currency exchange regulations and public spending he threatened to take over most private companies in venezuela but never abolished private property he attacked capitalism but never quit commercial relations with the united states chavez dreamed of ending the dominance of the us dollar an emblem of the world s biggest proponent of capitalism and creating an alternative currency with which to buy and sell crude oil the world is victim of the dollar s empire the united states have bought half the world with useless banknotes but the empire of the dollar has reached an end he said in 2009 ten years later it s the venezuelan bolivar and the bolivarian revolution that appear to be reaching an end instead even his former protégé maduro acknowledges that things have changed asked by cnn earlier this month whether he thought venezuela was still a socialist country maduro said he thought the values of socialism might be fading referring to new displays of wealth in the upmarket streets of caracas at times we moved forwards other times we pulled back perhaps today we retreated for what concerns our socialist values i recognize that he said at a press conference when oil prices began to fall in 2013 maduro who abruptly became president that year after chavez suddenly died of cancer with no transition plan in place found himself waging a losing battle against market forces decreeing price controls on the rising prices of basic consumer goods only to find the products in question disappearing overnight available only on the black market at a price ten times its official value as foreign reserves dwindled he printed stacks of new money devaluing the bolivar to the point of scrap paper and therefore the salaries of most venezuelan workers a soldier helps a man on a wheelchair as he votes at a polling station in a school in caracas on december 6 cristian hernandez afp getty images in more recent years even the state s hold on the country s financial system has been badly shaken with the us dollar growing commonplace in day to day transactions in march 2019 venezuela s entire electric grid collapsed leaving some regions without power for up to a week without electricity electronic transactions including credit and debit card payments were impossible and paying cash was futile with even the highest denomination bolivar notes worth only pennies so venezuelans started using the option left illegal foreign banknotes us dollars had always been seen by ordinary venezuelans as a last resort something most families kept hidden under the mattress for black market necessities but during the blackouts dollars were used to pay for ice bags to keep food in powerless refrigerators shops started accepting the illegal bills at first carefully watching out for venezuela s feared security forces then gradually in the open the government did not intervene once the barrier was broken it was impossible to turn back in caracas transactions of just a few dollars have now replaced local bank transfers of millions of bolivars products are increasingly available in caracas for those who can pay for them in dollars or other foreign currencies like euros colombian pesos or brazilian reals capitalism with venezuelan characteristics video ad feedback the stench is unbearable inside horrific venezuelan covid 19 ward 04 41 source cnn the coronavirus pandemic also made it possible for maduro himself to take a wrecking ball to one of the pillars of venezuelan socialism cheap oil for citizens considered a birthright in a country so rich with crude socialist governments here have always been careful with the sensitive issue of cutting gasoline subsidies in 2014 maduro himself declared he would not touch the price of gasoline because it would be like adding fuel to the fire but with demand for gasoline greatly reduced during lockdown he was able to do this year what no other ruler in venezuela dared in the last three decades raise prices in may maduro declared the subsidized gasoline would be rationed to 30 gallons per month per vehicle but customers could buy it at a premium of 0 5 a liter 1 9 per gallon at a selected number of gas stations in the country the result was that subsidized gasoline all but disappeared from sale while paying for it in greenbacks became the norm for those who could afford it with that they managed to break the myth of the caracazo says altero alvarado an oil analyst in caracas referring to an infamous cycle of riots against an oil price hike in 1989 that doesn t mean people didn t protest with an almost total collapse of services gasoline and water shortages and frequent blackouts there were at least 1484 protests in venezuela in the month of october 93 of which were related to basic necessities like access to regular utilities according to the venezuelan observatory of social conflict however these protests were quickly suppressed by security forces allowing the government to effectively push the policy through alvarado says a protest for gas shortages in punto fijo venezuela on november 27 irene revilla another blow to the chavez era economic vision of state control occurred in november this year when the government for the first time allowed a private company to issue bonds in dollars and by doing so raise capital outside of government control the measure unheard of since the early 2000s took the form of a little publicized authorization to a single maker of rum venezuela s national drink equally consumed in the shanty towns of caracas and the most exclusive beach resorts on the caribbean coast it is incredibly difficult to run a private company in venezuela the country is ranked 188 out of 190 in the world bank s ease of doing business ranking until now the government decided which companies had access to foreign currencies and at what rate they would be converted to bolivars by the central bank but this year the government allowed venezuelan rum brand santa teresa to raise money by issuing bonds worth a total of us 300 000 bonds allow investors to give a certain amount of money to the company in exchange for the promise that the money will be paid back with interest in santa teresa s case the company turned to bonds when it realized no venezuelan bank would have enough capital to loan what it needed to expand the distillery due to the bolivar s devaluation being able to borrow funds from private investors and pay it back in dollars would protect the company from the country s rampant inflation we are somehow beginning to come back to reality to understand that markets have to function says alberto vollmer santa teresa s owner in an interview with cnn in caracas they tried the absurd which was to annihilate all business it didn t work so now they are reversing policies he adds there s some history here in 2006 chavez himself expropriated part of santa teresa s lands during one of his famous tv shows hello president ricardo cusanno president of the venezuelan federation of chambers of commerce points out that venezuela is not the first planned economy to chart this path the country could well be on its way to becoming a tropical china a comparison that shows private enterprise and free markets can still be paired with intensive political control and absence of civil rights he points out since santa teresa s breakthrough he says more foreign investors have expressed interest in doing business in venezuela in the last few weeks it has been crazy we have been contacted by french investment funds latin american funds even north american funds he says with the visible excitement of someone who had not seen the same level of interest in a long time what you are seeing now is the loss of control a vendor attends a stall at the municipal market of chacao in caracas on september 3 2020 federico parra afp getty images to hear maduro tell it neither venezuela s crushing poverty nor its recent concessions to capitalism mean chavez s great socialist project has failed instead he says its progress has merely been stalled by the 2013 2015 oil price collapse which he frequently refers to as a war that left its coffers empty and its social programs running on fumes chavez never said that socialism triumphed here he said we are going to work the hardest to install a socialist way to production and we have just begun as we were starting to move those first steps towards a socialist economy this brutal war came and we lost our income from oil critics see venezuela s financial struggles differently blaming in addition to oil prices the state s own failure to invest in its oil sector or maintain oil infrastructure catastrophic government corruption and national economic mismanagement they also point that other commodity exporters like neighboring colombia successfully made it through the crises according to the imf venezuela s gdp lost 86 of its value under maduro s watch mostly due to the crash of income from oil and the slow encroachment of the dollar they say may be more a sign of deepening chaos than of positive economic liberalization while venezuelans can now use foreign currencies to buy their groceries they cannot open a bank account in dollars so their savings are still subject to some of the highest inflation in the world and the more foreign cash is used in the country the more the bolivar loses value ultimately hurting low income earners who are still paid in bolivars like ingrid sanchez luis vicente león one of the most respected analysts in caracas and the manager of a polling firm is wary of comparing this moment in venezuela to china s transition to open markets in the 1980s when foreign investment was slowly allowed into specific sectors of the economy and limited special economic zones china also maintained its own national currency while gradually reforming the economy there might be a plan to do the same things deng xiaoping did back in china but maybe in the future maybe the first steps of the chinese reforms were similar but i don t think we are seeing that yet what you are seeing now is the loss of control from the government of the economy and the prices he says rafael ramirez a former oil minister who worked with chavez and maduro from 2003 to 2014 warns that unregulated change now could open the door to economic anarchy where the most powerful set the rules when maduro says that he thanks god for the dollar he is surrendering there is no control of the economy it s in the hands of speculators and profiteers he told cnn ramirez is part of the growing number of former chavez aides who accuse maduro of squandering the bolivarian revolution from exile he accuses maduro of embracing crony capitalism while the majority of venezuelans people see no benefit from relaxed market rules according to a recent survey by three independent universities in caracas 96 of venezuelan live below the poverty line more than 5 million have fled the country s painful economic conditions making venezuela the largest migration crisis in the modern history of latin america sanchez the retired teacher and socialist party member has lost one of her daughters to the exodus who now lives in chile her older daughter remains in venezuela doing odd jobs to make ends meet and helping her mother run a community radio with salaries so undervalued there s little reason for her to pursue a full time job sanchez says their house in caracas is humble two rooms either side of a kitchen where the cooking pots have been emptied for a long time in the living room a large portrait of chavez in military uniform proudly stands on the wall by the door welcoming every visitor with the warning you don t speak badly of chavez here when she talks of the type of country she would like venezuela to be she says i believe in an active community organized you want to know why i haven t left because i know that there are people here that are happy with what i do and this small seed i am laying down today is what will germinate into change tomorrow only the people save the people she says quoting a famous revolutionary guerrilla slogan from the 1960s but in today s venezuela she says the people are f ing the

deep within the catalogue of regrets that is the 9 11 commission report â long after readers learn of the origins and objectives of al qaeda past the warnings ignored by consecutive administrations through the litany of institutional failures that allowed terrorists to hijack four commercial airliners â the authors pause to make a rousing case for the power of the nationâ s character â the u s government must define what the message is what it stands for â the report asserts â we should offer an example of moral leadership in the world committed to treat people humanely abide by the rule of law and be generous and caring to our neighbors â â we need to defend our ideals abroad vigorously america does stand up for its values â story continues below advertisement this affirmation of american idealism is one of the documentâ s more opinionated moments looking back itâ s also among the most ignored rather than exemplify the nationâ s highest values the official response to 9 11 unleashed some of its worst qualities deception brutality arrogance ignorance delusion overreach and carelessness this conclusion is laid bare in the sprawling literature to emerge from 9 11 over the past two decades â the works of investigation memoir and narrative by journalists and former officials that have charted the path to that day revealed the heroism and confusion of the early response chronicled the battles in and about afghanistan and iraq and uncovered the excesses of the war on terror reading or rereading a collection of such books today is like watching an old movie that feels more anguishing and frustrating than you remember the anguish comes from knowing how the tale will unfold the frustration from realizing that this was hardly the only possible outcome whatever individual stories the 9 11 books tell too many describe the repudiation of u s values not by extremist outsiders but by our own hand the betrayal of americaâ s professed principles was the friendly fire of the war on terror in these works indifference to the growing terrorist threat gives way to bloodlust and vengeance after the attacks official dissembling justifies wars then prolongs them in the name of counterterrorism security is politicized savagery legalized and patriotism weaponized it was an emergency yes thatâ s understood but that state of exception became our new american exceptionalism it happened fast by 2004 when the 9 11 commission urged america to â engage the struggle of ideas â it was already too late the justice departmentâ s initial torture memos were already signed the abu ghraib images had already eviscerated u s claims to moral authority and it has lasted long the latest works on the legacy of 9 11 show how war on terror tactics were turned on religious groups immigrants and protesters in the united states the war on terror came home and it walked in like it owned the place â it is for now far easier for a researcher to explain how and why september 11 happened than it is to explain the aftermath â steve coll writes in â ghost wars â his 2004 account of the ciaâ s pre 9 11 involvement in afghanistan throughout that aftermath washington fantasized about remaking the world in its image only to reveal an ugly image of itself to the world the literature of 9 11 also considers osama bin ladenâ s varied aspirations for the attacks and his shifting visions of that aftermath he originally imagined america as weak and easily panicked retreating from the world â in particular from the middle east â as soon as its troops began dying but bin laden also came to grasp perhaps self servingly the benefits of luring washington into imperial overreach of â bleeding america to the point of bankruptcy â as he put it in 2004 through endless military expansionism thus beating back its global sway and undermining its internal unity â we anticipate a black future for america â bin laden told abc news more than three years before the 9 11 attacks â instead of remaining united states it shall end up separated states and shall have to carry the bodies of its sons back to america â bin laden did not win the war of ideas but neither did we to an unnerving degree the united states moved toward the enemyâ s fantasies of what it might become â a nation divided in its sense of itself exposed in its moral and political compromises conflicted over wars it did not want but would not end when president george w bush addressed the nation from the oval office on the evening of sept 11 2001 he asserted that america was attacked because it is â the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world and no one will keep that light from shining â bush was correct al qaeda could not dim the promise of america only we could do that to ourselves i â the most frightening aspect of this new threat â â was the fact that almost no one took it seriously it was too bizarre too primitive and exotic â that is how lawrence wright depicts the early impressions of bin laden and his terrorist network among u s officials in â the looming tower al qaeda and the road to 9 11 â for a country still basking in its post cold war glow it all seemed so far away even as al qaedaâ s strikes â on the world trade center in 1993 on u s embassies in 1998 on the uss cole in 2000 â grew bolder this was american complacency mixed with denial the books traveling that road to 9 11 have an inexorable almost suffocating feel to them as though every turn invariably leads to the first crush of steel and glass their starting points vary wright dwells on the influence of egyptian thinker sayyid qutb whose mid 20th century sojourn in the united states animated his vision of a clash between islam and modernity and whose work would inspire future jihadists in â ghost wars â coll laments americaâ s abandonment of afghanistan once it ceased serving as a proxy battlefield against moscow in â the rise and fall of osama bin laden â peter bergen stresses the moment bin laden arrived in afghanistan from sudan in 1996 when khalid sheikh mohammed first pitched him on the planes plot and the 9 11 commission lingers on bin ladenâ s declarations of war against the united states particularly his 1998 fatwa calling it â the individual duty for every muslimâ to murder americans â in any country in which it is possible â yet these early works also make clear that the road to 9 11 featured plenty of billboards warning of the likely destination a presidential daily brief item on aug 6 2001 titled â bin ladin determined to strike in usâ became infamous in 9 11 lore yet the commission report notes that it was the 36th pdb relating to bin laden or al qaeda that year alone â all right youâ ve covered your ass now â bush reportedly sneered at the briefer both the fbi and the cia produced classified warnings on terrorist threats in the mid 1990s coll writes including a particularly precise national intelligence estimate â several targets are especially at risk national symbols such as the white house and the capitol and symbols of u s capitalism such as wall street â it stated â we assess that civil aviation will figure prominently among possible terrorist targets in the united states â some of the admonitions scattered throughout the 9 11 literature are too over the top even for a movie script thereâ s the exasperated state department official complaining about defense department inaction â does al qaeda have to attack the pentagon to get their attention â and the earnest fbi supervisor in minneapolis warning a skeptical agent in washington about suspected terrorism activity insisting that he was â trying to keep someone from taking a plane and crashing it into the world trade center â in these books everyone is warning everyone else bergen emphasizes that a young intelligence analyst in the state department gina bennett wrote the first classified memo warning about bin laden in 1993 pockets within the fbi and the cia obsess over bin laden while regarding one another as rivals on his way out president bill clinton warns bush outgoing national security adviser sandy berger warns his successor condoleezza rice and white house counterterrorism coordinator richard clarke as he reminds incessantly in his 2004 memoir â against all enemies â warns anyone who will listen and many who will not with the system â blinking red â as cia director george tenet later told the 9 11 commission why were all these warnings not enough wright lingers on bureaucratic failings emphasizing that intelligence collection on al qaeda was hampered by the â institutional warfareâ between the cia and the fbi two agencies that by all accounts were not on speaking terms coll writes that clinton regarded bin laden as â an isolated fanatic flailing dangerously but quixotically against the forces of global progress â whereas the bush team was fixated on great power politics missile defense and china clarkeâ s conclusion is simple and it highlights americaâ s we know better swagger a national trait that often masquerades as courage or wisdom â america alas seems only to respond well to disasters to be undistracted by warnings â he writes â our country seems unable to do all that must be done until there has been some awful calamity â the problem with responding only to calamity is that underestimation is usually replaced by overreaction and we tell ourselves it is the right thing maybe the only thing to do ii a last minute flight change a new job at the pentagon a retirement from the fire station the final tilt of a planeâ s wings before impact if the books about the lead up to 9 11 are packed with unbearable inevitability the volumes on the day itself highlight how randomness separated survival from death â the ferocity of the attacks meant that innocent people lived or died because they stepped back from a doorway or hopped onto a closing elevator or simply shifted their weight from one foot to another â jim dwyer and kevin flynn write in â 102 minutes â their narrative of events inside the world trade center from the moment the first plane hit through the collapse of both towers their detailed reporting on the human saga â such as a police officer asking a fire chaplain to hear his confession as they both flee a collapsing building â is excruciating and riveting at once yet as much as the people inside the structures and history of the world trade center are key actors too they are not just symbols and targets but fully formed and deeply flawed characters in the dayâ s drama had the world trade center built in the late 1960s and early 1970s been erected according to the city building code in effect since 1938 dwyer and flynn explain â it is likely that a very different world trade center would have been built â instead it was constructed according to a new code that the real estate industry had avidly promoted a code that made it cheaper and more lucrative to build and own skyscrapers â it increased the floor space available for rent â â by cutting back on the areas that had been devoted under the earlier law to evacuation and exit â the authors write the result getting everybody out on 9 11 was virtually impossible under the new rules the port authority of new york and new jersey was able to rent three quarters of each floor of the world trade center dwyer and flynn report a 21 percent increase over the yield of older skyscrapers the cost was dear some 1 000 people inside the north tower who initially survived the impact of american airlines flight 11 could not reach an open staircase â their fate was sealed nearly four decades earlier when the stairways were clustered in the core of the building and fire stairs were eliminated as a wasteful use of valuable space â the authors write that â building code reform hardly makes for gripping drama â an aside as modest as it is inaccurate the towers embodied the power of american capitalism but their design embodied the folly of american greed on that day both conditions proved fatal story continues below advertisement the assault on the pentagon long treated as an undercard to new yorkâ s main event could have yielded even greater devastation and again the details of the building played a role in his oral history of 9 11 â the only plane in the sky â garrett graff quotes defense department officials marveling at how american airlines flight 77 struck a part of the pentagon that because of new anti terrorism standards had recently been reinforced and renovated this meant it was not only stronger but on that morning also relatively unoccupied â it was truly a miracle â army branch chief philip smith said â in any other wedge of the pentagon there would have been 5 000 people and the plane would have flown right through the middle of the building â instead fewer than 200 people were killed in the attack on the pentagon including the passengers on the hijacked jet chance and preparedness came together the bravery of police and firefighters is the subject of countless 9 11 retrospectives but these books also emphasize the selflessness of civilians who morphed into first responders port authority workers frank de martini pablo ortiz carlos da costa and peter negron for instance saved at least 70 people in the world trade centerâ s north tower by pulling apart elevator doors busting walls and shining flashlights to find survivors only to not make it out themselves â with crowbar flashlight hardhat and big mouths de martini and ortiz and their colleagues had pushed back the boundary line between life and death â dwyer and flynn write the authors also note how the double lines of people descending a world trade center staircase would automatically blend into single file when word came down that an injured person was behind them and graff cites a local assistant fire chief who recalls the â truly heroicâ work of civilians and uniformed personnel at the pentagon that day â they were the ones who really got their comrades got their workmates out â he says the civilians aboard united airlines flight 93 whose resistance forced the plane to crash into a pennsylvania field rather than the u s capitol were later lionized as emblems of swashbuckling americana but one offhand detail in the 9 11 commission report underscores just how american their defiance was the passengers had made phone calls when the hijacking began and had learned the fate of other aircraft that day â according to one call they voted on whether to rush the terrorists in an attempt to retake the plane â the commission report states â they decided and acted â they voted on it they voted even in that moment of unfathomable fear and distress the passengers took a moment to engage in the great american tradition of popular consultation before deciding to become this new warâ s earliest soldiers was there ever any doubt as to the outcome of that ballot such episodes led by ordinary civilians embodied values that the 9 11 commission called on the nation to display except those values would soon be dismantled in the name of security by those entrusted to uphold them iii lawyering to death the phrase appears in multiple 9 11 volumes usually uttered by top officials adamant that they were going to get things done laws and rules be damned anti terrorism efforts were always â lawyered to deathâ during the clinton administration tenet complains in â bush at war â bob woodwardâ s 2002 book on the debates among the president and his national security team in an interview with woodward bush drops the phrase amid the machospeak â â dead or alive â â bring â em onâ and the like â that became typical of his anti terrorism rhetoric â i had to show the american people the resolve of a commander in chief that was going to do whatever it took to win â bush explains â no yielding no equivocation no you know lawyering this thing to death â in â against all enemies â clarke recalls the evening of sept 11 2001 when bush snapped at an official who suggested that international law looked askance at military force as a tool of revenge â i donâ t care what the international lawyers say we are going to kick some ass â the president retorted the message was unmistakable the law is an obstacle to effective counterterrorism worrying about procedural niceties is passe in a 9 11 world an annoying impediment to the essential work of ass kicking except they did lawyer this thing to death instead of disregarding the law the bush administration enlisted it â beginning almost immediately after september 11 2001 cheney saw to it that some of the sharpest and best trained lawyers in the country working in secret in the white house and the united states department of justice came up with legal justifications for a vast expansion of the governmentâ s power in waging war on terror â jane mayer writes in â the dark side â her relentless 2008 compilation of the arguments and machinations of government lawyers after the attacks through public declarations and secret memos the administration sought to remove limits on the presidentâ s conduct of warfare and to deny terrorism suspects the protections of the geneva conventions by redefining them as unlawful enemy combatants nothing mayer argues of the latter effort â more directly cleared the way for torture than this â to comprehend what our government can justify in the name of national security consider the torture memos themselves authored by the justice departmentâ s office of legal counsel between 2002 and 2005 to green light cia interrogation methods for terrorism suspects tactics such as cramped confinement sleep deprivation and waterboarding were rebranded as â enhanced interrogation techniques â legally and linguistically contorted to avoid the label of torture though the techniques could be cruel and inhuman the olc acknowledged in an august 2002 memo they would constitute torture only if they produced pain equivalent to organ failure or death and if the individual inflicting such pain really really meant to do so â even if the defendant knows that severe pain will result from his actions if causing such harm is not his objective he lacks the requisite specific intent â itâ s quite the sleight of hand with torture moving from the body of the interrogated to the mind of the interrogator story continues below advertisement after devoting dozens of pages to the metaphysics of specific intent the true meaning of â prolongedâ mental harm or â imminentâ death and the elasticity of the convention against torture the memo concludes that none of it actually matters even if a particular interrogation method would cross some legal line the relevant statute would be considered unconstitutional because it â impermissibly encroachedâ on the commander in chiefâ s authority to conduct warfare almost nowhere in these memos does the justice department curtail the power of the cia to do as it pleases in fact the olc lawyers rely on assurances from the cia itself to endorse such powers in a second memo from august 2002 the lawyers ruminate on the use of cramped confinement boxes â we have no information from the medical experts you have consulted that the limited duration for which the individual is kept in the boxes causes any substantial physical pain â the memo states waterboarding likewise gets a pass â you have informed us that this procedure does not inflict actual physical harm â the memo states â based on your research â â you do not anticipate that any prolonged mental harm would result from the use of the waterboard â you have informed us experts you have consulted based on your research you do not anticipate such hand washing words appear throughout the memos the justice department relies on information provided by the cia to reach its conclusions the cia then has the cover of the justice department to proceed with its interrogations itâ s a perfect circle of trust yet the logic is itself tortured in a may 2005 memo the lawyers conclude that because no single technique inflicts â severeâ pain amounting to torture their combined use â would not be expectedâ to reach that level either as though embarrassed at such illogic the memo attaches a triple negative footnote â we are not suggesting that combinations or repetitions of acts that do not individually cause severe physical pain could not result in severe physical pain â well then what exactly are you suggesting even when the olc in 2004 officially withdrew its august 2002 memo following a public outcry and declared torture â abhorrent â the lawyers added a footnote to the new memo assuring that they had reviewed the prior opinions on the treatment of detainees and â do not believe that any of their conclusions would be different under the standards set forth in this memorandum â in these documents lawyers enable lawlessness another may 2005 memo concludes that because the convention against torture applies only to actions occurring under u s jurisdiction the ciaâ s creation of detention sites in other countries renders the convention â inapplicable â similarly because the eighth amendmentâ s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment is meant to protect people convicted of crimes it should not apply to terrorism detainees â because they have not been officially convicted of anything the lack of due process conveniently eliminates constitutional protections in his introduction to â the torture memos rationalizing the unthinkable â david cole describes the documents as â bad faith lawyering â which might be generous it is another kind of lawyering to death one in which the rule of law that the 9 11 commission urged us to abide by becomes the victim years later the senate intelligence committee would investigate the ciaâ s post 9 11 interrogation program its massive report â the executive summary of which appeared as a 549 page book in 2014 â found that torture did not produce useful intelligence that the interrogations were more brutal than the cia let on that the justice department did not independently verify the ciaâ s information and that the spy agency impeded oversight by congress and the cia inspector general it explains that the cia purported to oversee itself and no surprise that it deemed its interrogations effective and necessary no matter the results if a detainee provided information it meant the program worked if he did not it meant stricter applications of the techniques were needed if still no information was forthcoming the program had succeeded in proving he had none to give â the ciaâ s effectiveness representations were almost entirely inaccurate â the senate report concluded it is one of the few lies of the war on terror unmasked by an official government investigation and public report but just one of the many documented in the 9 11 literature iv officials in the war on terror didnâ t deceive or dissemble just with lawmakers or the public in the recurring tragedy of war they lied just as often to themselves in â to start a war how the bush administration took america into iraq â robert draper considers the influence of the presidentâ s top aides deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz long obsessed with ousting saddam hussein pentagon chief donald rumsfeld eager to test his theories of military transformation and cheney fixated on apocalyptic visions of americaâ s vulnerability all had their reasons but draper identifies a single responsible party â the decision to invade iraq was one made finally and exclusively by the president of the united states george w bush â he writes a president initially concerned about defending and preserving the nationâ s moral goodness against terrorism found himself driven by darker impulses â iâ m having difficulty controlling my bloodlust â bush confessed to religious leaders in the oval office on sept 20 2001 draper reports it was not a one off comment in woodwardâ s â bush at war â the president admitted that before 9 11 â i didnâ t feel that sense of urgency and my blood was not nearly as boiling â bloodlust moral certainty and sudden vulnerability make a dangerous combination the belief that you are defending good against evil can lead to the belief that whatever you do to that end is good too draper distills bushâ s worldview â the terroristsâ primary objective was to destroy americaâ s freedom saddam hated america therefore he hated freedom therefore saddam was himself a terrorist bent on destroying america and its freedom â note the asymmetry the president assumed the worst about what hussein had done or might do yet embraced best case scenarios of how an american invasion would proceed â iraqis would rejoice at the sight of their western liberators â draper recaps â their newly shared sense of national purpose would overcome any sectarian allegiances their native cleverness would make up for their inexperience with self government they would welcome the stewardship of iraqi expatriates who had not set foot in baghdad in decades and their oil would pay for everything â there are lies and then there is self delusion the americans did not have to anticipate the specifics of the civil war that would engulf the country after the invasion they just had to realize that managing postwar iraq would never be as simple as they imagined it did not seem to occur to bush and his advisers that iraqis could simultaneously hate hussein and resent the americans â feelings that could have been discovered by speaking to iraqis and hearing their concerns anthony shadidâ s â night draws near iraqâ s people in the shadow of americaâ s war â published in 2005 is among the few books on the war that gets deep inside iraqisâ aversion to the americans in their midst â what gives them the right to change something thatâ s not theirs in the first place â a woman in a middle class baghdad neighborhood asks him â i donâ t like your house so iâ m going to bomb it and you can rebuild it again the way i want it with your money â in fallujah where shadid hears early talk of the americans as â kuffarâ heathens a 51 year old former teacher complains that â weâ ve exchanged a tyrant for an occupier â the occupation did not dissuade such impressions when it turned the former dictatorâ s seat of government into its own luxurious green zone or when it retrofitted the abu ghraib prison â the worst of saddamâ s hellholes â shadid calls it into its own chamber of horrors shadid understood that governmental legitimacy â who gets to rule and by what right â was a matter of overriding importance for iraqis â the americans never understood the question â he writes â iraqis never agreed on the answer â itâ s hard to find a better summation of the trials of iraq in the aftermath of americaâ s invasion when the united states so quickly shifted from liberation to occupation it lost whatever legitimacy it enjoyed â bush handed that enemy precisely what it wanted and needed proof that america was at war with islam that we were the new crusaders come to occupy muslim land â clarke writes â it was as if usama bin laden hidden in some high mountain redoubt were engaging in long range mind control of george bush chanting â invade iraq you must invade iraq â â â the foolishness and arrogance of the american occupation didnâ t help in â imperial life in the emerald city inside iraqâ s green zone â rajiv chandrasekaran explains how even as daily security was iraqisâ overwhelming concern viceroy l paul bremer bushâ s man in baghdad was determined to turn the country into a model free market economy complete with new investment laws bankruptcy courts and a state of the art stock exchange in charge of the new exchange was a 24 year old american with no academic background in economics or finance the man tasked with remaking iraqâ s sprawling university system had no experience in the middle east â but did have connections to the rumsfeld and cheney families a new traffic law for iraq was partially cut and pasted from marylandâ s motor vehicle code an antismoking campaign was led by a u s official who was a closet smoker and a u s army general when asked by local journalists why american helicopters must fly so low at night thus scaring iraqi children replied that the kids were simply hearing â the sound of freedom â message freedom sounds terrifying for some americans inflicting that terror became part of the job one more tool in the arsenal in â the forever warâ by dexter filkins a u s army lieutenant colonel in iraq assures the author that â with a heavy dose of fear and violence and a lot of money for projects i think we can convince these people that we are here to help them â filkins asked him if he really meant it about fear and violence the officer insisted that he did of course not all officials were so deluded and so forthright some knew better but lied to the public chandrasekaran recalls the response of a top communications official under bremer when reporters asked about waves of violence hitting baghdad in the spring of 2004 â off the record paris is burning â the official told the journalists â on the record security and stability are returning to iraq â in â the rise and fall of osama bin laden â bergen sums up how the iraq war conjured in part on the false connections between iraq and al qaeda ended up helping the terrorist network it pulled resources from the war in afghanistan gave space for bin ladenâ s men to regroup and spurred a new generation of terrorists in the middle east â a bigger gift to bin laden was hard to imagine â bergen writes if iraq was the war born of lies afghanistan was the one nurtured by them afghanistan was where al qaeda supported by the taliban had made its base â it was supposed to be the good war the right war the war of necessity and not choice the war endorsed at home and abroad â u s officials had no need to lie or spin to justify the war â washington post reporter craig whitlock writes in â the afghanistan papers â a damning contrast of the warâ s reality vs its rhetoric â yet leaders at the white house the pentagon and the state department soon began to make false assurances and to paper over setbacks on the battlefield â as the years passed the deceit became entrenched what whitlock calls â an unspoken conspiracyâ to hide the truth story continues below advertisement drawing from a â lessons learnedâ project that interviewed hundreds of military and civilian officials involved with afghanistan as well as from oral histories government cables and reports whitlock finds commanding generals privately admitting that they long fought the war â without a functional strategy â that two years into the conflict rumsfeld complained that he had â no visibility into who the bad guys are â that army lt gen douglas lute a former coordinator of iraq and afghanistan policy acknowledged that â we didnâ t have the foggiest idea of what we were undertaking â that u s officials long wanted to withdraw american forces but feared â correctly so it turns out â that the afghan government might collapse â bin laden had hoped for this exact scenario â whitlock observes â to lure the u s superpower into an unwinnable guerrilla conflict that would deplete its national treasury and diminish its global influence â all along top officials publicly contradicted these internal views issuing favorable accounts of steady progress bad news was twisted into good rising suicide attacks in kabul meant the taliban was too weak for direct combat for instance while increased u s casualties meant america was taking the fight to the enemy the skills and size of the afghan security forces were frequently exaggerated by the end of president barack obamaâ s second term u s officials concluded that some 30 000 afghan soldiers on the payroll didnâ t actually exist they were paper creations of local commanders who pocketed the fake soldiersâ salaries at u s taxpayer expense american officials publicly lamented large scale corruption in afghanistan but enabled that corruption in practice pouring massive contracts and projects into a country ill equipped to absorb them such deceptions transpired across u s presidents but the obama administration eager to show that its first term troop surge was working â took it to a new level hyping figures that were misleading spurious or downright false â whitlock writes and then under president donald trump he adds the generals felt pressure to â speak more forcefully and boast that his war strategy was destined to succeed â long before president biden declared the end of the u s war in afghanistan this summer the united states twice made similar pronouncements proclaiming the conclusion of combat operations in 2003 and again in 2014 â yet still the war endured it did so in part because â in public almost no senior government officials had the courage to admit that the united states was slowly losing â whitlock writes â with their complicit silence military and political leaders avoided accountability and dodged reappraisals that could have changed the outcome or shortened the conflict â itâ s not like nobody warned them in â bush at war â woodward reports that cia counterterrorism center director cofer black and deputy secretary of state richard armitage traveled to moscow shortly after 9 11 to give officials a heads up about the coming hostilities in afghanistan the russians recent visitors to the graveyard of empires cautioned that afghanistan was an â ambush heavenâ and that in the words of one of them â youâ re really going to get the hell kicked out of you â cofer responded confidently â weâ re going to kill them weâ re going to rock their world â now with u s forces gone and the taliban having reclaimed power in afghanistan washington is wrestling with the legacy of the nationâ s longest war why and how did america lose should we have stayed longer was it worth its price in blood and billions how does the united states repay the courage of afghans who worked alongside u s military and civilian authorities what if afghanistan again becomes a haven for terrorists attacking u s interests and allies as the airport suicide bombing in kabul that killed 13 u s service members last month may signal biden has asserted that â the war in afghanistan is now overâ but has also pledged to continue the fight against terrorists there â so what are the limits and the means of future u s military and intelligence action in the country these are essential debates but a war should not be measured only by the timing and the competence of its end we still face an equally consequential appraisal how good was this good war if it could be sustained only by lies v in the two decades since the 9 11 attacks the united states has often attempted to reconsider its response take two documents from late 2006 the report from the iraq study group co chaired by james a baker iii and lee h hamilton which argued that washington needed to radically rethink its diplomatic and political strategy for iraq and â the u s army marine corps counterinsurgency field manual â written by a team led by then army lt gen david h petraeus which argued that u s officials needed to radically rethink military tactics for insurgency wars of the kind it faced in iraq and afghanistan they are written as though intending to solve problems but they can be read as proof that the problems have no realistic solution or that the only solution is to never have created them â there is no magic formula to solve the problems of iraq â the isg report begins yet its proposed fixes would have required plenty of fairy dust the report calls for a â diplomatic offensiveâ to gain international support for iraq to persuade iran and syria to respect iraqâ s territory and sovereignty and to commit to â a comprehensive arab israeli peace on all fronts â simple iraq meanwhile needed to make progress on national reconciliation in a country already awash in sectarian bloodletting boost domestic security even though the report deems the iraqi army a mess and the iraqi police worse and deliver social services even as the report concludes that the government was failing to adequately provide electricity drinking water sewage services and education the recommendations seem written in the knowledge that they will never happen â miracles cannot be expected â the report states â twice absent divine intervention the next step is obvious if the iraqi government canâ t demonstrate â substantial progressâ toward its goals the report asserts â the united states should reduce its political military or economic supportâ for iraq indeed the report sets the bar for staying so high that an exit strategy appears to be its primary purpose the counterinsurgency manual is an extraordinary document implicitly repudiating notions such as â shock and aweâ and â overwhelming force â it argues that the key to battling an insurgency in countries such as iraq and afghanistan is to provide security for the local population and to win its support through effective governance it also attempts to grasp the nature of americaâ s foes â most enemies either do not try to defeat the united states with conventional operations or do not limit themselves to purely military means â the manual states â they know that they cannot compete with u s forces on those terms instead they try to exhaust u s national will â exhausting americaâ s will is an objective that al qaeda understood well â soldiers and marines are expected to be nation builders as well as warriors â the manual proclaims but the arduous tasks involved â reestablishing government institutions rebuilding infrastructure strengthening local security forces enforcing the rule of law â reveal the tension at the heart of the new doctrine â counterinsurgents should prepare for a long term commitment â the manual states yet just a few pages later it admits that â eventually all foreign armies are seen as interlopers or occupiers â how to accomplish the former without descending into the latter no wonder so many of the historical examples of counterinsurgency that the manual highlights including accounts from the vietnam war are stories of failure the manual seems aware of its importance the 2007 edition contains a foreword followed by an introduction then another foreword a preface then some brief acknowledgments and finally one more introduction just reaching chapter 1 feels like defeating an insurgency but the throat clearing is clarifying in his foreword army lt col john nagl writes that the documentâ s most lasting impact may be as a catalyst not for remaking iraq or afghanistan but for transforming the army and marine corps into â more effective learning organizations â better able to adapt to changing warfare and in her introduction sarah sewall then director of harvardâ s carr center for human rights policy concludes that its â ultimate valueâ may be in warning civilian officials to think hard before engaging in a counterinsurgency campaign at best then the manual helps us rethink future conflicts â how we fight and whether we should itâ s no coincidence that biden in his aug 16 remarks defending the decision to withdraw american troops from afghanistan specifically repudiated counterinsurgency as an objective of u s policy â iâ ve argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorism not counterinsurgency or nation building â the president affirmed even the longest war was not long enough for a counterinsurgency effort to succeed in his 2009 book â the good soldiers â david finkel chronicles the experiences of an army battalion deployed in iraq during the u s troop surge in 2007 and 2008 a period of the war ostensibly informed by the new counterinsurgency doctrine in his 2013 sequel â thank you for your service â the author witnesses these men when they come home and try to make sense of their military experience and adapt to their new lives â the thing that got to everyone â finkel explains in the latter book â was not having a defined front line it was a war in 360 degrees no front to advance toward no enemy in uniform no predictable patterns no relief â itâ s a powerful summation of battling an insurgency adam schumann returns from war because of post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury â the result of a mortar round that dropped without warning out of a blue sky â finkel explains schumann suffers from nightmares headaches and guilt he wishes he needed bandages or crutches anything to visibly justify his absence from the front his wife endures his treatments his anger his ambivalence toward life â heâ s still a good guy â she decides â heâ s just a broken good guy â another returning soldier nic deninno struggles to tell his wife about the time he and his fellow soldiers burst into an iraqi home in search of a high value target he threw a man down the stairs and held another by the throat after they left the lieutenant told him it was the wrong house â the wrong f ing house â nic says to his wife â one of the things i want to remember is how many times we hit the wrong house â hitting the wrong house is what counterinsurgency doctrine is supposed to avoid even successfully capturing or killing a high value target can be counterproductive if in the process you terrorize a community and create more enemies in iraq the whole country was the wrong house americaâ s leaders knew it was the wrong house they hit it anyway vi in the 11th chapter of the 9 11 commission report just before all the recommendations for reforms in domestic and foreign policy the authors get philosophical pondering how hindsight had affected their views of sept 11 2001 â as time passes more documents become available and the bare facts of what happened become still clearer â the report states â yet the picture of how those things happened becomes harder to reimagine as that past world with its preoccupations and uncertainty recedes â before making definitive judgments then they ask themselves â whether the insights that seem apparent now would really have been meaningful at the time â itâ s a commendable attitude one that helps readers understand what the attacks felt like in real time and why authorities responded as they did but that approach also keeps the day trapped in the past safely distant two of the latest additions to the canon â reign of terrorâ by spencer ackerman and â subtle toolsâ by karen greenberg draw straight stark lines between the earliest days of the war on terror and its mutations in our current time between conflicts abroad and divisions at home these works show how 9 11 remains with us and how we are still living in the ruins when trump declared that â we donâ t have victories anymoreâ in his 2015 speech announcing his presidential candidacy he was both belittling the legacy of 9 11 and harnessing it to his ends â his great insight was that the jingoistic politics of the war on terror did not have to be tied to the war on terror itself â ackerman writes â that enabled him to tell a tale of lost greatness â and if greatness is lost someone must have taken it the backlash against muslims against immigrants crossing the southern border and against protesters rallying for racial justice was strengthened by the open ended nature of the global war on terror in ackermanâ s vivid telling â his prose can be hyperbolic even if his arguments are not â the war is not just far away in iraq or afghanistan in yemen or syria but itâ s happening here with mass surveillance militarized law enforcement and the rebranding of immigration as a threat to the nationâ s security rather than a cornerstone of its identity â trump had learned the foremost lesson of 9 11 â ackerman writes â that the terrorists were whomever you said they were â both ackerman and greenberg point to the authorization for use of military force drafted by administration lawyers and approved by congress just days after the attacks as the moment when americaâ s response began to go awry the brief joint resolution allowed the president to use â all necessary and appropriate forceâ against any nation organization or person who committed the attacks and to prevent any future ones it was the â ur document in the war on terror and its legacy â greenberg writes â riddled with imprecision its terminology was geared to codify expansive powers â where the battlefield the enemy and the definition of victory all remain vague war becomes endlessly expansive â with neither temporal nor geographical boundaries â this was the moment the war on terror was â conceptually doomed â ackerman concludes this is how you get a forever war story continues below advertisement there were moments when an off ramp was visible the killing of bin laden in 2011 was one such instance ackerman argues but â obama squandered the best chance anyone could ever have to end the 9 11 era â the author assails obama for making the war on terror more â sustainableâ through a veneer of legality â banning torture yet failing to close the detention camp at guantã namo bay and relying on drone strikes that â perversely incentivized the military and the cia to kill instead of capture â there would always be more targets more battlefields regardless of president or party failures became the reason to double down never wind down the longer the war went on the more that what ackerman calls its â grotesque subtextâ of nativism and racism would move to the foreground of american politics absent the war on terror it is harder to imagine a presidential candidate decrying a sitting commander in chief as foreign muslim illegitimate â and using that lie as a successful political platform absent the war on terror it is harder to imagine a travel ban against people from muslim majority countries absent the war on terror it is harder to imagine american protesters labeled terrorists or a secretary of defense describing the nationâ s urban streets as a â battle spaceâ to be dominated trump was a disruptive force in american life but there was much continuity there too â a vastly different america has taken rootâ in the two decades since 9 11 greenberg writes â in the name of retaliation â justice â and prevention fundamental values have been cast aside â in his latest book on bin laden bergen argues that 9 11 was a major tactical success but a long term strategic failure for the terrorist leader yes he struck a vicious blow against â the head of the snake â as he called the united states but â rather than ending american influence in the muslim world the 9 11 attacks greatly amplified it â with two lengthy large scale invasions and new bases established throughout the region yet the legacy of the 9 11 era is found not just in afghanistan or iraq but also in an america that drew out and heightened some of its ugliest impulses â a nation that is deeply divided like those â separated statesâ bin laden imagined that bypasses inconvenient facts and embraces conspiracy theories that demonizes outsiders and that after failing to spread freedom and democracy around the world seems less inclined to uphold them here more americans today are concerned about domestic extremism than foreign terrorism and on jan 6 2021 our own citizens assaulted the capitol building that al qaeda hoped to strike on sept 11 2001 seventeen years after the 9 11 commission called on the united states to offer moral leadership to the world and to be generous and caring to our neighbors our moral leadership is in question and we can barely be generous and caring to ourselves in â the forever war â dexter filkins describes a nation in which â something had broken fundamentally after so many years of war â â there had been some kind of primal dislocation between cause and effect a numbness wholly understandable necessary even given the pain â he was writing of afghanistan but his words could double as an interpretation of the united states over the past two decades still reeling from an attack that dropped out of a blue sky america is suffering from a sort of post traumatic stress democracy it remains in recovery still a good country even if a broken good country

over time the carbon intensity of the production process can become its own attribute of the crude itself like the density of the crude and how much sulfur is included increased scrutiny of the upstream carbon intensity associated with the production of fossil fuels has led to investors consumers and producers looking to reduce their carbon footprint or emissions which has resulted in a growing demand for low carbon crude calculating the carbon intensity of different commodities has become one of the ways the market has started to measure greenhouse gas ghg emissions from specific types of production oil produced with a lower amount of ghg emissions has a lower carbon intensity than crudes produced with higher emissions in turn crudes that are produced with a higher volume of

minsk conferenceâ 4 as the title of that resolution notes this is a conflict over the nagorno karabakh region it is also about the return of 7 surrounding districts to azerbaijan in 1991 at the time of its independence the borders of azerbaijan were internationally recognised including by the council of europe while at the same time the armenian population of the nagorno karabakh region claimed the right to self determination as a consequence of the 1991 1994 war the united nations passed resolutions 822 1993 853 1993 874 1993 and 884 1993 urging the parties to comply and to refrain from any armed hostilities and withdraw military forces from any occupied territories as the title of that resolution notes this is a conflict over the nagorno karabakh region it is also about the return of 7

accession to the council of europe in january 2001 to use only peaceful means for settling the conflict at the same time armenia committed itself to use its considerable influence over the nagorno karabakh region to foster a solution to the conflict these commitments remain in place 6 the current report takes into account this background and focuses on humanitarian consequences not political consequences or political solutions it looks primarily at the recent 6 week war and ongoing challenges in addition there are certain humanitarian consequences from the 1991 1994 war and its aftermath which need to be considered the current report takes into account this background and focuses on humanitarian consequences not political consequences or political solutions it looks primarily at the recent 6 week warand ongoing challenges in addition there are certain humanitarian consequences from the 1991 1994 war and its aftermath which need to be considered 7 the main issues to be covered include the dead missing and wounded prisoners of war alleged captives allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts landmines and unexploded ordnance displaced persons border tensions cultural heritage hate speech 2 1 the trilateral statement of 9 10 november 2020 8 the war broke out on 27 september 2020 and after 6 weeks the trilateral statement of 9 10â november 2020 provided the main elements of a cease fire and created a framework to solve many of the humanitarian consequences it was signed by the president of the republic of azerbaijan mrâ ilham aliyev the prime minister of the republic of armenia mrâ nikol pashinyan and the president of the russian federation mrâ vladimir putin 9 the statement included an agreement that armenia and azerbaijan the parties remain in their current positions and that there be a phased return of certain regions this effectively led to the return of the seven surrounding districts and parts of the nagorno karabakh region 10 the statement gave a major role of peacekeeping to the russian federation for a five year renewable period deployed in parallel with the withdrawal of the armenian armed forces 11 the statement also provides for guaranteed safety along the lachin corridor to allow communication between armenia and the nagorno karabakh region 12 an important provision provides for the unblocking of all economic and transport links between the western regions of azerbaijan and the nakhchivan autonomous republic 13 essential to this report on the humanitarian consequences of the conflict are two provisions on displaced persons and on prisoners of war and the dead namely â internally displaced persons and refugees shall return to nagorno karabakh and adjacent areas under the control of the office of the un high commissioner for refugees â â an exchange of prisoners of war hostages and other detained persons and bodies of the dead is to be carried out â essential to this report on the humanitarian consequences of the conflict are two provisions on displaced persons and on prisoners of war and the dead namely 3 humanitarian concerns 3 1 dead missing and wounded 14 the military death toll from the recent 6 week war is understood to stand at 3â 945 armenians and 2â 907 azerbaijanis 15 in terms of civilian casualties the armenian human rights defender has signalled 163 and the azerbaijani side has given a number of 548 including 95 civilian deaths 16 one of the major problems following any war is locating and returning the remains of missing persons the 6 week war was conducted partly in a mountainous region heavily mined with the arrival of snow hard on the heels of combat this made the location and return of bodies all the more difficult 243 armenians and 7 azerbaijanis are still missing with the assistance of the international committee of the red cross icrc the remains of 1â 651 armenians have been returned according to azerbaijan and 395 azerbaijanis dead have been returned by armenia 17 the parties can in general be commended on their efforts to find the remains of the missing from the 6 week war this said finding the outstanding missing must not be the subject of politicisation and families of the missing require additional assistance further steps are needed and full ongoing co operation is necessary under article 8 of the trilateral statement which requires the â exchange of â bodies of the dead â to be carried out â 18 from the war in the nineties there are still 3â 890 azerbaijanis unaccounted for 3â 171 military and 719civilians and around a thousand armenians according to figures provided by each side the families of these persons are waiting for the return of their loved ones almost 30 years on little progress has been made on these files over the last decades and more should now be done in the past an intergovernmental commission was created to deal with the missing working with the icrc this has to be reinvigorated so as to continue the work and dna labs need refurbishing and updating so as to provide answers to the families of the missing 19 it is essential that both sides co operate fully in the identification of burial sites and the return of remains the parties should co operate fully with each other with the icrc and the russian peacekeepers who have been playing an important role in enabling access to recent battlefields and facilitating contacts between the two sides 20 families of the missing have the right to know and require social and psychological support women are usually the ones left to pick up the pieces and have particular needs as heads of households both sides should give consideration to preparing a generic law on the missing in co operation with icrc so as to regulate the different issues arising and the needs of the families in this consideration should be given to previous recommendations of the assembly families of the missing have the right to know and require social and psychological support women are usually the ones left to pick up the pieces and have particular needs as heads of households both sides should give consideration to preparing a generic law on the missing in co operation with icrc so as to regulate the different issues arising and the needs of the families in this consideration should be given to previous recommendations of the assembly 3 2 prisoners of war alleged detainees 21 article 8 of the trilateral statement provides that â an exchange of prisoners of war â is to be carried out â 22 of the different humanitarian issues the question of prisoner release has become one of the most difficult its importance has taken on an additional dimension in the light of the inter state cases and individual petitions introduced before the european court of human rights 23 both sides are under an obligation to make lists of the persons detained and share these with the icrc as well as facilitate visits to the detainees 24 azerbaijan has as at the beginning of august 2021 returned 103 captives according to armenia including civilians and armenia 21 captives according to azerbaijan both sides maintain they have returned or released all prisoners of war but this is contested by armenia 25 there are essentially two different issues at play the first is a dispute over the categorisation of those detained by azerbaijan after the signing of the trilateral statement azerbaijan still held around 45 persons at the beginning of august 2021 this includes many of the 62 armenian soldiers captured in the area of hadrut sometimes the area is referred to as caylaqqala khtsaberd after the signing of the trilateral statement the second is the issue of the whereabouts of those said to have been captured during the war and allegedly seen in captivity or filmed in captivity about whom the azerbaijani authorities indicate they have no information 3 2 1 the hadrut 62 and other captives following the trilateral statement 26 according to azerbaijan these persons were captured on 11 12 december 2020 several weeks after the entry into force of the ceasefire it is claimed they were a terrorist sabotage group deployed within azerbaijan which allegedly killed four azerbaijani soldiers and seriously wounded one civilian five of the 62 were returned to armenia on humanitarian grounds a further three were released in may 2021 and others were released in june and july as part of the release of a total of 30 persons in two groups of 15 this happened at the same time as mine maps were handed over the azerbaijani authorities continue to maintain that those detained are not prisoners of war but are terrorists and not covered by article 8 of the trilateral statement 27 the armenian authorities deny these persons were involved in terrorist activities and state they were carrying out legally mandated military service they point to the fact that hadrut was surrounded and it was a military operation by azerbaijan to take control of the area 28 the exact circumstances of their capture remain unclear but would appear to be linked to the 6 week war and its consequences there have been many calls by the international community for the captives to be released and the rapporteur joins these calls the exact circumstances of their capture remain unclear but would appear to be linked to the 6 week war and its consequences there have been many calls by the international community for the captives to be released and the rapporteur joins these calls 29 it is important to note that the icrc has access to these detainees and visits them on a monthly basis the icrc facilitates letters and video calls with family members the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of the republic of azerbaijan has informed the rapporteur that she visited detainees on four occasions and found them to be well treated testimonies from captives returned to armenia paint a different picture it is important to note that the icrc has access to these detainees and visits them on a monthly basis the icrc facilitates letters and video calls with family members the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of the republic of azerbaijan has informed the rapporteur that she visited detainees on four occasions and found them to be well treated testimonies from captives returned to armenia paint a different picture 30 the rapporteur made repeated requests to be able to meet the captives himself before and during his fact finding visit to azerbaijan in july 2021 not only to verify the well being of the persons concerned but also as a means of confidence building for both sides he regrets very much that this request was not granted notwithstanding the explanation given that visits were restricted to specialised bodies in view of the opaqueness of the situation of armenian captives allegations of ill treatment covered later in this report and that the only international body able to visit captives so far is the icrc the rapporteur considers it is essential that the council of europeâ s own monitoring body the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cpt undertakes a visit as soon as possible furthermore as both the icrc and the cpt work under strict codes of confidentiality it is essential that there be more openness about the situation of these captives this is important in the light of the following paragraphs 3 2 2 alleged captives unacknowledged by the azerbaijani authorities 31 figures of hundreds of individuals allegedly held secretly in captivity have been spoken of but there are many who have fallen in the war and who are missing there are others who may have been identified in videos by multiple families wanting to believe the same person in a blurred image is their son 32 nonetheless the rapporteur has been shown alleged evidence of 31 individuals held captive including videos photographs and information on the place and circumstances of their capture and their identities the rapporteur has also been shown alleged evidence of others held in captivity without the means to identify precisely who they are only that they are captives and not persons otherwise identified this information is available to the european court of human rights and in the hands of the armenian and azerbaijani authorities the rapporteur was able to hand over the list of 31â individuals mentioned to the prosecutor generalâ s office of azerbaijan and also the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of the republic of azerbaijan during his visit 33 the azerbaijani authorities have not been able to acknowledge the whereabouts or fate of these individuals which raises serious concerns including the prospect of enforced disappearances this is all the more disconcerting in the light of allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts covered later in this report 34 the azerbaijani authorities have reportedly set up a task force to look into the fate of these persons and other issues relating to alleged human rights violations they have said they will be sending in batches information on their findings to the european court of human rights it is crucial that this is followed up by the authorities without delay and that full co operation is extended to the european court of human rights 3 2 3 the european court of human rights and interim measures 35 the cornerstone of the council of europe is its european convention on human rights ets no 5 it is the single most important commitment of member states to which both armenia and azerbaijan have signed up the findings of its court are judicial and non political and binding on member states 36 since the outbreak of the 6 week war the european court of human rights has received many requests for interim measures in a decision of 29 september 2020 the court applied rule 39 â calling on both azerbaijan and armenia to refrain from taking any measures in particular military actions which might entail breaches of the convention rights of the civilian population including putting their life and health at risk and to comply with their engagements under the convention notably in respect of article 2 right to life and article 3 prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of the convention â since the outbreak of the 6 week war the

october the court applied rule 39 again calling on all states directly or indirectly involved including turkey to respect their obligations under the convention 38 inter state requests were lodged by armenia against azerbaijan on 18 october and by azerbaijan against armenia on 26 october and on 4 november the court clarified that the application of rule 39 included also â the convention rights of those who are captured during the conflict and those whose rights might otherwise be violated â inter state requestswere lodged by armenia against azerbaijan on 18 october and by azerbaijan against armenia on 26 october and on 4 november the court clarified that the application of rule 39 included also â the convention rights of those who are captured during the conflict and those whose rights might otherwise be violated â 39 in addition to the inter state requests the court received numerous requests under rule 39 lodged against both sides 40 against this backdrop the european court of human rights on 16 march 2021 made a statement concerning alleged captives taking the unusual step of notifying the committee of ministers of interim measures against this backdrop the european court of human rights on 16 march 2021 made a statement concerning alleged captives taking the unusual step of notifying the committee of ministers of interim measures 41 the court informed the committee of ministers that these measures remained in force concerning 188 armenians allegedly captured by azerbaijan and that the azerbaijani government had failed â to respect the time limits â â and commented on the â rather general and limited information provided by them â at the same time and for the sake of completeness the court explained it had suspended the examination of rule 39 cases concerning 16 azerbaijanis captured 3 2 4 concerns of the parliamentary assembly 42 on 13 april 2021 after discussion in the committee on migration refugees and displaced persons the chair mrâ pierre alain fridez

recent release of some of the post trilateral statement captives notably the two releases of 15 persons on 12 june and 3 july 2021 most of the remaining captives are facing or have undergone criminal trials and armenia contends that they are being held and tried on trumped up charges without appropriate european convention on human rights safeguards they have petitioned the european court of human rights on this issue 44 at the end of july 2021 it is reported that more than 60 armenian captives most of whom were captured after the cease fire are standing trial or have been convicted thirty nine armenians have been sentenced to six years in prison in three trials and another two have received sentences of four years twelve were sentenced to six months and were released and repatriated to armenia in a russian brokered trade involving the handing over of landmine maps a lebanese armenian was sentenced to 20â years in prison and a russian armenian was detained in baku and sentenced to 10â years in prison for â terrorist actionsâ and â illegal border crossingâ at the end of july 2021 it is reported that more than 60 armenian captives most of whom were captured after the cease fire

russian armenian was detained in baku and sentenced to 10â years in prison for â terrorist actionsâ and â illegal border crossingâ 45 for the rapporteur the types of charges put forward and the speed with which they have been dealt with raise concerns about the fairness of the proceedings and the politicisation of the issue of the captives this frustrates attempts to build confidence between the two countries and affects those held in captivity and their families these captives should be released without delay 3 3 allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts 46 a great deal of information has been circulated on social media recorded by reputed international ngos documented by the human rights defender and ombudsman on both sides and included in inter state cases and individual cases brought before the european court of human rights 47 highly disturbing images videos and post mortem details have been sent to the rapporteur including of alleged horrific executions

killing citizens by the indiscriminate use of weapons including cluster munitions ballistic missiles and imprecise rockets and artillery they also accuse each other of using phosphorous munitions which set fire to forests in the conflict region 58 the chairperson of the committee on migration mrâ pierre alain fridez at the height of the war made a statement calling for missile strikes on

picture of the allegations and the weapons used and the destruction on both sides is available from the armenian and azerbaijani sides including from the human rights defender of the republic of armenia and the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of the republic of azerbaijan both sides during the war had a responsibility to respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians from explosive weapons bound to have a wide impact in civilian areas in view of the number of strikes on civilian areas both sides must have been aware of the effect their attacks would have on civilians 3 3 5 use of mercenaries and foreign fighters during the recent 6 week war 62 the un working group on the use of mercenaries has commented on widespread reports that azerbaijan with turkeyâ s assistance used syrian fighters during the six week war including on the frontline the fighters appeared to be motivated primarily by private gain and in the case of death their relatives were reportedly promised financial compensation as well as turkish nationality the chair of the working group indicated that the way these individuals were recruited transported and used in and around the

war the rapporteur received a detailed list of armenians from different countries and a number of other nationals alleged to be involved 3 3 6 concluding remarks on allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts 64 while both sides deny the authenticity of certain information there is evidence of an extremely disturbing nature that cannot be put aside and both countries need to fully investigate the allegations and bring to justice anyone including at command level found to be responsible for crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts both countries should co operate fully with the european court of human rights on the complaints lodged against them turkey also needs to co operate fully with the court in relation to accusations made by armenia including on the issue of recruitment of mercenaries unless there is accountability and compensation for victims and unless there is some form of truth and reconciliation these allegations of crimes war crimes and other wrongful acts will poison relations between the two countries for generations and the consequences of the conflict will linger 3 4 landmines and unexploded ordnance 65 the conflict over the nagorno karabakh region is said to have resulted in one of the most contaminated regions in the world both sides planted mines in the early 1990s and afterwards new mines were reportedly laid by retreating armenian forces in the 6 week war 66 mines are not generally prohibited under international law the use of mines is however strictly limited by codified general principles of the law of war 67 armenia and azerbaijan are not parties to many of the international texts and as such this complicates the demining of the conflict region nonetheless according to customary international humanitarian law demining is in principle the responsibility of the party that has carried out the mining furthermore in peace agreements plans for mine clearance must be exchanged between the parties and forwarded to the un secretary general and responsibility for mine clearance has to be defined armenia and azerbaijan are not parties to many of the international texts and as such this complicates the demining of the conflict region nonetheless according to customary international humanitarian law demining is in principle the responsibility of the party that has carried out the mining furthermore in peace agreements plans for mine clearance must be exchanged between the parties and forwarded to the un secretary general and responsibility for mine clearance has to be defined 3 4 1 extent of mines and unexploded ordnance 68 it is impossible to give an accurate figure although it can be said that all regions affected by the conflict have been affected by mines and unexploded ordnance it is impossible to give an accurate figure although it can be said that all regions affected by the conflict have been affected by mines and unexploded ordnance 69 mine clearance has been an ongoing struggle for both sides even before the six week war 70 on the azerbaijani side mine clearance has been strengthened since the signing of an agreement between the anama azerbaijan national agency for mine action and the united nations development program undp in march 2021 this co operation is not new and anama and the undp have jointly eliminated more than 800â 000 mines and other explosive objects over the past 20â years on the azerbaijani side mine clearance has been strengthened since the signing of an agreement between the anama azerbaijan national agency for mine action and the united nations development program undp in march 2021 this co operation is not new and anama and the undp have jointly eliminated more than 800â 000 mines and other explosive objects over the past 20â years 71 on the armenian side the british charity halo trust is helping in mines clearance since 2000 it has provided the only large scale mine clearance capacity in the nagorno karabakh region clearing almost 500 minefields 3 4 2 casualties 72 the conflict area remains riddled with mines and casualties are high 73 between 1999 and 2017 147 armenians and 373 azerbaijanis were said to be victims of mines and accidents continue to occur according to the azerbaijani authorities since the end of the 6 week war 140â persons have been injured including 27 killed between 1999 and 2017 147 armenians and 373 azerbaijanis were said to be victims of mines and accidents continue to occur according to the azerbaijani authorities since the end of the 6 week war 140â persons have been injured including 27 killed 74 azerbaijan accuses armenia of not providing maps of the minefields for many months after the end of the war no progress was made on this but on 12 june 2021 armenia provided maps indicating 97â 000 mines in the region of aghdam while simultaneously azerbaijan released 15 armenian captives this was an important step in confidence building and cleared the way to a further handing over of maps of 92â 000 mines in the fuzuli and zangilan districts on 3 july 2021 along with a further release of 15â armenian captives mine maps from other districts could reveal once handed over up to a million further mines according the azerbaijani authorities azerbaijan accuses armenia of not providing maps of the minefields for many months after the end of the war no progress was made on this but on 12 june 2021 armenia provided maps indicating 97â 000 mines in the region of aghdam while simultaneously azerbaijan released 15 armenian captives this was an important step in confidence building and cleared the way to a further handing over of maps of 92â 000 mines in the fuzuli and zangilan districts on 3 july 2021 along with a further release of 15â armenian captives mine maps from other districts could reveal once handed over up to a million further mines according the azerbaijani authorities 75 the situation is clear on a humanitarian front and in terms of international humanitarian law both sides need to co operate fully and armenia is obliged to share without delay the maps that it has in its possession this is essential to minimise the ongoing loss of life and allow the gradual return of displaced persons to these mined areas 76 both countries require assistance in clearing mines this includes human resources equipment training and funding in the latter respect it is important to note that the average cost of removing a single mine ranges from us 300 to us 1â 000 it should also be kept in mind that relevant mine and unexploded ordnance awareness programmes are essential for the civilian population and support for victims has to be provided 3 5 displaced persons 3 5 1 armenia 77 not since the arrival of around 300â 000 refugees and displaced persons from the 1990â s war and events preceding it has armenia faced such a displacement at the height of the 6 week war there were around 91â 000 displaced persons predominantly women and children and elderly men most found accommodation and shelter in yerevan or elsewhere in armenia many staying with host families short term accommodation was also provided in hotels and other places often in regions close to the conflict the spread of covid 19 during the period exacerbated the problem of dealing with the needs of the displaced persons 78 of those who were originally displaced many returned to stepanekert khankendi and other parts of the nagorno karabakh region which remained under the control of armenia 79 as at the end of may 2021 there remained 36â 882 armenians from the conflict living in a refugee like situation 85â of them women and children there are some who will return when they are more certain of security particularly women and children and there are some who plan to move abroad there is a large category of around 24â 615 who come from areas returned under azerbaijani control and the rapporteur understands that there have been no returns to these areas and the persons concerned are unlikely to return returns have now largely dried up to a trickle and even if returns are the favoured option these should be voluntary in safety and in dignity and no undue pressure should be put on persons to return as at the end of may 2021 there remained 36â 882armenians from the conflict living in a refugee like situation 85â of them women and children there are some

trickle and even if returns are the favoured option these should be voluntary in safety and in dignity and no undue pressure should be put on persons to return 80 the first priority that the armenian authorities faced at the outbreak of the six week war was dealing with basic humanitarian needs including shelter food medical matters and education for children in the nagorno karabakh region where the un and unhcr and other international organisations do not have access the icrc was almost the only international presence along with the halo trust demining doctors without borders and a few other ngos 81 for those displaced while they have the same rights as citizens of the republic of armenia they remain socially and psychologically vulnerable similar to those in a refugee situation 82 the armenian government allocated financial support to those affected by the conflict including the displaced the families of civilian victims and persons with disabilities those who lost their homes family members of missing servicemen and injured servicemen they provided medical care and unemployment benefit for displaced persons and assistance for those who hosted displaced persons 83 according to the human rights defender of armenia the education of about 30â 000 school and kindergarten children was affected and 12 kindergartens and 71 schools were damaged or destroyed 84 in the first days of the war once the primary needs of food hygiene and shelter were catered for the authorities started providing cash assistance monthly allowances the rapporteur understands that the continuation of these cash support programmes will be a challenge including for international organisations providing funding as they require guarantees to ensure delivery in line with donor requirements in the first days of the war once the primary needs of food hygiene and shelter were catered for the authorities started providing cash assistance monthly allowances the rapporteur understands that the continuation of these cash support programmes will be a challenge including for international organisations providing funding as they require guarantees to ensure delivery in line with donor requirements 85 alongside cash assistance one of the major priorities is to provide long term shelter for those displaced and unlikely to return this means building new houses and apartments and dealing with in the longer term issues of property rights 86 providing livelihoods for those who cannot return is also a challenge over 50 are women and there is a need to tailor support including temporary job creation schemes in their favour public works are now the main source of employment but this creates a gender challenge as most jobs are seen to be â for menâ many persons are also racking up debts and require income to pay for rent so access to work is important there is also the dimension that employment gives in terms of self satisfaction 87 children make up between 32 42 of the displaced and while their basic needs are being met further access to education for example access to computers and computer tablets and ensuring that shelters are closer to schools and psycho social support is required 88 those who remained in the nagorno karabakh region or returned are facing a range of problems as outlined to the rapporteur by persons from the region when he met with them in yerevan or in on line meetings they feel isolated and frustrated with the international community and as one person said â during the war no one came after the war no one cameâ this is a reference to the lack of access to the territory and presence in the territory by international organisations with the exception of the icrc 89 persons from the region also raised what they felt were existential threats to their future referring to hate speech and alleged atrocities committed during the six week war they spoke as well of insecurity due to the vicinity of azerbaijani troops shots being fired day and night and security concerns when on the road particularly if crossing between sides in the fields and visiting graves threats from mines and unexploded ordnance also remain an issue persons from the region also raised what they felt were existential threats to their future referring to hate speech and alleged atrocities committed during the six week war they spoke as well of insecurity due to the vicinity of azerbaijani troops shots being fired day and night and security concerns when on the road particularly if crossing between sides in the fields and visiting graves threats from mines and unexploded ordnance also remain an issue 90 their basic needs are apparently being met even if there are pockets of problems a number of houses were destroyed during the recent war and the housing stock is insufficient to house those displaced including those from other parts of the conflict region who wish to resettle there are plans to build 1â 600 houses including 1â 000 houses which are to be provided by the russia federation electricity has been a problem as the number of power plants has reportedly been reduced from 36 to 6 due to the war and water supply has also reportedly been a problem furthermore for those injured during the war rehabilitation and health care often means travelling to yerevan 91 in terms of livelihoods there is not much available in the nagorno karabakh region apart from public employment and temporary employment contracts which is why direct financial assistance is required financial strain is however alleviated through the provision of utilities free of charge there is a lack of jobs for women and capacity building is needed to promote livelihoods which is something the international community could support and promote more 3 5 1 1 international assistance 92 in terms of assistance the icrc plays an essential role being almost the only international organisation that has access to the whole conflict region during and after the end of the conflict it has provided medical supplies food parcels hygiene items heaters financial assistance water and habitat support education materials for children as well as briefings on weapons contamination it has also visited prisoners of war undertaken prisoner exchanges and assisted with the location of missing persons and the return of the remains of the fallen the icrc has been financially supported in particular by the european union and at the end of june 2021 the icrc announced an increase in its mission budget for the nagorno karabakh region to a level of â 50 million 93 under paragraph 7 of the trilateral statement it is provided that â internally displaced persons and refugees shall return to nagorno karabakh and adjacent areas under the control of the office of the un high commissioner for refugeesâ however unhcr has so far not been able to negotiate access and the same applies to other un agencies and international organisations including the council of europe this is highly regrettable and both armenia and azerbaijan share a responsibility for the situation which adversely affects the delivery of humanitarian aid the rights of the persons living in the area and the ability to monitor what is happening the rapporteur recognises that his report is weakened by his inability to visit the conflict region and see for himself 94 in order to deal with displacement and other humanitarian issues the united nations has set up a co ordination structure under the lead of a resident coordinatorâ s office and unhcr for current priorities the un requires us 62 1 million it carries out work under a number of working groups and sub working groups these include â protectionâ focusing on those living in a refugee like situation â shelter and non food itemsâ including the â cash sub working groupâ other working groups cover â food security and nutritionâ â healthâ and â early recoveryâ which provides livelihoods to those who cannot return in

armenia in general and stated on 9 july 2021 that it would mobilise a further â 1 billion in assistance which goes beyond the â 1 6 billion previously announced 96 the russian federation has also been providing substantial aid to victims of the conflict and in april 2021 it was reported to have provided us 15 million aid to victims working through its interagency center for humanitarian reaction in addition it has played an important role in securing the trilateral statement and its peacekeeping contingent has helped to guarantee security and stability and assisted in the location of missing persons the russian federation has also been providing substantial aid to victims of the conflict and in april 2021 it was reportedto have provided us 15 million aid to victims working through its

stability and assisted in the location of missing persons 3 5 1 2 move towards a medium and long term recovery 97 in general there is a necessity to move towards a medium and long term recovery on the basis of on going needs assessments to be undertaken with international donors focusing in particular on those who are unable to return as well as the most vulnerable the rapporteur understands that armenia is preparing a large scale humanitarian appeal it is important that this focusses not only on recovery but also on peace building the council of europe in its current action plan for armenia and in preparing a new action plan 2023 2026 could provide expertise in designing and implementing policies towards displaced persons to ensure they are human rights compatible consideration should in particular be given to confidence building peace building measures gender equality tolerance and property issues 3 5 2 azerbaijan 98 for azerbaijan the six week war has had major consequences for displaced persons around 40â 000 were temporarily displaced during the recent war almost all of whom have returned the great challenge now is the return and settlement of displaced persons and refugees from the 1990s where estimates are given of around 650â 000 internally displaced approximately 200â 000 refugees and 45â 000 meskhetian turk refugees 99 of the 40â 000 persons displaced during the recent war almost all have been able to return and their homes where damaged have either been repaired or are under repair children whose schooling was disrupted have been able to return 100 in relation to the displaced and the refugees from the 1990s it has taken decades to deal with their transitory durable displacement more than 7 7 billion azerbaijani manats â 3 82 billion including 1 4 billion provided by humanitarian agencies have been spent on this legislation was adopted to deal with their needs housing was provided free of charge monthly allowances were provided and many of the displaced persons were employed by the state or in seasonal work over 315â 000 persons were provided with improved accommodation the assembly had the possibility to look into their situation on various occasions including in in relation to the displaced and the refugees from the 1990s it has taken decades to deal with their transitory durable displacement more than 7 7 billion azerbaijani manats â 3 82 billion including 1 4 billion provided by humanitarian agencies have been spent on this legislation was adopted to deal with their needs housing was provided free of charge monthly allowances were provided and many of the displaced persons were employed by the state or in seasonal work over 315â 000 persons were provided with improved accommodation the assembly had the

refugees and displaced persons in armenia azerbaijan and georgiaâ and recommendation 1570 2002 â situation of refugees and displaced persons in armenia azerbaijan and georgiaâ 101 now that it is possible to plan for returns a new law on returnees is under preparation and the views of unhcr are under consideration before these people return the territories need demining and only then can re construction take place according to a recent survey 65â of those displaced want to go back and the authorities believe more will wish to return once infrastructure is in place the extent of the challenge is huge and there will be many associated issues including providing basic infrastructure livelihoods healthcare education etc to deal with this 17 working groups have been set up across state entities handling the logistics of such a large operation this will take not just years but possibly decades although the first pilot resettlement could occur in 2023 the ministry of economy has developed a draft â state programme on the restoration and sustainable development of the liberated territories of azerbaijan for 2021 2025â it aims to restore and reconstruct the liberated territories integrate them into the country s economy ensure sustainable and balanced development and achieve high standards of social welfare 102 the rapporteur was able to visit one of the areas concerned aghdam and see the total destruction and view the project for reconstruction this will be part of a plan to build 9 10 new cities ensuring sustainable living conditions in smart city projects the project will need to take into account that many of those displaced from the region previously worked in agriculture but are now urbanised the authorities do not plan to rush these projects and sensibly prefer to go at a pace which assures their success 103 there is currently limited assistance provided by the international community to azerbaijan while during the 6 week war the authorities chose to handle the displacement challenge on their own dealing with the return of the displaced from the early 1990s will be a much more complex and expensive issue unhcr and un agencies have offered to help in particular on legal aspects and property issues linked to return the european union has recently put forward an aid package of â 140 million in favour of azerbaijan this is substantially less than that provided to armenia the international community is encouraged to provide assistance to azerbaijan for both recovery and peace building there is currently limited assistance provided by the international community to azerbaijan while during the 6 week war the authorities chose to handle the displacement challenge on their own dealing with the return of the

european union has recently put forward an aid package of â 140 million in favour of azerbaijan this is substantially less than that provided to armenia the international community is encouraged to provide assistance to azerbaijan for both recovery and peace building 3 6 border tensions 104 the trilateral statement provides in article 1 for â a complete ceasefire and termination of all hostilities in the area of the nagorno karabakh conflictâ and for â the republic of azerbaijan and the republic of armenia â to â stop in their current positionsâ 105 the recent border tensions started on 12 may 2021 with alleged border incursions by azerbaijan into the armenian region of syunik and more particular the area of black lake on the same day azerbaijani media reported azerbaijani armed forces would soon be holding military exercises with up to 15â 000 troops 300 tanks and other equipment this created even greater tension in the region 106 in relation to this incident azerbaijan said their troops were taking up positions after the winter and were not deployed on armenian territory and disputed the maps in armeniaâ s hands and put forward other maps 107 armenia triggered article 2 of the collective security treaty which provides â in case of menace to safety stability territorial integrity and sovereignty of one or several member states â â a mechanism of joint consultations to coordinate positions and take appropriate measures can be launched 108 steps were however taken over the next days to ease tension with the involvement of russian peacekeepers and also mediation at a political level with the ministers of foreign affairs of the russian federation france and tajikistan who chairs the collective security treaty organization all sides stressed the importance of resolving tension through political and diplomatic means 109 since then border incidents have continued on a semi regular basis at different points along the border there have been people injured and killed and armenian servicemen have been detained sparking a request for interim measures to the european court of human rights to protect their rights since then border incidents have continued on a semi regular basis at different points along the border there have been people injured and killed and armenian servicemen have been detained sparking a request for interim measures to the european court of human rights to protect their rights 110 incidents have continued throughout june and july 2021 with regular allegations of shots being fired by both sides and further skirmishes leading to injuries and loss of life the rapporteur felt compelled to make a statement on 30 july 2021 regretting the death of three armenian servicemen and one azerbaijani serviceman calling on the parties to de escalate and noting that the long standing humanitarian concerns affecting the lives of individuals each side of the border cannot be addressed unless violence stops the co chairs of the osce minsk group also made a statement calling for immediate de escalation and comprehensive implementation of the truce of 9 november the russian minister of foreign affairs joined in calls on the parties to show restraint incidents have continued throughout june and july 2021 with regular allegations of shots being fired by both sides and further skirmishes leading to injuries and loss of life the rapporteur felt compelled to make a statement on 30 july 2021 regretting the death of three armenian servicemen and one azerbaijani serviceman calling on the parties to de escalate and noting that the long standing humanitarian concerns affecting the lives of individuals each side of the border cannot be addressed unless violence stops the co chairs of the osce minsk group also made a statement calling for immediate de escalation and comprehensive implementation of the truce of 9 november the russian minister of foreign affairs joined in calls on the parties to show restraint 111 the rapporteur is not able to assess who is to blame for each incident 112 allegations of shootings in the vicinity of border villages referred to on a number of occasions by the human rights defender of the republic of armenia are of concern this has a destabilising impact on border communities in terms of their security well being access to their pastures and communication links 113 it is essential that there is a de escalation and that both sides adapt to a new proximity and the challenge this creates it is essential that talks on demarcation and delimitation continue and further consideration should be given to having a monitoring mission along the border whether organised by the osce minsk group the collective security treaty organization the un or others both sides should keep to the positions dictated under the trilateral statement and persons captured during border skirmishes should be released 114 while it will take time to regulate and solve border issues the trilateral statement does provide a positive hope for the potential reopening of transport links between armenia and azerbaijan and possibly as an offshoot also between armenia and turkey this will bring benefits to all concerned and could be what is required to start an effective process of reconciliation and peacebuilding both sides will need to negotiate on this and azerbaijan should refrain from any threat to open a right of passage by force 3 7 cultural heritage 115 the long running conflict has had a devastating impact on the cultural heritage of the region affecting both sides 116 azerbaijan points to massive destruction which took place during the 1991 1994 war and its aftermath in the areas of fuzuli aghdam but also in shusha shushi and elsewhere it also refers to looting and destruction at the end of the 6 week war 117 the ministry of culture of azerbaijan is currently carrying out an investigation to determine the degree of cultural damage the results of the preliminary investigation indicate damage or destruction of 706 state registered historical and cultural monuments 6 of world class architecture 5 of world class archaeology 119 of national importance 121 of national archaeological importance along with damage or destruction to other architecture parks monument and decorative applied art of local importance and significance 118 azerbaijan also alleges that more recently artefacts and ancient manuscripts of 13th century khudavang dadivank monastery as well as precious artefacts found during archaeological excavations have been illegally transported to armenia azerbaijan also allegesthat more recently artefacts and ancient manuscripts of 13th century khudavang dadivank monastery as well as precious artefacts found during archaeological excavations have been illegally transported to armenia 119 azerbaijan is currently negotiating with unesco concerning access to the region to carry out an independent technical mission with the aim of assessing the status of this heritage 120 the rapporteur was able to see the extent of some of this damage and destruction during his visit to aghdam the city once home to around 28â 000 residents with the region having well over 100â 000 residents is now an uninhabitable wasteland not just because of land mines but because almost all the buildings have been destroyed and building materials or objects of value even from graves looted the mosque in aghdam with its two minarets is more or less the only building left standing it was allegedly used for a period of time until it was wired off to keep livestock the extent of damage to homes and cultural heritage in particular in the seven districts returned to azerbaijan during and after the conflict is massive and shocking and will take many years and substantial resources to bring the area back to life the first priority will be demining and then infrastructure has to be created homes built services provided livelihoods created and areas repopulated the position is dramatic and as one senior member of the international community commented to the rapporteur â we should all have done more over the last 30 years to prevent this level of destructionâ 121 damage and destruction have also taken place of armenian cultural heritage evidence has been provided of the destruction in the 1990s of armenian cultural heritage in nakhchivan autonomous republic with allegations that 89 medieval churches 5â 840 carved cross stones khachkars and 22â 000 historical tombstones have been vandalized and ultimately erased damage and destruction have also taken place of armenian cultural heritage evidence has been providedof the destruction in the 1990s of armenian cultural heritage in nakhchivan autonomous republic with allegations that 89 medieval churches 5â 840 carved cross stones khachkars and 22â 000 historical tombstones have been vandalized and ultimately erased 122 during the 6 week war armenia alleged the deliberate shelling of the st holy saviour ghazanchetsots cathedral in shusha shushi human rights watch has documented the attack and noted from its nature and the choice of guided weapon that â the church a civilian object with cultural significance was an intentional target despite the absence of evidence that it was used for military purposesâ other alleged deliberate destruction raised by armenia relates to the dome and bell towers of the kanach zham green church following the end of the conflict armenia alleges ongoing acts of destruction including the removal of a recently constructed church st maryâ s church near jebrail jabrayil the demolition of the 18th century armenian cemetery in the village of sghnakh signaq and the demolition of the armenian 19th century cemetery in the village of mets tagher boyuk taghlar during the 6 week war armenia alleged the deliberate shelling of the st holy saviour ghazanchetsots cathedral in shusha shushi human rights watch has documented the attack and noted from its nature and the choice of guided weapon that â the church a civilian object with cultural significance was an intentional target despite the absence of evidence that it was used for military purposesâ other alleged deliberate destruction raised by armenia relates to the dome and bell towers of the kanach zham green church following the end of the

in the village of sghnakh signaq and the demolition of the armenian 19th century cemetery in the village of mets tagher boyuk taghlar 123 the rapporteurâ s meeting with archbishop nathan hovhannisyan of the mother see gave the rapporteur a sense of how important religious monuments churches khachkars stone crosses and other religious heritage are for the people of armenia and the extent of the concern for the cultural heritage under azerbaijani control since the end of the 6 week war this is said to include 161â churches and monasteries 591 stone crosses 345 valuable tombstones 108 cemeteries and sacral sights 43â fortresses and palaces and 208 other types of monuments a further concern raised was for the security of the functioning monastery of dadivank khudavang and for the clergy who have remained under the security of russian peacekeepers 124 armenia has furthermore alleged that azerbaijan is actively engaged in historical revisionism and cultural appropriation by asserting that armenian churches in the region are not armenian but â caucasian albanianâ an ancient christian people from the early medieval period this revisionism armenia claims is also leading to the defacing and destruction of churches and monuments and a general attempt to negate armeniaâ s history and religion the rapporteur met with the state service for protection development and restoration of the cultural heritage of azerbaijan during his fact finding visit to baku the importance of the â caucasian albanianâ heritage for azerbaijan was emphasised and assurances were given that azerbaijan would do nothing to destroy what it considers to be its own cultural heritage armenia has furthermore alleged that azerbaijan is actively engaged in historical revisionism and cultural appropriation by asserting that armenian churches in the region are not armenian but â caucasian albanianâ an ancient christian people from the early medieval period this revisionism armenia claims is also leading to the defacing and destruction of churches and monuments and a general attempt to negate armeniaâ s history and religion the rapporteur met with the state service for protection development and restoration of the cultural heritage of azerbaijan during his fact finding visit to baku the importance of the â caucasian albanianâ heritage for azerbaijan was emphasised and assurances were given that azerbaijan would do nothing to destroy what it considers to be its own cultural heritage 125 it is clear there has been extensive wanton destruction of the heritage of the region by both sides going back decades this spiral has continued during the 6 week war leading to further destruction of cultural heritage important for armenians there is evidence that this destruction is continuing there is an opportunity to stop this cycle and for this it is essential that unesco is given access as soon as possible to all relevant areas in both countries 126 the rapporteur is concerned about the current narrative being developed in azerbaijan promoting a â caucasian albanianâ cultural narrative while seeking to negate an â armenianâ cultural narrative while the whole region was certainly under the influence of different religions and people over history steps to create such a new narrative negating armenian cultural heritage in particular in the light of and in response to a long running 30 year conflict should be avoided this is a matter which unesco should look at to avoid manipulation by one side or the other 127 to conclude both sides have a justified deep sense of grievance but as the director general of unesco audrey azoulay said on 18 november 2020 after speaking to both sides â damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever means damage to the cultural heritage of all mankindâ she also recalled un security council resolution 2347 2017 which stresses that â the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage looting and smuggling of cultural property in the event of armed conflict including by terrorist groups and attempts to deny historical roots and cultural diversity in this context can fuel and exacerbate conflicts and impede post conflict national reconciliationâ â 3 8 hate speech 128 the rapporteur is greatly concerned by hate speech and its consequences during the 6 week war it has been a long standing problem as noted in reports of the european commission against racism and intolerance ecri the advisory committee on the framework convention for the protection of national minorities has also highlighted the issue in relation to azerbaijan the rapporteur is greatly concerned by hate speech and its consequences during the 6 week war it has been a long standing problem as noted in reports of the european commission against racism and intolerance ecri the advisory committee on the framework convention for the protection of national minoritieshas also highlighted the issue in relation to azerbaijan 129 generations of armenians and azerbaijanis have now been raised with the rhetoric of hostility and hate which has contributed to the violence and the alleged abuse and atrocities and destruction committed during the 6 week war 130 during the recent war the level of hate speech and hate crimes on both sides reached a shocking level instances have been documented by both the human rights defender of armenia and the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of azerbaijan during the recent war the level of hate speech and hate crimes on both sides reached a shocking level instances have been documented by both the human rights defender of armeniaand the commissioner for human rights ombudsman of azerbaijan 131 many examples have been put forward ranging from frequent denigrating references to armenians as â dogsâ and the azerbaijanis as â turksâ new and old graffiti on churches and mosques and there have been serious cases of incitement to hatred and killings addressed towards armenians and azerbaijanis including towards children horrendous alleged acts of abuse and executions have been filmed and distributed on social media and should be considered as hate crimes and legislated against in so far as this is not already the case persons responsible for spreading these types of messages should be held accountable 132 the rapporteur heard various statements during his fact finding visit that azerbaijan was proud of its multiculturalism notwithstanding this statements at the highest level continue to portray armenians in such a way that cannot be considered as tolerant with the 6 week war over now should be the time to build peace and reconciliation and not a time of hate speech no matter how bitter the war or the past the way in which azerbaijanâ s victory has been portrayed in the so called military â trophy parkâ in baku in particular the mannequins of armenians shown in a denigrating fashion caricatured and stereotyped is not appropriate as the council of europe commissioner for human rights said on 27â april 2021 â i consider such images highly disturbing and humiliating â this kind of display can only further intensify and strengthen long standing hostile sentiments and hate speech and multiply and promote manifestations of intolerance â the rapporteur agrees while the azerbaijani authorities correctly refer to the existence of war museums in other countries the use of caricatured and stereotyped mannequins exacerbates levels of intolerance and should have no place in any museum or society 133 both sides allege that the other continue irredentist discourse threatening their own territorial integrity and this does not help in terms of confidence building measures both sides should refrain from any such hostile rhetoric 134 the rapporteur understands that the recent war is still raw and that real tolerance will take years and possibly generations but both the armenian and azerbaijani authorities have a responsibility to stop the rhetoric of hatred including for short term political gain and recognise the responsibility they have towards current and future generations 135 the council of europe can play a role in assisting both countries in monitoring and dealing with hate speech this should be a priority action for the council of europe building on work undertaken in the past a needs assessment should be carried out to assess how best council of europe expertise including its standards monitoring findings and co operation efforts can be taken into account and the findings should be reflected in new action plans being prepared for azerbaijan 2022 2025 and armenia 2023 2026 encouraging tolerance and tackling hate speech will require a long term approach going beyond the use of criminal law in view of the sensitivity of the issues involved and will require genuine commitment of the parties and sustained resources this should be an important contribution to confidence building between the two countries 4 conclusions 136 the council of europe will have an important role to play as armenia and azerbaijan work towards a post conflict situation the humanitarian consequences as identified in this report are significant and can only be dealt with over a long period of time some form of truth and reconciliation will be needed to allow both sides to move beyond the trauma fear and intolerance and even hatred that is still present and the monitoring bodies of the council of europe the european court of human rights and the intergovernmental and expert bodies co operation programmes and country offices of the council of europe will each have a role to play the country specific action plans of the council of europe will be essential and the new action plans under preparation for armenia 2023 2026 and azerbaijan 2022 2025 will need to take into account the challenges of dealing with the consequences of a long lasting conflict and the

menafn caribbean news global by earl bousquet former prime minister allen chastanet is tearing the new government of saint lucia to bits over its handling of the covid 19 crisis six weeks after taking office and simultaneously offering to help the new philip j pierre administration to better handle the grave national health crisis it inherited in a letter on the official letterhead of the office of the leader of the opposition dated september 22 2021 chastanet took new prime minister pierre and his entire administration to task regarding the current covid 19 crisis in saint lucia the letter cited the latest official covid 19 figures and accused pm pierre of not taking his own advice on science and evidence based decisions following are some excerpts from the four page letter of over 1 700 words government costs when our united workers party came into office in 2016 the cost to operate the country was approximately 103 million per month 43 million for wages and salaries 30 million for debt financing and 30 million for operating costs rent utilities consultancies etc and government s monthly revenue was approximately 85 million per month and government ran a deficit of approximately 20 million per month by 2019 the policies implemented in 2016 to address this fiscal imbalance had started to bear fruit the unemployment rate had dropped from 25 to 16 and the debt to gdp ratio was at 59 we had had three years of economic growth and foreign direct investments were showing promise with several projects on the verge of commencing the reduction of the value added tax vat rate combined with the application of a gas tax and increasing the airport tax helped government revenue to grow steadily peaking in 2019 to 105 million per month during this same period government used these new revenue streams to increase the allocations to education health security and infrastructure government targeted key expenses by critically reviewing operations in particular that of statutory agencies covid impact in early 2020 we started to feel the negative impact of covid both from a health perspective and an economic perspective by later that year it got progressively worse the policy we adopted then which was different to many other countries in the region was to co exist with covid even then we understood it was about lives and livelihoods and that we had to find the equilibrium between them that equilibrium was guided by the science and the resulting policies were evidenced based try as we may we could not prevent people from being infected by the virus but given the limited health infrastructure and the vulnerability of the population to the virus all we could do was to slow the infection rate to limit the number of people infected within our health system we had to make sure when people got infected especially those with underlying conditions that we would be able to take care of them avoiding what we saw transpire in italy england and new york where the number of cases taking place simultaneously overwhelmed the health system initiatives like using hotels as quarantine stations and isolation facilities helped reduce the infection rate we also came to understand that social activities house parties public functions funerals weddings and any mass crowd events combined with alcohol contributed significantly to increasing the infection rate hence curfews and limiting eliminating alcohol consumption were very effective we also learnt that businesses public offices and schools were very successful in imposing the necessary social protocols like social distancing wearing face masks and sanitizing in other words people were actually safer at work than staying home tourism manufacturing construction and our call centers all required unique protocols to stay open while keeping the population safe and preserving livelihoods we also understood the precarious economic situation we were in as a result of closing the economy for three weeks in april and reopening slowly until september government s revenue dropped from 110 million a month to 60 million and our costs increased from 100 million a month to 120 million a month the increase in cost was primarily due to the cost of the isolation facilities the operationalizing of okeu converting victoria hospital into a dedicated respiratory facility national security and importantly the redemption of government bonds catastrophic fallout a catastrophic fallout from covid 19 was the financial impact on many businesses and personal incomes which resulted in many companies institutions and individuals redeeming their bonds in 2020 the government had 700 million due and approximately 25 were redeemed the government had to pay close to 170 million in cash this left the government with a deficit of approximately 500 million entering the budget of 2020 21 this revenue shortfall was partially made up through the support of the cdb wb imf and eccb recognizing the fallout of covid all of these institutions moved unprecedentedly quickly to approve funds to help with budgetary support i was very proud of the team in finance and economic development for the incredible job that they did in the most difficult of times tasked with the efforts to extract ourselves from the eu blacklist juggling the sudden and drastic drop in revenue and increase in costs the introduction of a new finance act the arduous task of applying to multiple agencies for funds all while designing a social and economic stabilization and recovery plan this team was able to accomplish all of these tasks the government of saint lucia continued to meet all of its financial obligations specifically all wages and salaries all debt commitments including the bond redemptions government operating costs and the increased costs due to covid protocols the financial institutions provided approximately ec 300 million in very concessionary loans to the gosl the imf funds and wb funds could not be used for debt payments so they had to be allocated to other operating costs including costs associated with covid the remaining shortfall came from increasing the overdraft facility with eccb and the local regional banks and increasing our payables payables normally average 30 million and as you know they are now in excess of 100 million it means individuals and business who have provided goods and services to the government have not been paid or it has taken an excessive amount of time to be paid while we have had no choice this can only continue for a while before these entities will want to be paid in advance for any services while we were able to provide some income and food support it clearly was not enough a fact you will now have a greater appreciation for current crisis the current crisis is at a point where we will have to reintroduce some of these programs the question is where are the resources going to come from this reality will be made worse if the entire economy must be shut down again sir this problem will not resolve itself nor will it disappear any time soon this letter is not meant to dictate to you but to advise you that your government must act urgently and decisively before the health and economic systems totally collapse you cannot wait for the situation to get so overwhelming that we have no choices our covid 19 statistics continue to increase at an alarming rate more concerning is the high rate of deaths in part because people cannot access timely help unfortunately when you came into office many of the front liners were already exhausted and the current situation is only making it worse by now you must realize that you will have to adopt some of the same policies that have proven successful in the past we need to urgently slow down and temper the covid 19 infection rate to achieve this we must reduce public socializing to do so will require longer curfew hours and prohibiting alcohol sales and consumption it may also require the use of 758 759 zoning for a period of time to help the police enforce these protocols you have on many occasions commented on the poor and limited housing conditions and that is why using some of the hotels to facilitate isolation of positive cases would be useful but i do appreciate the extraordinary cost offering assistance if your government does not act now as i have alluded the country will very soon reach a point where it will shut itself down jeopardizing many more livelihoods to save lives finally we need to step up the campaign on vaccination we note the number of saint lucians getting vaccinated is far below the target and propose a broad community outreach programme where we bring the vaccine to the people and engage in a rigorous education campaign the opposition stands in solidarity with the people of saint lucia and we are willing to offer our assistance for the sake of our people and country you need to change course i fear that if you do not heed this advice it will be catastrophic coincidence while the ex prime minister s letter is dated september 22 it was released on saturday september 25 coincidentally the same day prime minister pierre was carded to deliver his maiden address to the united nations general assembly as saint lucia s new leader it pokes poor fun at prime minister pierre s insistence on the need to follow the science in covid matters but the facts and figures only now being revealed tell new stories in opposition not heard that way before the uniter workers party uwp was voted out of office the letter explains the last uwp government s covid strategy in ways the then prime minister didn t during his 16 months leading the national fight against covid 19 comparing the results of its 16 months without the delta variant yet detected with the new administration s six weeks facing its deadly effects triumphalism the letter also reveals a sense of partisan triumphalism over the worsening covid situation the type choiseul saltibus member of parliament bradely felix warned about when he told a uwp press conference last week that persons thinking that way need to have their heads examined coming at the end of a week during which so much was revealed and alleged about a controversial deal under his watch to purchase 100 000 covid 19 vaccines for saint lucia that were never delivered and with over 7 million still outstanding there was no offer of any explanation in the lengthy statement not word the letter also followed prime minister pierre s startling revelations in parliament about untold millions spent on the st jude hospital project but there was no reference to the purported vaccines scam the statement seems to suggest that the delta variant would not have been a factor had the uwp not lost the last general elections blaming everything that s gone wrong on something the new government either did or failed to do it explains why juggling finance and created economic problems was difficult during the pandemic but without accepting that the uwp administration led by chastanet bequeathed to its successors the accumulated effects of all those same financial blues the statement also totally ignores the fact that the new administration has embraced and entrusted the same health officials that served the previous one throughout its 16 months directing the war against covid from the command center flashing mirrors yet after completely dissing prime minister pierre and his administration in and out and top to bottom the letter offers the uwp s full support to cure a national sore that festered on its shift and under its watch anyone with the time can go through the statement and extract as many questions requiring answers as those it ignored but too anyone who s been around long enough will also know that this is just par for the proverbial partisan political course by any party humiliatingly rejected by the electorate and trying hard to look and sound attractive on its first post election outing on the same day the new prime minister would be delivering his maiden address at the united nations general assembly or what prime minister pierre would typically call flashing

click to view details energy risks may intensify in the fourth quarter on august 17 the national development and reform commission issued a barometer on the completion of the target of double control of energy consumption in various regions in the first half of 2021 to analyze and early warning the situation of double control of energy consumption in each province the energy consumption intensity of nine provinces regions rose instead of falling in the first half of the year which was a first level early warning including jiangsu guangdong and other major industrial provinces after higher than expected growth in energy demand this summer it began to weaken seasonally and natural gas prices peaked and fell however there has been one wave after another and the expectation that la nina could cause a cold winter has heightened global concerns about energy shortages this winter thermal coal focus on the risk of high coal prices in the fourth quarter recently thermal coal led the rise in commodities first the current inventory continues to decline has reached an all time low and second the market is expected to be difficult to ease the fundamental tension in the fourth quarter since the beginning of this year the growth of thermal coal supply has been significantly slower than demand in the first eight months raw coal production increased by only 4 4 compared with the same period last year from a regional point of view inner mongolia is a big drag which is the same as last year imports fell significantly shrinking by about 10 3 per cent year on year however on the demand side thermal power generation increased by about 15 8 in the first seven months of this year compared with the same period last year and the gap between supply and demand is obvious the number of days of coal stocks at key power plants announced by the national development and reform commission fell to 11 days in july compared with 23 days in the same period last year since the beginning of this year the number of coal approval projects has increased but the supply constraints of security inspection and environmental protection are still large and it is difficult to import a large amount according to our calculations assuming that domestic thermal coal production returns to its peak we expect national coal output to rise by nearly 2 in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year given a stable economy and flat total coal imports the situation of domestic power shortage and thermal coal shortage may be suspended with the release of coal production capacity and industrial double limit measures and the gap between supply and demand will converge slightly but the pressure of winter storage and supply during the heating season may still be high inventory may be difficult to significantly repair natural gas demand weakens seasonally but inventory is difficult to repair the international natural gas market has entered the off season of demand and the rally since june has come to an end nymex natural gas futures prices fell slightly after peaking at 5 50 million british heat on sept 16 however due to the intensification of global cold winter expectations this year market concerns about energy shortages have increased we can see that natural gas prices in asia are still rising in the past two weeks jkm natural gas swap prices in japan and south korea have risen by 43 9 to us 26 8 per million british heat and the spread over nymex natural gas prices has also continued to widen to 58 9 looking forward we still believe that before the peak gas season this winter it will be difficult for us natural gas stocks to return to their five year average there are still some upside risks in winter gas prices for details see our research report north american natural gas replenishment or shortage tightening again in winter released on september 5 2021 on the domestic side the natural gas market may tighten in winter the import cost of overseas gas will rise asian lng will still be at a premium and gas prices may still have upward risks in the fourth quarter crude oil the gap between supply and demand will converge and the impact of cold winter may be small for the international oil market the cold winter will boost global fuel oil consumption but it accounts for only about 5 per cent of oecd s total oil demand so the improvement in crude oil demand may be limited at the same time global crude oil supply continues to recover crude oil production in the gulf of mexico region of the united states is coming out of the impact of hurricanes as of september 22 it has resumed production of 83 82 in addition opec has continued to increase production since august looking ahead the gap between supply and demand of crude oil will continue to converge therefore we think that the cold winter may have less impact on the oil market on the domestic side power cuts in shandong may affect georefining production and may lead to a tight balance in the domestic refining market shandong province is a three level early warning so in terms of sustainability we believe that the reduction of georefining production may not reverse the balance of the domestic refined oil market the supply of industrial products is overpowered by the east wind over the demand recently local production restrictions and electricity restrictions have become stricter independent electric furnace plants and thread rolling lines in jiangsu and guangdong are mostly controlled because of their high power consumption the electrolytic aluminum industry in guangxi yunnan and ningxia is subject to power restriction and production restriction and the resumption and commissioning of electrolytic aluminum have high requirements for stable power supply which may be difficult to realize under the current constraints the production of stainless steel and ferronickel in fujian is affected while the zinc smelters in yunnan and guangxi were restricted by power supply as early as may and july respectively the impact on copper smelting is relatively small the processing end of basic metals is also greatly affected among the nine provinces with first level early warning the output of copper and aluminum products accounted for 29 and 27 of the national output in the first half of this year respectively therefore it is necessary to continuously track the interference of power cuts on the replenishment demand of the downstream processing industry of basic metals copper the impact of power limitation on downstream demand is greater than that on the smelting end the current power restriction measures have little impact on copper smelters in addition for copper smelting if power cuts are implemented because refined copper consumes more power companies tend to give priority to producing crude copper rather than refined copper and make up for refined copper production when power is restored so the smelting end is more controllable up to now the impact of power restriction on copper smelting production is relatively small while that of the downstream processing industry is relatively greater and it also affects the rhythm of downstream pre festival replenishment at present low inventory and scrap copper shortage still support the copper price but it is still necessary to observe the changes of domestic refined copper inventory to track the negative feedback effect of power reduction measures on copper fundamentals in the copper processing industry aluminum power limiting measures and additional code of the nine provinces named by the ndrc aluminum production accounts for 40 per cent of the country yunnan issued notices to limit electricity production in may july and september respectively and the most recent notice required green aluminum enterprises to produce no more than their average monthly output from september to december guangxi on the other hand requires that the output of six alumina enterprises and eight household appliance dealumination enterprises in september should not exceed 50 and 80 of the average monthly output in the first half of 2021 respectively electrolytic aluminum as a large power user is greatly affected by the double control of energy consumption in addition the resumption and commissioning of electrolytic aluminum has high requirements for stable power supply which is difficult to realize under the current policy power restriction also has a great impact on the downstream aluminum processing industry the inventory of electrolytic aluminum society has accumulated slightly for the second week in a row and the expected reduction in september and october has not yet been fulfilled so we need to pay continuous attention to the inventory changes after the national day holiday overseas the aluminium association of india said that the decision of state owned coal companies to slash coal supply in the non power sector has led to coal shortages in their own power plants which could have an adverse impact in the short term zinc the influence of supply chain ratio is small the zinc smelters in yunnan guangxi and hunan are affected by power cuts but on the whole the reduction is small the superimposed dumping expectation is expected and the supply side chain ratio does not change much but overseas the pressure on smelters from high electricity prices is likely to continue to increase in the fourth quarter nickel stainless steel factory production reduction nickel price pressure in the nickel industry chain stainless steel is greatly affected in mid september stainless steel enterprises in jiangsu guangdong shandong fujian and guangxi stopped and reduced production one after another and the price of stainless steel reached an all time high as production in the first half of the month has not been greatly affected we expect domestic stainless steel production to decrease by 15 to 2 3 million tons in september while 300 series stainless steel with high nickel content may reduce production by 13 to 1 2 million tons month on month considering that from january to august this year domestic stainless steel production has increased by 20 compared with the same period last year and the double limit measures of the stainless steel industry may be more stringent in the fourth quarter the expected production reduction of stainless steel will lead to a drop in the price of nickel but the price of nickel pig iron is still high nickel pig iron plants in jiangsu shandong fujian and guangxi are also affected mysteel expects production to be reduced by 10 000 tons in september coupled with reduced supply and grade of nickel ore in the philippines during the rainy season we believe that the price of nickel pig iron still has some support rebar crude steel flat control superimposed production limit and power limit the iron and steel industry was affected by crude steel horizontal control in the early stage and recently superimposed double limit independent electric furnace plants and thread rolling lines are mostly controlled because of high power consumption as of september 24 the capacity utilization rate of the rebar rolling line had fallen to 59 4 from about 81 in may this year of which the short process electric furnace billet adjustment fell to 31 7 and the rebar output dropped to 2 71 million tons the lowest since april 2020 the decline in supply has been greater than the decline in demand and inventory destocking has also accelerated although it is the peak season but downstream demand is still weak steel consumption continues to decline by about 3 4 this week of which thread is down about 5 2 and hot coil is down about 2 5 we believe that in the case of weak downstream demand thread prices have been strong recently which is more likely to be the pulse rise caused by tighter production restrictions which is more difficult to maintain in the past two weeks the spot performance during the threaded period was differentiated which was affected by production restrictions but the upward momentum was limited while the futures side weakened due to pessimistic expectations of demand and the spot rally

by jeffrey toobin cnn dr aaron kesselheim had been on an advisory committee for the us food and drug administration for a half dozen years but he had never been to a meeting like this one the fda establishes advisory committees to assist the federal agency with one of its most important duties deciding whether to approve the distribution of new drugs the stakes of these decisions are enormous based on the outcome of the fda s deliberations patients may gain access to lifesaving medicines and manufacturers may reap billions in profits kesselheim a professor at harvard medical school was one of the members of this committee because of his expertise on pharmaceuticals that address diseases of the brain including alzheimer s the irreversible progressive brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills and eventually causes death alzheimer s is the sixth leading cause of death in the united states the public meeting conducted as an all day video call on november 6 2020 concerned the application for aducanumab a drug that would be marketed under the name aduhelm by the company biogen which is based in cambridge massachusetts aduhelm if effective would address one of the most pressing needs in modern medicine to slow the symptoms of alzheimer s disease research into alzheimer s treatments has long been an exercise in frustration with no new drugs approved since 2003 the field of alzheimer s research had proved so difficult that it was dubbed by some with the macabre nickname of the valley of death in light of this record and the need to improve it kesselheim was looking forward to examining the prospects for biogen s new drug the great thing about advisory committees is that they are independent and they don t have a stake in the outcome he said we were just an independent group providing their opinion as in all advisory committee meetings this one included several representatives of the fda and of the applying pharmaceutical company dr billy dunn the director of neuroscience at the fda spoke at length on the call and samantha budd haeberlein a senior vice president of biogen led the representatives for the company what was unusual about this meeting though according to kesselheim was the apparent relationship between the fda and company representatives there was a strange dynamic compared to the other advisory committee meetings i ve attended kesselheim said usually there s some distance between the fda and the company but on this one the company and the fda were fully in line with each other in support of the drug dunn in particular was outspoken in his support for the effectiveness of the drug calling some of the evidence in its favor a home run while opponents of approval described the same evidence as inconclusive or worse dunn noted further that the fda has determined that it is appropriate to exercise the broadest flexibility in applying the statutory standards for these conditions from a regulatory perspective drugs can work in two ways they can work to treat disease or they can address a surrogate measure for the disease take heart attacks for example a drug can directly reduce the chances of heart attack or it can address a surrogate for heart attack like cholesterol at the november meeting according to kesselheim the issue was treatment of alzheimer s itself not any surrogate the discussion at the committee related to the clinical benefits of the drug that is whether it slowed the cognitive decline of alzheimer s patients he said most of the meeting was devoted to analysis of biogen s own studies of the effectiveness of aduhelm the results were not promising in terms of clinical outcomes indeed two of biogen s major studies of people taking aduhelm had been shut down before they were completed because they showed no significant benefit to patients aduhelm which is injected intravenously also caused significant side effects including brain swelling in about a third of patients brain swelling at a minimum can produce painful headaches as well as more serious problems including in rare cases death in light of this the advisory committee voted with one member voting uncertain but no one dissenting to recommend that the fda reject the drug seven months later in june the fda gave biogen final approval to treat patients with aduhelm in all stages of alzheimer s disease reflecting the confidence in its judgment the agency even acted on an accelerated basis kesselheim and two other members of the advisory committee promptly resigned in protest in his letter of resignation kesselheim called the aduhelm process probably the worst drug approval decision in recent us history of course an advisory committee s recommendations are just that advisory the fda is not required to follow them indeed one study found that between 2008 and 2015 the agency rejected advisory committee recommendations 22 of the time but kesselheim along with the other experts cnn interviewed could not recall a single occasion when the fda had rejected the unanimous conclusion of an advisory committee which is what happened here the fda s decision to approve aduhelm has already had significant consequences in the first place the drug may give hope to the roughly 6 million alzheimer s sufferers in the united states and their families the approval has already renewed investment activity in alzheimer s disease research and development and we are optimistic that other innovative treatments will soon join aduhelm said allison parks a spokeswoman for biogen we are proud of the work our dedicated team has done to develop aduhelm and of the potential it brings to alzheimer s patients the financial implications are huge as well aduhelm will be extremely expensive as an intravenous treatment that will cost about 56 000 per year plus several thousand more in related expenses given the number of alzheimer s patients in the united states the cost for widespread use of this treatment could quickly run into the many billions of dollars much of which would go to biogen and its partner in the project eisai a japanese pharmaceutical company if aduhelm is approved as a treatment by medicare which is currently weighing the issue the taxpayers will pay much of the tab at its core though the controversy about aduhelm raises a fundamental question did the fda approve a drug that doesn t help people and if so why what s going on here alzheimer s is really like nothing else in chronic disease because it is so devastating to the family and caregivers as well as the people who have it said harry johns the president of the alzheimer s association the nation s largest advocacy group for victims of the disease six million people have it now and by mid century that s going to double because of the aging of the population if you figure at least two caregivers per afflicted person that s an enormous toll on the country alzheimer s first robs victims of their memory and then takes their lives despite all research efforts alzheimer s remains both incurable and fatal the dire course of the disease and its prevalence have led to a rush of investment in potential treatments sixteen years ago the federal government spent 450 million a year on alzheimer s research today the annual total is 3 1 billion private investment based on the promise of millions of potential customers has soared as well but progress has been glacial to nonexistent this prior record of futility appears to have played some role in the fda s decision to approve aduhelm as courtney rhodes an fda spokeswoman said given the unmet needs for patients with alzheimer s disease a serious progressive and ultimately fatal disease the agency chose to use the accelerated approval pathway to allow earlier access to patients while we continue to acquire data on the drug s benefit the fda will continue to collect data on the effectiveness of aduhelm for the next nine years but other parts of the fda s explanation for its decision surprised and angered advisory committee members aduhelm is designed to address a surrogate end point for alzheimer s disease just like cholesterol medication addresses a surrogate end point for heart disease advanced medical scans reveal that many alzheimer s patients have what are called amyloid plaques toxic nests of proteins in their brains as the fda said in its original statement on aduhelm while the specific causes of alzheimer s disease are not fully known it is characterized by changes in the brain including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary or tau tangles that result in loss of neurons and their connections aduhelm is designed to remove some of the plaques and thus the theory goes slow the progress of symptoms of alzheimer s disease for the last 20 or 30 years there has been a tremendous emphasis in the research on what s known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis the idea that amyloid isn t just a symptom of the disease but that it s a cause of the disease said dr caleb alexander an epidemiologist at johns hopkins who has served on the same fda advisory committee as kesselheim for eight years there has been enormous investment in various therapies to reduce amyloid and some have even succeeded but none of them have produced the corresponding gains in cognition in other words reducing amyloid has not meant that anyone is actually getting better still when the fda approved aduhelm in june it did so because the drug reduced plaque as the agency said in its announcement of the approval three studies involving more than 3 000 patients in total showed that patients receiving the treatment had significant dose and time dependent reduction of amyloid beta plaque while patients in the control arm of the studies had no reduction of amyloid beta plaque the logic was straightforward for a surrogate medication less plaque meant less disease meant fewer symptoms as rhodes the fda spokeswoman said the fda concluded that it is reasonably likely that this reduction in amyloid plaque will result in meaningful clinical benefit to patients but that reasoning immediately came under attack from the members of the advisory committee the reduction of plaque is a surrogate measure a lab measurement which stands in for a clinical end point which is how a patient feels function or survives kesselheim said amyloid plaque is a protein deposit on the brain that you can observe on a pet scan some alzheimer s patients have it and some don t have it it s associated with alzheimer s but it s not a perfect association we don t know what it means to reduce the amyloid plaque it s not 100 clear in contrast your ldl cholesterol level is a clear surrogate measure if you change your ldl then you reduce the number of heart attacks and strokes as dr david knopman a neurologist at the mayo clinic wrote in his email of resignation from the advisory committee biomarker justification for approval in the absence of consistent clinical benefit after 18 months of treatment is indefensible but committee members were surprised by more than the fda s decision to use what they regard as a flawed surrogate measure to approve the drug they were especially offended because the issue of amyloid plaque hadn t really been raised at the committee meeting in november the whole focus of the advisory committee meeting was whether the medication affected cognitive function which it didn t improve but not whether it affected some surrogate for cognitive function said kesselheim worse yet according to the critics the fda gave aduhelm accelerated approval in june another possibility that had not been raised before the committee in notable contrast the fda did not act in an accelerated fashion when it finally approved the pfizer biontech vaccine for covid 19 in august the fda remains adamant that both the process and the result of the review of aduhelm were correct we appreciate the perspective of the members of the advisory committee and value their input the fda s rhodes said the advisory committee s view was that there was insufficient evidence that the drug provided clinical benefit taking the advisory committee s input into account we considered the application further and determined that although there was residual uncertainty about clinical benefit as the committee told us aduhelm does reduce amyloid plaque still the contested medical evidence plus the apparent coziness of the fda and biogen representatives raised questions about whether the agency was taking the advisory committee seriously at all as knopman put it while i realize that the committee is advisory the approval of aducanumab appears have been foreordained as alexander of johns hopkins put it it s the billion dollar question what s going on here in the face of all this why did the fda approve the drug should the market decide supporters of the fda s decision which include the alzheimer s association have a simple answer to this question the fda approved aduhelm because it was the right thing to do we strongly advocated approval on the basis of the available science knowing full well that this is no cure said johns the association s president it is a really marginal advantage but that marginal difference can make a real difference for people who have a great need in a larger sense johns believes that the fda s critics are applying an unfair standard we are opening the door to a first treatment and first treatment in most illnesses is not very good the first treatments of cancer and hiv aids were not very good but they led to major improvements if you get a first treatment not only do you get other treatments but the treatments get better critics reject this rationale to make the case that something is better than nothing is not the law of the land in the united states that s not the evidentiary basis for market access they have to show substantial evidence of efficacy and they didn t said alexander you can argue that theoretically that this drug should work but we don t approve drugs on that basis in the united states we do it based on data not based on theory the question of how the fda evaluated the data about aduhelm is at the core of the controversy over its approval it wasn t just the outside advisory committee that was unimpressed by the testing results for the drug as first reported by the new york times an internal fda review committee after meetings in march and april also found no justification for approval of the drug according to minutes of the meeting of approximately 15 government scientists the vast majority questioned whether the evidence met the threshold for instilling public confidence in the usefulness of the drug one member of the committee said according to the minutes approval could result in millions of patients taking aducanumab without any indication of actually receiving any benefit or worse cause harm what was more the fda s statistical analysis unit produced a study of the aduhelm results that concluded there is no compelling substantial evidence of treatment effect or disease slowing the question then is what happened between april and june when the drug was approved to turn things around to dr michael carome a physician who is the director of the health research group for the consumer advocacy nonprofit public citizen which has long been critical of the fda the reason for the agency s action can be summed up by the phenomenon known as regulatory capture that is the pharmaceutical industry has effectively taken control of the part of the government that is supposed to regulate it we believe that the fda starting back in 2019 worked in inappropriately close collaboration with biogen said carome who testified at the advisory committee meeting against fda approval of aduhelm fda became a partner with biogen and they made the decision about whether to approve the drug they were not objective unbiased regulators it seems as if the decision was preordained carome believes the shift at the fda began in earnest in 1992 when the funding stream for the government agency changed under an act of congress that year the pharmaceutical industry paid user fees to support its regulators the idea was that since the companies would benefit from the fda s decisions they should cover the costs user fees now pay for roughly 45 of the fda s budget the politicians like user fees because that means they don t have to allocate taxpayer money carome said but what this has done is encourage the agency to become a partner with industry this has led to regulatory capture of the agency which is now looking at best interests of the company rather than the best interests of public health carome notes too that advocacy organizations like the alzheimer s association also receive substantial funding from pharmaceutical companies johns replies that his organization makes its decisions on the merits and that contributions from biogen and eisai provide only a small portion of its budget just 0 15 the question of how much influence biogen exerted on the fda to approve aduhelm remains unsettled the regulatory process for pharmaceuticals is relatively unstructured at least compared with court cases where parties are forbidden from privately approaching the judge communications between people at the fda and companies whose drugs are being reviewed happen all the time said susan wood a former senior official at the fda who is now a professor at george washington university as the fda notes in public guidance on the issue sponsors often solicit feedback from fda on both scientific and regulatory issues especially at critical junctures in their development program to the fda this is a good thing communication between fda and sponsors during drug development and at critical junctures in drug development may ultimately facilitate earlier availability of safe and effective drugs to the american public the guidance continues for example the fda and the makers of the covid 19 vaccines were in regular communication while the drugs were under review and available on an experimental basis and millions of americans were able to obtain the shots and protect themselves likewise the fda welcomed biogen s involvement in the approval process the fda often works closely with industry to help foster drug development understand emerging data and advise on best approaches to development plans especially in areas where there is a significant need for treatments for devastating diseases throughout this review process fda worked with the sponsor to understand emerging data rhodes said but how much collaboration between industry and government is too much that s not clear either in general or in regard to aduhelm the absence of strict rules limiting such contacts and the lack of transparency about what goes on in these meetings has raised suspicions about whether the process serves the public interest here certainly there was a close and continuing relationship between senior officials at biogen and those at the fda as the times first reported the fda s dunn and biogen s haeberlein collaborated on publications and made joint presentations while the company s application for aduhelm was pending because this work did not directly involve aduhelm it is probably permissible if perhaps unwise more troubling were the meetings between dunn and another biogen official which were first reported by stat news under fda regulations all meetings where fda officials and company executives share clinical data about a pending application are supposed to be documented but stat news reported that dunn and al sandrock who is now the head of research and development at biogen met at a conference in philadelphia in may 2019 there the two men discussed the possibility of an accelerated approval for aduhelm which the drug ultimately received dunn as well as biogen s sandrock and haeberlein declined to comment but their representatives asserted that they had behaved appropriately at all times in a statement earlier this summer sandrock said the approval of aduhelm by the u s food and drug administration fda came after an extensive development testing and review process over more than a decade we at biogen engaged in rigorous and science driven research and development that assessed whether aduhelm could help patients worldwide who suffer from alzheimer s disease we are proud of the work our dedicated team has done to develop aduhelm and of the potential it brings to alzheimer s patients we are equally proud of the professionalism both our team and the fda demonstrated during a thorough review process the approval for aduhelm also comes as part of a broader evolution at the fda which seems to be exercising a lighter regulatory touch across the board according to dr michael greicius a professor and clinician who treats alzheimer s patients at stanford s medical school the idea at the fda increasingly seems to be if a drug is potentially effective and not clearly harmful the market should decide whether patients should use it this idea is reflected in what s known as the right to try movement which aims to allow patients greater latitude to try drugs that have not received full fda approval outside of a clinical trial the agency has a long standing expanded access program that allows patients to use unapproved drugs and congress passed a similar law in 2018 to expand patient access to experimental therapies the spirit behind these rules giving patients with serious or life threatening conditions every opportunity to find treatments that work is understandable but critics say they do little but provide false hope there s this libertarian idea that people should have the opportunity to choose what they put into their own bodies harvard s kesselheim said but that sort of free market is what led the fda to start weighing the costs and benefits of drugs in the first place during the early 1960s when pharmaceutical companies can sell almost anything they want with no oversight from government that s not a situation that s good for patients the question for families soon after aduhelm was approved in june biogen began a sophisticated marketing campaign in support of the drug starting with advertisements on the internet despite these efforts the controversy over the fda s approval of aduhelm has led to a rocky launch for the product two major medical centers mount sinai and the cleveland clinic as well as the veterans health administration announced that they would not stock or administer aduhelm to any patients because they are not convinced of its effectiveness in an even more consequential development the medicare system is reviewing whether to approve payments for use of aduhelm the overwhelming majority of people with alzheimer s are 65 and older and thus are covered by medicare medicare almost always covers fda approved drugs but if it were to reject aduhelm that would be a major blow to the product and its owner biogen a decision is likely by the end of the year several committees in congress have vowed to hold hearings about the approval process and individual representatives have been scathing in their criticism of both the fda and biogen early in september the chairs of two leading house committees sent the fda a 13 page letter demanding a great deal of information about the process that had led to the approval of aduhelm earlier in a letter to president joe biden sen joe manchin a west virginia democrat demanded that dr janet woodcock the acting commissioner of the fda be fired even though the agency has said she played no role in the aduhelm decision manchin said the aduhelm approval process brings into question the current interim leadership of dr woodcock at a time when strong trusted leadership at our health agencies is most important biden has not yet nominated a permanent leader for the fda woodcock in turn has asked for the agency s inspector general to review the aduhelm approval apparently in response to the controversy biogen requested that the fda dial back its approval of aduhelm to just early stage sufferers with alzheimer s and the agency agreed limiting the market somewhat but the company is plowing ahead in a call with stock analysts in july michel vounatsos the chief executive of biogen acknowledged confusion and criticism surrounding the approval of aduhelm but said the company was proceeding with its product launch i want to be clear that biogen stands behind the integrity of the review process vounatsos said notwithstanding the controversy the company has estimated that first year sales of the drug will be about 1 billion lilly another major pharmaceutical company has a similar product in the approval process at the fda and has sought to receive approval on the same grounds all of which leaves perhaps the most important question what should alzheimer s patients and their families do the question is especially difficult because at the moment neither insurance nor medicare will cover the cost of aduhelm once the fda approved it i ve been faced with the real world possibility of prescribing it to this person sitting in front of me said greicius who studies the disease and treats patients at stanford i think some patients and family members even when presented with the lack of clinical efficacy concerning side effect profile and out of pocket costs will opt to roll the dice because they feel they have nothing to lose he said there is no question that patients family members and physicians are all desperate for a medication that helps that s what makes the false hope of aduhelm particularly cruel the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
menafn caribbean news global by earl bousquet former prime minister allen chastanet is tearing the new government of saint lucia to bits over its handling of the covid 19 crisis six weeks after taking office and simultaneously offering to help the new philip j pierre administration to better handle the grave national health crisis it inherited in a letter on the official letterhead of the office of the leader of the opposition dated september 22 2021 chastanet took new prime minister pierre and his entire administration to task regarding the current covid 19 crisis in saint lucia the letter cited the latest official covid 19 figures and accused pm pierre of not taking his own advice on science and evidence based decisions following are some excerpts from the four page letter of over 1 700 words government costs when our united workers party came into office in 2016 the cost to operate the country was approximately 103 million per month 43 million for wages and salaries 30 million for debt financing and 30 million for operating costs rent utilities consultancies etc and government s monthly revenue was approximately 85 million per month and government ran a deficit of approximately 20 million per month by 2019 the policies implemented in 2016 to address this fiscal imbalance had started to bear fruit the unemployment rate had dropped from 25 to 16 and the debt to gdp ratio was at 59 we had had three years of economic growth and foreign direct investments were showing promise with several projects on the verge of commencing the reduction of the value added tax vat rate combined with the application of a gas tax and increasing the airport tax helped government revenue to grow steadily peaking in 2019 to 105 million per month during this same period government used these new revenue streams to increase the allocations to education health security and infrastructure government targeted key expenses by critically reviewing operations in particular that of statutory agencies covid impact in early 2020 we started to feel the negative impact of covid both from a health perspective and an economic perspective by later that year it got progressively worse the policy we adopted then which was different to many other countries in the region was to co exist with covid even then we understood it was about lives and livelihoods and that we had to find the equilibrium between them that equilibrium was guided by the science and the resulting policies were evidenced based try as we may we could not prevent people from being infected by the virus but given the limited health infrastructure and the vulnerability of the population to the virus all we could do was to slow the infection rate to limit the number of people infected within our health system we had to make sure when people got infected especially those with underlying conditions that we would be able to take care of them avoiding what we saw transpire in italy england and new york where the number of cases taking place simultaneously overwhelmed the health system initiatives like using hotels as quarantine stations and isolation facilities helped reduce the infection rate we also came to understand that social activities house parties public functions funerals weddings and any mass crowd events combined with alcohol contributed significantly to increasing the infection rate hence curfews and limiting eliminating alcohol consumption were very effective we also learnt that businesses public offices and schools were very successful in imposing the necessary social protocols like social distancing wearing face masks and sanitizing in other words people were actually safer at work than staying home tourism manufacturing construction and our call centers all required unique protocols to stay open while keeping the population safe and preserving livelihoods we also understood the precarious economic situation we were in as a result of closing the economy for three weeks in april and reopening slowly until september government s revenue dropped from 110 million a month to 60 million and our costs increased from 100 million a month to 120 million a month the increase in cost was primarily due to the cost of the isolation facilities the operationalizing of okeu converting victoria hospital into a dedicated respiratory facility national security and importantly the redemption of government bonds catastrophic fallout a catastrophic fallout from covid 19 was the financial impact on many businesses and personal incomes which resulted in many companies institutions and individuals redeeming their bonds in 2020 the government had 700 million due and approximately 25 were redeemed the government had to pay close to 170 million in cash this left the government with a deficit of approximately 500 million entering the budget of 2020 21 this revenue shortfall was partially made up through the support of the cdb wb imf and eccb recognizing the fallout of covid all of these institutions moved unprecedentedly quickly to approve funds to help with budgetary support i was very proud of the team in finance and economic development for the incredible job that they did in the most difficult of times tasked with the efforts to extract ourselves from the eu blacklist juggling the sudden and drastic drop in revenue and increase in costs the introduction of a new finance act the arduous task of applying to multiple agencies for funds all while designing a social and economic stabilization and recovery plan this team was able to accomplish all of these tasks the government of saint lucia continued to meet all of its financial obligations specifically all wages and salaries all debt commitments including the bond redemptions government operating costs and the increased costs due to covid protocols the financial institutions provided approximately ec 300 million in very concessionary loans to the gosl the imf funds and wb funds could not be used for debt payments so they had to be allocated to other operating costs including costs associated with covid the remaining shortfall came from increasing the overdraft facility with eccb and the local regional banks and increasing our payables payables normally average 30 million and as you know they are now in excess of 100 million it means individuals and business who have provided goods and services to the government have not been paid or it has taken an excessive amount of time to be paid while we have had no choice this can only continue for a while before these entities will want to be paid in advance for any services while we were able to provide some income and food support it clearly was not enough a fact you will now have a greater appreciation for current crisis the current crisis is at a point where we will have to reintroduce some of these programs the question is where are the resources going to come from this reality will be made worse if the entire economy must be shut down again sir this problem will not resolve itself nor will it disappear any time soon this letter is not meant to dictate to you but to advise you that your government must act urgently and decisively before the health and economic systems totally collapse you cannot wait for the situation to get so overwhelming that we have no choices our covid 19 statistics continue to increase at an alarming rate more concerning is the high rate of deaths in part because people cannot access timely help unfortunately when you came into office many of the front liners were already exhausted and the current situation is only making it worse by now you must realize that you will have to adopt some of the same policies that have proven successful in the past we need to urgently slow down and temper the covid 19 infection rate to achieve this we must reduce public socializing to do so will require longer curfew hours and prohibiting alcohol sales and consumption it may also require the use of 758 759 zoning for a period of time to help the police enforce these protocols you have on many occasions commented on the poor and limited housing conditions and that is why using some of the hotels to facilitate isolation of positive cases would be useful but i do appreciate the extraordinary cost offering assistance if your government does not act now as i have alluded the country will very soon reach a point where it will shut itself down jeopardizing many more livelihoods to save lives finally we need to step up the campaign on vaccination we note the number of saint lucians getting vaccinated is far below the target and propose a broad community outreach programme where we bring the vaccine to the people and engage in a rigorous education campaign the opposition stands in solidarity with the people of saint lucia and we are willing to offer our assistance for the sake of our people and country you need to change course i fear that if you do not heed this advice it will be catastrophic coincidence while the ex prime minister s letter is dated september 22 it was released on saturday september 25 coincidentally the same day prime minister pierre was carded to deliver his maiden address to the united nations general assembly as saint lucia s new leader it pokes poor fun at prime minister pierre s insistence on the need to follow the science in covid matters but the facts and figures only now being revealed tell new stories in opposition not heard that way before the uniter workers party uwp was voted out of office the letter explains the last uwp government s covid strategy in ways the then prime minister didn t during his 16 months leading the national fight against covid 19 comparing the results of its 16 months without the delta variant yet detected with the new administration s six weeks facing its deadly effects triumphalism the letter also reveals a sense of partisan triumphalism over the worsening covid situation the type choiseul saltibus member of parliament bradely felix warned about when he told a uwp press conference last week that persons thinking that way need to have their heads examined coming at the end of a week during which so much was revealed and alleged about a controversial deal under his watch to purchase 100 000 covid 19 vaccines for saint lucia that were never delivered and with over 7 million still outstanding there was no offer of any explanation in the lengthy statement not word the letter also followed prime minister pierre s startling revelations in parliament about untold millions spent on the st jude hospital project but there was no reference to the purported vaccines scam the statement seems to suggest that the delta variant would not have been a factor had the uwp not lost the last general elections blaming everything that s gone wrong on something the new government either did or failed to do it explains why juggling finance and created economic problems was difficult during the pandemic but without accepting that the uwp administration led by chastanet bequeathed to its successors the accumulated effects of all those same financial blues the statement also totally ignores the fact that the new administration has embraced and entrusted the same health officials that served the previous one throughout its 16 months directing the war against covid from the command center flashing mirrors yet after completely dissing prime minister pierre and his administration in and out and top to bottom the letter offers the uwp s full support to cure a national sore that festered on its shift and under its watch anyone with the time can go through the statement and extract as many questions requiring answers as those it ignored but too anyone who s been around long enough will also know that this is just par for the proverbial partisan political course by any party humiliatingly rejected by the electorate and trying hard to look and sound attractive on its first post election outing on the same day the new prime minister would be delivering his maiden address at the united nations general assembly or what prime minister pierre would typically call flashing mirrors
in an historic move the washington state legislature passed two major pieces of climate change legislation in the closing days of its recent session over the weekend of april 24 25 2021 once signed by governor inslee the climate commitment act creates a market based economy wide cap and trade program the other legislation hb 1091 creates a program to reduce the carbon in transportation fuels 1 these bills follow on the heels of the 2019 clean energy transformation act ceta which requires that the electric generating sector be completely decarbonized by 2045 together these three laws place washington firmly in the top tier of states addressing climate change they also strengthen the policy alignment along the west coast by opening the door to linkage with california s cap and trade program and adopting a clean fuels program similar to that of british columbia oregon and california big picture as shown below washington state currently emits roughly 100 million metric tons of anthropogenic greenhouse gases ghgs annually consistent with the paris agreement and what the science says is necessary to avoid a global temperature increase greater than 1 5 degrees c washington s legislature in 2020 committed to achieving net zero ghg emissions by 2050 to achieve this the legislature established interim ghg emission limitations of 50 million tons by 2030 27 million tons by 2040 and five million tons by 2050 with the remaining five million tons of emissions to be offset by an equal amount of ghg capture and sequestration 2 in combination with ceta the two new bills are designed to meet these ambitious goals cap and trade under the cap and trade legislation the washington department of ecology ecology is first required to impose a cap on ghgs emissions from covered entities those that annually emit more than 25 000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent ecology is then required to adopt a budget of allowances to be made available to covered entities for a series of compliance periods with the first running from january 1 2023 through the end of 2026 allowances authorize the holder to emit up to one metric ton of ghgs per allowance and are tradeable the allowance budgets will decline over time so as to achieve the emission limits established for 2030 2040 and 2050 auctions allowances are then distributed through auctions with ecology establishing a price ceiling to protect covered entities from excessive compliance costs auctions are open to both covered entities and other entities without a compliance obligation the latter are referred to as general market participants and must register with ecology presumably to avoid market manipulation general market participants in the aggregate may not own more than 10 percent of the allowances issued in a calendar year eite industries and utilities special treatment is given to emission intensive trade exposed eite facilities that might otherwise relocate to jurisdictions that do not regulate ghg emissions they will receive free allowances in the early years but the quantity of those allowances will decline over time utilities subject to ceta are also provided free allowances to mitigate the cost burden of that program on electricity customers allocation of auction revenue beginning in 2023 the allowance auctions are projected to generate 460 million annually climbing to about 590 million by 2040 the legislature will determine the use of these funds through future appropriations the money will be available for an extremely wide range of purposes and activities including reducing the impacts of ghgs and co pollutants on overburdened communities programs to support fossil fuel workers affected by the transition to a clean energy economy and programs to increase forest and community resilience to wildfires auction proceeds can also be spent on programs to deploy more solar and wind power and to promote distributed generation energy storage demand side technologies and other grid modernization projects as well as on emission reduction efforts in the industrial sector the agricultural sector and the built environment because the bill requires that auction proceeds be invested in such climate related projects and programs supporters of the bill chose to brand it as cap and invest notwithstanding that allowances can be traded the appropriate allocation of this immense stream of funding will undoubtedly be the subject of lively public and legislative debate in the coming years environmental justice unlike the california cap and trade program washington s legislation includes a strong environmental justice component ecology must conduct an environmental justice review every two years to ensure achievement of reductions in criteria pollutants as well as ghg emissions in overburdened communities highly impacted by air pollution when allocating funding agencies are further directed to invest not less than 35 percent and with a goal of 40 percent to provide direct and meaningful benefits to vulnerable populations within overburdened communities vulnerable populations and overburdened communities are defined at some length in the legislation but the scope of those terms is nevertheless likely to be the subject of considerable discussion linkage ecology is also authorized to create linkage with other jurisdictions with ghg emission trading programs california is currently the only other state with a cap and trade program which began operating in 2013 and is linked to quebec s program the european union has operated a cap and trade program since 2005 linkage is intended to provide covered entities with a more cost effective way to meet their compliance obligations it could include joint auctions and the ability to transfer allowances between programs the obvious first move would be linkage between washington and california but the negotiation of a linkage agreement is likely to take time among other things the washington legislation includes a long list of criteria including a requirement that the agreement ensure that the linking jurisdiction has provisions to ensure the distribution of benefits from the program to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities the legislation also requires that any agreement be subject to a public comment process and review by relevant stakeholders and other interested parties penalties at the end of each compliance period a covered entity is required to submit to ecology an allowance for each ton of ghgs it emitted during the period a covered entity that fails to do so will be required to submit four allowances for each missing one within six months if a covered entity fails to submit the penalty allowances ecology must issue a civil penalty of up to 10 000 for each penalty allowance that is not submitted per day ecology will also issue a penalty of up to 10 000 per day per violation for failure to comply with program rules and may issue a penalty up to 50 000 per day per violation in cases of market manipulation clean fuels due to washington state s abundance of hydropower its transportation sector accounts for an unusually high percentage of its ghg emissions 45 percent as compared to 29 percent for the nation as a whole with the low carbon fuel standard lcfs programs in california and oregon as models washington s legislation aims to reduce those emissions by reducing the carbon intensity of fuel used in washington the goal is to reduce the ghg emissions attributable to transportation fuels by 20 percent below 2017 levels by 2038 with interim goals along the way to get there the legislation focuses on the producers and importers of transportation fuels with high carbon intensity e g gasoline and diesel regulated parties will incur deficits for producing importing or dispensing transportation fuels that have a carbon intensity above a standard that ecology will set by regulation to offset such deficits producers importers and others can acquire credits through the production importation or dispensing of transportation fuels with carbon intensity lower than ecology s standard those credits can then be sold to parties with deficits in addition credits can be created through carbon capture projects biofuel projects non utility electric vehicle charging and infrastructure programs the legislation also calls for the generation of credits through other transportation infrastructure initiatives that may be enacted by the legislature in the future next steps and beyond the enactment of this legislation is just the beginning of a very long process the development of the implementing regulations will be contentious and will almost certainly give rise to litigation these processes will bring to light unanticipated questions and unintended consequences for starters the programs required by these three complex pieces of legislation must be crafted so that they work together effectively as a whole integrating the legislation s first of its kind environmental justice programs and requirements will be particularly challenging if successfully implemented this legislation could well make washington a magnet for innovation and the deployment of next generation technologies this in turn could revive the political stock of cap and trade as a regulatory tool both at the state and federal level could oregon be next creating a west coast coalition of states operating under complementary cap and trade and clean fuels programs cap and trade efforts have failed in dramatic fashion in recent oregon legislative sessions but a scaled back cap and reduce administrative effort is currently under development dwt s energy and climate change team will be tracking these develops as they unfold and stands ready to assist stakeholders interested in embracing the challenges and pursuing the opportunities presented by the transition to a net zero ghg economy footnotes 1 although neither bill becomes fully effective until subsequent transportation legislation is enacted the likelihood that such legislation will be enacted appears to be very high 2 rcw 70a 45 020 originally published 03 may 2021 the

with more than 40 million doses of coronavirus vaccines available u s health authorities said they re confident there will be enough for both qualified older americans seeking booster shots and the young children for whom initial vaccines are expected to be approved in the not too distant future the spike in demand expected following last week s federal recommendation on booster shots would be the first significant jump in months more than 70 million americans remain unvaccinated despite the enticement of lottery prizes free food or gifts and pleas from exhausted health care workers as the average number of deaths per day climbed to more than 1 900 in recent weeks federal and state health authorities said current supply and steady production of more doses can easily accommodate those seeking boosters or initial vaccination avoiding a repeat of the frustratingly slow rollout of covid 19 vaccines across the country early this year i hope that we have the level of interest in the booster that we need more vaccines colorado gov jared polis said tuesday that s simply not where we are today we have plenty of vaccines robust supply in the u s enabled president joe biden this week to promise an additional 500 million of pfizer s covid 19 shots to share with the world doubling the united states global contribution aid groups and health organizations have pushed the u s and other countries to improve vaccine access in countries where even the most vulnerable people haven t had a shot among the challenges states face is not ordering too many doses and letting them go to waste several states with low vaccination rates including idaho and kansas have reported throwing away thousands of expired doses or are struggling to use vaccines nearing expiration this fall while most vaccines can stay on the shelf unopened for months once a vial is opened the clock starts ticking vaccines are only usable for six to 12 hours depending on the manufacturer according to the u s food and drug administration moderna vaccines come in vials containing 11 to 15 doses pfizer vials contain up to six doses and johnson johnson vials five doses we are going to see more doses that go unused over time said wisconsin s health secretary karen timberlake they come in multidose files they don t come in nice tidy individual single serving packages state health officials said they have tried to request only what health care providers and pharmacies expect to need from the federal supply those numbers have dwindled since the vaccines became widely available in early spring but u s officials holding out hope that some of the unvaccinated will change their minds are trying to keep enough vaccines in stock so all americans can get them that balancing act is tricky and can lead to consternation around the globe as the u s sits on unused vaccines while many countries in places such as africa can t get enough vaccines somebody sitting in a country with few resources to access vaccines seeing people in the u s able to walk into a pharmacy and get that vaccine and choosing not to i m sure that s causing heartache said jen kates senior vice president and director of global health and hiv policy for the kaiser family foundation dr marcus plescia chief medical officer of the association of state and territorial health officials which represents the public health agencies of all 50 u s states the district of columbia and u s territories said officials anticipate that on hand doses of covid 19 vaccines and manufacturers ability to supply more will meet needs across the country i think states have tried to plan as if everybody s going to be offered a booster he said suggesting they will be overprepared for the more narrow recommendations issued by the fda and the centers for disease control and prevention california for example estimated earlier this month that it would need to administer an extra 63 million doses by the end of 2022 if initial shots for children under 12 were approved and boosters were open to everyone u s health officials late thursday endorsed booster shots of the pfizer vaccine for all americans 65 and older along with tens of millions of younger people who are at higher risk from the coronavirus because of health conditions or their jobs california with nearly 40 million residents has the lowest transmission rate of any state and nearly 70 of eligible residents are fully vaccinated that leaves nearly 12 million people not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated dr mark ghaly california s health secretary said the state will rely largely on pharmacies and primary care providers to give boosters to seniors while some large counties and health care groups will use mass vaccination sites in pennsylvania more than 67 of residents older than 18 are fully vaccinated alison beam acting secretary of health said health authorities now have two missions continuing to persuade people to get vaccinated and serving those eager to receive a booster or initial shots pennsylvania is going to be prepared beam said and we re going to have the right level of vaccine and vaccinators to be able to meet that demand
kp nayar strategic analyst if there is a single paramount element that came out from the 90 minute meeting between us president joe biden and pm narendra modi it is the extensive damage which biden s predecessor donald trump did to indo us relations it is clear from the joint statement issued after modi s first in person meeting with biden as president and from what the indian delegation in washington said in public and more importantly in private after the summit that for four years indians hummed and hawed doing their best to keep trump in good humour as if he was a petulant child they did not do anything substantive with the us during the four trump years other than walk on pins in and around the white house all the time trying to prevent intemperate outbursts by the 45th president lest it spoiled the atmospherics surrounding the bilateral ties the effort was a remarkable success few other countries managed to do that as repeated discomfiture of several us allied leaders who wilted in front of trump s diplomatic indiscretions demonstrated now it is the turn of modi aides external affairs minister s jaishankar foreign secretary harsh vardhan shringla and the ambassador in washington taranjit singh sandhu to pick up the ties from where they were left off by president obama and make up for lost time even before he arrived in washington modi eschewed sweet talk with america and americans which has been a feature of bilateral relations with washington since the time of nehru in modi s departure statement in new delhi for example there was none of the usual paeans for the oldest democracy in the world or for shared values or about english language making it easier for the two countries to do business these were all good sentiments when indo us relations were changing from the latent hostility of the cold war era to becoming natural allies a phrase coined by vajpayee when he was pm modi decided that it was time to end such vacuous barrenness in public and most definitely in private the pm at least on his current trip to the us has instead opted for the transactional over the sentimental the 5ts a description modi coined will guide relations in future he conveyed this to biden at their one on one meeting these 5ts are technology trade talent trusteeship and tradition the primacy of the 5ts was evident in the choice of the five ceos of american companies whom the pm met on his first day in washington they were not picked up at random or with a view on optics the idea that modi will have one on one interactions in such a new format with select ceos whenever he next visited the us goes back a year ago in october 2020 even as the us was in the throes of the pandemic and looking for a way forward the indian ambassador in washington began a series of meetings with leading ceos in his jurisdiction he divided his attention equally between american ceos of indian origin and other corporate honchos for a balance in assessing the mood among captains of us business towards post covid 19 india among the heads of conglomerates that he met in october alone were milind pant ceo of amway jamie dimon ceo of jp morgan arvind krishna ceo of ibm and alex holmes chairman and ceo moneygram last october was ideal from the point of view of a foreign diplomat for such an initiative because the us presidential election campaign was in full swing as such sandhu was free of the intense political footwork that he is called upon to do on capitol hill or the white house in normal times after the elections the ambassador was able to continue this process because politicians were caught up until january in disputes over biden s victory as large sections of the republican party rallied round trump four of modi s 5ts are reflected in the choice of the ceos he met in washington the only exclusion that these five ceos personify is tradition but then american business traditions and those of india are still incompatible and both sides still have a long way to go in harmonising them if at all from ringing the opening bell at the new york stock exchange to hosting fancy lunches for a dozen or so american ceos to addressing business organisations such as the us india business council successive indian pms and finance ministers have tried many ways over at least two decades to attract us investment into india foreign direct investment and other forms of investment have come to india but it is questionable if gimmicks such as ringing the opening bell have played any role in such inflows so the modi aides now in charge of india s outreach to the us decided that it was time to change the old approach instead it was decided that the pm will hold separate meetings with the five ceos he interacted with it was also decided that a change of location was advisable instead of the global business hub of new york the venue for the ceo interaction was moved to washington because it signified power and governance over money this triumvirate understands such delicate nuances in the american social fabric all three men have been ambassadors in washington it is clear at the end of modi s visit that both sides attach top priority to reviving mechanisms for bringing back on track the intense and meaningful engagement with india which characterised the bill clinton george w bush barack obama tenures in the white house among the mechanisms to be woken up from the deep coma of the trump years are a trade policy dialogue and joint mechanisms on counter terrorism a significant addition to these will be joint structures for pandemic preparedness

menafn gulf times fifty years ago a us president closed the gold window ended capital controls and launched a new era of globalised finance the nixon shock reshaped the international monetary system overnight and then gradually changed the status of central bankers instead of acting as servants of the domestic economy monetary policymakers have become masters of the globalised and financialised world economy and this development bears directly on our ability to tackle the problems of climate change and biodiversity loss despite their technocratic mystique central bankers are politically appointed public servants on government payrolls and still derive their authority from the taxpayers in their respective jurisdictions as former bank of england deputy governor paul tucker observes the right to create money is always latently a power of taxation central bankers status and constitutional role is therefore primarily a democratic question not an economic or technical one as the managers of public institutions that hold a monopoly over the issuance of currencies and liquidity they wield awesome powerful instruments that can be deployed only because they are backed by government treasuries treasuries in turn are backed by a country s fiscal resources including tax revenues and by public institutions that are vital to the private financial sector such as the contract enforcing judicial system the stronger a sovereign s public institutions and tax base the more expansive the central bank s powers to generate liquidity and the more highly rated the country s bonds and currency will be despite the long reigning ideology of free markets capitalism has always depended on public institutions and resources for its capital gains and profits just as central banks have always presided over a hybrid private public financial system what is new is the extent to which central bank resources balance sheets have been expanded and deployed in the private interests of vast unregulated and systemically risky capital markets across the shadow banking system outlining the history of these developments the political economist benjamin braun notes that the stagflation crisis of the 1970s and paul volcker s labour crushing crackdown on inflation in the us in the early 1980s led to the transfer of responsibility for monetary policy away from those directly accountable to elected representatives ever since then braun argues financialised capital has depended on independent central banks and arbitration courts to protect it against local democracy meanwhile the bank for international settlements has tallied up the value of the extraordinary fiscal monetary and macroprudential measures that central banks have deployed since 2007 to shore up private financial markets and mitigate their adverse economic impacts notably bis economists find that central bank programs to purchase private assets accounted for half of total purchases over this period and as other researchers have shown a significant share of these financial flows have gone to support fossil fuels and other carbon intensive sectors the overall sums involved here are massive earlier this year the eurosystem s balance sheet exceeded 7tn 8 3tn which is more than 60 of the eurozone s gdp the bank of japan s balance sheet now stands at 130 of gdp the fed s grew from 4 3tn in mid march 2020 to a peak of 8 2tn in late july 2021 that is equivalent to about 40 of nominal us gdp a level not seen since world war ii moreover since 2007 central bankers have used their public authority to participate in influence and shape the vast 52tn shadow banking system where they have become private dealers of last resort and market makers of first resort the expansion of shadow banking follows from the 1981 2014 period when 30 governments around the world decided to privatise their pension funds as a result a vast pool of the world s savings flowed into asset management funds in globalised largely unregulated capital markets because the sums were too large to be accommodated by commercial main street banks the shadow banking system emerged these earlier political decisions to financialise the global economy are still with us and will pose hurdles to our efforts to tackle broader societal challenges like climate change given the precarious state of the biosphere it is imperative that central banks activities be reoriented toward what braun calls public purpose and away from the task of sustaining private gains in capital markets humanity is now facing terrifying climate and ecological threats while there is still a chance to slash greenhouse gas emissions at the pace needed to keep global warming below 1 5c biodiversity loss is already well underway in fact we are moving faster toward the point of civilizational collapse than scientists previously thought in research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in june 2020 gerardo ceballos paul r ehrlich and peter h raven argued that the ongoing sixth mass extinction may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization because it is irreversible emphasis added many including key figures in us president joe biden s administration believe that ensuring the survival of human civilization is a task that can be left to private capital markets in his first press conference as the us climate envoy john kerry paid homage to blackrock s climate conscious ceo larry fink and in effect begged wall street to come to the rescue of the administration s climate plan the us national climate adviser gina mccarthy then drove home the point the question won t be whether the private sector is going to buy into it the private sector is going to drive it in the great depression the face most americans associated with the response was the democratically elected president franklin d roosevelt are we now supposed to look to an unelected unaccountable fund manager or perhaps to fed chair jerome powell to rescue human civilization from collapse the present structure of globalised finance lends itself to precisely this undemocratic outcome but we must resist it lest we end up with a return of fascism on top of the climate crisis if we are going to avert both a political and a climate breakdown we will need to transform the international monetary system so that it upholds democracy and the policy autonomy of nation states that means reintroducing capital controls re regulating global banking re nationalising pensions and restoring political and economic power to elected assemblies not simply to their executives and to central bankers to be sure the separation of powers between central banks and politicians will have to be maintained to avoid corruption but central bankers will need to be required through legislation to reorient their vast array of planning tools to the needs of democracy and the domestic economy

a report by bret stephens for the new york times ritchie torres a congressman from america s poorest district new york s 15th in the bronx quietly bristles at the a o c comparison there s a sense in which the media narrative diminishes me he tells me over plates of pasta at a restaurant in the bronx s little italy when i raise the subject of his notorious fellow democrat from an adjoining district alexandria ocasio cortez i resist the temptation to fit into a preconceived narrative my career in politics long predates the squad no need to explain who and what is meant by the squad the house members seen by some as the bright dawning of a new democratic party and by others as the four horsewomen of the wokepocalypse not long after our lunch a o c once again became topic a of national conversation for posturing politically while posing pictorially at the met gala the bigger mystery is why torres who was emphatically not at the gala hasn t yet become a household name in the united states on the identity and background scorecard he checks every progressive box afro latino the son of a single mom who raised three children working as a mechanic s assistant on a minimum wage salary of 4 25 an hour a product of public housing and public schools a half brother of two former prison inmates an n y u dropout the bronx s first openly gay elected official when he won a seat on the city council in 2013 at the age of 25 and the victor over a gay bashing christian minister when he won his house seat last year he s dazzlingly smart he sees himself on a mission to radically reduce racially concentrated poverty in the bronx and elsewhere in america in other words torres is everything a modern day progressive is supposed to look and be like except in one respect unlike so much of the modern left including a o c who grew up as an architect s daughter in the middle class westchester town of yorktown heights he really is a child of the working class he understands what working class people want as opposed to what so many of its self appointed champions claim they want i don t hire ideologues or zealots he tells me on a walk through his district most of the people in the south bronx are practical rather than ideological their concerns are bread and butter health and housing schools and jobs what this translates to is a 21st century civil rights agenda based on pressing working class needs for affordable housing better schools safer streets good health care the goals are progressive but the solutions for torres have to be pragmatic that emphatically includes giving children the option to attend carefully regulated not for profit charter schools which his district has in abundance over fierce opposition from teachers unions if there are parents in my district who have concluded that the best option for their children is a charter school then who am i to tell them otherwise he asks he is also consumed by the crisis of affordable housing probably the single biggest challenge facing lower income new yorkers one of mayor bill de blasio s early drafts for solving the crisis torres recalls involved building 75 000 units over 10 years yet the demand was closer to six times that number even if we created 75 000 tomorrow instead of 10 years we d fall catastrophically short between bridging the gap between supply and demand his answer is a classic triangulation between big government interventionism and small government common sense he wants to greatly increase the section 8 federal voucher program turning it into a new federal entitlement housing vouchers for all he calls it that would ensure that no american family would need to pay more than 30 percent of its income in rent doing so would instantaneously make millions of units affordable for the lowest income households but he also understands the need to streamline the public review process to increase the supply of housing stock one of the great ironies of our time is that some of the most progressive cities are among the most systemically racist in their housing policies he says mentioning san francisco s policies of single family zoning and other land use practices that are the way in which liberals discriminate today torres is also particularly alarmed by the phenomenon that the russian american evolutionary anthropologist peter turchin calls elite overproduction we produce far more college graduates than there are elite positions for those graduates to occupy torres observes when those graduates find themselves deep in debt shut out of the kinds of jobs they were promised and crushed by the cost of housing it is bound to have a radicalizing effect it s a strong argument for more vocational schools it s also an f d r esque call to save capitalism from itself lest the people torres calls the new jacobins gain further grip speaking of f d r there will be a new york governor s race next year torres would be a formidable primary opponent to the new governor kathy hochul as perhaps the most singular political talent of his generation he is one progressive who could at last do more to unite the nation than to further divide it

menafn gulf times fifty years ago a us president closed the gold window ended capital controls and launched a new era of globalised finance the nixon shock reshaped the international monetary system overnight and then gradually changed the status of central bankers instead of acting as servants of the domestic economy monetary policymakers have become masters of the globalised and financialised world economy and this development bears directly on our ability to tackle the problems of climate change and biodiversity loss despite their technocratic mystique central bankers are politically appointed public servants on government payrolls and still derive their authority from the taxpayers in their respective jurisdictions as former bank of england deputy governor paul tucker observes the right to create money is always latently a power of taxation central bankers status and constitutional role is therefore primarily a democratic question not an economic or technical one as the managers of public institutions that hold a monopoly over the issuance of currencies and liquidity they wield awesome powerful instruments that can be deployed only because they are backed by government treasuries treasuries in turn are backed by a country s fiscal resources including tax revenues and by public institutions that are vital to the private financial sector such as the contract enforcing judicial system the stronger a sovereign s public institutions and tax base the more expansive the central bank s powers to generate liquidity and the more highly rated the country s bonds and currency will be despite the long reigning ideology of free markets capitalism has always depended on public institutions and resources for its capital gains and profits just as central banks have always presided over a hybrid private public financial system what is new is the extent to which central bank resources balance sheets have been expanded and deployed in the private interests of vast unregulated and systemically risky capital markets across the shadow banking system outlining the history of these developments the political economist benjamin braun notes that the stagflation crisis of the 1970s and paul volcker s labour crushing crackdown on inflation in the us in the early 1980s led to the transfer of responsibility for monetary policy away from those directly accountable to elected representatives ever since then braun argues financialised capital has depended on independent central banks and arbitration courts to protect it against local democracy meanwhile the bank for international settlements has tallied up the value of the extraordinary fiscal monetary and macroprudential measures that central banks have deployed since 2007 to shore up private financial markets and mitigate their adverse economic impacts notably bis economists find that central bank programs to purchase private assets accounted for half of total purchases over this period and as other researchers have shown a significant share of these financial flows have gone to support fossil fuels and other carbon intensive sectors the overall sums involved here

copies in its first year and would go on to become the best selling novel of the nineteenth century as crowe later wrote in with thackeray in america 1893 stowe s dramatic depictions of auction blocks families separated by slavery runaway slaves and vicious overseers properly harrowed him and inspired him to learn what he could of american slavery on march 3 1853 his first morning in richmond crowe noticed in one of the local newspapers the announcements of slave sales some of which were to take place that morning in wall street close at hand at eleven o clock he wandered down the hill from his hotel to the slave auction rooms and there made a number of sketches that served as inspiration for a series of his later engravings and paintings domestic slave trade slave auction house the slave trade in alexandria woman in front of slave pen crowe s drawings and paintings are significant to the degree that they shed additional light on a dark corner of american slavery the domestic or internal slave trade the international slave trade which included the often deadly voyage from african to america known as the middle passage legally ended in the united states in 1808 giving rise to a new domestic market historians estimate that from 1820 to 1860 two million enslaved african americans were sold from one owner in the united states to another of those two million about 666 000 were sold from states in the upper south especially maryland virginia and north carolina to states in the lower south especially alabama mississippi and louisiana where the sharp increase in cotton production fueled a parallel demand for slave labor those sold through the interregional slave trade were typically purchased by traders in the upper south where they were held in slave pens or jails before being marched or transported south by railroads upon arrival they were sold again often on the auction block at places many called the slave market this forced migration of hundreds of thousands of enslaved peoples was usually attended by family asserted that family separations were rare and only occurred in unusual circumstances but historians have determined that more than half the slaves sold by traders were forcibly separated either from a spouse or from one or both of their parents slaves were sold for a variety of reasons as punishment to pay debts or secure mortgages or to settle an estate after the death of an owner families were usually not sold intact because family units did not command the highest prices instead individual slaves age fifteen to thirty were the most profitable young mothers were sold away from their husbands and children young fathers from their wives and children and children from their parents slave market of america many cities in the upper south developed a sizable infrastructure dedicated to the slave trade baltimore washington d c alexandria and richmond among them these cities became primarily slave collecting and resale centers with a large network of traders who provided slaves to satisfy the demand in urban markets once purchased by a trader slaves were usually transported to the urban center by boat or railroad or marched overland and then placed in slave jail one of the largest and most financially successful slave trading firms was the partnership of isaac franklin and john armfield active from 1828 to 1836 who had an organized network of traders stationed in cities throughout the region including richmond and warrenton in virginia and fredericktown and baltimore in maryland slaves purchased by the traders were sent to franklin and armfield s headquarters in alexandria richmond the largest slave trading center in the upper south throughout most of the 1840s and 1850s had multiple slave jails and auction rooms most of which were within a few blocks of each other and only a few blocks from the thomas jefferson designed state capitol building these facilities were concentrated on a small alleyway known locally as wall street or roughly along what is now fifteenth street in shockoe valley after being held in jails sometimes for weeks at a time slaves were eventually sold often to another trader sales either occurred at the jails or in salesrooms these rooms were generally small and low ceilinged with little furniture or decoration they consisted primarily of large undivided interiors that sometimes held as many as a hundred people each room also had a piece of furniture specifically built for the trade conducted there the auction block generally these were platforms that raised the auctioneer and the slaves for sale above the standing audience to allow all a clear view of the stock as dealers commonly referred to the people they auctioned in addition to the dedicated salesrooms slaves were also sold at auction in the basements of several of richmond s leading hotels including the exchange hotel and the st charles hotel images slave auction at richmond virginia slaves waiting for sale virginia on march 3 1853 when crowe visited wall street in richmond he reported four salesrooms there the wall street traders at the time were pulliam and davis benjamin and solomon davis r h dickinson and brothers and c b and n b hill in the rooms he visited that day crowe gathered material that would later form the basis for a series of images that were published in the illustrated london news on september 27 1856 and two paintings that were exhibited in london in 1854 and 1861 together these images tell the story of the american slave trade by representing different moments in the process crowe s sketching that day in richmond attracted considerable attention those around him began to take notice of the image he was creating and paid little attention to the auctioneer three times the auctioneer stopped and came over to question crowe about what he was doing the artist decided that because of the auctioneer s ill disguised rage he ought to leave quickly he later reported that the entire audience determined him to be an abolitionist and he worried for his own safety concerned that it would cause trouble for thackeray who was well liked by richmonders crowe was relieved to learn that friends helped to keep the incident quiet auction prices for slaves the image slaves waiting for sale is known in three versions the sketch made the day crowe was in the salesroom the wood engraving of the sketch that was published in 1856 and a painting of the same scene that was exhibited at the royal academy in london in 1861 the image was particularly striking because it depicted a subject not commonly shown in abolitionist art many artists had drawn or painted a slave auction it was a popular subject in abolitionist materials and features in several scenes in stowe s uncle tom s cabin crowe chose instead to show the moment before the auction his focus on that quiet moment of uncertainty and dread invites viewers to pause and to think about the subject anew in his image of nine slaves seated on benches awaiting the moment of sale on the auction block he depicted families that had already been torn apart by the trade when the painting was exhibited in london in 1861 critics were struck by what they saw as the picture s apparent accuracy one reviewer for london s art journal declared it one of the most important pictures of the exhibition all were particularly taken with the figure of the male slave on the right at the time viewers were accustomed to seeing images of slaves who accepted their position with a happy complacency as famously depicted by stowe in her characterization of uncle tom crowe chose instead to paint a very different figure a man described by the same art journal reviewer as expressing suffused indignant scorn mingled with defiance in the figure of this man crowe had depicted a slave who could resist rebel or run away at any moment it was his most powerful statement about slavery and the slave trade the second image derived from crowe s day in the salesroom in richmond was also published in the illustrated london news alongside slaves waiting for sale the engraving slave auction at richmond virginia 1856 showed an event more commonly dramatized in abolitionist imagery a slave auction in crowe s image the viewer s attention is centered on the young woman on the block to the left is a group of slave traders crowe described one of them as having an unmistakable look of devilry and drew him with a cowhide whip trailing between his legs almost in imitation of an animal s tail after the sale slaves going south from richmond the third image in crowe s cycle on the american slave trade was a painting exhibited at the society of british artists in 1854 after the sale slaves going south from richmond exhibited in london as going south a sketch from life in america in this image crowe depicted what happened to slaves after they were purchased in the city s salesroom centered at a railroad terminal in richmond with the city s skyline visible in the background going south shows a scene of extraordinary confusion as slaves are marched to the railroad cars for their journey south some may have faced only short journeys to nearby locations but most were beginning a migration that would conclude in another auction room hundreds of miles away in south carolina alabama mississippi or louisiana

not really care about political categorizations but are more concerned with the economic policies embedded in the agenda of whoever holds the reigns of the sovereign policies that stimulate economic growth typically act as a magnet for investors looking to park capital where it will garner the highest yield these include the implementation of fiscal stimulus plans fortifying property rights allowing for goods and capital to flow freely and dissolving growth sapping regulations if these policies create adequate inflationary pressure the central bank may raise interest rates in response that boosts the underlying return on local assets reeling in investors and lifting the currency conversely a government whose underlying ideological predilections go against the gradient of globalization may cause capital flight regimes that seek to rip out the threads that have sown economic and political integration usually create a moat of uncertainty that investors do not want to traverse themes of ultra nationalism protectionism and populism have been frequently shown to have market disrupting effects if a state undergoes an ideological realignment traders will assess the situation to see if it radically alters their risk reward set up if so they may then reallocate their capital and re formulate their trading strategies to tilt the balance of risk to reward in their

an over 100 percent spike in italian 10 year bond yields that showed investors demanding a higher return for tolerating what they perceived to be a higher level of risk this was also reflected in the

to the inherently stubborn nature of nationalist regimes us president donald trump and modi employed a similar brand of strong rhetoric both on the campaign trail and within their respective administrations in a rather ironic way their ideological similarity may in fact be a force that causes a rift in diplomatic relations tensions between the two have escalated in 2019 with markets

stress for economies with a high degree of capital mobility there are essentially four different sets of policy mix alternatives that can provoke a reaction in fx markets following an economic or geopolitical shock scenario 1 fiscal policy is already expansionary monetary policy becomes more restrictive tightening bullish for the local currency fiscal policy is already expansionary monetary policy becomes more restrictive tightening bullish for the local currency scenario 2 fiscal policy is already restrictive monetary policy becomes more expansionary loosening bearish for the local currency fiscal policy is already restrictive monetary policy becomes more expansionary loosening bearish for the local currency scenario 3 monetary policy already expansionary loosening fiscal policy becomes more restrictive bearish for the local currency monetary policy already expansionary loosening fiscal policy becomes more restrictive bearish for the local currency scenario 4 monetary policy is already restrictive tightening fiscal policy becomes more expansionary bullish for the local currency it is important to note that for an economy like the united states and a currency like the us dollar whenever fiscal policy and monetary policy start trending in the same direction there is often an ambiguous impact on the currency below we will examine how various fiscal and monetary policy remedies for geopolitical and economic shocks impact currency markets scenario 1 fiscal policy loose monetary policy becomes tighter on may 2 2019 following the fomc decision to hold rates in the 2 25 2 50 percent range fed chair jerome powell said that relatively soft inflationary pressure noted at the time was transitory the implication here was that while price growth was below what central bank officials were hoping for it would soon accelerate the us china trade war played a role in slowing economic activity and muting inflation the implicit message was then a reduced probability of a rate cut in the near term given that the fundamental outlook was judged to be solid and the overall trajectory of us economic activity seen to be on a healthy path the neutral tone struck by the fed was comparatively less dovish than what markets had anticipated this might then explain why the priced in probability of a fed rate cut by the end of the year as seen in overnight index swaps fell from 67 2 percent to 50 9 percent after powell s comments meanwhile the congressional budget office cbo forecasted an increase in the fiscal deficit over a three year time horizon overlapping the central bank s would be tightening cycle what s more this came against the backdrop of speculation about a bipartisan fiscal stimulus plan in late april key policymakers announced plans for a us 2 trillion infrastructure building program recommended by dimitri zabelin improve your trading with ig client sentiment data get my guide the combination of expansionary fiscal policy and monetary tightening made the case for a bullish us dollaroutlook the fiscal package was expected to create jobs and boost inflation thereby nudging the fed to raise rates as it happened the greenback added 6 2 percent against an average of its major currency counterparts over the subsequent four months scenario 1 dxy 10 year bond yields rise s p500 futures fall source tradingview scenario 2 fiscal policy tight monetary policy becomes looser theglobal financial crisis in 2008 and the great recession that followed rippled out worldwide and destabilized mediterranean economies this stoked worries about a region wide sovereign debt crisis as bond yields in italy spain and greece climbed to alarming levels mandated austerity measures were imposed in some cases which helped create the basis for eurosceptic populism that hence haunted the region investors began to lose confidence in the ability of these governments to service their debt and demanded a higher yield for incurring what appeared to be a rising risk of default the euro was in pain amid the chaos as doubtsemerged about its very existence in the event that the crisis forced the unprecedented departure of a member state from the eurozone in what is considered to be one of the most famous moments in financial history european central bank ecb president mario draghi delivered a speech in london on july 26 2012 which many would come to see as a pivotal moment that saved the single currency he said that the ecb is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro and believe me he added it will be enough this speech calmed european bond markets and helped bring yields back down recommended by dimitri zabelin top trading lessons get my guide the ecb alsocreated a bond buying program called omt for outright monetary transactions it was aimed at reducing stress in sovereign debt markets offering relief to distressed eurozone governments while omt was never used its mere availability helped becalm jittery investors at the same time many of the troubled euro area states adopted austerity measures to stabilize government finances while the euro initially rose as worries about its collapse receded the currency would depreciate substantially against the us dollar over the course of the following three years by march 2015 it had lost over 13 percent of its value when examining the monetary and fiscal set up it becomes quite clear why scenario 2 euro sighs relief sovereign bond yields fall as insolvency fears are quelled source tradingview austerity measures in many eurozone countries limited their governments ability to provide fiscal stimulus that might have helped create jobs and boost inflation at the same time the central bank was easing policy as a way to alleviate the crisis consequently this combination pressured the euro lower against most of its major counterparts scenario 2 euro sovereign bond yields fall source tradingview scenario 3 monetary policy loose fiscal policy becomes tighter at the early stages of the great recession the bank of canada boc cut its benchmark interest rate from 1 50 to 0 25 percent as a way to ease credit conditions restore confidence and revive economic growth counterintuitively the yield on 10 year canadian government bonds began to rise this rally came right around the same time as canada s benchmark tsx stock index established a bottom scenario 3 usd cad tsx canadian 2 year bond yields source tradingview the subsequent restoration of confidence and recovery in share prices was reflected ininvestors shifting preference for riskier higher returning investments like stocks in lieu of comparatively safer alternatives like bonds this reallocation of capital sent yields higher despite the central bank s monetary easing the boc then began to raise its policy interest rate anew and brought it up to 1percent where it remained for the subsequent five years during this time prime minister stephen harper implemented austerity measures to stabilize the government s finances amid the global financial crisis the central bank then reversed course and cut rates back to 0 50 percent by july 2015 both cad and local bond yields suffered as monetary policy was loosened while the capacity for fiscal policy support was constrained as it happens cutting back government spending at this difficult time ended up costing mr harper his job justin trudeau replaced him as prime minister following a victory in the 2015 general election scenario 3 usd cad canada 2 year bond yields source tradingview scenario 4 monetary policy tight fiscal policy becomes looser after donald trump was proclaimed the victor in the 2016 uspresidential election the political landscape and economic backdrop favored a bullish outlook for the us dollar with the the oval office and both houses of congress thus controlled by the republican party the markets appeared to conclude that scope for political volatility had been reduced this made the market friendly fiscal measures proposed by candidate trump during the electionappear more likely to be implemented these included tax cuts deregulation and infrastructure building investors appeared to overlook threats to launch trade wars against top trading partners such as china and the eurozone at least for the time on the monetary side central bank officials raised rates at the tail end of 2016 and were looking to hike again by at least 75 basis points through 2017 with scope for fiscal expansion and monetary tightening in sight the us dollar rallied alongside local bond yields and equities this came as corporate earnings expectations strengthened alongside the outlook for broader economic performance this stoked bets on firmer inflation and thereby on a hawkish response from the central bank scenario 4 us dollar index dxy s p 500 futures 10 year bond yields chart 7 source tradingview why political risks matter for trading countless studies have shown that a significant decline in living standards from war or a severe recession increase the propensity for voters to take up radical positions on the political spectrum as such people are more likely to deviate from market friendly policies such as capital integration and trade liberalization and instead focus on measures that turn away from globalization and are deleteriously inward facing the modern globalized economy is interconnected both politically and economically and therefore any systemic shock has a high probability of echoing out into the world during times of significant political volatility amid inter

i have written several letters on the theme that the best investment posture is cautious optimism pessimism and bearishness never get you in the game while untamed optimism means that at some point you ll have a serious setback the cautiously optimistic investor asks both what could go wrong and what could go right dave portnoy notwithstanding stock prices don t always go up investors got a little reminder last week when financial media suddenly had some drama to report then it subsided and the market went right back up the latest volatility may or may not turn into something more extended some of the most respected market analysts are turning bearish still others expect the bull market to continue timing is hard yet nothing has happened to make bear markets impossible stocks are overextended by many different measurements so at some point the bears will take control more than a few investors aren t ready for that possibility today i want to show you how richly valued the market is and then review some of the top risks that could force it downward like those sandpiles i talk about we don t know exactly what will trigger a collapse we know something will do it sandpiles don t grow to infinity but then we re going to ask what could go right sandpiles don t grow to infinity but they can grow a lot higher for longer than many expect different scenarios suggest different strategic responses it pays to think about what could happen it will let you plan ahead and maybe make some decisions in advance starting price matters making money in stocks is really quite simple you buy a stock and then sell it at a higher price that means two things need to happen the stock price rises above your purchase price you sell while it is up there this is why your starting buy price matters the higher it is the fewer chances you have to sell at a profit buying a stock whose price is already extreme puts the odds against you that s what people have been doing and to be fair it s worked well for many but the jury is still out on that because most of those folks haven t yet sold the so called buffett indicator is one of the best high level valuation measures this is simply a ratio of stock market capitalization to gdp it makes sense because over long periods stocks should track economic growth here is a graph by my friend michael lebowitz source realinvestmentadvice this ratio recently surpassed its tech bubble peak around 20 years ago this means stocks are more expensive relative to gdp than ever seen in the modern era could they get still more expensive sure some stocks could and almost certainly will buck the trend but this shouldn t reassure anyone who is putting new money into the market or who holds unrealized gains michael has another interesting chart on price earnings ratios he calculated a running sigma which is the number of standard deviations the current month s p e is above below its ten year average source realinvestmentadvice i ll quote his explanation the current reading of roughly three sigmas matches or exceeds seven other peaks in the last 100 years 2009 is the exception however that significant overvaluation is a function of earnings collapsing not excessive prices in all the cases the ratio fell to at least zero the current sigma is at prior peaks so any upside appears limited if the market reverts to a zero sigma we should expect 36 losses again a decline to negative readings will compound the losses for p e to simply return to what was normal over the last ten years will take a 36 loss but past bear markets didn t stop there long periods of overvaluation get balanced by subsequent undervaluation so it s entirely reasonable to think the next bear market whenever it comes will chop prices in half that s not crazy it is what we should expect b list triggers again let me stress that the timing is hard we never know exactly when the sandpile will collapse we just know it will the chart above shows the buffett indicator has been at worrisome levels for several years this could continue but the longer it does the bigger the sandpile gets and the bigger the eventual collapse will be the ultimate trigger may be something none of us have yet considered an unforeseeable bolt from the blue but many plausible triggers are perfectly visible some are more plausible than others i m going to name several starting with the b list and then moving to the one i think most likely and most dangerous too china crisis i used to call japan a bug in search of a windshield lately i wonder if it could be china instead or perhaps china is actually the windshield in any case china s sheer size means its problems affect everyone the latest china problem is debt laden property developer evergrande which has missed some payments and as of today is in default there is never just one cockroach while we don t know the extent i will bet you a dollar to 47 doughnuts china has dozens of other evergrande lite problems it s unclear if the government can help much or even wants to xi jinping is responding to popular unrest with a new common prosperity theme that looks less business friendly some chinese commentators i respect seem to believe that the government will take what money the developers still have and use it to finish projects so consumers aren t hurt i would not want to be a bank or funds holding dollar denominated chinese debt they can form all the debt holder committees they want but if the ccp is on the other side of the table you won t have much leverage there is no rule of law there is the ccp and xi jinping however the dollar denominated debt while seemingly huge is a drop in the bucket the rest will be absorbed internally within china and that is their problem more likely is a slow burn crisis but the world does have one problem china is currently the world s fastest growing major economy and a critical supplier to most others if evergrande depresses construction and business activity while raising the cost of capital growth in china could slip to a very low level the real estate and commodities world has grown accustomed to china growing at a compound 6 8 any lasting drop would affect businesses worldwide and slow global growth down this could certainly combine with other forces to generate crisis conditions us political gridlock as i write this the us government is days away from a government shutdown should the senate not pass a stopgap spending bill by september 30 democratic leaders have combined that bill with a debt ceiling suspension the republicans find unpalatable it s not clear if democrats have the votes on their own side and some gop senators could choose to filibuster so we don t know what will happen but it s another potential fiasco in any case the us treasury will hit its legal debt ceiling in the next few weeks unless congress passes some kind of extension with potentially serious market effects as jim bianco recently explained on twitter the sec ruled in 2013 that any government security that doesn t pay on maturity date is in technical default and must be valued at 0 this means money market funds holding t bills would have to mark down their portfolios if a debt ceiling fight interrupts interest payments they would break the buck in other words this risk has created a kink in the yield curve source jim bianco however jim notes this kink is much smaller than a similar one in the 2013 debt ceiling fight so traders seem to think the risk is low we should all hope they are right and i should point out after over 40 years of watching this charade somehow we always seem to increase the debt ceiling count me in the group that thinks that risk is low us tax changes congress is also trying to pass a pair of infrastructure bills one of which has bipartisan support but could fail anyway they have become bargaining chips in other disputes both between the two parties and within them senator kirsten sinema has made it clear she will not vote for any reconciliation bill if the infrastructure bill does not pass some house democrats have made the same declaration these aren t just spending bills though they are also tax bills potentially problematic ones the house democratic version includes a provision that would prevent investors from holding non publicly traded assets like hedge funds and real estate in iras those who currently have such would get two years to move the assets out of ira form at which point any gains would become taxable where would people get the cash to pay those taxes many would have to sell other assets like stocks that wouldn t be good for stock prices fortunately my sources say even many democrats are against this particular idea so it hopefully won t happen other tax changes are quite possible and even likely as the negotiations seek pay fors to cover their desired spending the risk of unintended side effects is high particularly when the people writing legislation don t understand how markets work or are being advised by special interest lobbyists the moderate democrats negotiating with biden have stated both to him and publicly that they want to know what tax increases biden needs wants before they agree to the size of any bill reading the tea leaves suggests that corporate taxes and capital gains taxes will rise 4 and that income taxes at the highest levels will go back to 39 6 medicare etc these would be a drag on the economy but less so than the original much higher proposals which hopefully are now off the table covid recession the pandemic continues to affect economic activity almost everywhere though the particulars vary we hear a lot about supply chain problems some of it begins in the exporting countries when virus outbreaks shut down ports and factories this could continue since vaccinations are proceeding slowly in many of those places the effects cascade through the economy here in the us covid seems to have taken several million people out of the labor force some are choosing to retire early and others are homeschooling their children changing careers dealing with long covid disability etc there seem to be several million workers who are reluctant to come back to the workforce when covid is still a significant factor all of this combines to explain why we have 10 million job openings increasingly high wages to attract workers yet few workers are responding this comes on top of demographic trends that were already reducing the working age population it s a problem because we need a sufficient number of productive workers to generate gdp growth i ve said i expect 1 average growth over the rest of the decade note the average part it could and probably will include recessions with below zero growth recession is rarely good for corporate earnings which is what underpins the present bull market policy risk now to the main risk as of a few months ago quite a few economists expected the september fed policy meeting would mark the initial tapering of its pandemic stimulus programs that meeting occurred this week they still aren t tapering they did throw us a little bone though the federal open market committee fomc statement noted a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted if everything goes well blah blah blah it included all their typical hedge clauses and escape hatches they promised nothing and may well do nothing at the next meeting either we ll never know but i suspect the weak august jobs numbers probably spooked some fomc members they have lashed themselves to the full employment mast if that s not happening tapering now would generate major credibility questions the next fomc statement will be on november 3 by then they will have seen the september jobs report and maybe had a peek at october s the fed like the white house gets an advance copy of the friday bls public releases if it shows them some plausible path to maximum employment then maybe they ll take a first step i don t expect it though by then we may also know whether powell will be reappointed as seems likely at that point powell may well be willing to begin a taper that might be faster than normal sadly though i think the fed has already waited too long the fomc members are hoping for some kind of magical return to normal if inflation pressure keeps growing it will eventually force their hand real rates will become even more negative and the fed will have no choice but to begin applying the brakes possibly harder and faster than the market currently anticipates that won t be pretty but it s a real possibility i consider it the number 1 risk to both the economy and the stock market they needed to start tapering last year as soon as it was clear the financial system would hold together now they re boxed in and we re all in the box with them what could go right sentiment drives markets at least in the short term which presents us with a conundrum markets are near their all time highs yet sentiment is weakening let s quote from my friend philippa dunne of tlr analytics this morning langer research associates reported that those who believe the economy is improving fell 11 percentage points to 27 between mid august and mid september the sharpest dive in 13 years those who believe the economy is getting worse rose by 7pps to 40 since 1985 the spread between brightening and darkening outlooks has averaged 17 points so the sudden september decline is the bigger concern outlooks among households making less than 50 000 fell by 16 points among higher earners by 5 points among democrats by 21 points and among republicans by 13 points lra highlights that their current sentiment gauges have also fallen over the last three weeks from what they are calling their pandemic peak and unevenly rating the national economy the largest losses were among republicans 9 7pps households making less than 50 000 9 2pps with losses of 8 7pps among southerners and 6 3pps among women personal finances and buying climate are both off by about 2pps in his morning missive david kotok flagged the conference board s 18 point jump from 24 in june to 42 august in those ranking risk of contracting covid personally among their greatest concerns about returning to work with women and millennials more concerned about catching covid themselves and about spreading it to their families another rising share our friend danielle dimartino booth of quill intelligence put that data into charts source the daily feather that data and charts reflect the view outlined above of what could go wrong but what could go right what could change that sentiment last week my doctor mike roizen told me covid models developed by scientists who advise cdc that are finally beginning to improve one scenario suggests infections will fall 80 or even more by march getting past this pandemic could create a huge turnaround in the country s mood workers would feel far more comfortable coming back to work you could find millions of people especially in the lower income ranges finding jobs the unemployment number would drop significantly much closer to 4 the economy would improve and sentiment would potentially come roaring back the fed would have room to finish the taper faster and actually begin raising rates to something that looks like normal in another six months more supply chain problems will be solved with the exception of computer chips and the economy will resume functioning normally business travel will begin to pick up though maybe never to the prior level since we now know how to have events online those of us who speak for a living may actually find ourselves in front of crowds again homebuilders could finally catch up with the demand from first time homebuyers businesses would see new opportunities and make capital investments again you know like normal maybe we even get an honest to god 10 correction in the markets creating a buying opportunity as that sentiment begins to build the cowboys might even win the super bowl okay maybe not that last one but we can dream optimistic yes but appropriately and cautiously optimistic we keep our eyes on the covid statistics we pay attention to the supply chains we watch the sausage factory in washington dc hopefully not do too much damage to the tax structures and create too many job killing regulations but a rally from here because of the relief of covid being behind us is not out of the question i can think of other things that can go right new technologies will be amazingly powerful drivers of not just wealth but jobs and opportunities new medicines and drugs new ways to do things cheaper the contrast between what could go right and what could go wrong has hardly ever been starker i still think we are in a market where i would rather diversify among trading strategies rather than buy and hold index funds which reflects my cautious optimism i am in the markets but there is a hedge and of course i still look for those truly transformational technological innovations it is actually a wonderful time to be alive a suggestion as you may know i distill information for a living and while i have access to almost any research i want there are a handful of writers on my must read list jared dillian is one of them i find that jared challenges my viewpoints which is a positive thing in the world of investing his is a voice i want to keep in my ear more than anything jared understands investor sentiment and market psychology that is why i and countless other professionals listen to his views and watch with keen interest how he chooses to invest this week at my request jared is opening his private daily letter to mauldin economics readers if you are looking for a fresh contrarian voice you may be interested in learning more about his letter the daily dirtnap and what it could do for you when you follow this link you will gain a good introduction not only to the daily dirtnap but to jared dillian himself he had quite the career on wall street and has riveting and entertaining stories to tell about his time there the five minutes spent reading

shanghai sep 26 2021 acn newswire hua medicine hua medicine sehk 2552 today announced that at the 6th china biomed innovation and investment conference held september 25 27 in suzhou china the cbiic professor jianhua ma director of the department of endocrinology nanjing first hospital standing member of the chinese diabetes society as one of the principal researchers presented the results from a clinical study called dream which showed that dorzagliatin a glucokinase activator and a first in class investigational drug of hua medicine may make progress in diabetes remission the dream study is an observational non pharmacologic and non interventional clinical study initiated by certain researchers participating in the seed study also known as hmm0301 the seed study is a phase iii registered clinical study of dorzagliatin monotherapy in drug naive type 2 diabetes patients to observe its long term efficacy and safety the main objective of the dream study is to evaluate the ability of type 2 diabetes patients who participated in our seed study and achieved glycemic control as defined by investigators to maintain normal to near normal glucose levels i e remission of type 2 diabetes without any glucose lowering medication after the completion of the seed study for a minimum follow up period of 52 weeks the dream study was conducted in a total of 69 patients in five clinical sites in china the researchers comprehensively evaluated the subjects and set their individual hba1c control goals and the results of the research showed that the subjects had a 52 week glucose remission rate of 65 2 95 ci 53 4 77 0 during the research period professor jianhua ma said dorzagliatin a new class of glucokinase activator has demonstrated the ability to effectively improve early phase insulin secretion and beta cell function and insulin resistance resulting in type 2 diabetes remission in the previous seed study dorzagliatin monotherapy also demonstrated stable long term efficacy and a good safety profile the dream study again showed positive results where patients who reached normal blood glucose level after dorzagliatin treatment were able to maintain their blood glucose level and beta cell function after discontinuation of medication this result will help us gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of diabetes remission and explore more effective therapy for patients in clinical treatment the dream study explores the possibility of oral dosing in diabetes remission and is of great significance in expanding the treatment options for type 2 diabetes at the cbiic in addition to the dream study results dr li chen ceo founder and chief scientific officer of hua medicine also analyzed the landscape of medication for type 2 diabetes and shared hua medicine s

results of the dream study have strengthened our confidence in the cure of type 2 diabetes hua medicine will continue to explore the broad prospects of monotherapy and combination therapy based on dorzagliatin while further conducting typing studies and using a combination of big data and artificial intelligence for the precise treatment of type 2 diabetes hua medicine will also actively

menafn gulf times fifty years ago a us president closed the gold window ended capital controls and launched a new era of globalised finance the nixon shock reshaped the international monetary system overnight and then gradually changed the status of central bankers instead of acting as servants of the domestic economy monetary policymakers have become masters of the globalised and financialised world economy and this development bears directly on our ability to tackle the problems of climate change and biodiversity loss despite their technocratic mystique central bankers are politically appointed public servants on government payrolls and still derive their authority from the taxpayers in their respective jurisdictions as former bank of england deputy governor paul tucker observes the right to create money is always latently a power of taxation central bankers status and constitutional role is therefore primarily a democratic question not an economic or technical one as the managers of public institutions that hold a monopoly over the issuance of currencies and liquidity they wield awesome powerful instruments that can be deployed only because they are backed by government treasuries treasuries in turn are backed by a country s fiscal resources including tax revenues and by public institutions that are vital to the private financial sector such as the contract enforcing judicial system the stronger a sovereign s public institutions and tax base the more expansive the central bank s powers to generate liquidity and the more highly rated the country s bonds and currency will be despite the long reigning ideology of free markets capitalism has always depended on public institutions and resources for its capital gains and profits just as central banks have always presided over a hybrid private public financial system what is new is the extent to which central bank resources balance sheets have been expanded and deployed in the private interests of vast unregulated and systemically risky capital markets across the shadow banking system outlining the history of these developments the political economist benjamin braun notes that the stagflation crisis of the 1970s and paul volcker s labour crushing crackdown on inflation in the us in the early 1980s led to the transfer of responsibility for monetary policy away from those directly accountable to elected representatives ever since then braun argues financialised capital has depended on independent central banks and arbitration courts to protect it against local democracy meanwhile the bank for international settlements has tallied up the value of the extraordinary fiscal monetary and macroprudential measures that central banks have deployed since 2007 to shore up private financial markets and mitigate their adverse economic impacts notably bis economists find that central bank programs to purchase private assets accounted for half of total purchases over this period and as other researchers have shown a significant share of these financial flows have gone to support fossil fuels and other carbon intensive sectors the overall sums involved here are massive earlier this year the eurosystem s balance sheet exceeded 7tn 8 3tn which is more than 60 of the eurozone s gdp the bank of japan s balance sheet now stands at 130 of gdp the fed s grew from 4 3tn in mid march 2020 to a peak of 8 2tn in late july 2021 that is equivalent to about 40 of nominal us gdp a level not seen since world war ii moreover since 2007 central bankers have used their public authority to participate in influence and shape the vast 52tn shadow banking system where they have become private dealers of last resort and market makers of first resort the expansion of shadow banking follows from the 1981 2014 period when 30 governments around the world decided to privatise their pension funds as a result a vast pool of the world s savings flowed into asset management funds in globalised largely unregulated capital markets because the sums were too large to be accommodated by commercial main street banks the shadow banking system emerged these earlier political decisions to financialise the global economy are still with us and will pose hurdles to our efforts to tackle broader societal challenges like climate change given the precarious state of the biosphere it is imperative that central banks activities be reoriented toward what braun calls public purpose and away from the task of sustaining private gains in capital markets humanity is now facing terrifying climate and ecological threats while there is still a chance to slash greenhouse gas emissions at the pace needed to keep global warming below 1 5c biodiversity loss is already well underway in fact we are moving faster toward the point of civilizational collapse than scientists previously thought in research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in june 2020 gerardo ceballos paul r ehrlich and peter h raven argued that the ongoing sixth mass extinction may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization because it is irreversible emphasis added many including key figures in us president joe biden s administration believe that ensuring the survival of human civilization is a task that can be left to private capital markets in his first press conference as the us climate envoy john kerry paid homage to blackrock s climate conscious ceo larry fink and in effect begged wall street to come to the rescue of the administration s climate plan the us national climate adviser gina mccarthy then drove home the point the question won t be whether the private sector is going to buy into it the private sector is going to drive it in the great depression the face most americans associated with the response was the democratically elected president franklin d roosevelt are we now supposed to look to an unelected unaccountable fund manager or perhaps to fed chair jerome powell to rescue human civilization from collapse the present structure of globalised finance lends itself to precisely this undemocratic outcome but we must resist it lest we end up with a return of fascism on top of the climate crisis if we are going to avert both a political and a climate breakdown we will need to transform the international monetary system so that it upholds democracy and the policy autonomy of nation states that means reintroducing capital controls re regulating global banking re nationalising pensions and restoring political and economic power to elected assemblies not simply to their executives and to central bankers to be sure the separation of powers between central banks and politicians will have to be maintained to avoid corruption but central bankers will need to be required through legislation to reorient their vast array of planning tools to the needs of democracy and the domestic economy fifty years ago a political decision by one elected president and his advisers transformed the international financial architecture overnight such democratic transformations are entirely possible and another one is now urgently needed project syndicate ann pettifor director of policy research in macroeconomics is the author of the case for the green new deal menafn26092021000067011011id1102867550

look forward to seeing more of that going forward unfortunately another of the trends of 2017 seemed to be maga zines closing or on hiatus magazines new and old print and online are still struggling to raise money in the current free internet economy leaning on fundraising kickstarter etc and recurring dona tions patreon and paypal in order to pay creators the rates they deserve even though they are often not paying themselves or other editors who work on the publications advertising has shifted so much that many of the new magazines have never had a direct advertiser let alone a major advertiser which historically made up 50 of magazine revenue in contrast online ad placement services like google adsense pay only pennies a day and are meager replacements if you enjoy these magazines re member to subscribe donate and support even if the material online is free so that they can continue to publish this and more like it in the february 2018 issue of locus while you are here please take a moment to support locus with a one time or recurring donation we rely on reader donations to keep the magazine and site going and would like to keep the site paywall free but we

print this page five years ago the un general assembly adopted a landmark declaration urging global action against growing anti microbial resistance amr which many still view as one of the greatest threats to public health in the 21st century the move followed a groundbreaking review of antibiotic resistance commissioned by the uk government from the economist jim o neill the findings of which continue to be widely cited without decisive action there could be 10m deaths a year due to amr by 2050 and a cumulative cost to the global economy of 100tn yet 2016 was a high watermark for political and public engagement with amr while the subsequent five years have seen some new funding for antibiotics research and development as well as initiatives to slow the evolution of amr by restraining excessive use of existing drugs in medicine and agriculture progress has not been made at the scale needed comparing the many commitments made in the un declaration with how governance and financial initiatives for amr has developed in reality progress and particularly the pace has been truly disappointing says otto cars professor of infectious diseases at uppsala university and a member of the un interagency co ordination group on amr set up after the declaration 0 none of the 43 antibiotics currently in clinical development sufficiently addresses drug resistance in the most dangerous bacteria according to the who the covid 19 pandemic has thrown the failure to act on amr into sharp relief antibiotic resistance is not like covid 19 it will not be an unpredictable pandemic says cars who also founded the international amr network react the world already knows what it must do to prevent and manage it we just don t have the broad political will to tackle it yet if we can t convince governments at this point to prioritise and invest in the prevention of health disasters that we know are approaching in the foreseeable future what has the world really learned from covid 19 the world health organization s annual antibacterial pipeline report in april found that none of the 43 antibiotics currently in clinical development sufficiently addresses drug resistance in the most dangerous bacteria the persistent failure to develop manufacture and distribute effective new antibiotics is further fuelling the impact of amr and threatens our ability to successfully treat bacterial infections says hanan balkhy who assistant director general for amr we are almost forced to move away from amr and into other areas where we can apply our technology particularly cancer and fibrosis a new amr preparedness index launched in june by the global coalition on aging and the infectious diseases society of america provided more evidence of what it called a broad failure to match public promises with the concrete actions needed to avert the growing crisis the index scored the world s 11 largest economies against seven amr criteria the worst national performers were brazil china and india least bad was the uk since the 1980s the stock of effective antibiotics has depleted gradually as bacteria evolve and build up resistance replenishing the pipeline requires both push and pull financial incentives push which means funding research by biotech companies and universities to discover new antibiotics and carry out initial clinical trials is performing better than pull which instead rewards pharmaceutical companies for taking antibiotics through late stage clinical trials and on to the market several organisations set up with public private and charitable funding are supporting research into new antibiotics the most active backers of antibiotic r d include carb x gardp repair impact fund and amr action fund carb x is an active backer of antibiotic research there has been much less progress on the pull side marketing new antibiotics would bring in little conventional sales revenue as the drugs would be reserved for use in small quantities in short courses on patients whose infection is not treatable with existing products a few countries including the us and uk are exploring subscription style incentives in which companies would be paid upfront for developing effective new antibiotics in ways that are not linked directly to sales volumes but none of the pull initiatives is yet on a scale sufficient to make much impact a report published by the access to medicine foundation in amsterdam in june showed that innovative antibiotics and their producers must bridge two distinct funding valleys of death before the drugs can reach patients one is in the earlier stages when venture capitalists are unwilling to support a new antibiotic with no promising return on investment the second is the commercial valley of death when an approved drug reaches the market but lacks sufficient sales revenues oxford drug design an oxford university spinout exemplifies the problem its technology based on inhibiting enzymes called aminoacyl trna which play a key role in protein synthesis is leading to promising antibiotics for treating drug resistant infections we have received generous grants from carb x and innovate uk which have enabled us to make good technical progress but that does not cut the ice with venture capitalists says paul finn the company s chief scientist it has been well nigh impossible to raise money to take our molecules into the clinic we are almost forced to move away from amr and into other areas where we can apply our technology particularly cancer and fibrosis others are in a worse predicament than oxford drug design many companies go bankrupt before they can launch their products and some fail even after reaching this milestone the access to medicine report says it is clear that the innovators of such drugs urgently need a stable economic and policy environment suitable for developing and responsibly delivering new antimicrobials
olga r rodriguez associated press san francisco pacific gas electric was charged friday with involuntary manslaughter and other crimes after its equipment sparked a northern california wildfire that killed four people and destroyed hundreds of homes last year prosecutors said it is the latest legal action against the nation s largest utility which pleaded guilty last year to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in a 2018 blaze ignited by its long neglected electrical grid that nearly destroyed the town of paradise and became the deadliest u s wildfire in a century shasta county district attorney stephanie bridgett announced the 31 charges including 11 felonies against pg e saying it failed to perform its legal duties and that its failure was reckless and criminally negligent and it resulted in the death of four people if the utility is convicted of involuntary manslaughter the punishment would be a fine for each person killed in the zogg fire last year near the city of redding a corporation can t go to jail so we re talking fines fees the ability for the court to order remedial and corrective measures bridgett said one of our primary functions here is to hold them responsible and let the surviving families know that their loved one did not die in vain she added pg e ceo patti poppe said failing to prevent the fire was not a crime this was a tragedy four people died and my coworkers are working so hard to prevent fires and the catastrophic losses that come with them they have dedicated their careers to it criminalizing their judgment is not right poppe said in a statement in a filing with the securities and exchange commission the utility said it intends to vigorously defend itself against the charges we ve accepted cal fire s determination reached earlier this year that a tree contacted our electric line and started the zogg fire poppe said in the same statement released friday by pg e in the wake of bridgett s announcement of the charges we accept that conclusion but we did not commit a crime the wind whipped zogg fire began on sept 27 2020 and raged through rugged terrain and small communities west of redding killing four people burning about 200 homes and blackening about 87 square miles 225 square kilometers of land three of the victims died as they tried to outrun the blaze and were found inside or near their vehicles a fourth victim died at a hospital in march state fire investigators concluded that the blaze was sparked by a gray pine tree that fell onto a pg e distribution line shasta and tehama counties have sued the utility alleging negligence saying pg e had failed to remove the tree even though it had been marked for removal two years earlier the utility says the tree was subsequently cleared to stay the district attorney determined that the company was criminally liable for the fire the charges friday include enhancements for injury to a 29 year old firefighter who was hit by a falling tree that fractured his spine paralyzing him from the chest down they also include felony arson counts linked to several fires started by the utility s equipment in shasta county over the last year bridgett said pg e which has an estimated 16 million customers in central and northern california filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 after its aging equipment was blamed for a series of fires including the 2018 camp fire that killed 85 people and destroyed 10 000 homes in paradise and neighboring communities company officials have acknowledged that pg e hasn t lived up to expectations in the past but said changes in leadership and elsewhere ensure it s on the right track and will do better they have listed a wide range of improvements that include using more advanced technology to avoid setting wildfires and help detect them quicker pg e also remains on criminal probation for a 2010 pipeline explosion in the san francisco bay area city of san bruno that killed eight people giving a federal judge oversight of the company the judge and california power regulators have rebuked pg e for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the company has acknowledged that its equipment may have played a role in sparking this summer s dixie fire which has burned nearly 1 million acres and is now the second largest wildfire in state history pg e emerged from bankruptcy last summer and negotiated a 13 5 billion settlement with some wildfire victims but it still faces both civil and criminal actions including charges from the sonoma county district attorney s office over the 2019 kincade fire that forced nearly 200 000 people to evacuate in the meantime most of the roughly 70 000 victims who have filed claims for the devastation caused by pg e s past misdeeds still are awaiting payment from a trust created during the bankruptcy the trust which is run independently of pg e is facing a nearly 2 billion shortfall because half its funding came in company stock
the last year has made one fact quite clear spending huge amounts of money on defense has little to no impact on whether a country will be able to effectively protect its people and its economy from a pandemic the covid 19 pandemic vividly illuminated the many ways in which the american approach to national security has been fundamentally focused on the wrong threats as us defense expenditures rose in 2020 to 778 billion that is almost 40 percent of total military spending in the world a third of small us businesses closed either temporarily or forever and by june 2021 over 600 000 people in the united states had died from covid 19 the biden administration had an opportunity to redirect the united states path away from endless war and all but limitless spending on the defense department that path could and should have centered on the most imminent threats to our security climate change and potentially pandemic infectious diseases but you wouldn t recognize those as america s top threats by looking at its spending priorities which continue to prioritize the best interests of defense contractors over protecting the true national security for example the defense department has repeatedly accelerated production of weapons systems with immature technology before capabilities have been proven in testing the end result of this practice included a decade of spending 46 billion on programs that were ultimately canceled when that immature technology inevitably led to delays and increased costs those programs took resources from maintaining the weapons and systems the united states already had contributing very likely to preventable accidents smart cuts would stop production of major programs like the f 35 joint strike fighter until testing is complete proper oversight of the defense budget would also challenge bureaucratic growth that inevitably follows when new entities are created one good example is the space force which some in congress are already criticizing for mismanaging its procurement programs nuclear spending is another area in which us priorities have flown completely off the rails over the course of a single year the cost estimate for the nuclear weapons activities budget increased by 113 billion the upcoming nuclear posture review should seriously consider canceling a number of programs for example the sea launched cruise missile is not only destabilizing an adversary could not tell whether a us submarine launched cruise missile had a nuclear or conventional warhead but undermines the navy s ability to conduct its conventional missions canceling the program would save at least 10 billion over the next 10 years plans to modernize land based intercontinental ballistic missiles could also be curtailed without compromising us national security the defense budget submitted by the biden administration looks very like the trump administration s with only a few variations it included more than 12 billion for the f 35 joint strike fighter program a program plagued with performance deficiencies high costs and low availability it also largely endorsed the past administration s destabilizing nuclear weapons plans and spending on expensive and fragile conventional weapons even before the pandemic there was plenty of evidence that the large us defense budget was ripe for cuts and reform in fact the overall pattern of recent defense contracting exhibits one defining characteristic always paying too much too much for the shadow workforce of private white collar workers performing jobs that could usually be performed at half or one third the cost by government employees for instance too much for spare parts including 71 for a straight pin that should have cost less than a nickel based on these kinds of results another federal agency could expect significant budget cuts the significant costs of protecting the economy during the pandemic led to one of the strongest votes in history to cut the defense budget by 10 percent with 93 house members and 23 senators in favor that modest proposal was a bridge too far for the congress as a whole still it s becoming clear to defense contractors and their allies that their gravy train could be in jeopardy unless they create a new threat to justify continued high levels of defense spending in washington there is a growing drumbeat from pentagon contractors and the think tanks they fund on the need to increase defense efforts related to china their allies in the pentagon and congress also argue that the united states must increase its budget significantly to be prepared to fight an all out conventional war against china those pushing for a new cold war with china look past reality the united states far outpaces china in military spending by a factor of three roughly and us weapons systems personnel and innovation programs are generally far more capable than china s our nuclear arsenal stockpile is also significantly larger saber rattling against major nuclear powers is dangerous the sabers rattled against china seem to be largely directed at grabbing as many contractor dollars for the pentagon as possible rather than making the united states safer and make no mistake us defense contractors bottom lines and stock values have soared the six largest contractors for the pentagon spent over 163 9 billion on stock repurchases and dividends between 2010 and 2018 and they hope to keep the largesse flowing as my colleague dan grazier has pointed out exaggerated rhetoric about the threat of china is consistent with historical patterns of inflating threats when reality would otherwise call for curtailing defense spending the already ample defense budget would be better directed toward anti access area denial rather than expanding our already sizable offensive capabilities while some might argue that defense spending aids the economic recovery from the pandemic the data clearly do not agree defense spending is in fact one of the least effective job creators government can pursue numerous studies have confirmed that the money spent on defense programs would create significantly more jobs if it were directed toward domestic infrastructure or healthcare or put toward programs that address climate change which is increasingly endangering lives in the united states and elsewhere seattle had its hottest temperature ever this summer a winter storm in texas that some experts linked to climate change led to nearly 60 people dying and left 12 million people without safe drinking water and 4 5 million without power the nonpartisan congressional budget office predicts that climate change will increase us deficits by both reducing revenues and increasing mandatory spending it s also destabilizing countries around the world as the progressive advocacy group win without war has pointed out a real understanding of syria s civil war includes an acknowledgement that climate change contributed to droughts that displaced hundreds of thousands of rural families rising sea levels and increased heat will continue to put pressure on the ability of communities in many countries to access water grow food and thrive even looking at climate change through a purely military lens it s clear that there are increasing costs to this threat a 2016 report by the union of concerned scientists estimates that by 2050 vulnerable military installations will experience 10 times as many floods flooding and hurricane michael caused 4 9 billion in damage to air force bases the marine corps estimated hurricane florence resulted in 3 6 billion in damage to its installations and for both domestic and military disasters the national guard is repeatedly called upon to help the biden administration took an important step early this year issuing an executive order prioritizing the climate crisis but as long as it supports unsustainable spending at the pentagon this administration undercuts its own goals there are certainly military dimensions to the threat of epidemics as well for example a poorly handled outbreak of covid 19 on the uss theodore roosevelt aircraft carrier made headlines and keeping military personnel healthy is a top us security concern but the defense department does not have the expertise or the capacity to be at the forefront of fighting pandemics leadership on such issues must come from public health experts and agencies and it s important to remember what happened when the defense department was given the lead in a pandemic related effort the department took 1 billion meant to accelerate purchases of n95 masks and other personal protective equipment ppe and reallocated that money using it to buy jet engine parts and body armor the costs and threats of covid 19 are too familiar after a year of lockdowns and masks many americans hoped that they would be able to put the pandemic behind them by now the struggles to recover from the pandemic however show that the united states has deeper problems to address perhaps the largest and most difficult problem involves a lack of confidence in government and political leaders our enemies abroad have repeatedly shown that they can exploit our divisions to undermine confidence in our elections inflame racial divides and spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines real and perceived concerns about corruption and self dealing by public officials are making it more difficult for the government to be an effective leader in combating society s greatest challenges the consequences of this distrust are real and lethal as evidenced by the number of people who still refuse to take a vaccine that could protect both themselves and those they love america will continue to see epidemics and natural disasters that can only be addressed through government leadership a democracy s effectiveness however depends on making the government worthy of public trust restoring public trust requires the allocation of resources in ways that support the resilience of the entire economy not just the defense sector the general public understands what governments should be focused on polling by pew research center found that those polled in the united states identified infectious diseases as the greatest threat to the country many of our closest allies cited climate change as their top concern the united states can t continue to throw money at a bloated defense department while short changing the most pressing areas of national security the biden defense budget is one that only a defense contractor could love it continues spending for unproven weapon systems unsustainable and unneeded nuclear weapons efforts and a new cold war with china the united states cannot sustain a 750 billion plus pentagon budget and have the needed funds to address covid relief and recovery infrastructure and climate change the us government has a duty to prioritize america s greatest threats now and not burden families and the generations to come with bills for spending that does not make us safer notably the department of defense also accelerates the damage of climate change by being the single largest us user of fossil fuels a 2019 analysis by the brown university costs of war project found the military has emitted 1 2 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases since 2001

this article is part of the debatable newsletter you can sign up here to receive it on tuesdays and thursdays humanity s failure to avert the crisis of a warming climate is sometimes framed as a grand technological problem for centuries countries relied on fossil fuels to industrialize their economies and generate wealth and it was only in recent years that alternative ways of powering a society like solar and wind energy became viable but when it comes to electricity at least that story isn t true today the united states gets 60 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels and just 20 percent from renewables the final 20 percent comes from nuclear power a technology that has existed since the 1950s produces no carbon dioxide and has killed far fewer people than fossil fuels decarbonizing the electric grid is certainly not the only challenge climate change poses but it is the central one and the biden administration has said the united states needs to meet it by 2035 should nuclear power be playing a bigger role in the transition here s what people are saying

as big a problem rep ilhan omar is for jews israel and the democratic party she is the face of a much bigger problem for the historic american nation immigrants or their children from what it is now apparently politically incorrect to call the third world being elected to congress granted the proximate target of the muslim somali refugee s ire is israel it s all about the benjamins the koranically sworn congresswoman famously tweeted i am told everyday that i am anti american if i am not pro israel she answered when a jewish democrat called out her anti semitism and granted the democrats particularly open borders jewish democrats are getting what they deserve in a party where the sine qua non of success is unqualified support for israel top leaders don t know what to do about omar whom they merrily invited to join their subversion but however much she fulminates about israel her ultimate target is you and me jewish or not she s in congress to change the country and not for the better as real americans go given her origins in a country with zero experience in the rule of law and the democratic laws and customs that grow out of it in somalia to quote mao power grows out of the barrel of a gun omar isn t the only one either the immigrant or child of immigrant contingent in congress is non european the pew research center reports that 68 of congress 535 members or 13 percent are immigrants or the children of immigrants problem is the vast majority are non european forty two are from asia the middle east or south america as for the foreign born pew reported the number is 14 or 3 percent only one is european polish born tom malinowski here s the list salud carbajal mexico democrat calif adriano espaillat dominican republic democrat n y jesús garcía mexico democrat ill mazie hirono japan democrat hawaii the only senator pramila jayapal india democrat wash raja krishnamoorthi india democrat ill ted lieu taiwan democrat calif tom malinowski poland democrat n j debbie mucarsel powell ecuador democrat fla stephanie murphy née đặng thị ngọc dung vietnam democrat fla ilhan omar somalia democrat minn raul ruiz mexico democrat calif albio sires cuba democrat n j norma torres guatemala democrat calif of course 57 of the 68 are democrats it s 58 if you count bernie sanders the child and grandchild of immigrants last session 12 percent of congressmen were immigrants or the children of immigrants and in 2015 the number dropped to near nothing only six were immigrants but they all had something in common not one was from europe pew s data show zero immigrants in congress from 1967 through 1973 but the research center also pointed to a compelling mid 20th century study every immigrant who served in congress from 1789 through the next 160 years was european with just one exception mexico born octaviano ambrosio larrazolo the former governor of new mexico served a year in the u s senate 1928 1929 he was a handsome highly educated man who looked as white as donald trump at least in black and white as for the first congress four of its 29 senators were born in the old country two in ireland one in scotland and one in england four of the 66 members of the house were born in british isles two ireland two in england one was born in bermuda which really wasn t the old world but still a british possession so nine of the 95 members of the first congress of 1789 about 10 percent were foreign born a century later it was 8 percent but pew s using immigrant to describe the foreign born 1789ers elides an important truth those men weren t immigrants in the sense that omar and others are they were settlers building a new nation they weren t immigrants demanding change to an existing polity and they were as john jay said descended from the same ancestors speaking the same language professing the same religion attached to the same principles of government very similar in their manners and customs not anymore the danger of a third world beachhead on capitol hill almost all open borders democrats are obvious they consider illegal immigrants and fake refugees real constituents consider the activities of pramila jayapal born in india who boasts about flouting and subverting immigration law i was able to successfully assist 5 asylum seekers 2 unaccompanied minors a mother and her 9 year old child and a young man with a serious medical condition into the united states she harrumphed on twitter initially they were denied in violation of u s and international law but i was able to intervene and ensure that they could simply present themselves for asylum in the united states i was able to successfully assist 5 asylum seekers 2 unaccompanied minors a mother and her 9 year old child and a young man with a serious medical condition into the united states rep pramila jayapal repjayapal december 2 2018 in other words an indian feet still wet from the ganges lectures us on what it means to be an american and helps illegal aliens file what are most likely phony asylum claims but that wouldn t matter to someone who didn t love her own country enough to stay put and change things there not here as for those who oppose her jayapal flatly says trump is a white supremacist his ultimate goal is to make america pure in the sense of not having immigrants not having folks of color here and shutting down every form of legal immigration all to throw a bone to those people she told msnbc s chris hayes in an interview those people of course are trump voters then she confessed her motive as an immigrant myself it is so deeply offensive to see the harm that he s causing to people across the country people who are terrified who don t feel that they belong the people who are seeking asylum who no longer can get in even though it s legal to seek asylum and not just at a legal port of entry in fact of course jayapal and her ilk don t belong trump isn t harming anyone and stopping the likes of jayapal from getting into the country would be a great help to americans not least because crazy white leftists wouldn t get the guilts and send them to congress unsurprisingly omar and jayapal joined alexandria ocasio cortez technically not of immigrant stock only because we haven t yet expelled puerto rico in calling for the abolition of immigration and customs enforcement like jayapal omar didn t love her own country enough to stay and change it she wants to wreck ours abolish ice she tweeted there is no compromise our immigration system is deeply broken we shouldn t seek to punish families seeking safety and opportunity we should create fair and accessible pathways to citizenship translation keep letting people like me into the country without limit well the few remaining white democrats particularly jews now know what that means giving african and other muslims a voice in the party on israel policy of course democrats didn t have that in mind when they dropped the preference for immigration from europe in 1965 thanks largely a left wing jewish congressman from new york emanuel celler his irish american messenger boy in the senate ted kennedy helped jam the third world immigration bill down the country s throat after lying about it it wouldn t he said alter the country s demographics speaking of celler a fun fact in the godfather when nazorine the baker asks for the don s help to keep his immigrant future son in law the country consigliere tom hagen asks his boss which of his bribed politicians should get the job replied the don give it to a jew congressman in another district i doubt if novelist mario puzo or francis ford coppola were thinking of celler but a jew congressman certainly did alter the country s demographics yet jewish democrats and their allies how profess themselves shocked at the unforeseen consequences one of which was omar congress passed a resolution condemning anti semitism it didn t mention omar and instead blamed white supremacists but the israel lobby made its point needless to say jewish democrats back home want omar gone even trying to entice minneapolis city councilwoman andrea jenkins the first openly transgender african american woman elected to public office in the united states into the race these are democrats you can t make this stuff up worsening matters added to that newly elected anti israel phalanx are many members born in 1973 or after who are ardently socialist anti israel and contemptuous of america and its history newt gingrich observed all that said here s the thing however right the angry muslim refugee is about the israel lobby and jewish power paleocons and immigration patriots must not join her omar wants to diminish support for israel because she hates the jews not because she loves the united states and wants to disentangle us from the middle east as joe sobran said by the way we want to see although not help israel prevail over its islamic enemies for the same reason we want the mammal to win in a fight against a reptile on animal planet we have a natural affinity for our own even if that small part of our own can be an obnoxious pain a final gangster allusion to illustrate the richly amusing irony of what the democrats face in a party with more and more omars when a hasidic hotelier asks tony soprano to help solve a problem the new jersey mob boss takes over the hotel the owner regretfully cries that he created a golem a monster democratic immigration ideology conceived and backed by jewish democrats has unleashed a golem in the capitol would harm israel but that same golem wants to harm us it is hard left heavily black and heavily hispanic not to mention partly islamic so yeah it s anti israel but it s also anti white anti christian and anti american open borders doesn t just mean flooding the country with a teeming horde of the illiterate the unemployed the diseased and the criminal it means more omars in congress and we know what that will mean for the historic american nation

1 trillion coins instead of more federal debt by stefan gleason credit risk out of china and debt ceiling drama in washington were driving precious metals markets tlast is week gold and silver attracted some significant safe haven buying as equity markets succumbed to selling the storyline being trumpeted in the financial media is that a government shutdown and possible debt default loom in october unless the u s senate comes to an agreement on raising the debt ceiling there is some truth to these headlines and we would certainly include unsustainable government debt among the top reasons for investors to own physical precious metals but let s get real the odds of an actual default on u s government bonds in 2021 are slim to none like so many times before brinksmanship will almost certainly give way to compromise the debt ceiling will be raised one way or another right now what we are witnessing is mostly political theater republicans are posturing to show they are opposed to democrats spending agenda and democrats are posturing to force republicans to vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling the reality is that establishment republicans approved most of the spending that is now being financed and democrat leader chuck schumer could authorize the government to undertake additional borrowing through a procedural vote in the senate at any time democrats have the votes to do it on their own left leaning cnn acknowledged but by doing so they would be getting all the worst parts of raising or suspending the debt ceiling with none of the benefits by benefits they mean political cover for vulnerable democrats in the mid term election campaign meanwhile cbs news is reporting that a u s debt default could wipe out 6 million jobs and 15 trillion in wealth based on calculations by moody s analytics janet yellen is warning of an economic catastrophe in the event that congress fails to raise the government s credit card limit these alarmist warnings are misleading government bonds and the dollars in which they are denominated are claims on wealth â not wealth itself in a sovereign debt collapse purchasing power is transferred away from bondholders to the benefit of taxpayers who are no longer on the hook for paying interest and principal of course a domino effect would hit financial markets and sectors of the economy sensitive to credit risk the financial system would be forced to reorganize itself on sounder footing â a painful process which wouldn t necessarily be a bad thing in the long run but a default won t be allowed to happen even if the senate fails to act the treasury department and federal reserve could invoke emergency measures on their own some unconventional options being discussed involve precious metals â though not in the sense of returning to sound money one proposal would have the treasury department mint platinum coins with an arbitrary face value of 1 trillion these coins could then be deposited at the federal reserve which would credit the government with the trillions of dollars it needs to pay its bills voila no new debt as wacky as this idea sounds it was first floated by hard leftists during the obama administration as a way around political gridlock over the debt ceiling and it is again being pushed as a possible last ditch maneuver of course individuals who holdâ platinum american eagle coins â face value 100 wouldn t become instant trillionaires but platinum and other hard assets could still move markedly higher in dollar terms based on inflationary fears if the fed used its digital printing press to buy coins the u s government declares are worth a trillion dollars regardless of what form it takes the fed stands ready to print all the currency the government needs to pay its bills former fed chair alan greenspan has said that a default is essentially impossible under our monetary system instead of fearing a formal u s default investors should fear the inflationary consequences of averting it a lot of new currency creation will be coming down the pike in the years ahead to keep the 28 8 trillion and growing national debt propped up while enabling politicians to continue running multi trillion dollar annual budget deficits the greatest default risk of all is that of the federal reserve reneging on its obligation to maintain a stable currency with no meaningful grounding anymore in gold or other precious metals there is nothing to stand in the way of a precipitous decline in the federalâ reserve note s value â especially since a currency

depression is a serious mental disorder and a state of being that troubles many people all over the world it is not a condition to be taken lightly it can weigh down on a person immensely and can even claim lives it is a state of extreme sadness of apathy and lethargy and an all consuming melancholy depression is like a mire into which a person sinks slowly and uncontrollably getting out of this state can be a big challenge but a challenge that can be overcome so we can imagine that people in ancient times had a hazy understanding of what depression is and struggled to help those affected with it can we learn anything from the history of depression and its treatment across the ages how the ancients understood depression today s science and medicine has shed a lot of light on this serious condition and thanks to that it can be helped while sadness is a normal human emotion and a part of life major depression is not depression can come in bouts lasting for a short period of time or can be a major clinical disorder that constantly weighs a person down either way such a condition is dangerous and requires treatment and attention it is estimated that more than 160 million people around the world suffer from major depression if not helped they can be consumed by this state and take their own lives one must wonder how did ancient societies understand this extreme state the first clues lie amongst the philosophers of ancient greece this civilization was at the forefront of all things scientific mental issues included and surprisingly they characterized the illness quite accurately considering the time the famed ancient greek physician hippocrates described this severe mental state as a distinct disease he named it melancholia from ancient greek melas black and kholé bile and stated that all fears and despondencies if they last a long time are the usual symptoms of the illness however his understanding of this melancholia was much broader than it is today and included several other symptoms which are no longer directly associated with depression these were anger fear obsessive behaviors and delusions shamash was the mesopotamian sun god prioryman cc by sa 4 0 while hippocrates gave the first medical or scientific description of the illness there are still some mentions that go even further back in time however they are not as detailed in the cradle of civilization mesopotamia there is mention of such an ailment as far back as 2 000 bc still the mesopotamians considered it a spiritual state a trouble caused by demonic possession so a depressed person of that era would call to his aid not a doctor but a holy man one could also hope to dispel the fears by offering a sacrifice to the god shamash in an elaborate ritual an imbalance of bile the greeks however more than a millennia later had a better grasp of the human ailments their understanding was nevertheless still crude hippocrates believed that melancholia as with most other such ailments was caused by an imbalance in humors the four humors and their relationship to the natural order wellcome trust cc by 4 0 the greeks based a lot of their diagnoses on the so called humors which were four bodily fluids blood phlegm black bile and yellow bile hippocrates claimed that melancholia was caused by an excess of black bile in the spleen thus his treatment for the condition was bloodletting dieting vigorous exercise and hot or cold baths it wasn t until the roman statesman cicero a few centuries later that a more logical diagnosis was given cicero said that melancholia had roots in fear anger and above all grief from compassion to abuse however in the following centuries treatment of this ailment did not progress across the world many odd and cruel treatments for depression were implemented generally in post classical and early medieval societies depressed people were shunned and seen as weak thus they were most often abused it was often reported that such patients were thrown in dungeons shackled and beaten but as the world progressed so did our understanding of depression and the need to help those afflicted one of the pioneers in that treatment was the persian physician muhammad ibn zakariya al razi positive reinforcement for proper behavior al razi accurately described depression as stemming from the brain he called it a melancholic obsessive compulsive disorder which stems from the changes of blood flow in the brain he urged all the doctors to treat their patients with kindness and special care and emphasized positive reinforcement i e rewards for proper behavior following successful treatments al razi would discharge the patient and provide them with a sum of money this would help them with immediate needs back in society and help with their transition this is considered to be the first recorded case of psychiatric aftercare and we can safely assume that muhammad al razi successfully cured many cases of depression with his careful and kind approach to treatment muhammad ibn zakariya al razi wellcome trust cc by 4 0 possession by the devil alas there were many competing theories at that time and positive treatment of depression did not catch on with the coming the medieval period a dark age fell upon europe shunning those afflicted with depression christianity influenced diagnosis and mental illness was commonly seen as possession by the devil or demons often crude methods were employed as a cure chief of them being exorcism of course chanting christian prayers in hopes of relieving a person of the demon possessing it is not an efficient treatment for clinical depression sadly more than often afflicted people were persecuted openly abused or killed depression and other mental issues were often seen as signs of witchcraft and many innocent people suffered cruel deaths at the hands of the christian clergy the dangers of prolonged isolation but physicians during this period learned to recognize the symptoms of depression oddly enough it was within christianity that symptoms could be observed in particular amongst the ascetic monks the hermits and anchorites of the christian movement wanted to shun the earthly life and thus fled into remote areas where they lived in total solitude devoted to prayer and introspection but this is an unnatural state and can have profound effects on the mind and spirit hermits were often associated with depression due to their self isolation unknown author public domain during the middle ages many hermits were described as suffering from a state called acedia which was described as grief indifference and a great spiritual discomfort all symptoms of depression the state resulted from prolonged isolation from society and the rigorous deprivations that the hermits endured thus it was seen that depression can be induced as well a new light on depression starting in the 14th century depression received its name the one we use today it comes from the latin verb deprimere to press down and to depress was used to signify low spirits with the renaissance around the 16th century philosophical scientific and medical thinking once more came to the forefront a famed english author wrote of the condition in 1665 calling it a great depression of spirit a description that later became established from the end of the renaissance and to the end of the enlightenment the classical age sheds new light on depression and its treatments it was understood as an alienation of the mind and the imagination to be fought with reason a depressed person was considered one struck with emptiness an absence of meaning and great sadness it was around this time that the most important work on depression for that period was published the anatomy of melancholy in 1621 it was published by robert burton a scholar a teacher and a vicar at oxford university he was one of the pioneers who took a thorough and profound look at melancholy addressing many theories and describing firsthand experiences burton proposed that depression was to be battled by all the reasonable and positive remedies plenty of sleep a healthy diet music arts meaningful work and a positive talk about the problem with a friend robert burton walker boutall public domain burton himself was a lifelong sufferer from depression depression seen through the eyes of learned men in the following centuries the concept of melancholia as it was still widely called was continuously explored and studied the ancient theory of humors came to be seen as flawed and incorrect and new pioneering medical and psychological studies appeared the german physician johann christian heinroth 1773 1843 described the state as a disturbance of the soul that stemmed from a moral conflict within the patient thus he saw it as a psychological state many learned men and physicians from the period began categorizing melancholia into distinct sub groups depending on the afflictions over time the term depression began to be used more often before at last supplanting the outdated melancholia emil kraepelin 1856 1926 a german psychiatrist was likely the first to use depression as an overarching term and was also the first to distinguish manic depression and to describe bipolar disorder during this time sigmund freud also tackled the subject of depression arguing that it could result from loss and that it takes up a form more severe than standard mourning he proposed a complex theory stating that objective loss results in subjective loss also as an example he took depression that stems from a loss of valued romantic relationship freud claimed that the depressed person has identified with the object of affection unconsciously and the loss has severe psychological effects that are more profound than mourning when philosophy and psychology mingle in the 20th century philosophy and psychology were often intertwined both searching for an explanation for depression existentialism and were the foremost schools of philosophy associated with depression and its treatment viktor frankl 1905 1997 the austrian existential psychiatrist connected depression to an overpowering feeling of insignificance futility and meaninglessness he proposed that the existential vacuum that these feelings produce had to be filled with meaningful things another unique theory came from the american existentialist psychologist rollo may 1909 1994 he argued that depression is the inability to construct a future and that a person suffering from it fails to look ahead in time properly such a feeling is commonly connected with a sense of insignificance and a lack of meaning in the world rollo may unknown author public domain humanist psychologists argued that depression stems from a gap between the pressures and standards of society and the individual s natural need to reach its full potential sadly modern times placed all too high standards in society and ordinary people often in their formative years find themselves unable to reach these impossible standards feelings of self pity worthlessness and lack of meaning all result from this in a sense society is partially to blame for high rates of depression in the 1950s albert ellis claimed that depression originated in irrational shoulds and musts impossible standards and needs from society this he stated led to unneeded self pity and self blame always a brighter tomorrow thankfully modern medicine and modern science have a good foothold in the battle against depression those who seek aid can win the fight against depression especially in the developed parts of the world medicine therapy and a change of lifestyle are major remedies in this fight still sadly a lot of depressed people from impoverished corners of the world are faced with discrimination abuse and lack of help depression claims many lives each year in the fight against this it must be remembered that depression is a state of mind that can be overpowered and dealt with looking back onto history and understanding the affliction that grips us we can work to overcome it for as we all know tomorrow is a brand new day top

by arno schuetze abhinav ramnarayan and toby sterling frankfurt reuters european stock market listings have come back with a bang after the summer lull but blank cheque firms are nowhere to be seen so far this quarter 42 initial public offerings ipos in europe have raised 8 5 billion the highest amount for a decade but there hasn t been special purpose acquisition company spac deal since july according to refinitiv data the spac frenzy in the united states during 2020 and the first half of 2021 was widely tipped to spill over to europe but despite a flurry of activity before the holiday season the market appears to have fizzled out the spac ipo market is almost dead said german entrepreneur christoph gerlinger who considered setting up a spac but has shelved those plans to focus on his job as a private equity manager investing in technology firms a spac is a blank cheque firm that raises funds in an ipo with the aim of merging with a private company once that happens the target becomes a listed stock sidestepping the traditional ipo route which is heavily regulated spacs became one of wall street s hottest investment trends last year as many retail investors stuck at home during covid 19 lockdowns placed speculative bets on them in europe so far this year spac issuance peaked in the second quarter with 15 deals raising 3 7 billion followed by seven more in july worth 1 4 billion but there have not been any since the refinitiv data showed overall 26 spacs have listed in europe this year raising 6 6 billion over the same period in the united states 433 new spacs have raised 118 billion the last time there were more european ipos in a third quarter was in 2007 with 99 deals and the amount raised was the highest since 2011 when ipo proceeds came in at 9 billion according to the refinitiv data as of sept 24 selective issues spacs offer companies such as technology firms with high growth potential but little near term visibility on revenue and profit an avenue to raise funds in a less onerous way than a full blown ipo they also offer profit opportunities for spac sponsors usually well known entrepreneurs as well as investors who get the chance to buy into private companies via the stock market rather than less liquid venture capital funds but spac sponsors and bankers say demand has dried up in the face of poor performance a regulatory crackdown in the united states and waning market sentiment the european union s markets watchdog also warned in july that spacs might not be for everyone due to risks of dilution conflicts of interests and uncertainty as to the identification and evaluation of the target company i only expect selective new issues of quality spacs coming to market said christoph stanger co head of equity capital markets in emea at u s investment bank goldman sachs in the third quarter globally only 85 spacs listed raising 14 billion down from 309 spacs raising 95 billion in the first quarter according to the refinitiv data while some investors in u s listed shell companies made fortunes overnight when the shares surged many who held onto their investments are nursing losses when an investor can buy an existing spac at a discount to list price it s less attractive to buy a new spac said one equity capital markets banker hometogo debut in europe shares in the first company to be created via a spac merger this year started trading last week but with a whimper rather than a bang german travel tech startup hometogo the target of lakestar spac i backed into the frankfurt stock market on sept 22 by completing its union with the listed shell company hometogo s shares edged higher on the day but were still 10 lower than the price lakestar listed in february and 33 below the peak the shell company s shares hit that month european companies such as air taxi startup lilium car seller cazoo payments firm paysafe and global blue electric vehicle charging firm evgo and cyber security company arqit have all successfully gone public in the united states via spac deals but most are below their spac issue price with a few notable exceptions such as arqit globally about 60 of spacs that have bought their target company are now trading below their issue price analysts say there was a different mood in the spring when the buoyant u s market triggered the start of a european spac wave tikehau capital backed pegasus europe raised 606 million in april followed by hedosophia european growth which raised 483 million both listing in amsterdam then the market started to cool as investors realised the hunt for targets was pushing up valuations making investments less attractive analysts said investors are currently unwilling to buy into new spacs while there are 423 spacs with 131 billion in raised capital out there waiting to find takeover targets entrepreneur gerlinger said here to stay german investor primepulse for example explored a spac deal this year and held some meetings with investors but has said it decided to drop the project due to waning demand many of the spac mergers that did get done also struggled in the final stretch as some shareholders opted to redeem their money rather than staying invested after the merger lilium for example had redemptions of 66 while it was 37 for hometogo that meant spac managers had to put more of their own money into deals forfeit lucrative compensation or abandon the mergers altogether and spacs that don t seal a merger within two years of their ipos have to return the money to investors rene van vlerken head of listing at euronext amsterdam which has attracted a number of europe s spac deals said the current weakness would eventually be overcome there are a lot of spacs in the market all looking for attractive business combinations the market is waiting for a number of good acquisitions by european spacs he said giacomo ciampolini head of emea alternative capital at citi also said the spac market would eventually rebound spacs have already started to arrive in europe combinations have been announced and closed and there are many sponsors companies and investors who recognise the merits of the instrument he

russian tortoise testudo horsfieldii a popular pet tortoise russian tortoises are one of the most readily available tortoise species they are small making them easy for most people with limited space to keep they are also feisty eager to eat and more active than some other tortoises when allowed to burrow russian tortoises also have one of the highest tolerances for temperature extremes they are one of the few species that can be kept outdoors in las vegas nev year round these factors make russian tortoises attractive for new tortoisekeepers and a fun tortoise for seasoned veterans russian tortoise availability most russian tortoises are imported into the united states compared to the number of imported tortoises captive production of this species is relatively low you should assume that most adult or subadult russian tortoises for sale are wild caught imported captive bred babies are rarely raised to adult size and sold at the low prices that these imported russian tortoises sell for advertisement photo credit tyler stewart russian tortoise hatchling advertisement russian tortoise size russian tortoise hatchlings measure about 1 inch in carapace length as they mature they reach a maximum length of 8 to 10 inches females are normally a little larger than males at full size when females are about 6 inches long they are large enough to begin producing eggs russian tortoises are almost always imported as young adults between 4 and 5 inches in carapace length these tortoises are large enough to handle subprime conditions during shipping but small enough to fit many in a fixed size shipping crate russian tortoises larger than about 6 inches long can be difficult to find russian tortoise life span russian tortoises can live more than 40 years raised on a lean high fiber diet captive raised animals in low stress environments have higher life expectancies russian tortoise caging the preferred method for raising russian tortoises is an outdoor enclosure in a warmer climate pens for one or two adults should be at least 2 feet by 4 feet enclosure walls should be set into the ground 6 to 12 inches to prevent the tortoises from digging under the sides and they should be 12 inches or higher aboveground russian tortoises are burrowers they tend to dig into corners and against objects placing large rocks under the soil in the corners helps prevent tortoises from digging out in higher or lower temperatures they attempt to go underground to insulate themselves from the extremes building russian tortoises underground hide boxes that maintain more stable temperatures helps to keep them from burrowing too much shaded grassy areas that get regular water help to keep smaller tortoises cool advertisement photo credit tyler stewart russian tortoises hatchling to adult advertisement russian tortoises are sure to try to eat any plant accessible to them in their pens they prefer wide leafed plants and weeds they really do not eat grass unless they are out of options check all plants in the enclosure to ensure they are safe russian tortoises housed indoors can be caged in large plastic bins stock tanks or small plastic pools one to two adults can be kept in an enclosure measuring at least 5 square feet with sidewalls 8 inches or higher more space is much better babies can get away with smaller housing tortoises kept in small enclosures become restless and spend much of the day trying to get out of the enclosures advertisement many different substrates can be used i prefer a combination of dirt or sand mixed with peat moss or fine coconut coir using only sand makes running around somewhat difficult for the tortoises their feet sink with every step mixing soils helps to solidify the foundation i also like to include a few large flat rocks in an indoor enclosure they help file down the tortoises nails and give them a clean surface for food russian tortoises also enjoy climbing so try to provide an enclosure that gives them that opportunity russian tortoise lighting and temperature russian tortoises living outdoors and allowed to dig burrows are very capable of taking care of themselves as far as temperatures are concerned i keep them outdoors in las vegas year round without additional heat sources winter lows are in the 20s degrees fahrenheit and summer highs near 120 degrees russian tortoises can handle high temperatures only if they can get underground where it s cooler keeping any tortoise on an outdoor patio or anything aboveground when it s over 100 degrees is too hot for them russian tortoises are most active when temperatures are between 60 and 90 degrees but they remain active during the cooler parts of the day in midsummer or they sleep underground in a burrow advertisement russian tortoises hibernate underground during the winter if they are allowed some time to dig a burrow before cold temperatures set in in las vegas my tortoises bed down at various times during the fall and come out of hibernation in mid february indoors russian tortoises can be maintained at normal room temperatures 68 to 80 degrees they should also have access to an area heated by an overhead light this spot should be in the 90 to 100 degree range like most diurnal herbivorous reptiles they need a uvb light in their indoor enclosures to help them properly process the calcium in their diets these tortoises can handle nighttime temperatures into the low 50s without a problem russian tortoises do not need to hibernate to be healthy so tortoises kept indoors and maintained at stable temperatures will never skip a beat while winter winds below outside keep lights on 12 to 14 hours a day and turn off all light and heat sources at night photo credit tyler stewart russian tortoises hibernate underground during the winter if they are allowed some time to dig a burrow before cold temperatures set in russian tortoise food russian tortoises are enthusiastic eaters and the destruction they wreak on the plants in most outdoor enclosures is proof of this they prefer broadleaf weeds and eagerly eat almost any leafy greens or vegetables offered to them we regularly use spring mixes which have several leafy ingredients in them we supplement with kale collared greens turnip greens and any of the darker lettuce types variety is the key and for their size these tortoises do some serious eating i plant many different types of safe leafy weeds in their outdoor enclosures in the spring dandelions are one of my favorite food sources for all tortoises it might also be useful to partition off parts of the enclosure to allow plants to recover and rotate the tortoises access to the separate areas we also plant grasses clovers and various other safe plants throughout the enclosure if given full access to all available space they will almost surely eat the plants down to nothing by midsummer photo credit tyler stewart russian tortoises should not be handled with any regularity it is best to leave them alone russian tortoise water russian tortoises can have small water dishes in their outdoor enclosures we use shallow low sided dishes that are glazed to make cleaning easy cleaning needs to be done on a regular basis as most tortoises tend to soak in their dishes and dirty them while they re in there i provide water bowls during the hottest parts of the year but i don t during cooler times tortoises living in areas with regular rainfall drink from puddles and leaves if they live in areas with prolonged dry periods such as las vegas offering them water helps to keep them hydrated when russian tortoises are housed indoors i prefer not to have standing water in the bowls because they tend to defecate in them while soaking in shallow water the tortoises usually begin drinking immediately and flush their systems at the same time they can be soaked outside the enclosure in shallow water once or twice a week for 15 to 30 minutes to get them fully hydrated babies and juveniles tend to dry out much quicker than larger more established tortoises because of this i briefly soak baby russian tortoises in shallow water up to three times a week for 10 to 15 minutes whether they re housed outdoors or indoors russian tortoise health for best results purchase an alert active russian tortoise with bright clean eyes or buy one from a reputable source that will guarantee at least a live arrival these tortoises can suffer from most common reptile health problems but parasites and respiratory infections are probably the most common although one of the more hardy tortoise species wild caught russian tortoises usually have internal parasites these parasites are not a huge burden on the animals in the wild but when tortoises are confined to a small area and they endure the additional stresses of importation the parasites can build up their numbers to levels potentially deadly to the tortoise taking a fresh fecal sample to a reptile veterinarian can get you some idea of the types of parasites present their numbers and the drugs needed to treat them russian tortoises can also be prone to respiratory infections if they are kept in cool or wet enclosures they need to be able to dry out particularly if temperatures are low russian tortoise handling and temperament contrary to what many sellers tell customers tortoises generally should not be handled with any regularity they are easily stressed when overhandled and children tend to drop them when spooked these stress factors can lead to a decline in a tortoise s activity levels and health adult russian tortoises are generally more resistant to handling but all tortoises should be handled carefully avoid pinning them down or restricting them allow them to carry on with their intended ways tyler

if you reject the food ignore the customs fear the religion and avoid the people you might better stay home james michener reality is harsh there are at least two sides to the caribbean tourism

the caribbean region was experiencing a tourism boom air arrivals to the wider caribbean region were up by 12 percent in the first quarter of 2019 the region s highest growth rate at that point on the calendar in years this includes i9 1 million international tourist arrivals to the region in the first three months of 2019 representing an increase of almost 970 000 visitors to the caribbean the region s cruise industry also saw growth with a jump of 9 9 percent in cruise passenger arrivals and a record total of 10 7 million arrivals in the period the united states remained the region s largest tourism source markets accounting for 4 5 million tourists in the period while canada sent 1 5 million visitors to the caribbean representing a 4 percent increase the caribbean island nations rely heavily on tourism for employment and it provides more than 90 percent of all jobs in antigua and barbuda in 2019 one in every 10 people in the caribbean worked in travel and tourism related occupations contributing 8 9 trillion approximately 10 3 percent to the global economy with the arrival of covid 19 the industry is hemorrhaging jobs and revenue with the worst yet to arrive the largest loss of tourism arrivals due to the pandemic include the bahamas 72 7 percent dominica 69 1 percent aruba 68 1 percent st lucia 68 5 percent and bermuda 61 7 percent cock eyed optimist or magical thinking even with the world told to quarantine not to travel and not to mix and mingle with others at bars and restaurants marketing efforts for the caribbean region continue to direct their efforts to motivating tourists to get on a plane or ship and head to the caribbean the public relations and advertising efforts remain ever faithful to portraying a fantasy land that offers no alternatives to eco tourism and keeps the dark sides of the island nations out of the mindset of the visitor many island destinations have state of the art airports with pina colada s welcoming each and every arrival ground transportation at the terminals quickly transport arrivals to their hotels with drivers trained in the art of chit chat the drivers talk sometimes incessantly with the intent of keeping passengers distracted from the poverty that surrounds the ports the animated and frequently interesting information from the drivers may include updated weather information the temperature of the sea and local history in many cases the drivers encourage visitors to talk about their hometowns the length of time it took them to arrive and what they plan to do during their holiday by the time the conversation has dwindled down to children and pets visitors are at their hotels entering the reception areas registered and delivered to their rooms and suites by attractive employees with sincere smiles and warm greetings between breakfast and dinner guests are entertained by island music local drinks and international gourmet dining options that in many instances keep them within the walls of the hotel for their entire holiday what lies beyond the palm trees is outside the interests wants and needs of the international visitor the fact that employees are paid minimum wages that increasing levels of crime have eroded confidence among investors and reduced international competitiveness by introducing much higher costs in the form of additional security or transactional costs is of no interest to these tourists the fact that crime is causing capital flight along with the loss of people with skills or education who are choosing to work in safer more secure locales is of no consequence to these guests and the hoteliers do their best to make sure that none of the harsh reality of the destination enters this dream like vacation experience another slice of life visitors willing to step outside the gated holiday communities and dialogue with local residents are likely to find that crime diverts limited resources away from health and education to security in many islands research suggests that citizens are currently more concerned with crime than they are with other issues such as unemployment healthcare and family abuse in 2019 the highest homicide rate was registered in venezuela with over 60 murders committed per 100 000 inhabitants statista com jamaica 2018 recorded a homicide rate of 47 homicide per 100 000 inhabitants with an uptick of 3 4 percent one year later 2019 osac gov which is three times higher than the average for latin america and the caribbean the international monetary fund imf cited crime as the number one impediment to economic growth and the government of jamaica found that corruption and the transnational crime it facilitates presents a grave threat to national security osac gov forbes magazine listed jamaica as the third most dangerous place for women travelers 2017 and business insider ranked the destination the 10th amongst the most dangerous places in the world 2018 the us department of state travel advisory assesses the bahamas at level 2 indicating that travelers should exercise increased caution due to crime incidents involving us citizens include rape sexual assault and robbery theft and armed robbery property crime purse snatching fraud and sexual assault remain the most common crimes perpetrated against tourists osac gov the caribbean waterways have seen an increase in us naval presence focusing on countering narcotics trafficking in semi submersible vessels and shipments of sanctioned fuel and goods from iran to venezuela although tourists enjoy caribbean activities that include sailing swimming and scuba diving the sea offers other more nefarious activities before the pandemic the cruise industry disgorged thousands of visitors introducing them to the illusion of prosperity most of the islands pay a per head fee to the cruise lines for each passenger who goes ashore cruise passengers do not care that the ships destroy the reefs and sea life and have a stranglehold on the discretionary dollars passengers spend in addition the cruise ships beloved by millions of global travelers delivered covid 19 to many destinations and local citizens at the beginning of 2020 because company executives were impotent when it was time to be pro active against the virus contagion to compound the problem many ships were stuck at sea with covid 19 patients onboard so passengers and crews were unable not permitted to disembark the pristine reefs of bonaire dutch make this island a popular port of call and cruise lines disgorge up to 4000 passengers at a time sometimes the ships have triggered food shortages by taking up dock space usually reserved for cargo groups like bonaire future forum opportunity from crises have debated whether the island should limit access to specific ships with more expensive itineraries and hence more selective in passenger profiles rebalance tourism if there is to be future for tourism in the caribbean region perhaps it will come by taking a pause in tourism growth with the time used to reevaluate the tourism product climate change species extinction deforestation child labor sexploitation and many other evils represent a wholesale failure of mass tourism the first steps require an honest appraisal of regional assets and a dedication to sustainability and local entrepreneurship mass tourism has been accompanied by significant dependence on foreign investment in development promotion and property management the industrial size tourist complexes have been unregulated and poorly planned resulting in growth besieged by volatility and vulnerability leading to in many instances financial crises the combination of bio physical threats such as volcanic eruptions and environmental changes leading to intense hurricanes and rises in sea levels combined with economic upheavals from severe global recessions lead to the current covid 19 health and economic crises the last few decades have put enormous pressures on the tourism industrial complex and there has been little time to review and consider lessons learned given the fact that tourism has become the most important economic asset of the region it is unfortunate that previous disasters appear to have been ignored however going forward they may provide the foundation for a sustainable future for the region to continue and prosper it must adjust to imminent competition and the changing demands of the global marketplace therefore it needs to recognize and prepare for a renewal revitalization and repositioning of its product as an industry it must acknowledge its vulnerability and volatilities and be willing to document and clarify the unique aspects of its assets and practices that differentiate one island from another and one culture from another while protecting the remaining assets from further destruction islands most noted for eco tourism include dominica known as the nature island of the caribbean where 65 percent of the land is tropical rainforest and more than 300 miles are dedicated to hiking trails bonaire is noted for its pristine marine environment while costa rica and belize are renown for being ecologically friendly resorts on these islands are low impact with commitments to reduced energy use or renewable energy with visitor activities encourage learning about and enjoying the local ecosystem running parallel to mass tourism the new eco tourism approach will focus on the quality of the tourism experience rather than on the quantity of tourists arriving by air or sea the quality experience will not be based on the dollars spent by the visitor but rather the richness of the moments that will be culturally sensitive focusing on the human side of the destination the control of the new tourism product will not be in the hands of bankers or foreign investors but rather regulated and directed by local entrepreneurs and their representatives the current focus on mass tourism and on creating a large revenue stream requires a constant increase in the numbers of tourists who are moved through the system with little or no concern for the quality of the tourist experience or the benefits that could accrue to the local service providers in addition the profits from mass tourism leak out of the country ending in foreign banks and shareholder pockets woke visitors the new niche markets will encourage visitors with a woke consciousness who are happy in supporting local entrepreneurs and their communities these new visitors will do their best to minizine their footprint in the destination as their interests and desires are to slow their pace seeking rest recuperation wellness and learning these travelers prefer to be viewed as gusets and not as consumers with credit cards bank accounts and stock portfolios accommodations and attractions will feature remote locations that are handicap accessible and designed for spaces overlooked as prime locations for mass tourism development the new entrepreneurial tourism product will emphasize the personal touch currently absent from assembly line tourism where people places and attractions are treated as commodities eco tourism will focus on a bionetwork with an emphasis on conviviality sense of place and the human touch new ecology based tourism experiences will feature local assets fishing scuba diving snorkeling bird watching marine turtle watching and preservation and caribbean style leisure activities including sailing kayaking walking swimming hiking plus cooking and crafts taught by local artists and chefs new all inclusive culinary menus will re establish dining options that have been lost as mega hotels and restaurants moved from local food groups to international cuisine locally trained chefs using food from nearby farms will encourage a new appreciation for the culture and customs of each island nation meals evening meetings communal parties musical and cultural events all the way through to shopping for arts and crafts from residents will feature what is available through entrepreneurs and shared with friends and family creating a new definition of all inclusive old businesses will be revived from raising chickens and cattle to agriculture and agri processing plants marketing ecotourism marketing will focus on experiences that are nature based some studies have found that many tourists 83 percent like the idea of being green and protecting the environment green washing the lets pretend concept of ecotourism is not what ecotourism is about one of the concepts of green washing is a deceptive form of marketing as the vendors and their consultants promote places that are not protected by environmental norms or regulations or eco trips that have environment friendliness in name only tourists visit a destination return home believing they have helped the environment and they have not such programs and procedures must be identified and removed or changed it is no longer acceptable to dupe the unsuspecting tourist the new ecotourism opportunities can be marketed globally at a budget level because of new technology that makes e marketing available to entrepreneurs with small bank accounts but large skill sets and a clear vision businesses will be promoted through entrepreneurial designed websites offering personalized holiday itineraries and experiences not tours designed by global tour operators individualized experiences will be directed by local historians and community leaders who are able to provide this unique niche for alternative holiday opportunities government oversight and political support from government agencies will ensure that the stakeholder s entrepreneurial rights are honored and will prevent foreign or outsider takeovers centrally supported public private partnerships will enable a competitive environment of quality offerings that are sustainable alternatives to mass tourism government leaders will direct revenues to the conservation and management of natural and protected areas recognize the need for regional tourism zoning and visitor management plans that are slated to be eco destinations prioritize the use of environmental and social baselines studies and monitor long term programs in order to assess and minimize impact ensure that tourism development does not exceed the social and environmental

september 2021 by kenneth d ward for much of its early history the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw was a little known international organization quietly verifying the destruction of cold war era stockpiles as required by the chemical weapons convention cwc today the opcw is the epicenter of a global chemical weapons crisis and a front line in a broader confrontation between the west and russia when the cwc entered into force in 1997 it seemed that all that remained to achieve a world free of chemical weapons was to verifiably destroy declared stockpiles and universalize membership instead the international norm against chemical weapons use is under siege most prominently by syria and russia two states parties to that very treaty the world is now precariously perched on the knife s edge of a new era of chemical weapons use once the chemical weapons crisis erupted in syria the opcw was forced to make a historic transformation moving from being solely a standard arms control monitoring body to becoming an indispensable instrument of international peace and security as recognized when the organization was awarded the 2013 nobel peace prize this new role must be strengthened to address the chemical weapons threat that has metastasized globally as a result of recent chemical weapons use in the united kingdom russia iraq and malaysia ghouta the ieper of the 21st century the hope that chemical weapons use had been consigned to the 20th century was shattered on august 21 2013 when the syrian military launched a barrage of rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin against the opposition controlled town of ghouta a suburb of damascus soon afterward a un investigation team confirmed the worst 1 400 people were killed from exposure to sarin the images of the ghouta victims were seared into the collective conscience of humanity alongside ieper the site of the first major use of chemical weapons in world war i and halabja where iraqi president saddam hussein in 1988 perpetrated a devastating nerve agent attack against the kurds as the world reeled in horror from the ghouta attack western powers considered military intervention to deter further carnage but when u s secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov met in geneva to discuss the crisis on september 14 they achieved a diplomatic breakthrough known as the joint framework for the elimination of syrian chemical weapons the united states and russia found common ground on only one point namely that the syrian chemical weapons stockpile needed to be removed and destroyed to this end russia tacitly assumed responsibility as the guarantor ensuring that its syrian ally would not use chemical weapons and would fully declare its chemical weapons stockpile so it could be destroyed under international oversight syria initiated the process to formally join the cwc just 24 days after the ghouta attack during that brief period the assad regime certainly had not undergone a moral conversion but rather bowed to pressure from the western powers and russia by the end of september 2013 the international community had legally anchored the u s russian joint framework in a decision of the opcw executive council and in a un security council resolution which included measures to address any syrian failure to comply with the resolution s provisions or with the prohibitions of the cwc false declaration and chemical weapons attacks in the spring of 2014 while syria s declared chemical weapons stocks were being removed from its territory for destruction the first signs appeared that damascus did not intend to comply fully with its commitments under the cwc and the un resolution the unraveling of the historic joint framework had begun widespread reports emerged of chemical weapons attacks involving chlorine gas barrel bombs dropped by helicopters on opposition controlled towns resulting in injuries and fatalities the claims prompted the opcw director general to establish a fact finding mission which later determined that chlorine had been used as a weapon in syria repeatedly and systematically from april to august 2014 during that same period there were indications that syria had not fully disclosed its chemical weapons program in its october 2013 declaration to the opcw the opcw technical secretariat after a detailed examination of the declaration and site visits in syria identified troubling discrepancies prompting the organization s director general to establish a dedicated group the declaration assessment team to continue engagement with syrian authorities until the declaration could be fully verified as accurate and complete to date that group has conducted more than 20 rounds of consultations with syria yet 19 issues still remain unresolved renewed concern over chemical weapons use in syria prompted the adoption of another un resolution in which the security council unanimously established the opcw un joint investigative mechanism jim since the fact finding mission mandate was limited to determining only whether chemical weapons use occurred in syria the jim was established as a panel of experts charged with identifying those individuals groups or governments involved in their use in the fall of 2016 the jim reported its findings concluding that the syrian military had been involved in the use of toxic chemicals chlorine gas as weapons in three attacks in 2014 and 2015 although moscow refused to accept the jim findings that its syrian ally was using chemical weapons in violation of the cwc and the security council resolution it begrudgingly agreed in november 2016 to renew the jim s mandate for another year and endorsed a new panel of experts to lead the effort within months the jim would become seized with the most devastating chemical weapons attack since ghouta on april 4 2017 the assad regime launched a sarin nerve agent attack against the opposition controlled town of khan shaykhun damascus and moscow quickly flooded the media with disinformation and outright fabrications claiming the opposition itself had launched the attack to falsely accuse the assad regime to deter further chemical weapons use the united states launched cruise missiles against the syrian airfield where the attacking aircraft originated despite russian and syrian efforts to bury the truth of what happened in khan shaykhun the jim determined that the syrian military had used sarin in the attack it was evident at the united nations and the opcw however that russia would seek to block any international action against its syrian ally no matter how damning the evidence indeed it was in direct reaction to the jim s competence that russia vetoed three renewal resolutions at the un and the jim ended in november 2017 deepening chemical weapons crisis two chemical weapons attacks in the spring of 2018 escalated the threat to the international norm against the use of chemical weapons in march former russian spy sergei skripal now a uk citizen living in salisbury and his daughter were poisoned by a novichok nerve agent known to have been developed by the soviet union the uk blamed russia for the assassination attempt underscoring the terrible risk the use of a such a nerve agent had posed to the local community indeed a resident of the adjacent town of amesbury later died the uk requested a technical assistance visit by opcw experts who confirmed that a nerve agent was used in the attack on april 18 2018 the opcw executive council met to address the experts findings in the wake of the expulsion of russian diplomats by the uk the united states and others the meeting immediately escalated into high politics with russia unleashing absurd counteraccusations and protesting that it was the victim of a western smear campaign before the day was over it was clear that a front line in a broader international confrontation had opened up and that in addition to the syrian crisis there was now an even more ominous russian problem russia was no longer just an enabler of syria s use of chemical weapons protecting it at the opcw and the un security council it was itself a perpetrator signaling to the world that it still illicitly possessed its own dangerous chemical weapons agent moreover moscow now viewed the opcw technical secretariat as an adversary just a week earlier as reported by the dutch government agents from the russian military intelligence branch the gru were deported from the netherlands for attempting to conduct a cyberoperation against opcw headquarters in the hague from an adjacent hotel as the chemical weapons threat widened to the european continent the crisis in syria deepened on april 7 multiple chlorine filled barrel bombs were dropped on the damascus suburb of douma killing dozens of civilians again a highly charged special meeting of the opcw executive council was convened on april 16 just two days after joint military strikes against syrian government facilities by france the uk and united states russia and syria falsely claimed that the uk and the united states staged the douma chlorine attacks with the help of the white helmets an organization of volunteer first responders in syria that russia has tried to label as terrorists within weeks opcw fact finders went to douma to further its investigation which ultimately concluded that chlorine was used the opcw also faced a grim new reality extending beyond syrian and russian transgressions the islamic state group had used chemical weapons in syria and iraq moreover north korea although not a party to the cwc was advertising its chemical weapons capabilities by assassinating the stepbrother of leader kim jong un with vx nerve agent in a malaysian airport opcw response to widening chemical weapons use with increasing use of chemical weapons undermining the cwc seriously eroding the international norm and putting the world at risk of a new era of chemical weapons threats the opcw had to act or succumb to irrelevance deeply aggrieved by russia s use of chemical weapons on its territory and concerned with a worsening chemical weapons crisis the uk initiated a special session of cwc states parties to forge an international response after russia and syria tried unsuccessfully to block adoption of the agenda the fourth special session of the conference of cwc states parties on june 27 2018 with broad international support took unprecedented steps to address the crisis by adopting the historic decision titled addressing the threat from chemical weapons use most importantly the decision dealt with syria s continued possession and use of chemical weapons to remedy the termination of the jim the conference directed the opcw technical secretariat to put in place arrangements to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in syria director general fernando arias implemented that directive by establishing the investigation and identification team which in april 2020 found reasonable grounds to conclude that syria conducted three chemical weapons attacks against opposition controlled areas in march 2017 in response to these findings the conference of states parties in april 2021 suspended syria s voting rights at the opcw the decision further clarified the mandate of the opcw technical secretariat in the context of the cwc the director general if requested by a state party investigating a possible use of chemical weapons on its territory was expressly authorized to provide technical expertise to help identify the perpetrators of any chemical weapons attack the decision also authorized the release of opcw information to any entities established under the auspices of the un investigating chemical weapons use in syria this provision would aid the ongoing investigation efforts of two such entities 1 the international impartial and independent mechanism iiim established to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for committing war crimes in syria and 2 the independent international commission of inquiry on the syrian arab republic the fight for a future free of chemical weapons threats to the cwc and the international norm against the use of chemical weapons remain ominous and unabated as evidenced by russia s attempted assassination of opposition leader alexei navalny with a novichok nerve agent in august 2020 russia s contempt for and repeated violation of the convention are appallingly evident moscow has enabled and protected its syrian ally by relentlessly wielding its veto at the un security council opposing action by the opcw and engaging in a calculated global campaign of disinformation and distortion in two assassination attempts against opponents russia has advertised to the world that it illicitly maintains a chemical weapons program possesses novichok nerve agents and has no compunction about using such outlawed weapons against its adversaries there should be no expectation that russia s contempt for the convention will ebb in the foreseeable future indeed moscow s continued embrace of chemical weapons is not an isolated affront but rather part of a much larger challenge to the west the assad regime also remains a long term threat to the convention and the international norm against chemical weapons use it views chemical weapons as a vital tool of survival and as a strategic counterweight to israel there should be no expectation that syria will finally comply with its cwc obligations once the conflict there is over rather it should be expected that syria will seek to produce and deploy chemical weapons as long as the assad regime remains in power the fourth special session of the conference of cwc states parties in june 2018 began an effort to push back against these threats and avoid a return of the chemical weapons horrors of the 20th century this must continue and intensify as it will be a long term struggle the united states must accord high priority to defending the cwc and lead an international effort to hold perpetrators accountable in all relevant forums what would this entail chemical weapons use by north korea and the islamic state group are surely of concern but they are not parties to the treaty and thus not a primary factor in the current crisis which is largely a russian problem it is important to recognize that deterring moscow from possessing or using chemical weapons or enabling their use by others is a challenging task increased pressure through sanctions and initiatives at the opcw and un general assembly will continue to play a role just as importantly the united states and its allies must mount a diplomatic and public messaging campaign to counter russian disinformation and deprive moscow of any credibility or support this would include further isolating russia from the international community by encouraging key states in africa and asia that have been sitting on the sidelines to join efforts to condemn chemical weapons use by syria and russia to be clear the near term prospects for deterring further russian chemical weapons affronts are not favorable the russian chemical weapons problem is fundamentally rooted in moscow s broader confrontation with the west and it should be expected that any progress would ultimately be dependent on the broader political landscape in 2013 russia worked constructively with the united states to diplomatically address the syrian chemical weapons crisis in the years that followed however russia chose to abet rather than dissuade its syrian ally from chemical weapons use and then went beyond that by targeting the kremlin s own opponents for assassination with chemical agents prohibited by its treaty obligations all these premeditated decisions helped to precipitate the wider strained situation and are symptomatic of moscow s intractability justice and deterrence require that a diplomatic strategy to defend the convention also ensure personal accountability for those individuals who ordered enabled or carried out chemical weapons attacks much of the groundwork for such an effort has been laid but its promise may not be realized for years internationally two un established entities the iiim and the independent international commission of inquiry on the syrian arab republic are mandated to investigate violations of international law and have reported on incidents involving chemical weapons use france has spearheaded a multilateral initiative launching in january 2018 called the international partnership against impunity for the use of chemical weapons with the mission of gathering and sharing information to facilitate national and international prosecution of chemical weapons perpetrators currently 40 states and the european union are members the united states and its allies should intensify efforts to substantially expand support for the partnership although prosecutions could take years these cooperative efforts signal the international community s determination to ensure that those who use chemical weapons will someday face a reckoning and their victims will see justice done to successfully weather the assault on the convention and the norm diplomacy must be paired with concerted international investment in the opcw the technical secretariat must remain the calm eye of the political storm the convention does not endow the opcw with enforcement authority but it does provide the secretariat with the ability to assess the accuracy of state party declarations to investigate chemical weapons use and to provide technical assistance to states parties indeed in the syrian case the secretariat s reports underscored that objective analysis from an independent organization is the best antidote to false claims from the perpetrator of a chemical weapons attack it is essential that the technical secretariat remain fit for its mission in an increasingly challenging environment that will require annually increasing the budget to adjust for inflation for almost a decade the opcw budget has remained virtually unchanged at about 85 million meanwhile the international community has asked the organization to do more when inflation has left it with 25 percent less purchasing power than in 2009 states parties have responsibly provided the secretariat with many millions in voluntary contributions to fund syria related operations the 2016 removal of chemical weapons precursors from libya and other important initiatives yet such donations are not a reliable or sustainable way to maintain the organization s core activities and staffing the opcw is the best bargain in the international system and should be treated the same as the international atomic energy agency which in effect has been held to roughly zero real growth with an annual increase reflecting inflation keeping the technical secretariat highly capable and operationally agile will also require establishing a long term training program and a dedicated training directorate to ensure that the next generation of inspectors investigators laboratory technicians chemical weapons experts and analysts are fully trained and prepared to face future challenges given that the opcw is regularly detecting increasingly sophisticated hacking attempts another priority must be securing the organization s computer network the technical secretariat has initiated remedial measures to enhance security but a broader revamp of the computer network along with additional cybersecurity resources are needed these should be funded through the regular budget and voluntary contributions by states parties the final requirement is to ensure the opcw continues to be well led the director general should always be a highly skilled experienced diplomat with expertise in chemistry being optional since the beginning of the syrian chemical weapons crisis in 2013 the opcw has been ably led by successive directors general who have exemplified these attributes faithfully implementing the convention while deftly navigating the diplomatic landscape to paraphrase edmund burke all that is needed for the evil of chemical weapons to triumph is for responsible nations to acquiesce the cwc is a remarkable achievement in the progress of humanity and the international community must continue to fight for it or risk losing it the opcw is an indispensable partner in this fight with the broad support of its membership the organization has taken unprecedented action to expose all perpetrators countries groups and individuals who use chemical weapons more broadly the world must redouble its efforts to ensure chemical weapons remain reviled and those who use them are held accountable what was started with the signing of the convention must be finished finally turning the page on an ugly chapter in history

editor s note this is an ongoing series which runs each thursday morning titled the richland chronicles volume vi by author paul lintern it is set in the 1860s and tells the story of richland county through the eyes of young people this is the sixth in a series volume i is amelia changes her tune volume ii is isaac and wolf paw find their home volume iii is autumn keeps her secret volume iv is mr gamble starts a school volume v is jacob blows his horn march 13 1863 dear assistant i hope the grocery business is safe in your hands and that you have looked after my brother timothy enough to be sure he doesn t make the store go bust while i am away i long for the familiar hills of mansﬁeld its beautiful square and the friendly faces of neighbors for whom i have much affection in my absence we are still camped here in northern virginia waiting for our next assignment it is boring to be encamped for the winter but that will soon change we want to be able to take it to johnny reb and get this war over with so i can go back to important things such as coffee grounds and saltine crackers mother has been sending that new cereal that someone in holmes county invented they call it shredded wheat the boys here can t get enough of it especially if a friendly cow nearby has milk to offer anyway little cassie thank you again for helping at the store my mother sends many compliments of you my way we will soon be on the move i hope our letters will ﬁnd each other greet your parents for me and jacob i pray for the safety of your brothers nate philip and levi sincerely yours john i can t believe a captain writes to me and he s still just john that letter occupied a special place in her top dresser drawer cassie had always liked john costin from her ﬁrst memories of going with mama to the grocery store when john was helping his father stock shelves and collect food for orders he was always friendly taking extra time to make her and jacob smile he would sing a silly song make funny faces and sounds and when his father wasn t looking slip some licorice to them by the time the war started john and his brother timothy were running the store after their father died suddenly the twins took piano lessons from mrs cole upstairs and so every wednesday they stopped to pick up mama s order on their way home from the lesson john did not join the sherman brigade as papa and her brothers had he waited until the next year when the union army needed more volunteers and his grocery store was stable enough for him to go that is how he explained it to her anyway now he was somewhere to the east camping or whatever soldiers do for the winter cassie was helping tim costin three days a week after school and on saturdays if he needed it and mama did not have something for her to do she would measure things sort things clean things collect things deliver things and generally enjoy being in the same space in which john had been she loved just remembering him with what she did she wasn t in love with him he was twice her age for goodness sake not a crush or a puppy dog love like her brothers teased her of with people like sheldon she just loved him he was the nicest man she knew outside of her family mrs costin was nice too taking a special liking to cassie perhaps because she knew that cassie s brothers and father were gone too they would often talk while they sorted things together johnny seems to have more responsibility every time he writes to me now he is a captain so many men to look after i hope he is getting his rest she said one day in may i don t know if soldiers ever sleep even then they are camping cassie said always drilling digging marching cleaning i know she said then laughed the grocery store will be spotless once he returns at least he will have learned some useful skill in the army timothy said not even looking up from his ledger which occupied much of his time john always was the idea boy and tim made the ideas happen mrs costin said you mean ﬁxed his messes tim quipped and cassie looked at him to see if he were serious you are a good team you two mrs costin replied i don t think either of you on your own could have made this grocery store work after your father passed but together you have what it takes and now we are not together tim said it s that way for many people she replied just be thankful that god has protected him and us so well so far will you be needing me for anything else today cassie asked no dear we are all caught up thank you and grab some licorice on your way out i was hoping she d say that cassie headed out onto main street and immediately turned right onto third normally she would stop to examine new items in the stores nearby maybe walk up main street to the square to see what mr sturges had in his store but this day she wanted to get home and see if mama had any more news about nate coming home and to see if papa was back from a trip he had taken to wooster and canton and to see if sheldon were there by any chance since he and jacob were going to join a few boys at touby s run that thought alone made the walk seem much longer than the ﬁve blocks it was

menafn caribbean news global by earl bousquet former prime minister allen chastanet is tearing the new government of saint lucia to bits over its handling of the covid 19 crisis six weeks after taking office and simultaneously offering to help the new philip j pierre administration to better handle the grave national health crisis it inherited in a letter on the official letterhead of the office of the leader of the opposition dated september 22 2021 chastanet took new prime minister pierre and his entire administration to task regarding the current covid 19 crisis in saint lucia the letter cited the latest official covid 19 figures and accused pm pierre of not taking his own advice on science and evidence based decisions following are some excerpts from the four page letter of over 1 700 words government costs when our united workers party came into office in 2016 the cost to operate the country was approximately 103 million per month 43 million for wages and salaries 30 million for debt financing and 30 million for operating costs rent utilities consultancies etc and government s monthly revenue was approximately 85 million per month and government ran a deficit of approximately 20 million per month by 2019 the policies implemented in 2016 to address this fiscal imbalance had started to bear fruit the unemployment rate had dropped from 25 to 16 and the debt to gdp ratio was at 59 we had had three years of economic growth and foreign direct investments were showing promise with several projects on the verge of commencing the reduction of the value added tax vat rate combined with the application of a gas tax and increasing the airport tax helped government revenue to grow steadily peaking in 2019 to 105 million per month during this same period government used these new revenue streams to increase the allocations to education health security and infrastructure government targeted key expenses by critically reviewing operations in particular that of statutory agencies covid impact in early 2020 we started to feel the negative impact of covid both from a health perspective and an economic perspective by later that year it got progressively worse the policy we adopted then which was different to many other countries in the region was to co exist with covid even then we understood it was about lives and livelihoods and that we had to find the equilibrium between them that equilibrium was guided by the science and the resulting policies were evidenced based try as we may we could not prevent people from being infected by the virus but given the limited health infrastructure and the vulnerability of the population to the virus all we could do was to slow the infection rate to limit the number of people infected within our health system we had to make sure when people got infected especially those with underlying conditions that we would be able to take care of them avoiding what we saw transpire in italy england and new york where the number of cases taking place simultaneously overwhelmed the health system initiatives like using hotels as quarantine stations and isolation facilities helped reduce the infection rate we also came to understand that social activities house parties public functions funerals weddings and any mass crowd events combined with alcohol contributed significantly to increasing the infection rate hence curfews and limiting eliminating alcohol consumption were very effective we also learnt that businesses public offices and schools were very successful in imposing the necessary social protocols like social distancing wearing face masks and sanitizing in other words people were actually safer at work than staying home tourism manufacturing construction and our call centers all required unique protocols to stay open while keeping the population safe and preserving livelihoods we also understood the precarious economic situation we were in as a result of closing the economy for three weeks in april and reopening slowly until september government s revenue dropped from 110 million a month to 60 million and our costs increased from 100 million a month to 120 million a month the increase in cost was primarily due to the cost of the isolation facilities the operationalizing of okeu converting victoria hospital into a dedicated respiratory facility national security and importantly the redemption of government bonds catastrophic fallout a catastrophic fallout from covid 19 was the financial impact on many businesses and personal incomes which resulted in many companies institutions and individuals redeeming their bonds in 2020 the government had 700 million due and approximately 25 were redeemed the government had to pay close to 170 million in cash this left the government with a deficit of approximately 500 million entering the budget of 2020 21 this revenue shortfall was partially made up through the support of the cdb wb imf and eccb recognizing the fallout of covid all of these institutions moved unprecedentedly quickly to approve funds to help with budgetary support i was very proud of the team in finance and economic development for the incredible job that they did in the most difficult of times tasked with the efforts to extract ourselves from the eu blacklist juggling the sudden and drastic drop in revenue and increase in costs the introduction of a new finance act the arduous task of applying to multiple agencies for funds all while designing a social and economic stabilization and recovery plan this team was able to accomplish all of these tasks the government of saint lucia continued to meet all of its financial obligations specifically all wages and salaries all debt commitments including the bond redemptions government operating costs and the increased costs due to covid protocols the financial institutions provided approximately ec 300 million in very concessionary loans to the gosl the imf funds and wb funds could not be used for debt payments so they had to be allocated to other operating costs including costs associated with covid the remaining shortfall came from increasing the overdraft facility with eccb and the local regional banks and increasing our payables payables normally average 30 million and as you know they are now in excess of 100 million it means individuals and business who have provided goods and services to the government have not been paid or it has taken an excessive amount of time to be paid while we have had no choice this can only continue for a while before these entities will want to be paid in advance for any services while we were able to provide some income and food support it clearly was not enough a fact you will now have a greater appreciation for current crisis the current crisis is at a point where we will have to reintroduce some of these programs the question is where are the resources going to come from this reality will be made worse if the entire economy must be shut down again sir this problem will not resolve itself nor will it disappear any time soon this letter is not meant to dictate to you but to advise you that your government must act urgently and decisively before the health and economic systems totally collapse you cannot wait for the situation to get so overwhelming that we have no choices our covid 19 statistics continue to increase at an alarming rate more concerning is the high rate of deaths in part because people cannot access timely help unfortunately when you came into office many of the front liners were already exhausted and the current situation is only making it worse by now you must realize that you will have to adopt some of the same policies that have proven successful in the past we need to urgently slow down and temper the covid 19 infection rate to achieve this we must reduce public socializing to do so will require longer curfew hours and prohibiting alcohol sales and consumption it may also require the use of 758 759 zoning for a period of time to help the police enforce these protocols you have on many occasions commented on the poor and limited housing conditions and that is why using some of the hotels to facilitate isolation of positive cases would be useful but i do appreciate the extraordinary cost offering assistance if your government does not act now as i have alluded the country will very soon reach a point where it will shut itself down jeopardizing many more livelihoods to save lives finally we need to step up the campaign on vaccination we note the number of saint lucians getting vaccinated is far below the target and propose a broad community outreach programme where we bring the vaccine to the people and engage in a rigorous education campaign the opposition stands in solidarity with the people of saint lucia and we are willing to offer our assistance for the sake of our people and country you need to change course i fear that if you do not heed this advice it will be catastrophic coincidence while the ex prime minister s letter is dated september 22 it was released on saturday september 25 coincidentally the same day prime minister pierre was carded to deliver his maiden address to the united nations general assembly as saint lucia s new leader it pokes poor fun at prime minister pierre s insistence on the need to follow the science in covid matters but the facts and figures only now being revealed tell new stories in opposition not heard that way before the uniter workers party uwp was voted out of office the letter explains the last uwp government s covid strategy in ways the then prime minister didn t during his 16 months leading the national fight against covid 19 comparing the results of its 16 months without the delta variant yet detected with the new administration s six weeks facing its deadly effects triumphalism the letter also reveals a sense of partisan triumphalism over the worsening covid situation the type choiseul saltibus member of parliament bradely felix warned about when he told a uwp press conference last week that persons thinking that way need to have their heads examined coming at the end of a week during which so much was revealed and alleged about a controversial deal under his watch to purchase 100 000 covid 19 vaccines for saint lucia that were never delivered and with over 7 million still outstanding there was no offer of any explanation in the lengthy statement not word the letter also followed prime minister pierre s startling revelations in parliament about untold millions spent on the st jude hospital project but there was no reference to the purported vaccines scam the statement seems to suggest that the delta variant would not have been a factor had the uwp not lost the last general elections blaming everything that s gone wrong on something the new government either did or failed to do it explains why juggling finance and created economic problems was difficult during the pandemic but without accepting that the uwp administration led by chastanet bequeathed to its successors the accumulated effects of all those same financial blues the statement also totally ignores the fact that the new administration has embraced and entrusted the same health officials that served the previous one throughout its 16 months directing the war against covid from the command center flashing mirrors yet after completely dissing prime minister pierre and his administration in and out and top to bottom the letter offers the uwp s full support to cure a national sore that festered on its shift and under its watch anyone with the time can go through the statement and extract as many questions requiring answers as those it ignored but too anyone who s been around long enough will also know that this is just par for the proverbial partisan political course by any party humiliatingly rejected by the electorate and trying hard to look and sound attractive on its first post election outing on the same day the new prime minister would be delivering his maiden address at the united nations general assembly or what prime minister pierre would typically call flashing mirrors
the supply chain crisis that our supermarkets are facing is far worse than the mainstream media has been telling us the mainstream media keeps trying to put a happy face on the temporary shortages but an industry insider has let me know what is really going on behind the scenes this particular insider runs a grocery store in maine and he says that things are as bad as he has ever seen in fact he says that he has never seen anything close to what is happening now the email that he sent me the other day greatly alarmed me and i asked him if i could share it with all of you he gave me permission to do so as long as i didn t use his name i haven t received an email this startling in a long time as you read this email i think that you will quickly understand why i am saying that i m self employed for 25 years now independent iga affiliated grocery store in coastal maine supply issues are real my supplier has limited us on orders for about a month now limited the physical number of cases we can order their issue is was mainly the help crisis in their warehouse order pickers and truck drivers same story everywhere i know many of the items your reader commented about in this article are the same here very limited gatorade and gallon water is sketchy at best sometimes we get it sometimes we don t i ve not seen many supply issues in produce rather poor quality issues there much more than normal deli bakery yes lots of out of stocks and long term unavailable as my supplier likes to word it on the invoice in the center store dry grocery like others are saying tons of out of stocks meat supply is fair but pricing is extremely high shockingly high to me the middle class is slowly being destroyed with these prices hikes death by 1000 cuts of sorts i guess my frito lay delivery person tells me that he is getting 55 60 of what he s ordering my last nabisco order had 30 out of stocks over the years we always get 99 100 of what was ordered pepperidge farm cookies he tells me some weeks he s only getting half of what he orders these folks all work on commission if they don t or can t sell it to me they don t get paid or get paid less when we place our liquor order twice a week out of stocks there are running 30 most orders this commodity was always 99 5 to 100 fill rate over the years always it s frustrating as i said self employed 25 years and worked for kroger for 25 years before that so 50 51 years in this business never seen anything close to what is happening now add to that a far left governor and both houses here in maine democrat controlled i just know we are on the verge of another mask mandate and a lock down of sorts would not surprise me again as we move into the colder months as you ve seen i m sure maine is in the news with covid case surges so they say i come to work every day just holding my breath for what is next for our business and the 35 people i employ here in maine this industry insider is trying to order normal quantities but his suppliers are often unable to completely fulfill them as you can see from the email the shortages are widespread and this is the worst that they have been during the entire pandemic so far if there is something that you need to stock up on i would grab it if it is still on the shelves because pretty soon it may be completely gone on friday i went to the grocery store and they were out of several things that i wanted to purchase unfortunately we continue to get more confirmations that this is going to become the new normal for example according to bloomberg meat reserves in this country have plunged to dangerously low levels a u s report wednesday showed beef reserves down 7 7 from a year ago in august poultry supplies slumped 20 and pork bellies which are sliced into bacon dropped 44 to the lowest levels since 2017 in most cases supermarkets still have meat on the shelves but it is definitely a lot more expensive than it used to be and we are being told to brace ourselves for more price hikes in the months ahead of course other types of retailers are facing severe supply shocks as well a few days ago another reader sent me an email in which he described what he is seeing at his local pharmacy the big issue however is at the local drug store rite aid the place is thin at best and stripped in some areas last week there was no zinc available the beer cases are notably sparse the main issue however is at the pharmacy six or eight months ago you could walk in and have your prescription filled inside of 20 minutes if you called in the prescription the day before it was waiting for you not so any more yesterday i went to pick up an rx for my wife that had been called in last week not only was it not ready but i had to wait an hour before it was filled there were nine cars in the drive up queue i opted to walk in and it was nearly as bad the young woman that helped me was clearly not local with bicolor hair and a large glaringly obvious in your face baphomet symbol around her neck i had a chat with the manager on the way out and asked him what was up with the pharmacy staffing i hadn t seen the regular pharmacist for a few months he blamed it all on the city for not having any affordable housing lame and mentioned that albertson s pharmacy albertson s and ridley s were all very short on help true right now dozens and dozens of drugs are in short supply in fact the official fda drug shortage list has 149 entries on it right now that is the most that i have ever seen as shortages persist retailers are going to start implementing more limits last week we learned that costco has already started to pull the trigger costco on thursday said it was reinstating limits on purchases of toilet paper paper towels and bottled water they don t call it rationing but that is essentially what it is and we are also being told to expect significant price increases because supply chain issues are causing costs to go through the roof costco this week joined the long list of retailers sounding the alarm about escalating shipping prices and the accompanying supply chain issues the warehouse retailer which had a similar cautionary tone in may was joined by athletic wear giant nike and economic bellwethers fedex and general mills in discussing similar concerns the cost to ship containers overseas has soared in recent months getting a 40 foot container from shanghai to new york cost about 2 000 a year and a half ago just before the covid pandemic now it runs some 16 000 according to bank of america i have been warning that rampant inflation and shortages were coming for a long time but a lot of people didn t want to believe me at first if you were one of those doubters do you believe me now during the first half of this year many economic optimists assured us that the u s economy would be booming by this point but instead our economic infrastructure is being shaken on a very basic level and we are facing enormous price hikes and very painful shortages throughout the rest of this year and into next year events have begun to slide out of control and it certainly wouldn t take too much to push us into a full blown avalanche it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael snyder and my brand new book

continue to campaign for taper fed officials will fire intensively this week us debt may be at risk as central banks gradually end emergency stimulus policies in the wake of the epidemic us bond yields finally seem to have paved the way for a further upward breakthrough after months of struggling to break the upward shackles 10 year us bond yields last week broke through the top of the volatility range since mid july surpassing the 1 40 per cent mark and away from the low of 1 13 per cent set last month the 10 year yield rose a further 2 25 basis points to 1 457 on friday and portfolio repricing continues according to market data the fed decided earlier that week to start scaling back its massive bond purchases soon a move that could push interest rates higher next year the hawkish tendencies of the bank of england and the bank of norway that followed the tightening also cleared the way for a further rise in yields the meeting between the federal reserve and the bank of england fired the starting gun said jim vogel interest rate strategist at fhn financial the wave of liquidity from central banks around the world is weakening said gene tannuzzo a portfolio manager at columbia threadneedle several central banks are moving from bringing tailwinds to at least neutral to at least neutral and may even bring headwinds to markets for the foreseeable future now the 10 year treasury yield already has a bottom line and the yield is likely to rise to around 1 5 to 1 6 in the near future from a technical point of view the momentum index also supported yields further higher after 10 year treasury yields significantly broke through their 50 day moving average 1 29 per cent on friday jonathan krinsky chief market technician at bay crest partners expects the 10 year treasury yield to rise to 1 6 per cent with 10 year us treasury yields above 1 38 per cent and breaking the downward trend of the past six months it looks like a new trading band is forming he said some industry insiders say that if us bond yields continue to rise it could create local opportunities for weekly and small cap stocks and re inflationary trading is expected to prevail again however if bond yields rise too fast it may still have a negative impact on us stocks in the end and the experience of the first quarter of this year is a lesson if bond yields suddenly soar to much higher than expected levels equity valuations could fall sharply as higher long term bond yields reduce the present value of future profits fed officials will fire intensively this week looking ahead to this week the us bond market is likely to remain inseparable from the fed for the time being as fed officials will make intensive firing speeches this week after the end of the period of silence ahead of last week s fed decision predictably most of these officials are likely to campaign for the fed s announcement of qe cuts in november the following is a media list of speeches by fed officials this week all showing eastern australian time 2 hours earlier than beijing time among them federal reserve chairman powell will have a very busy schedule next week with two public events to attend first on tuesday powell will testify at a hearing before the u s senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs which will also be attended by u s treasury secretary yellen in addition powell will also participate in policy group discussions at the european central bank forum on wednesday speaking to reporters after a two day policy meeting on wednesday mr powell said the fed would start cutting back on its 120 billion a month bond purchases soon and would end by the middle of next year in fact several fed policymakers can t wait to say after last week s decision that they think the us economy is in a position to start withdrawing support paving the way for the fed s next big debate that is when to raise interest rates and what to do with its huge balance sheet cleveland fed chairman mestre and kansas city fed chairman george said on various occasions on friday that the economy had made substantial further progress in achieving the fed s job maximization and 2 per cent inflation target the remarks by the two hawkish policy makers shed light on some of the contours of the closed door debate at last week s fed policy meeting however most of the fed officials who first appeared on monday belonged to the dove camp including chicago fed chairman evans fed governor brainard and new york fed chairman william williams other concerns this week in terms of economic data the us market will also have a lot of bright spots this week including us durable goods orders on monday the final gdp in the second quarter on thursday and the personal consumption price index pce released on friday which is the fed s preferred indicator of inflation other noteworthy economic data include tuesday s house price index and consumer confidence index pending sales of existing homes on wednesday and initial jobless claims on thursday of course with the new fiscal year approaching in october on friday if congress fails to pass the expedient spending bill key branches of the federal government may be shut down from october 1st which is also expected to be a highlight of the us bond market this week house speaker nancy pelosi promised over the weekend that he would pass a 550 billion infrastructure bill this week and avoid a government shutdown while arranging intensive legislative work to ensure that president joe biden s economic agenda remains on track we will submit the bill for consideration tomorrow pelosi said on abc television on sunday but you know i will never submit a bill that does not have enough votes to a full vote in the house of representatives she added that she would not set an arbitrary date pelosi also said she still wants enough republicans to take some responsibility and join in raising the debt ceiling we want this to be a bipartisan bill pelosi said
