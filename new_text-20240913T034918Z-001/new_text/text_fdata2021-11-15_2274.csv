companies are struggling to hire seasonal workers as they head into the busy holiday season during one of the tightest labor markets in u s history the number of part time jobs has increased by 31 4 percent over the past four weeks according to data from global job search engine adzuna the rise coincides with the national retail federation s estimate that retailers will hire 500 000 to 665 000 seasonal workers compared to 486 000 last year in mid october amazon announced plans for 150 000 seasonal jobs this year other retailers are taking on tens of thousands of workers to help stock shelves serve customers and carry out holiday deliveries even as the number of jobs spikes potential workers aren t necessarily jumping at the chance to apply retailers have been struggling to fill positions this holiday season tina hawk senior vice president of human resources at goodhire told the epoch times the underlying reasons stem from overarching trends rippling through the economy there s an extremely tight labor shortage that continues to stifle retail in particular hawk said at the same time we re seeing businesses expect a return to pre pandemic levels of consumerism the national retail federation forecasts that holiday sales during november and december 2021 will surpass 2020 sales by 8 5 percent to 10 5 percent for a total ranging from 843 4 billion to 859 billion a further obstacle for retailers comes from the sheer number of jobs available rather than spending months searching for an opening potential employees have numerous options to compare workers are feeling more confident about the number of opportunities available and their ability to find another job meaning if they re unhappy they re now more likely to hand in their two weeks notice andrew hunter co founder of adzuna told the epoch times the pandemic s toll on the number of workers available has also played a role in the currently limited labor market some retired early during covid 19 due to a decision to live off their savings or a desire to stay safe and healthy by remaining at home still others who lost a job simply chose not to look for a different one another group where we ve seen high quit rates is women with young children who have been the hardest hit by pandemic related school closures hunter said even as places reopen households may not be resuming a life that mirrors their pre pandemic ways the cost of child care remains a blocker for many workers hunter added bonuses and incentives in their quest to have enough laborers to cover the expected holiday sales surge companies are getting increasingly creative large retailers are using every idea and incentive they can create to address the current and holiday labor shortages rick haughey a managing director at riveron a national business advisory firm told the epoch times some companies are offering sign on bonuses or referral bonuses macy s announced plans in september to hire approximately 76 000 full and part time employees for its macy s bloomingdale s and bluemercury stores call centers and distribution and fulfillment centers macy s also stated that current employees could be eligible to earn a bonus of up to 500 for each family member or friend they refer to join the retailer s team meanwhile amazon is offering sign on bonuses of up to 3 000 for seasonal workers kohl s which is hiring about 90 000 seasonal employees stated that new hires are eligible for up to a 400 bonus for working through the holiday season besides offering a monetary amount for signing on retailers are extending other benefits to encourage workers to stay these perks go beyond traditional features that were accepted in the past employee discounts are no longer cutting it hawk said while the biggest bonuses and incentives are offered for permanent staff temporary staff are still benefiting from increased salary options in the current market amazon s starting pay for seasonal workers is 18 an hour with an additional 3 per hour based on shifts in certain locations the benefits available at some retailers are tailored to fit the lifestyle many employees seek these days employees are going after much more than financial incentives alone showing it s not only about cash for the modern worker hunter said instead people want workplaces that fit better around the rest of their lives by offering a flexible working culture a good work life balance or benefits such as child care support or enhanced annual leave retailers who tune in to the priorities that have emerged through the pandemic may have an easier time keeping workers after dealing with the added stress from the pandemic and work life boundaries blurring many americans have realized the importance of their mental and emotional well being hunter said looking past the holidays retailers that offer benefits to support this mindset could have an easier time hiring and retaining a workforce in the long term many now value this more than monetary incentives like signing and holiday bonuses hunter said giving employees the opportunity to develop new skills and grow in their careers may trend in the coming year some retailers are offering employee benefits packages including tuition reimbursement and the opportunity to transition from seasonal to permanent jobs haughey said the option to start a job during the holiday season stay on with new and improved benefits and move up the career ladder may be the recipe that leads to filled positions at retailers around the country
dear earthtalk my husband thinks it s better for the planet to hand wash dishes in the sink but it seems to me using the dishwasher is more eco friendly can you settle this debate for us chris b bowie md hands down the dishwasher is the way to go not only from the standpoint of water waste and energy use but also to preserve your own sanity who needs to be scrubbing rinsing and drying dishes all day when an efficient machine can do the work modern dishwashers use much less water and energy than their forebears so you can clean up after your meals and snacks quickly and without guilt just by filling up the dishwasher and hitting the start button it s not surprising that many of us still think hand washing is better given that the dishwashers of yesteryear used 10 15 gallons of water per cycle but dishwashers sold today in the united states can only use a maximum of five gallons per cycle per the mandate of the u s department of energy and to qualify for one of the federal government s energystar labels identifying especially efficient appliances dishwashers must max out their water use at 3 5 gallons per cycle meanwhile handwashing the same number of dishes pots and pans as you can fit in the dishwasher typically consumes some 27 gallons of water according to a study by researchers at germany s university of bonn they also found that some people can handwash a load of dishes with as little as 8 7 gallons of water while others use as many as 116 gallons the average kitchen faucet has a flow rate of 2 2 gallons per minute meaning that you d only have two minutes to wash an entire dishwasher s worth of dishes to match a dishwasher s water efficiency reports savannah sher on bobvila com it would be nearly impossible to use less than five gallons of water to hand wash a full load of dishes and if you re going to use the dishwasher anyway save yourself even more hot water by skipping the sink pre rinse and just loading those dirty dishes right into the bottom rack scrape big chunks of leftover food into the trash but pre rinsing isn t necessary with modern dishwashers because they have sensors that adjust the wash cycle based on how dirty the dishes are says consumer reports perry santanachote in fact unnecessary pre rinsing can waste about 6 000 gallons of water per household per year these efficiency gains only apply to running your dishwasher when it s full rather than running the dishwasher with a half load wait until it fills up before hitting start some units have a rinse and hold feature that pre rinses what s in there so it s easier to clean when it does fill up later of course some items cutting boards silver flatware cast iron cookware non stick pans will still require handwashing but you can always try to minimize your use of them accordingly contacts a european comparison of cleaning dishes by hand www tempurl4 uni bonn de forschung haushaltstechnik publikationen eedal manualdishwashing ht1 dishwasher vs hand washing when to use each cleaning method www bobvila com articles dishwasher vs hand washing 9 tricks that save tons of water www nrdc org stories 9 tricks save tons water earthtalk is produced by roddy scheer doug moss for the 501 c 3 nonprofit earthtalk see more at emagazine com to donate visit earthtalk org send questions to
turkey is the mainstay of most thanksgiving meals but those preparing them for guests have a lot to consider here are some tips ideas and things to know ahead of turkey day how big of a turkey should you buy if you re going to a typical grocery store or a local producer you should consider about a pound per person said londa nwadike extension associate professor of food safety for both university of missouri and kansas state university if you want more leftovers 1 1 2 pounds of bird per person should work nwadike said if you re just using a turkey breast 3 4 pound per person should be enough she said thawing turkeys if you buy a turkey frozen there s thawing to consider the safest way to thaw it is in the refrigerator she said in the fridge that would require a day of thawing for every five pounds of turkey if one doesn t have that much time they can put the bird in cold water in the sink nwadike said that will require 30 minutes of thawing for each pound of turkey so a 14 pound turkey would thaw in seven hours using that method change the cold water every 30 minutes she said when using that method never thaw your turkey on the kitchen countertop she said more where you can go to get your thanksgiving dinner together in columbia even without the cooking on the kitchen counter the outer part of the turkey is at room temperature while it s frozen inside she said microorganisms love to grow at room temperature it could potentially make you sick and your guests a guide to giblets there may be giblets inside the bird take them out nwadike said she always throws them away but they could be used in gravy she shared her own embarrassing experience with giblets the first time she cooked a turkey she didn t check in the cavity for the giblets they were in plastic which melted inside the turkey as it cooked how to safely prep a turkey when preparing the turkey wash your hands before and after touching it she said you don t need to rinse your turkey the rinsing doesn t have any benefit and it could spread germs around the sink put it in an oven set to 325 or 350 degrees a 10 pound bird should take three hours to cook or 3 1 2 hours if you cook it with stuffing inside definitely use a thermometer checking the innermost part of the thigh or breast in the muscle part not touching the bone nwadike said it should be at least 165 degrees stuffing inside the turkey or separately outside i personally love stuffing inside the turkey nwadike said sometimes i see recommendations not to stuff inside make sure you stuff it loosely if it s inside the turkey make sure the stuffing in the turkey also reaches 165 degrees she said leftovers there are things to consider after the meal too you do want to make sure you remove the meat from the carcass she said it s better to get it done with after the meal put it into smaller containers for leftovers you want to make sure you cool down the meat to below 41 degrees within two hours of cooking leftovers can stay in the fridge for three or four days any longer put it in the freezer she said supply chain worries will there be turkeys when you shop for them everything else seems to be in short supply we ll have a plentiful supply said sheila regehr spokeswoman for gerbes we know based on feedback from our customers when we surveyed them in april 42 of our customers plan on celebrating with a larger family gathering than in 2020 the same is true for schnucks said spokesman paul simon we have a great stock he said we have more turkeys than in 2020 both recommended shopping early for a better selection of turkey sizes if buying a fresh bird get your order in as soon as possible simon said rmckinney columbiatribune com 573 815 1719
vancouver bc nov 12 2021 cnw northstar clean technologies tsxv roof is a clean technology company focused on the recovery and repurposing of single use asphalt shingles to produce liquid asphalt fibre and sands while diverting shingle waste from landfills the company has a fully constructed facility in delta bc in the commercialization phase with steady state production expected in early 2022 on november 9 2021 northstar announced the results of the independent carbon dioxide footprint life cycle assessment lca completed by burgess environmental ltd which concludes that the production of northstar s liquid asphalt will produce 60 less carbon emissions versus routing shingles to landfill and producing virgin asphalt the 2017 british columbia best practices methodology for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions was used to calculate emissions associated with fuel and electricity consumption the asphalt produced by the northstar process is green renewable circular asphalt with the lowest carbon intensity of any asphalt in north america key take aways from lca confirms roof s empower facility is a circular renewable industry solution with lower carbon dioxide emissions net estimated greenhouse gas ghg emission savings of 121 94 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per 1 tonne of feedstock through diverting shingles from landfills and replacing virgin production asphalt production from the empower facility through diverting shingles from landfills and replacing virgin production asphalt production from the empower facility net estimated carbon dioxide emission savings in the range of 1 500 000 kg to 3 000 000 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per year dependent on steady state production volume 12 million tons of asphalt shingles are sent to landfills annually in the united states equivalent to over 18m barrels of oil or one day of us oil production being dumped into landfills each year diverting a oily mountain of old shingles from landfills is a promising business plan but some green companies get dirty downstream in 2019 the new york times published an article about toxic old solar panels and batteries causing harm to people who scavenge recyclable materials by hand in poor african communities reported forbes magazine the independent lca report just got northstar over that hurdle northstar s bitumen extraction and separation technology best uses a proprietary process to separate the liquid asphalt fiber and aggregate sands from discarded or defective asphalt roofing shingles destined for landfill demand for asphalt binder in north america is currently highest for interstate highways and roofing states an october 2021 liquid asphalt research report prepared by kin communications shingles made from asphalt serve one purpose which is to be used for the roofing of structures because these shingles are petroleum based they are not eco friendly and their production wastes energy in addition to exacerbating the emission of greenhouse gases continues the research report the lca analysis quantifies how our operations can support our customers and industry partners in delivering circular and green renewable asphalt produced with significantly lower carbon intensity stated aidan mills ceo of northstar empower facility s carbon dioxide emissions 77 21 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent produced per 1 tonne of feedstock virgin production and landfill disposal carbon dioxide emissions 44 09 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent produced from 1 tonne of feedstock routed to landfills 155 06 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent produced from 1 tonne of virgin asphalt including transportation to the vancouver market 1 market 1 a combined total of 199 15 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per 1 tonne of feedstock net savings 121 94 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per 1 tonne of feedstock the global context for reducing industry carbon footprints is forcing companies to identify alternative renewable avenues continued mills with the reduced carbon footprint solution for repurposing asphalt shingles we believe we can support our customers and industry partners on their sustainability journey as well as the carbon dioxide net savings the lca report calculates that the empower facility will 1 reduce water consumption by 650 litres per tonne of asphalt processed 2 reduce land disturbance by 0 44m2 per tonne of asphalt processed depending on the regulatory and legislative framework carbon dioxide emissions benefits may allow northstar to potentially generate future revenue and margins from carbon credit sales stated roof in british columbia carbon credits are valued at about 50 tonne a carbon credit is a kind of permit that represents 1 ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere explains nbc news they can be purchased by an individual or more commonly a company to make up for carbon dioxide emissions that come from industrial production roof s business model anticipates four revenue streams 1 tipping fees paid by waste haulers and roofing contractors 2 sale of asphalt 3 sale of fiber and 4 sale of aggregate the sale of carbon credits would add a 5th revenue stream for roof shareholders the most significant knock on effect of the life cycle assessment report is likely not the value of the carbon credits but the confirmed eligibility of roof s technology for government funding roof s facility is modular and can be duplicated in other locations when the company expands operations governments can be valuable partners reducing the need for dilutive financing on july 27 2021 northstar announced that it has engaged wellington dupont public affairs to lead government engagement on the reduction of single use asphalt shingle disposal into landfills across canada wellington will support federal provincial and municipal engagement on the execution of the northstar s expansion plans across north america in addition to evaluating various potential non dilutive funding strategies including government grants to support expansion plans stated northstar the retail price of asphalt cement per tonne as of august 2021 is cad 891 00 according to the ontario asphalt pavement council this represents a 44 increase year to date reports the kin communication report we now know our production process can deliver a meaningful difference to our climate by reducing carbon dioxide emissions in both degradation of asphalt shingle tiles in landfills and virgin asphalt production stated mills following publication of the independent carbon dioxide footprint life cycle assessment lca the first step on the journey towards carbon neutrality is to quantify corporate emissions accurately and the lca quantifies exactly that concluded mills full

cast your mind back to the summer and you might recall we ran a story on a pristine 1995 toyota supra that sold for what we then called an absurd 201 000 well that car could soon be reclassified as a bargain if one illinois dealership gets its way and persuades somebody to part with 299 800 for this one a 1993 sport roof car with the removable top but no rear spoiler it looks stunning in its anthracite paint and its 321 hp 2jz turbocharged straight six is mated to the hugely desirable six speed manual transmission the 9 638 miles 15 511 km on the odometer means it s seen a little more action than the 201k car which had only covered 6 571 miles 10 575 km and has one previous owner whereas the red car had zero previous registered owners but that mileage still ranks as an extremely low and it can be one of only a handful of mkiv supras around with less than 10k miles which is obviously why the seller diamond motor works of lisle illinois thinks it can afford to get punchy with the price tag to my mind this supra s color makes it more desirable than the red one but i reckon the higher miles would more than offset that but that s just my opinion related what if the mk4 toyota supra was based on the bmw m coupe here s another one i m guessing the dealer isn t really expecting to get 300k for the car and has just stuck a crazy number on the advert to generate some publicity and since i m writing about it and you re reading it it s clearly worked incidentally the shop looks like it has a bunch of other very interesting cars in stock including at least two more mkiv supras so is this mkiv supra really worth nearly a third of a million dollars well something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it and if someone feels happy to part with 300 000 for this one then we guess it is worth it to the buyer at least but don t forget that even paul walker s orange the fast and the furious supra only sold for 550 000 we can t help wondering what that buyer will do with it when they do get the keys you wouldn t tune this car and with the mileage so close to 10 000 you probably couldn t even use it much either for fear of the odometer rolling over into five figures and damaging your investment but it would be a real shame for such a great car to spend the rest of life caged up in a garage what do you think is any mkiv supra worth 300k
tokyo japan toshiba corporation announced on november 12 that it will divide its business into three entities a conciliatory move aimed at placating shareholders seeking a major revamp of the company following several scandals an uncommon step in a nation where corporations reign supreme news of the tokyo headquartered company being divided came to light within days of american manufacturer general electric declaring it was dividing itself while johnson and johnson also made an announcement of a split established in 1875 toshiba has given its approval to joining its infrastructure and energy units into a single business with its hard disk drives and semiconductor devices used in power electronics forming a second company the third unit will be tasked with the management of toshiba corporation s share in kioxia holdings as well as other assets the idea of splitting the company up which originated following a calculated evaluation spanning a period of five months following an exceedingly detrimental and scandalous corporate governance incident in which the company was found to have colluded with the government to suppress the interests of foreign investors nevertheless this division contradicts demands from some shareholders for taking the problem ridden firm private still some major shareholders believe that this plan might have difficulties receiving approval at the march shareholders meeting the revamp announcement came following the closing of japanese markets though a four percent fall in toshiba shares was recorded on the frankfurt stock exchange at opening on november 12 thereby indicating dissatisfaction among investors after much discussion we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option toshiba president satoshi tsunakawa stated at a press conference
review and preview inflation in the u s hit a three decade high in october delivering widespread and sizable price increases to households due to persistent supply shortages and strong consumer demand gwenn guilford inflation rate of 6 2 marks a 31 year high wall street journal november 11 2021 joe biden s next political nightmare is inflation a force that can destroy family budgets and political careers and is being driven by domestic and global factors tough for a president to quickly fix stephen collinson why inflation is a political nightmare for biden www cnn com november 11 2021 the higher inflation numbers weren t so positive for stock prices last week but they were very good for gold and silver prices most world stock indices posted new cycle and even all time highs late the prior week or early last week then pulled back by the customary 3 5 trading days to a low in the middle of last week there were some notable exceptions as in the case of germany s dax index which just rose to a new all time high on friday november 12 and the shanghai stock composite sse which fell to its lowest level since august 23 late last week and then began to rally again cryptocurrencies were stellar performers into the middle of last week as both bitcoin and ethereum posted new all time highs however on the same day they made new highs they also had one of those very large selloffs again yet the most bizarre market behavior was in the stable currencies and precious metals normally when the euro falls and u s dollar rises gold and silver fall but we are in the middle of some serious uranus aspecting activity in the cosmos right now and with uranus rules don t apply the euro plunged to its lowest level since july 2020 but at the same time gold soared to its highest level in nearly five months y all can thank me now for discovering the mars in scorpio correlation to big rallies in gold as described in detail in both the subscriptions reports monthly weekly and daily and the last webinar of september 3 correctly outlining the period to buy a low in the last two weeks of october for a big rally into november december and i will take your thanks because we all know that an analyst is only as good as their last call and this was a great one especially given that the dollar was also rising just one week ago on november 3 gold was trading at 1758 testing its low of 1750 1760 of october 6 and 18 on friday november 12 it was up to 1871 i should retire right now but the trade is still on and i might still break the bank then i can retire just kidding i can t retire i am a sun moon in capricorn with mars there too if i retire i will turn into a stone or worse a potato i would not be happy not that a stellium in capricorn could ever really really be happy well maybe if he had a venus jupiter conjunction in scorpio in the second house which fortunately i also have but enough about me let s talk about joe biden short term geocosmics and longer term thoughts first however let s quickly review the cosmic situation for next week it s very active and it ends the powerful sun mars t square to the saturn uranus square of november 4 17 it ends with the earth shaking mars in opposition to uranus on november 17 however there might be some aftershocks with the full moon of november 19 this is all in the last four degrees of scorpio where the stinger of the scorpion is located living here in arizona i know all about the stinger of scorpions you ve got to keep your eyes on the ground now because you don t want to step on one of those creatures and get stung if you know what i mean just ask anyone who is trying to progress along in life joe biden s birthday will also take place then he was born on the day of the stinger november 20 but then the sun leaves scorpio on november 22 and enters the sign of santa claus sagittarius typically a time of the year when goodwill and charity abound and stock markets rally in joy so do retailers who make most of their money at this time of the year now let s return to the economic and by extension political news of the day the 31 year highs in inflation reported last week bring back memories of the jimmy carter era you remember president carter and our comments in columns stretching back prior to the 2020 election that joe biden his policies and performance would likely be the reincarnation of jimmy carter this was based on the fact that carter was elected president under the last passage of the 45 year saturn uranus waning square cycle nobody thought so at the time but then again not many pay attention to the correlation of long term planetary cycles and the cycles of economics and politics carter bungled a plan to rescue american hostages in iran biden s military strategy to evacuate americans and supporters of america s military in afghanistan received a similar review even though biden himself called the evacuation an extraordinary success under carter the u s economy started out strong with record economic advances it didn t take long however before the u s embarked upon a huge inflationary spiral and the economy sank into a period of stagflation and low growth for several years and into the remainder of his term biden also started out with a strong record breaking economy but now it is overseeing another inflationary spiral that appears to be spinning out of control the economy is still strong but biden has only been in office 10 months he has plenty of time to right the ship with effective new economic strategies or sink it with jupiter about to return to the water sign of pisces december 29 2021 may 16 2022 where it will join neptune god of the seas it may be time to invest in life jackets jupiter and neptune in pisces point to the danger of drowning both literally and figuratively once the tide of inflation starts coming in with jupiter in pisces it can quickly swell to a tidal wave maybe it becomes a tsunami with jupiter things can expand much greater than anyone projected with neptune and pisces involved boundaries and controls get lost and solutions become based more on hope and faith than science and reality the good news is that the fears and hysteria associated with jupiter in pisces are not long lasting they end by the middle of may the not so good news is that jupiter then moves into aries which can be a whole lot of fun but can also be a whole lot of anger combativeness and blame directed at those in leadership while the ship was headed for the iceberg fortunately due to global warming the iceberg probably will have melted before the ship got there and the leadership will probably take credit for rescuing the vessel before the inevitable collision that wasn t really going to happen it was all another make believe crisis blown way out of proportion the real danger down the road in the latter half of this decade is still deflation well that does it for this week i can t promise there will be a column

late breaking presentation at american heart association annual meeting of landmark phase 3 trial of rexlemestrocel l in chronic heart failure tweet trial results highlighted reduction in cardiovascular mortality heart attacks and strokes with greatest effect seen in setting of inflammation new york nov 14 2021 globe newswire mesoblast limited nasdaq meso asx msb global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases today announced that results from the randomized controlled phase 3 trial of rexlemestrocel l in 565 patients with new york heart association nyha class ii and class iii chronic heart failure chf with reduced ejection fraction hfref were presented as a late breaking presentation at the american heart association aha annual scientific sessions during a featured program titled building on the foundations of treatment advances in heart failure therapy the trial s co principal investigator dr emerson perin medical director of texas heart institute and clinical professor baylor college of medicine presented new results from the landmark study showing a significant relationship between presence of systemic inflammation as quantified by high sensitivity c reactive protein hs crp and treatment benefit with rexlemestrocel l on risk of cardiovascular mortality heart attacks or strokes in a release by the american heart association dr perin said cell therapy has the potential to change how we treat heart failure this study addresses the inflammatory aspects of heart failure which go mostly untreated despite significant pharmaceutical and device therapy development key findings of pre specified outcomes were a single dose of rexlemestrocel l on top of standard of care reduced the incidence of heart attacks or strokes by 65 across all 537 nyha class ii or class iii treated patients compared with standard of care alone p 0 001 1 across 301 nyha class ii and class iii treated patients with high levels of inflammation hs crp 2mg l rexlemestrocel l reduced the incidence of heart attacks or strokes by 79 compared with standard of care alone p 0 001 1 in nyha class ii patients with high levels of inflammation hs crp 2mg l a single dose of rexlemestrocel l reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death by 80 compared with standard of care alone p 0 005 1 compared with standard of care alone a single dose of rexlemestrocel l on top of standard of care reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death heart attacks or strokes by 33 across all 537 nyha class ii or class iii patients p 0 02 1 and by 45 in the 301 patients with high levels of inflammation hs crp 2mg l p 0 012 1 and by 45 in the 301 patients with high levels of inflammation hs crp 2mg l p 0 012 compared with standard of care alone addition of rexlemestrocel l did not further reduce the frequency of hospitalization for worsening hf symptoms as previously reported in a release from texas heart institute president ceo dr joseph g rogers said that the texas heart institute prides itself upon consistently striving to uncover the next first in cardiovascular discovery and treatment whereas most traditional treatments address the congestion or fluid overload associated with heart failure rexlemestrocel l addresses the inflammation that is at the centre of advanced chronic heart failure widely regarded as the leading cause of death in the developed world the ability of rexlemestrocel l to significantly impact cardiac death heart attacks and strokes on top of maximal hfref therapy reflects the unique mechanisms of action of this allogeneic cellular therapy on reduction of inflammation and improved microvasculature the unchecked intra cardiac inflammation in hfref patients causes progressive loss of heart muscle replacement with scar tissue and death persistent inflammation in the blood circulation also results in accelerated atherosclerosis with plaque progression and instability resulting in plaque rupture and potential blockage of major arteries resulting in high rates of heart attacks and strokes in chronic hfref patients rexlemestrocel l reduces inflammatory cytokine production by immune cells generating improved local networks of blood vessels within the damaged heart and reducing risk of plaque rupture in major arteries the observed relationship between systemic inflammation and degree of benefit from treatment with rexlemestrocel l supports the importance of the anti inflammatory mechanism of action of rexlemestrocel l in addessing the high risk of mortality and morbidity in hfref patients in addition to dr perin the dream hf study co authors are drs barry greenberg md kenneth borow md timothy henry md farrell mendelsohn md les miller md elizabeth swiggum md eric adler md christopher james pa and silviu itescu md the study s findings have been submitted for publication about chronic heart failure heart failure affects approximately 6 5 million people in the us and 26 million people globally with increasing prevalence and incidence the mortality rate approaches 50 at 5 years as patients progress beyond nyha class ii disease in parallel with increasing intra cardiac and systemic inflammation 2 4 despite recent approvals of new therapies for hfref including sglt2 inhibitors that have reduced hospitalizations due to reversible volume related events nyha class ii iii hfref patients with inflammation remain at high risk for cardiac death heart attacks and strokes rexlemestrocel is being developed as an immunomodulatory therapy to address the high degree of intra cardiac and systemic inflammation in chronic heart failure in order to reduce the high rate of major cardiac events mace in these patients about the american heart association aha the american heart association is the us s oldest and largest voluntary organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke its scientific journals include circulation stroke and journal of the

washington the top white house economic adviser on sunday acknowledged the pain for americans of sharply rising consumer prices saying that president joe biden remains open to the possibility of tapping the u s strategic petroleum reserve to ease spiraling gasoline prices that motorists are paying at service stations there s no doubt inflation is high right now brian deese director of the national economic council told nbc s meet the press show it s affecting americans pocketbooks it s affecting their outlook u s consumer prices jumped at an annualized rate of 6 2 in october the biggest increase since 1990 the government s labor department reported last week higher energy and food prices have affected consumers the most with consumer spending accounting for 70 of the u s economy the world s biggest fuel costs for motorists are up sharply over the last year with motorists now paying 3 30 a gallon 3 8 liters 1 08 more than a year ago the highest average price since 2014 the cost of grocery bills has risen 5 3 over the last year with beef prices increasing markedly further pinching household budgets inflation spike may sway biden s choice for next federal reserve chair deese offered no immediate solution for the higher consumer prices but said economic forecasters expect the inflation rate to decrease in 2022 he said all options are on the table to curb rising prices including tapping the strategic petroleum reserve where the u s currently has 612 million barrels of oil stored in four salt caverns along the gulf of mexico coast some release of the reserve oil could be refined into gasoline for sale to motorists which could in the short term ease gas prices at service station pumps but u s presidents have only reluctantly tapped the reserve instead holding it for use in the event of a possible true national emergency such as a cutoff in middle east and north atlantic oil production the existing oil reserve is enough to replace more than half a year s worth of u s crude net imports deese said three things have to occur to improve u s economic growth and curb inflation one we have to finish the job on covid he said with more vaccinations to curb the spread of the coronavirus that causes the illness we have to return to a sense of economic normalcy by getting more workplaces covid free getting more kids vaccinated so more parents feel comfortable going to work but biden s mandate that 84 million u s workers be vaccinated at workplaces with 100 or more employees has been at least temporarily blocked by a u s appellate court pending further court hearings secondly deese said we ve got to address the supply chain issue of consumer goods arriving into the u s from asia with 83 container ships currently anchored off the pacific coast waiting for docking and unloading americans give bosses same message in record numbers i quit he said the 1 2 trillion infrastructure legislation biden is signing monday will help ease transportation bottlenecks in the u s but that construction work does not occur overnight lastly he called for congressional passage of biden s nearly 2 trillion social safety legislation to provide more financial educational and health care assistance to all but the wealthiest american families the house of representatives is planning to vote on the measure this week but its fate in the senate remains uncertain despite the immediate inflationary pressures on american consumers and biden s sharply declining voter approval standing deese said the economy has sharply improved since biden took office last january when the president took office we were facing an all out economic crisis deese said eighteen million people were collecting unemployment benefits three thousand people a day were dying of covid and because of the actions the president has taken we re now seeing an economic recovery that most people didn t think was possible then economic growth in america is outstripping any other developed country deese said and the unemployment rate has come down to 4 6 that s about two years faster than experts projected but with higher consumer prices the democratic president s republican political foes are focusing on american pocketbooks as congressional elections halfway through biden s four year presidential term loom in november of next year one republican critic senator john barrasso of wyoming told abc s this week show he would never have believed biden would preside over the biggest increase in consumer prices in three decades but barrasso blamed what he characterized as biden s almost irreversibly bad federal government spending choices both for infrastructure and the pending social safety legislation the infrastructure legislation was approved with both republican and democratic support but no republicans have voiced support for the social safety net measure forcing democrats to attempt to pass it with their own votes

tokyo japan toshiba corporation announced on november 12 that it will divide its business into three entities a conciliatory move aimed at placating shareholders seeking a major revamp of the company following several scandals an uncommon step in a nation where corporations reign supreme news of the tokyo headquartered company being divided came to light within days of american manufacturer general electric declaring it was dividing itself while johnson and johnson also made an announcement of a split established in 1875 toshiba has given its approval to joining its infrastructure and energy units into a single business with its hard disk drives and semiconductor devices used in power electronics forming a second company the third unit will be tasked with the management of toshiba corporation s share in kioxia holdings as well as other assets the idea of splitting the company up which originated following a calculated evaluation spanning a period of five months following an exceedingly detrimental and scandalous corporate governance incident in which the company was found to have colluded with the government to suppress the interests of foreign investors nevertheless this division contradicts demands from some shareholders for taking the problem ridden firm private still some major shareholders believe that this plan might have difficulties receiving approval at the march shareholders meeting the revamp announcement came following the closing of japanese markets though a four percent fall in toshiba shares was recorded on the frankfurt stock exchange at opening on november 12 thereby indicating dissatisfaction among investors after much discussion we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option toshiba president satoshi tsunakawa stated at a press conference
i guess i would make a lousy progressive because i just don t buy into their argument that somehow rich people are evil to me it would seem that folks like elon musk who both make something people want and provide jobs have done something that s beneficial not only for themselves but for society as well it would seem logical to encourage that so there would be more of it not penalize it so there would be less and everyone could be equally poor in a socialist system advertisement but to folks on the left like millionaire sen bernie sanders i vt billionaires are inherently evil to be constantly used as a point of outrage they the billionaires are the source of all the pain of the working class if they have a lot and you have less it must be because they took it somehow from you even if that makes no sense at all bernie was off on one of his typical rants on the subject on twitter demanding that the rich pay their fair share of taxes we must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share period bernie sanders sensanders november 13 2021 you constantly hear this plea from leftists while there are certainly rich people who avail themselves of legal tax provisions to pay less rich people pay most of the income tax paid according to a heritage foundation article earlier this year the latest government data show that in 2018 the top 1 of income earners those who earned more than 540 000 earned 21 of all u s income while paying 40 of all federal income taxes the top 10 earned 48 of the income and paid 71 of federal income taxes the data show tax rates decline with income and the poorest 20 of the population pay an average tax rate of just 1 the left leaning tax policy center found similar results advertisement it surely looks like the rich pay more than their fair share elon musk who is worth over 285 billion let bernie have it with a jab i keep forgetting that you re still alive elon musk elonmusk november 14 2021 musk then followed it up with a reference to his recent sell off of stock which he did in part to pay tax obligations want me to sell more stock bernie just say the word elon musk elonmusk november 14 2021 musk previously blasted the democratic effort to put an annual tax on billionaires investment gains as part of their build back better reconciliation package musk has also sparred with sanders when bernie chastised him for spending money on space travel saying he should focus on earth we are in a moment in american history where two guys elon musk and jeff bezos own more wealth than the bottom 40 of people in this country that level of greed and inequality is not only immoral it is unsustainable sanders tweeted on march 18 musk who also owns the aerospace company spacex tweeted a couple of days later that he is using his wealth to get humanity to explore space i m going to bet those two folks bernie names also pay more in taxes than the bottom 40 percent and that s one of the reasons bernie s rant is so wrong not to mention that he equates being rich and successful with greed but it s the only thing socialists like bernie understand to take from those who make things advertisement musk has stood up not only against such targeting but he also stood against lockdown orders over covid last year which he called fascist he also told his followers they should take the red pill an indication that he might be rejecting the democratic narrative sign up here for that new red state vip subscription to get exclusives and the latest news that matters to you use promo code 2022 this week only for a 40 discount on your new redstate vip subscription it is the largest discount we have ever offered make sure you have the news you need

tokyo japan toshiba corporation announced on november 12 that it will divide its business into three entities a conciliatory move aimed at placating shareholders seeking a major revamp of the company following several scandals an uncommon step in a nation where corporations reign supreme news of the tokyo headquartered company being divided came to light within days of american manufacturer general electric declaring it was dividing itself while johnson and johnson also made an announcement of a split established in 1875 toshiba has given its approval to joining its infrastructure and energy units into a single business with its hard disk drives and semiconductor devices used in power electronics forming a second company the third unit will be tasked with the management of toshiba corporation s share in kioxia holdings as well as other assets the idea of splitting the company up which originated following a calculated evaluation spanning a period of five months following an exceedingly detrimental and scandalous corporate governance incident in which the company was found to have colluded with the government to suppress the interests of foreign investors nevertheless this division contradicts demands from some shareholders for taking the problem ridden firm private still some major shareholders believe that this plan might have difficulties receiving approval at the march shareholders meeting the revamp announcement came following the closing of japanese markets though a four percent fall in toshiba shares was recorded on the frankfurt stock exchange at opening on november 12 thereby indicating dissatisfaction among investors after much discussion we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option toshiba president satoshi tsunakawa stated at a press conference
after multiple drafts revisions and years of discussion charlottesville s city council will have its first public hearing on the city s proposed and controversial future land use map or flum monday evening if approved the proposed draft of the flum could be one of the first substantial steps the city takes to address the city s legacy of exclusionary racial covenants and redlining it would do so by providing more potential opportunities for affordable housing in areas traditionally dominated by single family homes the map would eliminate designations for exclusively single family home neighborhoods allowing opportunities for different kinds of housing to be added in these areas this has led many residents of single family homes to fear that developers could take advantage of their neighborhoods but other residents say this is a necessary step forward to rectify persisting patterns of segregation the future land use map is a part of the city s comprehensive plan a guide for local land use and other big picture decisions it was last updated in 2013 city council will hear from staff and the public about the map in a work session and public hearing monday in past hearings about the flum dozens of community members have spoken in public comment with some endorsing the map and other decrying the proposed changes while councilors may ask for a second hearing it s not required so they may make a vote on the map the same night hundreds of people have signed petitions and submitted comments to the city about the proposed map what is the future land use map the city s planning commission first started discussing revising the comprehensive plan and future land use map flum in 2017 the city hired a team made up of planners from the consulting firm rhodeside and harwell to manage revisions to the plan and the map the team is now known as cville plans together it s helpful to understand the guiding principles that frame the comprehensive plan also frame the land use map said james freas the city s director of neighborhood development services principles outlined in the comprehensive plan such as environmental protection and affordable housing development should be reflected when implementing the map freas said while the plan is not a zoning map it provides a framework for what kind of zoning could be allowed in the future the zoning code hasn t been substantially revised since 2003 the flum is intended to be consistent with the city s affordable housing plan the map designates some areas as general residential which allows for different kinds of housing to be added into the existing residentials areas some neighborhoods have received a new medium intensity designation which is intended to increase opportunities for affordable housing in areas that are not currently considered to be affordable examples of medium density housing include townhouses row houses duplexes triplexes and fourplexes this designation is also placed near schools job centers and other places residents would frequent previously the city s residential areas were only designated as high intensity or low intensity this resulted in a stark divide between areas with single family homes and areas with highly populated housing complexes and limited opportunity for anything in between now all neighborhoods will either be classified as general residential or medium intensity residential in an effort to lessen the divide i believe it s the most meaningful change that we can see said planning commission chair lyle solla yates it doesn t solve centuries of troubles that have gone before us but it starts to turn the ship and that s the right thing to do at this point while the flum eliminates r1 or single family zoning solla yates said that doesn t mean single family homes are not allowed it just means areas that previously only included single family homes may see different types of development around them the flum has been referred to as a living document by some members of the planning commission and the cville plans together team meaning even when it is approved there is still room for edits and changes as issues may arise think about any plan that you make in your personal life when you make a plan you then refine that plan and when you actually move forward with implementation of what you re doing your experience informs your understanding of the plan freas said sensitive communities while racial covenants no longer exist legally historians and researchers have tracked how there are still patterns of segregation today in charlottesville as a result of the covenants most of the houses that were built in the pre and post world war ii era were established with racial covenants racial covenant neighborhoods excluded racial and religious minority groups often african americans and jews from living there what we have right now is a historical relic of intentional segregation our comprehensive plan and future land use map are based on existing zoning which essentially realized and encapsulated crystallized patterns of segregation that were enforced through racial religious restrictive covenants dan rosensweig president and ceo of habitat for humanity of greater charlottesville and a member of the city s housing advisory committee told the daily progress in april one of the additions to the most recent draft of the flum that addresses this legacy is a sensitive communities designation the goal of this designation is to identify and support communities that are most sensitive to displacement pressures and are at risk of resident displacement as often happens which housing prices rise and people can no longer afford to live in their homes the map identifies the meadows rose hill 10th and page and parts of the fifeville and belmont neighborhoods as sensitive communities the draft proposes that these are sensitive areas that may require additional affordability requirements incentives or other tools to support residents these areas were identified with average median income and percentage of minority residents in mind the sensitive designation aims to limit excessive development in areas that are already under displacement pressure people who expressed support for more residential intensity in the city also had some concerns about central displacement specifically in these neighborhoods said jenny koch project manager for cville plans together koch said the team reviewed recommendations from the charlottesville low income housing coalition and the housing advisory committee as well as census data to determine the sensitive designations koch said some community members were specifically concerned about neighborhoods at risk of displacement near the university of virginia the uva student council weighed in on these displacement pressures in regards to the flum releasing a letter last month that addresses the university s legacy of gentrification it was co signed by 20 student organizations and includes five testimonials from uva students about their individual struggles finding stable affordable housing in the city student council decided to weigh in on the city s comprehensive plan and flum because uva students have historically caused substantial harm to longtime charlottesville residents despite the potential for uva students to be strong allies to other renters in charlottesville uva student council president abel liu told the daily progress in an email uva student council estimates that about 19 000 to 20 000 uva students live in off campus housing in the city uva has approximately 27 000 students but there are only 7 500 beds on uva grounds as of may 2020 this places a significant burden on charlottesville s housing stock and contributes to the displacement of low income and black and brown longtime city residents the letter says liu said the student council s goal is not for the city to prioritize student housing rather the board feels that increasing the density and concentration of housing near the university particularly affordable housing is a mutually beneficial solution for both permanent charlottesville residents and students who rent off campus housing student council wants to champion tenants rights and affordable housing while preventing further student encroachment into the charlottesville community and displacement of sensitive neighborhoods he said community response but while the flum has support from uva students and many others it has strong critics some residents are concerned that it doesn t do enough to address the affordable housing crisis while other residents decry the increased density designations in single family neighborhoods cville plans together has received thousands of comments on the map and community members spent hours addressing it during public comment portions of city meetings and forums some community members organized groups in response to the proposed map koch and freas said that while community members have been very vocal about the process this isn t uncommon and they ve both seen this kind of response in other communities build smart charlottesville is a group of city residents advocating for the city to delay the comprehensive plan and future land use map approval process a change org petition started by the group has garnered over 550 signatures as of press time the petition calls on city council to delay a vote on the map it says the addition of the newly announced interim city manager marc woolley is not enough and the city should at least wait till a permanent city manager is hired city council has said the hiring process for a permanent city manager will not begin until spring of 2022 we need an outstanding city council and deep professional expertise to help us prevent a developer led demolition bonanza that ruins our neighborhoods and city unfortunately the current council is profoundly dysfunctional the petition says the group has taken out multiple ads in the daily progress referring to the flum as the most extreme rezoning plan in the country solla yates said the plan is not extreme in comparison to what other localities have done we re a little bit late to the party now the various efforts to reform zoning have been going on for decades solla yates said he said california minneapolis and hartford connecticut are examples of localities that have taken similar actions in limiting or eliminating single family zoning solla yates said it would be astonishingly difficult legally for existing single family homes to be demolished and homeowners should not be concerned built smart charlottesville did not respond to requests for comment another group citizens for responsible planning garnered over 500 signatures on its own petition voicing concerns about increased density and saying there have not been enough opportunities for community members to give input on the map cville plans together has an online public comment tool and has held multiple public forums both on zoom and in person throughout the year the planning commission held multiple public hearings on the map crp has published multiple papers and videos on its website advocating against the proposed flum a letter authored by crp and signed by 11 neighborhood associations drew criticism in june after some community members alleged that a few of the signing associations didn t appear to exist before the flum debates members of citizens for responsible planning could not be reached for comment livable cville is a group that supports the changes in the proposed flum livable cville has written letters to the planning commission and city council advocating for affordability and has published papers on its website explaining the proposed changes to the flum and why they endorse them crystal passmore a member of the group said the group formed after some like minded city residents who did their own research on land use and affordable housing realized they could be more impactful by working together the group wants to see increased opportunities for affordable housing as well as safer roads to encourage walking and biking they see an environmental component at the intersection of these issues as well i don t know if our group would have formed if there wasn t such vocal opposition to what we all thought should happen passmore said it was frustrating to be a group of individuals another organized group trying to put out statements and their own data and not see anyone on the other side what s next if city council votes to approve the flum the next step is the zoning rewrite which will take a long time solla yates said nothing is going to happen soon that much is a promise we are merely setting us up to start the rezoning process which will be its own public process there ll be public meetings this is a process that leads to a process that leads to a process so i understand the anxiety that the government will move too fast but the risk is low solla yates said we would expect the changes to not happen on the ground overnight most of the land in charlottesville is private property and people will choose to make changes or not on their property koch said and while the plan may pave the way for affordable housing opportunities the city will still have to do more to ensure change is made both solla yates and koch said the greatest need is affordable housing it will require sustained commitment on the city s part financial commitments to make that happen koch said that will be an important part of actually seeing those affordable housing changes happen on the ground specifically at the greatest needs

in cold tumors no preclinical liver toxicity atg 101 is a pd l1 4 1bb bi specific antibody that was designed to activate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and inhibit immune checkpoints without inducing liver toxicity antengene presented data from in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluated atg 101 activity in several t cell activation assays and multiple in vivo models including those resistant to anti pd l 1 therapies data in the poster showed that atg 101 was active in anti pd l1 resistant and relapsed tumor models in addition atg 101 increased the activation of t cells and exhausted t cells upon pd l1 crosslinking required for atg 101 activity rendering cold tumors hot importantly atg 101 showed no liver toxicity in a glp toxicity study differentiating the drug vs other 4 1bb targeted monoclonals bi specifics and did not induce cytokine release syndrome in an in vitro assay atg 101 s unique safety and efficacy properties make it a promising potential therapy for solid tumors and non hodgkins lymphoma poster 608 promising atg 017 in vivo combination study add to clinical strategy atg 017 is a potent small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting the extracellular signal related kinases 1 and 2 erk1 2 antengene presented data on an in vivo study that evaluated atg 017 in combination with an anti pd l1 monoclonal antibody atezolizumab in an aggressive immune checkpoint inhibitor resistant mouse cancer model data in the poster showed that the combination enhanced the antitumor efficacy as well as increasing the percentage of infiltrating cd8 t cells nk cells cd8 cd4 ratio and m1 m2 macrophage ratio in the tumor microenvironment rendering a cold tumor hot these results demonstrated that atg 017 has potential synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors providing a rationale for exploring combination therapy in the clinic in the pursuit of improved efficacy in solid tumors including those resistant to checkpoint inhibitions poster 227 computational analysis tool enables atg 101 clinical dose selection bispecific antibody atg 101 acts by forming a trimer comprised of atg 101 bound to pd l1 and 4 1bb expressing cells that activates tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and inhibits immune checkpoints measuring trimeric complexes is important in defining optimal clinical doses but is very challenging to do in the clinic antengene and its collaborators at applied biomath llc reported on the development of a computational semi mechanistic pharmacology model that could be used to define the clinical dose of atg 101 it works by simulating in vivo tumor growth inhibition and predicting trimer formation free drug levels and receptor occupancy over time this work has enabled antengene to define a clinically effective dose range of atg 101 that induces 90 pd l1 receptor occupancy a key metric of drug activity this valuable pharmacology tool which may also be applied across other compounds in antengene s pipeline reflects the company s enthusiasm to utilize novel technologies and partnerships to enhance drug development capabilities details on the posters published on the sitc website are shown below abstract number 227 title a computational semi

here s what you need to remember the legacy of soviet preparation has not only survived but thrived and stocks of gas masks decontamination sets and other chemical and biological defense equipment are placed strategically around russia the threat of chemical and nuclear warfare loomed large over most militaries during the cold war the development of new nerve agents during the 1940s as well as advanced delivery systems later on meant that chemical weapons could be delivered with precision and deadly effect as such most militaries trained extensively for the chemical threat however those on the eastern side the soviet union and the warsaw pact states developed a reputation for extensive preparation but how much of this remains today in the russian cbrn рхбз troops the legacy of soviet preparation has not only survived but thrived new cbrn defense vehicles and equipment continue to be procured and cbrn equipment is often displayed prominently at large expositions like army 2019 the special battlefield role of the russian cbrn troops is also probably a reason why their capabilities are exercised more in addition to chemical attack and defense cbrn troops are in charge of operating battlefield smoke generators and the powerful tos 1 and tos 1a heavy flamethrower systems which can fire incendiary and thermobaric rounds cbrn troops are also armed with the powerful rpo a thermobaric rocket launcher which can level weak houses in a single shot the russian military also undertakes more cbrn training as a whole in addition to larger drills involving the cbrn troops there are weekly drills in most combat units every wednesday which involve the use of cbrn protective equipment and the completion of tasks with it on gas masks are also carried regularly regardless of the situation training drills with full body rubber suits also often occur as well as practice decontamination washes of armored vehicles larger scale cbrn exercises are also common with one occurring in august 2019 comparatively most nato soldiers seem to only train occasionally with cbrn equipment with monthly familiarization at most on the civil side stocks of gas masks decontamination sets and other chemical and biological defense equipment are placed in strategic locations around russia federal documents about the responsibilities of russian civil defense specifically state that defense against cbrn threats is part of the civil defense mandate the current civilian ai 4 individual first aid kit held in russian civil defense stocks contains antibacterial agents radioprotective agents an agent to treat carbon monoxide poisoning and antidotes against some chemical poisoning compared to regular first aid kits most american or european civilians have the ai 4 offers far better capability to treat victims of a cbrn threat however in nato cbrn training has lapsed while czechia retains one of the only live agent chemical weapons training facilities in nato there is far less focus on the cbrn threat in nato nations in both civil defense and military settings while russia has upgraded its cbrn reconnaissance vehicles twice since the 2000s the united states last procured an upgrade for its german m93 fox cbrn reconnaissance vehicles in 2007 charlie gao studied political and computer science at grinnell college and is a frequent commentator on defense and national security issues this article is being republished due to reader interest image reuters
useful idiots who let china off the hook why is there such an apparent lack of concern over their determination to keep burning coal asks david rose last thursday china revealed its coal miners had achieved an all time record by digging up 12 05million tonnes in one day just two days later the world s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases reduced cop26 minister alok sharma almost to tears by refusing to phase out coal in the final summit agreement judged by the benchmarks set by mr sharma and boris johnson before the conference cop had failed thanks to china yesterday green campaigners hailed some modest successes such as pledges to reduce methane but back in the real world china whose president xi jinping did not even turn up is still building coal fired power stations at a rate of knots and the agreement it reached with america to co operate on global warming lacked any substance yet the campaigners in glasgow barely mentioned let alone criticised china a spokesman for insulate britain told me we mustn t use china as a scapegoat some campaigners even heap praise on china so why is there such an apparent lack of concern one answer lies in a book called hidden hand exposing how the chinese communist party is reshaping the world by clive hamilton and mareike ohlberg serialised in the mail last year it argues that china has extended its influence over certain institutions in britain and other democracies in order to blind them to beijing s drive for supremacy yesterday green campaigners hailed some modest successes such as pledges to reduce methane but back in the real world china whose president xi jinping did not even turn up is still building coal fired power stations at a rate of knots writes david rose file image china the book says seduces politicians business people academics and campaigners into supporting its aims it regards them as useful idiots unwitting instruments of its goal of becoming the world s only superpower evidence unearthed by this newspaper working with researchers fluent in mandarin shows western environmentalists have indeed become a target documents suggest they are enmeshed with bodies subordinate to the chinese communist party ccp and staffed by figures from its most ruthless departments they include xie zhenhua china s chief climate envoy until 2012 he was a member of the central commission for discipline inspection which enforces state orthodoxy according to human rights watch it has been responsible for illegal detention torture and forced confessions just two days later the world s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases reduced cop26 minister alok sharma almost to tears by refusing to phase out coal in the final summit agreement i m dismayed that some leading western environmentalists are talking up the ccp as the saviour of the world hamilton says take for example professor lord stern chairman of the grantham research institute on climate change at the london school of economics who advises government having taught in china since 1998 in 2009 he told a chinese magazine he had close contacts with ccp officials in 2014 he wrote a paper for the world economic forum claiming china was emerging as a global leader in climate policy in 2016 he claimed china s emissions may already have peaked they hadn t the following year he insisted there was compelling evidence china s coal use had also peaked stern even praised president xi s personal commitment to driving climate action concluding the world is looking for a climate champion in china it has one but in march he sounded less optimistic saying it is crucial china stops building new coal fired power plants and stops increasing its emissions by 2025 nevertheless bob ward stern s spokesman told me china was taking significant action and the rate of increase in its emissions had slowed enormously he said china was keen to learn from the uk s example of world leading action on climate change nevertheless bob ward stern s spokesman told me china was taking significant action and the rate of increase in its emissions had slowed enormously he said china was keen to learn from the uk s example of world leading action on

another was kate hampton chief executive of the children s investment fund foundation ciff which donates tens of millions a year to green groups such as extinction rebellion she told the conference she supported chinese leadership on setting the global path in may she addressed a beijing investment forum praising china s determination to phase out coal the phrase vetoed by xie at cop26 what s more hampton is co chair of the board of the belt and road international green development coalition run by china s environment ministry it is an offshoot of president xi s belt and road initiative which chinese leaders have said is the means by which china will supplant america the ciff the wwf and clientearth run branches in china under chinese law any foreign organisation must submit to close supervision by the ministry of public security in charge of crushing dissent any group harming the national interest risks having its staff jailed canadian patricia adams director of the think tank

ecological civilisation is a means of furthering china s dominance at a meeting of the foreign environmental co operation centre chen xiangyang the director of an arm of china s spy agency said ecological civilisation was part of china s plans for a shared future for mankind but green groups insist engaging with china helps the planet a ciff spokesman said china is the world s largest emitter and its transition to a net zero economy is of utmost importance ciff s work in china aims to accelerate this transition clientearth said we are focused on reducing pollution and bringing down

washington the top white house economic adviser on sunday acknowledged the pain for americans of sharply rising consumer prices saying that president joe biden remains open to the possibility of tapping the u s strategic petroleum reserve to ease spiraling gasoline prices that motorists are paying at service stations there s no doubt inflation is high right now brian deese director of the national economic council told nbc s meet the press show it s affecting americans pocketbooks it s affecting their outlook u s consumer prices jumped at an annualized rate of 6 2 in october the biggest increase since 1990 the government s labor department reported last week higher energy and food prices have affected consumers the most with consumer spending accounting for 70 of the u s economy the world s biggest fuel costs for motorists are up sharply over the last year with motorists now paying 3 30 a gallon 3 8 liters 1 08 more than a year ago the highest average price since 2014 the cost of grocery bills has risen 5 3 over the last year with beef prices increasing markedly further pinching household budgets inflation spike may sway biden s choice for next federal reserve chair deese offered no immediate solution for the higher consumer prices but said economic forecasters expect the inflation rate to decrease in 2022 he said all options are on the table to curb rising prices including tapping the strategic petroleum reserve where the u s currently has 612 million barrels of oil stored in four salt caverns along the gulf of mexico coast some release of the reserve oil could be refined into gasoline for sale to motorists which could in the short term ease gas prices at service station pumps but u s presidents have only reluctantly tapped the reserve instead holding it for use in the event of a possible true national emergency such as a cutoff in middle east and north atlantic oil production the existing oil reserve is enough to replace more than half a year s worth of u s crude net imports deese said three things have to occur to improve u s economic growth and curb inflation one we have to finish the job on covid he said with more vaccinations to curb the spread of the coronavirus that causes the illness we have to return to a sense of economic normalcy by getting more workplaces covid free getting more kids vaccinated so more parents feel comfortable going to work but biden s mandate that 84 million u s workers be vaccinated at workplaces with 100 or more employees has been at least temporarily blocked by a u s appellate court pending further court hearings secondly deese said we ve got to address the supply chain issue of consumer goods arriving into the u s from asia with 83 container ships currently anchored off the pacific coast waiting for docking and unloading americans give bosses same message in record numbers i quit he said the 1 2 trillion infrastructure legislation biden is signing monday will help ease transportation bottlenecks in the u s but that construction work does not occur overnight lastly he called for congressional passage of biden s nearly 2 trillion social safety legislation to provide more financial educational and health care assistance to all but the wealthiest american families the house of representatives is planning to vote on the measure this week but its fate in the senate remains uncertain despite the immediate inflationary pressures on american consumers and biden s sharply declining voter approval standing deese said the economy has sharply improved since biden took office last january when the president took office we were facing an all out economic crisis deese said eighteen million people were collecting unemployment benefits three thousand people a day were dying of covid and because of the actions the president has taken we re now seeing an economic recovery that most people didn t think was possible then economic growth in america is outstripping any other developed country deese said and the unemployment rate has come down to 4 6 that s about two years faster than experts projected but with higher consumer prices the democratic president s republican political foes are focusing on american pocketbooks as congressional elections halfway through biden s four year presidential term loom in november of next year one republican critic senator john barrasso of wyoming told abc s this week show he would never have believed biden would preside over the biggest increase in consumer prices in three decades but barrasso blamed what he characterized as biden s almost irreversibly bad federal government spending choices both for infrastructure and the pending social safety legislation the infrastructure legislation was approved with both republican and democratic support but no republicans have voiced support for the social safety net measure forcing democrats to attempt to pass it with their own votes

trial results highlighted reduction in cardiovascular mortality heart attacks and strokes with greatest effect seen in setting of inflammation new york nov 14 2021 globe newswire mesoblast limited nasdaq meso asx msb global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases today announced that results from the randomized controlled phase 3 trial of rexlemestrocel l in 565 patients with new york heart association nyha class ii and class iii chronic heart failure chf with reduced ejection fraction hfref were presented as a late breaking presentation at the american heart association aha annual scientific sessions during a featured program titled building on the foundations of treatment advances in heart failure therapy the trial s co principal investigator dr emerson perin medical director of texas heart institute and clinical professor baylor college of medicine presented new results from the landmark study showing a significant relationship between presence of systemic inflammation as quantified by high sensitivity c reactive protein hs crp and treatment benefit with rexlemestrocel l on risk of cardiovascular mortality heart attacks or strokes in a release by the american heart association dr perin said cell therapy has the potential to change how we treat heart failure this study addresses the inflammatory aspects of heart failure which go mostly untreated despite significant pharmaceutical and device therapy development key findings of pre specified outcomes were a single dose of rexlemestrocel l on top of standard of care reduced the incidence of heart attacks or strokes by 65 across all 537 nyha class ii or class iii treated patients compared with standard of care alone p 0 001 1 across 301 nyha class ii and class iii treated patients with high levels of inflammation hs crp 2mg l rexlemestrocel l reduced the incidence of heart attacks or strokes by 79 compared with standard of care alone p 0 001 1 in nyha class ii patients with high levels of inflammation hs crp 2mg l a single dose of rexlemestrocel l reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death by 80 compared with standard of care alone p 0 005 1 compared with standard of care alone a single dose of rexlemestrocel l on top of standard of care reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death heart attacks or strokes by 33 across all 537 nyha class ii or class iii patients p 0 02 1 and by 45 in the 301 patients with high levels of inflammation hs crp 2mg l p 0 012 1 and by 45 in the 301 patients with high levels of inflammation hs crp 2mg l p 0 012 compared with standard of care alone addition of rexlemestrocel l did not further reduce the frequency of hospitalization for worsening hf symptoms as previously reported in a release from texas heart institute president ceo dr joseph g rogers said that the texas heart institute prides itself upon consistently striving to uncover the next first in cardiovascular discovery and treatment whereas most traditional treatments address the congestion or fluid overload associated with heart failure rexlemestrocel l addresses the inflammation that is at the centre of advanced chronic heart failure widely regarded as the leading cause of death in the developed world the ability of rexlemestrocel l to significantly impact cardiac death heart attacks and strokes on top of maximal hfref therapy reflects the unique mechanisms of action of this allogeneic cellular therapy on reduction of inflammation and improved microvasculature the unchecked intra cardiac inflammation in hfref patients causes progressive loss of heart muscle replacement with scar tissue and death persistent inflammation in the blood circulation also results in accelerated atherosclerosis with plaque progression and instability resulting in plaque rupture and potential blockage of major arteries resulting in high rates of heart attacks and strokes in chronic hfref patients rexlemestrocel l reduces inflammatory cytokine production by immune cells generating improved local networks of blood vessels within the damaged heart and reducing risk of plaque rupture in major arteries the observed relationship between systemic inflammation and degree of benefit from treatment with rexlemestrocel l supports the importance of the anti inflammatory mechanism of action of rexlemestrocel l in addressing the high risk of mortality and morbidity in hfref patients in addition to dr perin the dream hf study co authors are drs barry greenberg md kenneth borow md timothy henry md farrell mendelsohn md les miller md elizabeth swiggum md eric adler md christopher james pa and silviu itescu md the study s findings have been submitted for publication about chronic heart failure heart failure affects approximately 6 5 million people in the us and 26 million people globally with increasing prevalence and incidence the mortality rate approaches 50 at 5 years as patients progress beyond nyha class ii disease in parallel with increasing intra cardiac and systemic inflammation 2 4 despite recent approvals of new therapies for hfref including sglt2 inhibitors that have reduced hospitalizations due to reversible volume related events nyha class ii iii hfref patients with inflammation remain at high risk for cardiac death heart attacks and strokes rexlemestrocel is being developed as an immunomodulatory therapy to address the high degree of intra cardiac and systemic inflammation in chronic heart failure in order to reduce the high rate of major cardiac events mace in these patients about the american heart association aha the american heart association is the us s oldest and largest voluntary organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke its scientific journals include circulation stroke and journal of the american heart association jaha the aha s scientific sessions is regarded as the world s most prestigious cardiovascular meeting and has been running since 1925

washington the top white house economic adviser on sunday acknowledged the pain for americans of sharply rising consumer prices saying that president joe biden remains open to the possibility of tapping the u s strategic petroleum reserve to ease spiraling gasoline prices that motorists are paying at service stations there s no doubt inflation is high right now brian deese director of the national economic council told nbc s meet the press show it s affecting americans pocketbooks it s affecting their outlook u s consumer prices jumped at an annualized rate of 6 2 in october the biggest increase since 1990 the government s labor department reported last week higher energy and food prices have affected consumers the most with consumer spending accounting for 70 of the u s economy the world s biggest fuel costs for motorists are up sharply over the last year with motorists now paying 3 30 a gallon 3 8 liters 1 08 more than a year ago the highest average price since 2014 the cost of grocery bills has risen 5 3 over the last year with beef prices increasing markedly further pinching household budgets inflation spike may sway biden s choice for next federal reserve chair deese offered no immediate solution for the higher consumer prices but said economic forecasters expect the inflation rate to decrease in 2022 he said all options are on the table to curb rising prices including tapping the strategic petroleum reserve where the u s currently has 612 million barrels of oil stored in four salt caverns along the gulf of mexico coast some release of the reserve oil could be refined into gasoline for sale to motorists which could in the short term ease gas prices at service station pumps but u s presidents have only reluctantly tapped the reserve instead holding it for use in the event of a possible true national emergency such as a cutoff in middle east and north atlantic oil production the existing oil reserve is enough to replace more than half a year s worth of u s crude net imports deese said three things have to occur to improve u s economic growth and curb inflation one we have to finish the job on covid he said with more vaccinations to curb the spread of the coronavirus that causes the illness we have to return to a sense of economic normalcy by getting more workplaces covid free getting more kids vaccinated so more parents feel comfortable going to work but biden s mandate that 84 million u s workers be vaccinated at workplaces with 100 or more employees has been at least temporarily blocked by a u s appellate court pending further court hearings secondly deese said we ve got to address the supply chain issue of consumer goods arriving into the u s from asia with 83 container ships currently anchored off the pacific coast waiting for docking and unloading americans give bosses same message in record numbers i quit he said the 1 2 trillion infrastructure legislation biden is signing monday will help ease transportation bottlenecks in the u s but that construction work does not occur overnight lastly he called for congressional passage of biden s nearly 2 trillion social safety legislation to provide more financial educational and health care assistance to all but the wealthiest american families the house of representatives is planning to vote on the measure this week but its fate in the senate remains uncertain despite the immediate inflationary pressures on american consumers and biden s sharply declining voter approval standing deese said the economy has sharply improved since biden took office last january when the president took office we were facing an all out economic crisis deese said eighteen million people were collecting unemployment benefits three thousand people a day were dying of covid and because of the actions the president has taken we re now seeing an economic recovery that most people didn t think was possible then economic growth in america is outstripping any other developed country deese said and the unemployment rate has come down to 4 6 that s about two years faster than experts projected but with higher consumer prices the democratic president s republican political foes are focusing on american pocketbooks as congressional elections halfway through biden s four year presidential term loom in november of next year one republican critic senator john barrasso of wyoming told abc s this week show he would never have believed biden would preside over the biggest increase in consumer prices in three decades but barrasso blamed what he characterized as biden s almost irreversibly bad federal government spending choices both for infrastructure and the pending social safety legislation the infrastructure legislation was approved with both republican and democratic support but no republicans have voiced support for the social safety net measure forcing democrats to attempt to pass it with their own votes

gold is holding in a bullish territory at the open bears are on the lookout for a downside correction for the days ahead xau usd capitalizes on inflation fears buyers look to retain control update the price is stalling at a daily resistance which could encourage weak hands to bail update the price of gold has stalled at the start of the week which could encourage the bulls to take profits in anticipation of a significant correction to test prior resistance on the daily chart at the time of writing gold is losing over 0 20 and has dropped to test the low of 1 860 99 so far 1 860 is a key level on the hourly chart a break of the horizontal support will expose the dynamic trendline and then prospects of a run into the 1 830 enhancement area will be on the cards end of update the us dollar was mixed against the g10 last friday and gold recorded its biggest weekly gain in more than six months following last week s inflation report in the us xau usd rallied to 1 868 as the greenback fell from its 95 265 highs on the back of concerns among consumers the november university of michigan consumer sentiment survey surprised with a slump to a 10 year low as consumers fret over rising prices the spectre of higher entrenched inflation saw investor demand surge and the breakout in the yellow has also attracted new buyers as global markets search for inflation hedges the sentiment is likely to stick around for the foreseeable future the bureau of labor statistics announced that consumer prices in the united states rose 6 2 over the past year however this is not a uniquely us phenomenon eurostat the statistical agency of the european union has released a flash estimate for annual inflation in the euro area and like the us report this estimate showed inflation surging beyond what has been considered the norm the data has come in at 4 1 in a preliminary estimate based on incomplete data considerably lower than the us rate in fact the world s four largest economies the us highest in 30 years china japan highest in more than 40 years and germany have all reported record inflation numbers for october economists politicians central bank leaders had been insisting that the current inflation is temporary but the markets seem to think otherwise and that is bullish for gold one of the worst inflation calls ever by the fed we have already started to see policymakers back off from the transitory mantra but there is still a lot of work to do on the labour recovery so there needs to be a fine balance in the communication in the past pandemic recovery however there are economists out there who are far more concerned mohamed el erian for instance a chief economic adviser at allianz se says this will go down in history as one of the worst inflation calls ever by the federal reserve he doesn t think inflation will come down anytime soon and the concern is that the time between ending the taper and interest rate hikes is not going to be significant and that they will have to raise rates much faster tapping on the breaks at the wrong time in this regard for the week ahead the bond markets and us yields are going to matter for the gold price gold technical analysis the above link is a contrarian view of the current trajectory of the price in anticipation of a healthy bearish correction in this daily chart it is illustrated that the price is reaching a critical level of resistance and a pullback could be expected towards the prior daily highs where a 38 2 fibonacci retracement can be found near the 1 830s

michigan consumer sentiment falls to a fresh 10 year low in october real wages have fallen for seven straight months retail sales and personal spending have yet to drop with sentiment americans hate inflation every time they go to the supermarket consumers can see their paychecks shrink for seven straight months rising prices have outpaced wages it should be no surprise that for half of that time consumer optimism has languished at a decade low despite a job market that is begging for workers and willing to pay for them the university of michigan consumer sentiment index unexpectedly dropped to 66 8 in october from 71 7 in september setting a new 10 year low the third in the last four months analysts had forecast a small increase to 72 4 over the past four months the michigan index has averaged 70 4 michigan consumer sentiment fxstreet labor market the number of us positions on offer in the job openings and labor turnover survey jolts has averaged 9 9 million for seven months that is more than two million more than the previous monthly high of 7 6 million in november 2019 hiring in the nonfarm payroll accounts has averaged 592 000 for that period these are the best numbers since the initial recovery from last spring s lockdown jolts fxstreet a record 4 4 million workers quit their jobs in september seeking different or better paid employment these voluntary separations reflect worker confidence in finding a more lucrative or more congenial job and the growing pricing power of employees in a very tight labor market these labor market statistics favor workers over employers and cannot be the source of consumer discontent wages and inflation despite the nationwide shortage of workers wage increases have not kept pace with soaring inflation annual real income wages minus inflation have fallen every month since march average hourly earnings ahe have averaged a 3 9 annual gain for those seven months and have climbed from 0 4 in april to 4 9 in october average hourly earnings yoy fxstreet annual cpi inflation has averaged 5 3 for the same period americans have lost 1 4 of their purchasing power in a little more than half a year cpi yoy fxstreet the overall inflation and wage statistics understate the impact of inflation on most families because the prices for some necessities particularly cars gasoline and fuel have risen far faster than the general inflation rate consumer sentiment retail sales and personal spending retail sales have been essentially flat over the past six months from april averaging 0 07 though they were stronger in august and september at 0 9 and 0 7 october s figures will be reported on tuesday november 16 and are forecast to be unchanged at 0 7 retail sales fxstreet if the october projection is accurate given the sentiment numbers hardly a guarantee retail sales will have averaged 0 8 for the three months of weak consumer outlook august through october personal spending has been stronger than sales for the half year through october averaging a 0 6 monthly increase august and september were the strongest consecutive months of the six averaging 0 8 november s spending result will be reported in two weeks on november 24 personal spending fxstreet the us economy expanded at a 2 annualized rate in the third quarter with a 0 17 monthly increase in retail sales and a 0 5 average for personal spending the atlanta fed gdpnow estimate for the fourth quarter based on the limited data available is 8 2 the next revision will be after october s retail sales on november 16 consumer sentiment has been weak for four months averaging 70 4 from august sales and spending numbers have been released for only two of those months august and september the identical averages of 0 8 for sales and spending show no evidence that the trough in sentiment has had an effect on consumption whether consumers will continue to spend in the fourth quarter as inflation increasingly appears to be a long term prospect is unknown what is certain is that a drop in consumption from third quarter levels will register far slower economic growth market response weak consumer sentiment numbers are normally a negative indicator for treasury yields and equities the logic flows from poor sentiment and falling confidence to fading consumption lower economic growth and eventually lower interest rates friday s markets took the opposite tack treasury rates rose across the board the gains were small 1 2 basis point in the 10 year 2 in the 30 and 1 5 in the 5 year but coming after wednesday s powerful yield rally it is an indication that credit traders do not expect the weakening sentiment numbers to deter the fed s taper schedule us 10 year treasury yield cnbc equities were higher with the dow rising 0 5 the nasdaq 1 and the s p 500 adding 0 72 stocks are taking their cues from the third quarter s consumption figures and the obvious fact that consumers have not yet taken their inflation discontent shopping the dollar was higher on the week in every major pair the surge in treasury rates was the last word for the greenback the fed s dilemma the worst possible outcome for the fed s taper program is for collapsing consumer attitudes to take a large bite out of consumption and gdp dislike of inflation is the most likely culprit behind the plunge in consumer sentiment the longer inflation continues at current levels the greater the chance that households begin to adjust spending to their diminished purchasing power in an extremely tight job market with widespread labor shortages inflation exacerbates demands for higher wages which in turn forces employers to raise their own prices driving both sides of a wage price spiral the federal reserve has underestimated the strength duration and causes of us inflation far from price increases being a temporary effect of the lockdown plummet in consumption global dislocations in supply manufacturing and distribution worker reluctance and unprecedented deficit spending from washington have created a near perfect storm of inflationary pressures unchecked price increases are a far greater threat to consumer outlook spending and the economic recovery than rising treasury yields it is too late for the modest recent gains in treasury yields and commercial rates to have any impact on the next six months worth of inflation if the fed does not begin to curb the monetary impulse for inflation the following six months could be even worse

tokyo japan toshiba corporation announced on november 12 that it will divide its business into three entities a conciliatory move aimed at placating shareholders seeking a major revamp of the company following several scandals an uncommon step in a nation where corporations reign supreme news of the tokyo headquartered company being divided came to light within days of american manufacturer general electric declaring it was dividing itself while johnson and johnson also made an announcement of a split established in 1875 toshiba has given its approval to joining its infrastructure and energy units into a single business with its hard disk drives and semiconductor devices used in power electronics forming a second company the third unit will be tasked with the management of toshiba corporation s share in kioxia holdings as well as other assets the idea of splitting the company up which originated following a calculated evaluation spanning a period of five months following an exceedingly detrimental and scandalous corporate governance incident in which the company was found to have colluded with the government to suppress the interests of foreign investors nevertheless this division contradicts demands from some shareholders for taking the problem ridden firm private still some major shareholders believe that this plan might have difficulties receiving approval at the march shareholders meeting the revamp announcement came following the closing of japanese markets though a four percent fall in toshiba shares was recorded on the frankfurt stock exchange at opening on november 12 thereby indicating dissatisfaction among investors after much discussion we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option toshiba president satoshi tsunakawa stated at a press conference

consumer business home to band aid and tylenol will be shed within 24 months johnson johnson plans to break up into two companies splitting off the 15 billion a year division that sells band aid bandages tylenol medicines and johnson s baby powder in a shift indicating just how much healthcare has changed since the company helped pioneer the industry the world s largest health products company by sales will separate its high margin but less predictable prescription drug and medical device businesses from its storied but slower growing consumer group creating two publicly traded companies j j will shed its consumer division in 18 to 24 months chief executive alex gorsky said j j decided to make the change mr gorsky said because the businesses their customers and markets have diverged so much in recent years including during the pandemic lawsuits that alleged use of johnson s baby powder caused cancer didn t play a role he said the best path forward to ensure sustainable growth over the long term and better meet patient and consumer demands is to have our consumer business operate as a separate healthcare company mr gorsky said in an interview what form the separation will take what the new consumer oriented company will be called and who will lead it are yet to be worked out mr gorsky said though he said j j planned to structure the transaction to be tax free it is likely j j would spin out its consumer unit and hold a stock offering but no decision has been made mr gorsky said the decision comes after rivals including pfizer inc and merck co decided to hive off their consumer businesses and double down on faster growing pharmaceuticals last week general electric co said it would break into three public companies another example of large diversified companies reassessing their structures and seeking to find stronger growth by separating into smaller units focused on their core competencies the trimmer j j which will keep the name will still stand as the world s largest health products company with yearly sales approaching 80 billion chief financial officer joseph wolk said the consumer company will be among the industry s largest after competitors such as procter gamble co nestlé sa and l oréal sa johnson johnson band aids are displayed on a shelf at a cvs store in san anselmo california on nov 12 getty images afp j j shares rose more than 1 friday on the news given that there is not much synergy between the consumer business and the other jnj segments this initiative makes sense wells fargo analyst larry biegelsen said in a note to investors the separation will kick off the biggest change in direction in j j s 135 year history disposable diapers indigestion tablets and cough remedies powered j j during its first century then provided the diversification that helped the company ride out the ups and downs of its riskier but higher reward pharmaceuticals and medical devices businesses the decision to pull all tylenol from store shelves during a safety scare in 1982 endeared j j to many consumers today the consumer health business sells well known brands from neutrogena skin moisturizers to zyrtec allergy pills that include four that ring up 1 billion in sales each year and 20 generating more than 150 million in annual sales the unit is also home to j j s namesake brand johnson s baby the division has grown apart from j j s other units in recent years sales are growing more slowly than at the other businesses and have lower margins it depends on recognition of name brands such as aveeno neutrogena and listerine which are marketed directly to consumers endorsements by celebrities and sales via e commerce websites increasingly play the decisive role in commercial success people are now looking to folks that they idolize and say if that product works for them it s going to work for me too mr wolk said in an interview prescription drugs and medical devices require different corporate skill sets they undergo tight regulatory scrutiny before they can go on sale and are monitored closely afterward their commercial success depends heavily on the choices of doctors and hospitals as well as payment by health insurers prescription drugs and devices also spring from more advanced research than consumer goods the next generation drugs and devices are requiring yearslong and heavy investments in research into human genetics and molecular biology artificial intelligence and optical recognition j j s pharmaceuticals business which sells therapies for diseases ranging from prostate cancer to pulmonary arterial hypertension developed one of only three covid 19 vaccines authorized in the u s wall street also has different expectations for the businesses the consumer unit s sales rose 1 1 to 15 billion last year after growth of 0 3 the previous year in contrast j j s pharmaceutical unit posted sales growth of 8 last year and 3 6 the previous year the consumer division has generally contributed the smallest profit of j j s three main divisions less than the contribution from prescription drug sales or medical device sales while j j s pharmaceutical sales have surged in recent years the consumer business was recovering from a series of recalls including of millions of bottles of tylenol and other over the counter medicines in 2009 and 2010 because of manufacturing problems in addition it has faced lawsuits alleging talc containing johnson s baby powder caused cancer or mesothelioma j j has said its talc containing baby powder is safe doesn t contain asbestos and doesn t cause cancer it created a subsidiary and placed it in bankruptcy to resolve the talc claims quickly mr gorsky said j j has corrected the manufacturing issues that led to recalls it upgraded the plant in fort washington pennsylvania that makes tylenol in july the food and drug administration lifted a consent decree that had put three consumer division manufacturing plants under scrutiny one risk of splitting off the consumer division is that j j will have less of a buffer to smooth out sales and profit if one of the remaining divisions stumbles or encounters a market downturn j j has long touted its diversified business model as a strength at various points weakness in one unit would be offset by strong sales in another at times in the mid 2000s j j s consumer business was posting the strongest sales growth of the three main units the unit was bolstered in 2006 when j j bought pfizer inc s consumer business including listerine for 16 6 billion a stand alone consumer business however won t be able to draw on a well endowed parent while it competes with bigger rivals the new company will be in a better position standing alone to allocate resources and make other decisions said joaquin duato vice chairman of j j s executive committee who will become chief executive in january and eventually lead the pharmaceutical and medical device company the leaner j j he said will remain diversified by providing products for a range of diseases and based on various technologies from cellular therapy to robotic assisted surgery the remaining j j mr duato added will intensify efforts to create products that combine medical devices with drugs such as one in development that identifies lung tumors and then targets them with a cancer therapy another experimental product aims to treat bladder cancer patients using a device that delivers a drug the split mr duato said in an interview is going to create two strong companies with fit for purpose models for the changing trajectory of health rival drugmakers have also been shedding units selling cough pills daily vitamins and skin lotions in recent years in 2019 pfizer and glaxosmithkline combined their over the counter businesses into a joint venture gsk consumer healthcare which sells pain medicine advil merck sold its consumer business which makes coppertone sunscreen to bayer ag for 14 2 billion in 2014 for j j the covid 19 pandemic has accelerated the divergent potential of its pharmaceutical and consumer businesses and intensified discussions among board members about separating them mr gorsky said

antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced the presentation of three posters at the society for immunotherapy of cancer sitc annual meeting in washington d c antengene is very pleased to present preclinical data on two of our phase i programs for atg 101 and atg 017 at the 2021 sitc meeting on november 12 2021 the unique mechanisms promising preclinical safety and activity of these exciting new compounds are very much in keeping with antengene s mission to develop first in class best in class medicines for cancer said jay mei m d ph d founder chairman and chief executive officer of antengene dr mei continued these presentations also highlight the breadth and depth of antengene s drug development capabilities the antengene management team and i look forward to reviewing these posters detailed below and the company s exciting portfolio at our upcoming r d day planned for november 16th virtual details below and november 18th in person details below summary of poster presentations poster 893 atg 101 active in cold tumors no preclinical liver toxicity atg 101 is a pd l1 4 1bb bi specific antibody that was designed to activate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and inhibit immune checkpoints without inducing liver toxicity antengene presented data from in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluated atg 101 activity in several t cell activation assays and multiple in vivo models including those resistant to anti pd l 1 therapies data in the poster showed that atg 101 was active in anti pd l1 resistant and relapsed tumor models in addition atg 101 increased the activation of t cells and exhausted t cells upon pd l1 crosslinking required for atg 101 activity rendering cold tumors hot importantly atg 101 showed no liver toxicity in a glp toxicity study differentiating the drug vs other 4 1bb targeted monoclonals bi specifics and did not induce cytokine release syndrome in an in vitro assay atg 101 s unique safety and efficacy properties make it a promising potential therapy for solid tumors and non hodgkins lymphoma poster 608 promising atg 017 in vivo combination study add to clinical strategy atg 017 is a potent small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting the extracellular signal related kinases 1 and 2 erk1 2 antengene presented data on an in vivo study that evaluated atg 017 in combination with an anti pd l1 monoclonal antibody atezolizumab in an aggressive immune checkpoint inhibitor resistant mouse cancer model data in the poster showed that the combination enhanced the antitumor efficacy as well as increasing the percentage of infiltrating cd8 t cells nk cells cd8 cd4 ratio and m1 m2 macrophage ratio in the tumor microenvironment rendering a cold tumor hot these results demonstrated that atg 017 has potential synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors providing a rationale for exploring combination therapy in the clinic in the pursuit of improved efficacy in solid tumors including those resistant to checkpoint inhibitions poster 227 computational analysis tool enables atg 101 clinical dose selection bispecific antibody atg 101 acts by forming a trimer comprised of atg 101 bound to pd l1 and 4 1bb expressing cells that activates tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and inhibits immune checkpoints measuring trimeric complexes is important in defining optimal clinical doses but is very challenging to do in the clinic antengene and its collaborators at applied biomath llc reported on the development of a computational semi mechanistic pharmacology model that could be used to define the clinical dose of atg 101 it works by simulating in vivo tumor growth inhibition and predicting trimer formation free drug levels and receptor occupancy over time this work has enabled antengene to define a clinically effective dose range of atg 101 that induces 90 pd l1 receptor occupancy a key metric of drug activity this valuable pharmacology tool which may also be applied across other compounds in antengene s pipeline reflects the company s enthusiasm to utilize novel technologies and partnerships to enhance drug development capabilities details on the posters published on the sitc website are shown below abstract number 227 title a computational semi

kinds of cancer atg 101 can activate anti tumor immune effectors by simultaneously blocking the binding of pd l1 pd 1 and inducing 4 1bb stimulation in pd l1 over expressed cancer cells atg 101 has shown potent pd l1 crosslinking dependent 4 1bb agonist activity thus potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy whilst mitigating risk of hepatoxicity antengene has received u s fda approval for the ind for a phase i trial of atg 101 in solid tumors and non hodgkins lymphoma and is currently conducting a phase i study of atg 101 in australia for the treatment of patients with metastatic advanced solid tumors and non hodgkin lymphoma about atg 017 atg 017 is a potent and selective small molecule extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 erk1 2 inhibitor erk1 2 are related protein serine threonine kinases that function as terminal kinases in the ras mapk signal transduction cascade this cascade regulates a large variety of cellular processes including proliferation the ras mapk pathway is dysregulated in more than 30 of human cancers with the most frequent alterations being observed in ras or braf genes across multiple tumor types an erk inhibitor enables the targeting of both ras and braf mutant diseases in nonclinical pharmacology studies atg 017 has demonstrated potent inhibition of erk1 2 enzyme activity and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo antengene is conducting

commentary the biden administration is trying to build alliances in asia to deter beijing from attacking taiwan but their measures are too weak at this late stage america can only lead through bold action on nov 7 reports emerged of china mocking up multiple targets on its missile range in the xinjiang region to appear as u s navy ships including two mock ford class u s aircraft carriers at least two mock arleigh burke class u s destroyers and a 246 foot moveable ship mounted on two 20 mile long rails set 20 feet apart to serve as a moving blue naval target for u s and chinese war planners alike the blue forces are the united states and the red forces are typically russian chinese or terrorist forces the ship on rails is 67 feet longer than a cyclone class u s patrol ship the chinese military s aggressive training in the xinjiang desert is just the latest in beijing s war preparations and territorial aggression including the taking of territory in the south china sea india and bhutan and the military pulsing of taiwanese and japanese islands despite xi jinping s reported war threats and no denials against taiwan australia the united states and the philippines the chinese communist party ccp leader had the audacity on nov 11 to complain in a quasi veiled manner about the united states and allies drawing ideological lines and forming small circles on geopolitical grounds xi said these efforts were bound to fail and he could be right if washington fails to get tougher and fast the asia pacific region cannot and should not relapse into the confrontation and division of the cold war era xi said without a bit of irony at his own hypocrisy he made the statement to a virtual summit of the asia pacific economic cooperation apec forum the leaders of which largely held their tongues due to trillions of dollars in investment and trade with china but xi s complaints show the direction that u s policy is starting to and should be taking stronger and more rigorous alliances in asia that explicitly require the taking of sides against beijing which the biden administration rejected as recently as august white house national security adviser jake sullivan speaks during the daily press briefing at the white house in washington on aug 23 2021 drew angerer getty images on nov 11 u s national security adviser jake sullivan signaled that the united states is now working on a framework for u s economic engagement in the region as part of the competition with china whether it s in the realm of supply chains or the intersection of climate and trade or digital or investment screening and export controls across a number of areas that have not traditionally been part of trade agreements we believe that there is the possibility of putting together a comprehensive vision and getting a whole bunch of countries aligned around that said sullivan as reported in the financial times this is clearly too vague for any superpower alliance worth its salt but when sullivan replied to a question about why the united states joined the aukus alliance with australia and the united kingdom he revealed an incipient hardening of the u s position toward a much needed quid pro quo for real allies that demonstrate their commitment in recent and tangible ways not just an indiscriminate u s security guarantee doled out to any country with paper treaties from the 1950s sullivan said the president wanted to say not just to australia but to the world that if you are a strong friend and ally and partner and you bet with us we will bet with you it s about a statement of putting your money where your mouth is when it comes to the rhetoric around alliances there are evidently circles of trust with aukus countries at the center five eyes which includes canada and new zealand and of course nato countries which adds most of continental europe and turkey japan and south korea can be added as america s most important allies in asia and india is in the process of joining as a member of the quadrilateral security dialogue the quad the philippines a treaty ally of the united states since 1951 is unfortunately heading away from the circle of trust because of its rejection of permanent u s military bases in the early 1990s and since 2016 president rodrigo duterte s crude and public rejection of washington and human rights in favor of beijing and vigilante tactics against criminals as each ally demonstrates different levels of commitment to the united states and the freedoms for which it stands through differing diplomatic economic and military policies on china and human rights each ally should be treated accordingly to incentivize all to close ranks and unify in their resolve to stop the ccp s aggression if one size fits all then u s allies have no incentive to stop playing and benefiting from both sides countries that explicitly identify the genocide in china reject huawei and welcome u s military bases to deter beijing should be rewarded with a better bet by the biden administration in sullivan s words those countries that fail to show such support will likely lose preferential american policies such as those enjoyed by australia when it was promised highly classified nuclear submarine propulsion technology by the united states and its closest ally britain nobody in the administration will say it out loud but all analysts in foreign policy know that duterte better not hold his breath in hopes of similar privileges despite sullivan s oblique wording this transactional approach is unfortunately the correct one and the only one that can counter beijing given the ccp s similar approach to international politics realpolitik is unfortunately replacing the liberal internationalism of the 1948 u n universal declaration of human rights because beijing is forcing the world in that direction gone is the naive idealism of former president barack obama who in 2016 asked duterte to side with the united states and follow human rights just because it was the right thing to do at the time china was promising tens of billions in infrastructure investment and according to my sources duterte s inner circle was receiving lucrative consulting contracts from beijing so duterte had personal reasons to side with the ccp and publicly call a sitting u s president a son of a whore at that beijing must have been popping champagne chinese leader xi jinping right and philippine president rodrigo duterte wave to members of the media after inspecting the honor guard during a welcoming ceremony at the malacanang palace in manila on nov 20 2018 ted aljibe afp getty images we could have done more to reverse that shocking deterioration in america s asian alliances without stronger economic repercussions duterte was apparently only financially compensated by following beijing that was a failure in american strategy that lost the philippines perhaps permanently as a true american ally since beijing and many heads of state globally have stooped to that level the united states is being forced to engage in its own forms of economic and technological competition with some of the same monetary and transfer tools that beijing uses this is unfortunate but it is the reality of navigating the peaks of human greed to be found among the world s statesmen and their closest associates still the biden administration s approach to alliance building is too little and too late to deter beijing from continuing its short term preparations for an attack on taiwan and long term plans for global hegemony as representative mike waltz r fla said on nov 9 xi and the ccp see weakness they smell weakness in this white house and they will continue to push and that is incredibly dangerous for the united states but also for the world waltz a former green beret who sits on the house armed services committee hit the nail on the head when he said the chinese communist party is preparing to be the dominant world superpower in the next decade and irony of it all the sad thing of it all is that they re doing it with our money with u s taxpayer dollars we re flowing billions right into beijing s stock market their economy and fueling their military buildup that our future soldiers and sailors and airmen may have to fight against views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and

why prices for wheat have climbed to their highest level since 2012 wheat prices have climbed above 8 a bushel for the first time in nearly nine years with demand for the commodity rising and supplies expected to end the 2021 2022 marketing year at their lowest in more than a decade global demand remains robust at record or near record levels with foreign buyers aggressively purchasing wheat supplies during the past several weeks says sal gilbertie president and chief investment officer at teucrium trading the u s department of agriculture estimates 2021 2022 u s wheat ending stocks at 583 million bushels the lowest since the 2007 2008 marketing year wheat supplies dropped after a drought in the northwestern u s plains reduced the production of hard red spring wheat and durum wheat says todd hultman lead analyst at commodity information and analysis provider dtn the usda estimates domestic 2021 2022 wheat production at 1 646 billion bushels down 10 from 2020 2021 the smallest crop in 19 years according to hultman the tight supplies have prompted a rise in wheat futures to their highest most active contract settlement since december 2012 on nov 10 prices wz21 0 18 w00 0 18 settled at 8 03 a bushel in chicago with prices for that session getting an added boost from a bloomberg report that russia may lift its grain export taxes wheat prices posted a fifth straight monthly gain in october wheat supplies have a tendency to be tight through the winter says hultman but predicting tops in markets where supplies are legitimately tight is difficult as markets can get emotional how high prices go will largely depend on how much of a bind end users get into as they make purchases in the next several months ahead he says spot prices for chicago wheat have the potential to trade above 9 hultman says to get much higher than that in 2022 the market needs to have more problems with drought in the spring a situation that we can t rule out yet on a global level the usda forecasts for 2021 2022 wheat ending stocks at 275 8 million metric tons down from an estimated 287 95 million metric tons in 2020 2021 the world has consumed more wheat than been produced in the last two years hence the shrinking ending stocks says jake hanley managing director and portfolio manager at teucrium demand is strong because wheat s primary use is for human consumption he says wheat prices held up well during the covid 19 lockdowns for the simple reason that people need to eat hanley says instead of ordering garlic bread at restaurants they bought wheat flour in bulk from costco in order to bake at home gilbertie meanwhile pointed out that fear of food insecurity in major wheat exporting countries like russia has some governments restricting or discouraging wheat exports during the coming winter making matters worse are poor weather conditions in many critical winter wheat producing areas including dryness in ukraine the middle east and the southwestern u s record high fertilizer prices also threaten to cut wheat planting and yields this spring which has wheat markets on edge right now he says even so higher wheat prices will be a small concern for consumers during the holidays says hultman the federal reserve bank of st louis pegged the price of a 1 pound pan of white bread at 1 58 in september about 6 higher than a year ago for wheat traders however it may be too late to take advantage of a potential winter boost in prices prices may go higher this winter as end users try to secure supplies but that doesn t make this a good bet hultman says buying wheat at its highest prices in nine years is not a very attractive risk reward ratio source marketwatch

the coming 2018 election is heating up in chilly minnesota where gop rep erik paulsen is being challenged by liquor millionaire and democrat dean phillips phillips has slammed paulsen for his investments in the fossil fuel industry however a look at phillip s balance sheet sheds light on the hypocritical charge phillips has staked out his campaign identity as an extreme environmentalist in a bid to first win the democratic primary to then challenge 5 term gop incumbent erik paulsen i care about the environment and i d like to see fewer cars burning fossil fuels he said at a may town hall with his voters anybody who argues that a carbon tax would kill jobs is simply fundamentally misguided as per the year 2013 report delivered by the non partisan congressional budget office a carbon tax would further damage the economy by moving up the prices of all the goods furthermore the people who are paying higher prices for the electricity and fuel a carbon tax would too lead to the lost wages and a decrease in the investment the increase in energy costs would also hit poor americans and the blue collar workers the hardest of all due to the largest decrease in demand for their products such a tax would have a negative effect on the economy the higher prices it caused would diminish the purchasing power of people s earnings effectively reducing their real inflation adjusted wages the report says lower real wages would have the net effect of reducing the amount that people worked thus decreasing the overall supply of labor investment would also decline further reducing the economy s total output phillips financial records further show that this environmentally conscious congress candidate has never had any problems with profiting from automakers or fossil fuels for that matter he has his investments summing up to 780000 and 2 million in the energy sector and the companies within while also investing heavily in the automobile industries phillips holds stocks that value up to 65000 and 150000 in energy transfer partners owner of the dakota access pipeline who went on to inspire several protests and the arrests from all the radical environmental activists phillips further focused on the republican s history of receiving huge donations from mega giants of oil exxon mobil a company which also is invested in by phillips while erik s taken money from the nra the koch brothers and exxon mobile dean isn t taking a dime the campaign had said in a fundraising email phillips has raised a sum of about 800 000 more than the all of the democratic field combined together more than 90 percent of contributions came from large individual contributions as per the center for responsive politics

a pizzeria in president joe biden s hometown wilmington recently took sparkling water off the menu because it got so pricey managers figured no one would buy it at the car dealership that biden s presidential motorcade occasionally passes when he comes to town sales people have had trouble keeping new vehicles in stock while prices for their used models have climbed ever higher in recent months each day is a new day we re not really sure what s going to happen in the business or in the economy when we wake up in the morning said jim ursomarso vice president of union park automotive the wave of inflation that s swept the united states this year as covid 19 vaccines have helped businesses reopen and consumers spend has spared no part of the country not even wilmington the city that has provided a backdrop for much of biden s political career voters in the mid atlantic city gave biden seven times more votes than his predecessor donald trump in last year s election but business owners now fret as prices rise and public approval in his administration falls here in delaware he s loved but as time has gone by we have been lacking the reciprocation said serena kelley jefferson co owner of serena s soulfood whose mother cooked for biden and who recently took crab balls off her menu because they became too costly to serve profitably inflation was predicted to increase as the us economy recovered in 2021 but a wednesday report from the labor department showing the consumer price index last month experienced its biggest year on year gain in more than three decades was an unwelcome surprise this year s initial price spikes were most severe for products like used cars and airplane tickets the latest data however showed them extending into groceries and gasoline with ripple effects across the economy after the pandemic this was the worst thing that could happen to small businesses especially restaurants said gianni esposito whose eponymous pizza parlor has received biden repeatedly including on the day he began his latest presidential campaign in 2019 now you cannot find a lot of employees everything you have to buy it s 30 40 50 percent more expensive as of friday poll amalgamator fivethirtyeight put biden s approval rating at 42 8 percent lower than all other presidents at this point in their terms except for two i didn t vote for him but i wasn t against him like i am now said candice gronski 50 an accountant living just over the state line in pennsylvania who typically votes republican but felt like biden nonetheless failed to meet her expectations the us inflation rate has been muted for years and the latest price increases are driven by a mix of factors that might not have occurred without the pandemic supply chains are snarled worldwide thanks to the disruptions caused by covid 19 while energy costs have risen after global oil prices briefly went negative in 2020 in the united states american consumers are flush with cash and spending it with the help of three rounds of stimulus checks and an expanded government social safety net that both trump and biden approved but businesses haven t been able to keep up since many people who could work have decided not to meanwhile the global semiconductor shortage has slowed down production across a range of industries including the auto sector driving prices higher the increases may well hamper biden s push for an expansion of the country s social services costing 1 85 trillion over 10 years following the latest inflation report joe manchin a centrist senator whose vote is crucial to getting the bill through congress warned the threat posed by record inflation to the american people is not transitory and is instead getting worse as he filled up his car with gasoline that was upwards of a dollar more expensive per gallon then it was a year ago phil johnson said inflation wasn t affecting his life biden inherited a lot of this when he took office in january the 32 year old worker in the financial sector said the stimulus checks won t last forever and inflation can t stay at six percent

oncology today announced the presentation of three posters at the society for immunotherapy of cancer sitc annual meeting in washington d c antengene is very pleased to present preclinical data on two of our phase i programs for atg 101 and atg 017 at the 2021 sitc meeting on november 12 2021 the unique mechanisms promising preclinical safety and activity of these exciting new compounds are very much in keeping with antengene s mission to develop first in class best in class medicines for cancer said jay mei m d ph d founder chairman and chief executive officer of antengene dr mei continued these presentations also highlight the breadth and depth of antengene s drug development capabilities the antengene management team and i look forward to reviewing these posters detailed below and the company s exciting portfolio at our upcoming r d day planned for november 16th virtual details below and november 18th in person details below summary of poster presentations poster 893 atg 101 active in cold tumors no preclinical liver toxicity atg 101 is a pd l1 4 1bb bi specific antibody that was designed to activate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and inhibit immune checkpoints without inducing liver toxicity antengene presented data from in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluated atg 101 activity in several t cell activation assays and multiple in vivo models including those resistant to anti pd l 1 therapies data in the poster showed that atg 101 was active in anti pd l1 resistant and relapsed tumor models in addition atg 101 increased the activation of t cells and exhausted t cells upon pd l1 crosslinking required for atg 101 activity rendering cold tumors hot importantly atg 101 showed no liver toxicity in a glp toxicity study differentiating the drug vs other 4 1bb targeted monoclonals bi specifics and did not induce cytokine release syndrome in an in vitro assay atg 101 s unique safety and efficacy properties make it a promising potential therapy for solid tumors and non hodgkins lymphoma poster 608 promising atg 017 in vivo combination study add to clinical strategy atg 017 is a potent small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting the extracellular signal related kinases 1 and 2 erk1 2 antengene presented data on an in vivo study that evaluated atg 017 in combination with an anti pd l1 monoclonal antibody atezolizumab in an aggressive immune checkpoint inhibitor resistant mouse cancer model data in the poster showed that the combination enhanced the antitumor efficacy as well as increasing the percentage of infiltrating cd8 t cells nk cells cd8 cd4 ratio and m1 m2 macrophage ratio in the tumor microenvironment rendering a cold tumor hot these results demonstrated that atg 017 has potential synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors providing a rationale for exploring combination therapy in the clinic in the pursuit of improved efficacy in solid tumors including those resistant to checkpoint inhibitions poster 227 computational analysis tool enables atg 101 clinical dose selection bispecific antibody atg 101 acts by forming a trimer comprised of atg 101 bound to pd l1 and 4 1bb expressing cells that activates tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and inhibits immune checkpoints measuring trimeric complexes is important in defining optimal clinical doses but is very challenging to do in the clinic antengene and its collaborators at applied biomath llc reported on the development of a computational semi mechanistic pharmacology model that could be used to define the clinical dose of atg 101 it works by simulating in vivo tumor growth inhibition and predicting trimer formation free drug levels and receptor occupancy over time this work has enabled antengene to define a clinically effective dose range of atg 101 that induces 90 pd l1 receptor occupancy a key metric of drug activity this valuable pharmacology tool which may also be applied across other compounds in antengene s pipeline reflects the company s enthusiasm to utilize novel technologies and partnerships to enhance drug development capabilities details on the posters published on the sitc website are shown below abstract number 227 title a computational semi

kinds of cancer atg 101 can activate anti tumor immune effectors by simultaneously blocking the binding of pd l1 pd 1 and inducing 4 1bb stimulation in pd l1 over expressed cancer cells atg 101 has shown potent pd l1 crosslinking dependent 4 1bb agonist activity thus potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy whilst mitigating risk of hepatoxicity antengene has received u s fda approval for the ind for a phase i trial of atg 101 in solid tumors and non hodgkins lymphoma and is currently conducting a phase i study of atg 101 in australia for the treatment of patients with metastatic advanced solid tumors and non hodgkin lymphoma about atg 017 atg 017 is a potent and selective small molecule extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 erk1 2 inhibitor erk1 2 are related protein serine threonine kinases that function as terminal kinases in the ras mapk signal transduction cascade this cascade regulates a large variety of cellular processes including proliferation the ras mapk pathway is dysregulated in more than 30 of human cancers with the most frequent alterations being observed in ras or braf genes across multiple tumor types an erk inhibitor enables the targeting of both ras and braf mutant diseases in nonclinical pharmacology studies atg 017 has demonstrated potent inhibition of erk1 2 enzyme activity and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo antengene is conducting

last month boston s acting mayor kim janey began clearing an encampment of homeless people near the intersection of massachusetts avenue and melnea cass boulevard commonly known as mass and cass around 300 people stayed in tents in the area at its peak with many accessing nearby addiction treatment services janey s office has claimed that it is committed to maintaining a public health approach in confronting this complex challenge focused on connecting individuals to shelter providing substance use disorder and mental health services expanding low threshold housing providing safe road and sidewalk access and enforcing laws against those who prey on the vulnerable or present a danger to themselves or others however news reports statements by public health experts and a lawsuit from the state affiliate of the american civil liberties union aclu reveal that the constitutional rights of mass and cass residents are being infringed upon while their access to life saving treatment is being interrupted the tents of a homeless camp line the sidewalk in area commonly known as mass and cass saturday oct 23 2021 in boston ap photo michael dwyer the massachusetts aclu s filing notes that after the mayor s executive order declaring that tents would no longer be allowed on city sidewalks the city and its agents began dispersing people encamped at mass cass under threat of arrest and destroying many of their possessions contrary to basic constitutional guarantees while some homeless people have been referred to shelters the aclu notes that many shelters are not equipped for people with certain medical conditions or family situations moreover during a pandemic throwing more people into congregate settings risks deadlier outbreaks pine street inn to which people have been referred said it would be offering beds if available once those are filled we will provide mats in our lobbies and chairs in our dining room for those who are not enticed by the prospect of sleeping in a chair in a homeless shelter s dining room the city has a protocol in place to allow for arresting people for the crime of disorderly conduct that is refusing to leave mass and cass the threat of criminal prosecution either for failing to leave one s belongings with a city worker in the hope that they are returned upon exiting a shelter or for outstanding warrants some for petty crimes like drug possession hangs over people s heads and can make them reluctant to seek out needed services the city has convened a special court nominally to direct people with warrants into treatment however public defenders and the prosecutor suffolk district attorney rachael rollins both say that this court has sent more people to jail than to treatment the boston globe noted of the nine people in the court s first three days only two went to treatment according to court officials four others were jailed and sent to jurisdictions that had outstanding warrants on them they included a 33 year old gardner man sent to a worcester jail experiencing a covid 19 outbreak over the objections of the prosecutor as well his public defender dr benjamin linas who teaches medicine at boston university and is an infectious disease physician at boston medical center and dr joshua barocas who teaches medicine at the university of colorado wrote an opinion column in the globe revealing that their statistical models published in clinical infectious diseases indicate that the clearing of mass and cass far from helping those who currently live there will be a public health disaster while some in the short term will receive treatment either voluntarily or because it is court ordered it will represent a disruption for everyone who has been living at mass and cass such disruptions decrease access to necessary services including harm reduction programs and addiction treatment some who are currently receiving medication for opioid use disorder will have their treatment interrupted leaving them vulnerable to an overdose others who receive mandated care often cease receiving care when they are no longer required to likewise leaving them vulnerable to an overdose particularly because their tolerance has been lowered linas and barocas project an immediate 20 40 percent overdose increase due to the clearing a 12 percent increase in overdose mortality in the year following and fewer people receiving treatment for opioid use disorder hospitalizations are projected to increase by double digits for endocarditis and for overdoses a staggering 46 percent in the latter case other public health experts have also criticized the clearing of mass and cass the public health human rights for mass and cass coalition which includes the massachusetts society of addiction medicine boston medical center s grayken center for addiction medicine and the fxb center for health and human rights at the harvard t h chan school of public health among others issued a statement declaring public health crises require public health solutions thoughtfully pointing to the stakes involved the statement continued we support a plan that treats people with dignity that meets people s stated needs in the short and long term and that relies on evidence based practices of low threshold housing voluntary treatment and harm reduction not involuntary commitment and criminalization which risk even more death dr sarah e wakeman who is the medical director for substance use disorders at mass general brigham hospital told a news conference near mass and cass it is my medical opinion that displacing people offering them ultimatums that include only congregate shelters medically supervised withdrawal or being funneled into a correctional setting will worsen the public health crisis that we are seeing leading to more overdoses and hiv infections cassie hurd executive director of material aid and advocacy program which advocates for homeless people told the same news conference about the limitations of shelters and their warehouse and jail like environment she also noted according to the globe that earlier in the pandemic the city and state rented hotel rooms for quarantining purposes and that the same could be done in this public health crisis hotel rooms would give residents of mass and cass some autonomy and dignity while they can access services if desired although property owners near hotels have objected leaving the proposal stillborn new york city which had a similar program has canceled it and moved thousands from hotel rooms into crowded shelters and the streets the situation at mass and cass is a microcosm of the social crisis across the us and internationally even as a few hundred vulnerable people are forced off the streets in a crackdown and shuttled off to jails or crowded shelters the boston area has seen a bonanza in wealth in the pharmaceutical and technological industries during the pandemic the rising stock price of cambridge based moderna which is jealously guarding intellectual property rights to its mrna covid 19 vaccine has minted many millionaires while restaurant payment processor toast s initial public
