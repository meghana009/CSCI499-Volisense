we ve had so many new celebrity brands in such a short period of time that this was the straw that broke the camel s back says awa who wants celebrities to stop creating beauty brands just because they can why not collaborate with people who are doing the work why not invest in some of these innovative independent brands that can t get funding skincare is big business in the us alone sales revenue for prestige skincare was us6 3 billion last year according to market research firm npd but although celebrity brands enjoy instant awareness and an edge in capturing that first sale the products need to work for consumers to come back says larissa jensen beauty industry adviser at npd creating a loyal consumer is what will drive long term success scarlett johansson recently launched the outset her limited range of vegan skincare products skincare became huge during the pandemic lockdowns palermino says because people were looking at themselves on zoom calls all day and seeing skincare content on tiktok and instagram i think business advisers came to them with deals showing them the explosive growth of the skincare market and the potential revenue and they subsequently capitalised on the expanded interest palermino says now stars such as former talk show host ellen degeneres and stranger things teen millie bobby brown are among an expanding class of big names that have their own skincare lines rhianna centre arrives for the fenty beauty brand birthday party she hosted at sydney s overseas passenger terminal in october 2018 wolter peeters launched in 2017 rihanna s fenty beauty may not have been the first celebrity led beauty brand mccormack says but it may have started the recent tsunami fenty was really well executed and was so involved in being the face of the brand it did very well that partly laid the groundwork for other stars thinking they could do it too she says but for kevin james bennett a cosmetic developer and makeup artist there s only one way to describe the proliferation a cash grab bennett made headlines in august when he called out kylie jenner for a photo she shared on instagram with her 370 million followers in which she posed in an active manufacturing lab with her hair down and no gloves or a mask jenner countered his claims saying the photos were not actually taken in a manufacturing facility bennett responded that she was standing on a platform looking into a homogenising kettle of complexion product in one of the images bennett say he thinks that celebrities like jenner often get away with skirting industry regulations including making unsubstantiated marketing claims look at kate moss new line her brand is saying their signature extract can turn back the clock 20 years in four weeks really where are the clinicals advertisement the differences between some of these famous name skincare brands can be nearly indistinguishable according to lalita iyer a cosmetic chemist and product formulator they re made by the same contract manufacturers who take one of their stock formulations and just tweak it slightly like add 0 1 per cent of fairy dust and call it a new brand she says there is also concern over many of these brands sustainability claims says ann oh a beauty critic known as minsooky on social media kim kardashian s skkn brand for instance boasts sustainability and eco friendly materials in its initial press release there are outliers though model hailey bieber s rhode skincare line is cited as being a head above the rest but if you compare the actual products versus refills it s literally just an additional container that surrounds the refill creating more plastic waste in my opinion not less oh says brad pitt s brand le domaine sells refills but they are literally just the same product sold without a cap the press materials for le domaine which is co owned by winemaker marc perrin who shares ownership in pitt s château miraval a french estate and vineyard also state that the brand found ways to upcycle grape pomace the end product from the winemaking process kim kardashian s rebrand of her previous kkw beauty line skkn launched in june skkn instagram yet jason ruppert vigneron for ardure wines in california says pomace usually goes to a compost management facility where it is turned into soil or is used for chicken feed or for the vineyard s own compost which helps with regeneration the following year in other words pomace doesn t need to be upcycled vi lai a beauty influencer known on tiktok as whatsonvisface thinks many celebrity founders underestimate today s beauty consumer they are so out of touch because they don t take into consideration how much more educated and savvy the average skincare consumer is these days she says they think they can just slap their name on a product line and everyone will buy it a bigger issue according to lai is the lack of transparency in cosmetic surgeries and other treatments famous people selling skincare may have undergone she said it s harmful if celebrities deny they ve had botox and plastic surgery and then sell products that suggest fans will have similar results all while their own instagram pages are populated with heavily edited photos tiara willis an aesthetician and influencer thinks these brands have a specific audience celebrity skincare is more about creating merchandise for their fans than trying to innovate she says i just don t see their intention being to add something of value to the skincare community advertisement there are outliers though willis palermino and lai mention model hailey bieber s rhode skincare line as seeming a head above the rest bieber who launched her brand this june contacted lai and other skincare creators including palermino two years ago for advice she came off as very well researched and like the skincare line was a real passion project says lai who also commended bieber for her team s diversity and knowledge base lai and palermino also name pharrell williams humanrace skincare line which he launched with his longtime dermatologist elena jones in 2020 as an exception go back to interviews from 10 years ago and you ll find pharrell talking about skincare palermino says it s just that when you re a celebrity coming out of nowhere with a skincare line it seems like there s little respect for people s intelligence despite the fact pitt did an interview with british vogue about le domaine and appears in the promotional photos co owner perrin says they don t see their newest venture as a celebrity brand i know it can look strange when you have such a celebrity on board but we have been working together for more than 10 years now and we are willing to build something that is for the long term he says perrin says he is confused by the negative reactions he has seen on social media and in the press these are people who have never tried the products or seen them he says regardless the negative attention doesn t seem to be hurting le domaine s bottom line we were very impressed that we made in two days what we had planned for three months perrin says le domaine has plans to launch an essentials collection which will be at a more accessible price point next year straight talking from australia dr michele squire phd qualified scientist science educator and founder of qr8 mediskin here s a real truth bomb at the end of the day cosmetic skincare products can t really change skin all that much yes the serums moisturisers eye creams toners essences and masks in celebrity skincare ranges can temporarily make skin look smooth glazed and hydrated but they do this by adding water to the skin and holding it there which any moisturiser serum mask will do for a lot less than a celeb endorsed product temporarily plumping the skin shouldn t be confused with anti ageing so there s no need to spend big bucks on the celebrity versions when something from the pharmacy or supermarket will do just as good a job in fact if you can get over the grease factor plain old vaseline is the best moisturiser there is reducing water loss from the skin by a whopping 60 to 70 per cent more than lanolin and increasing the skin s own production of proteins and enzymes that help skin repair its own barrier structure washington post

in june 2020 but this also gave many chefs a break chefs in the first year of lockdown started spending time with kids and it was like wow i m actually teaching my kid to ride a bike here fassnidge said behind the entertaining tough love of kitchen nightmares australia which rated well in his first week is the brutal reality of extremely heavy pressure on chefs and restaurant owners fassnidge said the pressure maybe greater on australians running hospitality businesses than anywhere else in the world a little light went on for many of them should i be with my family or in the kitchen fassnidge said just last week he bumped into a former chef de partie from a sydney restaurant he was head chef at do restaurants fail because of poor food the rank food served up by struggling chefs is the focus of kitchen nightmares australia but the show s star critic colin fassnidge admits there is a bigger factor in the failure of cafes and restaurants than food quality while food is a defining factor service is probably more important he told daily mail australia i think service is hugely important he said if there s a problem with the food good front of house staff will pick it up and fix the problem before the customers leave the building if someone gets an entre they didn t like they should get them a great dessert it s better than that person leaving and never coming back and complaining to their friends while chefs tend to get all the accolades front of house staff are the unsung heroes they are just as important advertisement he had trained as an electrician then worked as a chef and he s gone back to working as an electrician during covid his wife had a new baby and he said i want to see my kid grow up it takes some balls to change career but if you re sleeping better at night because of it then that s all that matters he seemed happy i totally get it fassnidge said the pressure maybe greater on australians running hospitality businesses than anywhere else in the world in australia you ve got other factors rest of the world don t have he said if you have a restaurant on the south coast or up north you ve been dealing with fires and floods and drought or the pandemic it feels everything is stacked against you for years now imagine you re in a holiday destination and a fire comes through town my god there goes the family business a common issue he comes across in encountering failing cafes and restaurants is people who put their life and savings in without realising how hard it will get the saddest thing is people going into restaurants thinking its a romantic thing to do he said everyone loves to eat out and they think i d love to cook my food for people but you get in there and the dream turns into a nightmare it becomes a 16 hour a day job every day if it s not really your passion it can suck the life out of you people keep throwing more money more money on top of their problems and before you know it they re losing their house fassnidge feels lucky that after 30 years in kitchens he has transitioned out of only working in kitchens i m in a lucky position where i have my feet in both worlds i have the stuff in the media too fassnidge said filming kitchen nightmares australia was eye opening at mumma joe s diner west of the nsw blue mountains fassnidge called the cheese in a dog dog rank then spat out an elvis burger before helping the owners to relaunch he said most australian cafes and restaurants do everything by the book but the show deliberately showcased a handful that did not it was right up my alley i still get shocked at some of the bad procedures health and food out there sometimes it s funny but a lot of the time it s just annoying so many try so hard to do things properly but some don t seem to care advertisement to be honest it s disrespectful to customers

hikes deputy governor says the reserve bank of australia has more flexibility on the size and timing of rate increases because its board holds more meetings compared to other central banks in the region rba deputy governor michele bullock said it is able to achieve similar tightening with smaller individual rate increases bullock said speaking at the australian finance industry association the central bank s board members said they recognized the benefits of a smaller increase according to minutes released from rba s october 4 meeting where it raised its cash rate by 25 basis points a smaller increase than that agreed at preceding meetings was warranted given that the cash rate had been increased substantially in a short period of time and the full effect of that increase lay ahead

in the race to be vermont s next lieutenant governor david zuckerman and joe benning met earlier this month for another debate before voters make their choice on nov 8 the two candidates differed on topics ranging from housing and act 250 to guns the first subject of the evening was how each candidate would work to fix housing shortages benning a republican state senator representing caledonia went first in this final debate of the vtdigger debate series and said he is against a new government registry on rental properties in the state i would say there is a place for public private partnership but i oppose that registry because i don t believe it s appropriate for the state of vermont to take over people s property he said and when you establish a registry there s only one reason that you are doing that you are looking to have as much as you can have on what is out there from a private perspective and then you obviously bring something kind of regulation to get that to where you want it to be it s not the function of government to provide housing stock that s the function of private persons he added noting most public housing does not currently have public funding going into it benning also said he worked with the governor s office to secure 90 million for housing however not enough new projects are currently ready to start our current predicament is we don t have shovel ready projects ready to go he said zuckerman a democrat said that sen patrick leahy d vt is largely responsible for helping the state obtain the 90 million from the federal government that benning had mentioned he also suggested the government can have more roles in housing regulation if it s public dollars i do think there is a reasonable expectation that there be limits on some of the potential price increases zuckerman said if it s affordable housing will it be perpetually affordable he said he supports a statewide rental registry and he does not see it as government overreach i have a rental property it s registered with the city of burlington he said we are inspected every few years to make sure that it is safe for the occupants it is not the city taking over my property or telling me what to do zuckerman added that having a registry would help the state make better plans for the future in regard to new developments village centers vs sprawl development each candidate was asked whether they favor policies that encourage sprawling development or village centers zuckerman said that developing village centers will spur the local economy the state could both support infrastructure investments sewer and water lines to help encourage development in those town and village centers he said that would reduce sprawl that would rebuild our small rural communities potentially increasing the number of people living in areas that have the country store be able to thrive or a hardware store or a small mechanic shop according to zuckerman act 250 the state s land use law that many critics believe is too burdensome is the reason vermont has maintained its rural character over the years benning agreed that act 250 has served a role in maintaining vermont s character however he said that doesn t mean there isn t room for reform there have been impediments placed in front of developers who have become very frustrated as a result and have been begging us to make simple changes that might enable them to better serve vermonters he said one is at the front end how does a developer know and understand whether or not a given project will meet the act 250 criteria he said the other is at the back end and frankly the people that i have talked to have found this to be the worst part of it when an act 250 permit is granted and then appealed the appellate process can last for many months if not years and the expense to developers is extremely high health care guns and more on health care zuckerman is open to the idea of looking into a single payer model as had been previously considered in the past in contrast benning suggested a one payer model for a single state could be too costly when debating proposals to have state requirements for keeping guns locked away benning said such policies put many thousands of vermonters at risk during a crisis and police are often up to a half hour away when danger strikes zuckerman proposed state funding for professional grade gun lockers he s also for increased waiting periods for purchases through background checks each candidate weighed in on the randolph high school controversy where a transgender student identifying as female was using the girls locker room both candidates agreed that the students involved are not getting enough say in the public debate and each pledged to continue

a bill creating a legal framework for the territory to begin accepting digital currency but what does this mean for the gambling industry which relies on a strong local privacy framework and a steady supply of gamblers macau one of china s two special administrative regions sar tends to be the more obedient territory than its cousin the erstwhile british territory of hong kong macau is smaller and more focused its entire economy is based around gambling while macau is an autonomous legal jurisdiction after all gambling is illegal in mainland china there s not the same interest in contesting beijing s rule as in hong kong because of the divergent history of the two sars consider census data from 2016 shows that just over 55 of hong kong can speak english while less than 1 of macau speaks portuguese but local law still prevails in macau which has what unsw australia faculty of law professor graham greenleaf called some of the strongest data protection laws in asia in a 2014 paper on the topic there s a ban on recording images and sounds in casinos and in 2019 macau s director of gaming inspection warned casino operators that their use of facial recognition rfid enabled casino chips and digitally enabled baccarat tables all of which are used to give the house an edge must conform to macau s personal data protection law consent for collection would be required as would best practices like removing personally identifiable information before sending it to a third party gamblers prefer discretion advertisement advertisement but that s macanese law of which beijing respects but doesn t approve beijing doesn t want to be seen as rescinding the guarantees of autonomy it promised with the basic law of macau the territory s mini constitution but at the same time it doesn t want its people gambling there in 2021 china s criminal law was amended with a supranational flavor gambling is now illegal for its citizens overseas later in 2021 china s ministry of culture and tourism banned the organizing of tour groups to cross border gambling tourist destinations which includes macau and other regional gambling hubs like sihanoukville cambodia macau embracing china s digital currency is the logical conclusion of all of this macau s own currency isn t widely used even at home as it pegs the hong kong dollar 1 1 to the macanese pataca with the hkd being the currency of choice on casino floors there s a precedent to using a foreign currency for gambling so there s not much of a leap required to embrace a version of china s digital currency in the territory digital currency as a tool for oversight and for beijing it gives bureaucrats as well as law enforcement much more granular insight into the gambling industry while bypassing macau s strong privacy laws beijing knows it can t eliminate the gambling industry entirely in macau because it would decimate the local economy so better off controlling it instead via its central bank digital currency foreign nationals may be allowed to keep using cash but chinese nationals would need to use this digital currency in order to keep being allowed at casinos advertisement advertisement macau has nothing to lose once upon a time at the peak of china s boom the territory netted more gambling revenue than las vegas but covid 19 changed things macau s casinos are estimated to bring in 680 million in revenue

the center square illinois gov j b pritzker and republican challenger darren bailey have largely avoided specifics regarding plans to address the state s growing pension burden ahead of the nov 8 election libertarian candidate scott schluter the only other gubernatorial candidate on the ballot has offered a more detailed plan on how he would address the issues surrounding the state s five underfunded pension systems schluter a diesel technician from southern illinois trails his opponents in both campaign fundraising and polling none of the candidates would push for changes to the state constitution to reduce promised pension benefits all three have ruled out such a move and have vowed to make good on the state s pension promises despite decades of underfunding by state lawmakers even as the cost of pensions continues to eat up more of the state s general fund budget the state s most recent budget report notes that annual pension contributions account for about 25 of the state s general fund spending the fiscal year 2023 budget funds the certified pension contribution of 9 63 billion from the general fund according to the report addressing the state s pension costs had been a topic of frequent discussion in springfield for years after the illinois supreme court ruled a 2013 law designed to stabilize state pension costs was unconstitutional the justices ruled that it violated the state constitution s pension protection clause however with an influx of billions of dollars in federal money amid the covid 19 pandemic pressure to deal with the growing pension costs and unfunded liabilities has faded said bill bergman a lecturer for the quinlan school of business at loyola university chicago who has four decades of financial market experience in both the public and private sector it was on the tips of tongues for a while until the covid pandemic arrived and the massive infusion of federal funds bergman said and i think we re going to have those discussions again in coming years both pritzker and bailey a state senator from xenia provided few details about how they plan to tackle the problem during the first gubernatorial debate this month schluter did not participate in the debate if i would have been governor for the last four years we wouldn t be having this conversation bailey said at the debate and every state employee whether they re earning their pension or whether they re living off it would feel comfortable and they wouldn t have to worry about that each and every day bailey said state workers are concerned about the future of their promised payments under state run pension systems that political elites and union bosses have hacked the system for far too long bailey mentioned switching new hires to 401 k style defined contribution plans rather than defined benefit plans he also said he would not infringe on pensioners benefits bailey said the state budget contained 10 billion to 15 billion in waste that he would use to put the state on a path to firmer financial ground the state s democrat controlled legislature passed a 46 billion general fund budget for fiscal year 2023 pritzker used his time during the debate to reiterate his stance that state pensions are a promise that he plans to fulfill i m pleased to say that we ve made real progress on our statewide pensions pritzker said pritzker said he reduced the state s net pension liability during his term as governor through good investments and by putting more money in the state s pension systems the governor also said he expanded the state s pension buyout program which has helped save money for taxpayers the pension buyout program has saved the state money but not near enough to dig taxpayers out of pension debt bergman said the state reported a net pension liability of 151 871 billion as of june 30 2021 that s up from a net pension liability of 133 570 billion as of june 30 2018 according to the state s annual financial documents other state documents show net pension liabilities have declined it looks like the liability for the state based on its share of the plans rose even as the total for the plans declined bergman said bergman said televised debates aren t optimal for discussing issues like the state s unfunded pension liabilities this is a deep complex issue and the sound bites we get are sometimes hard to square with reality in part because it s hard to put reality in so many short words he said bergman also said it s difficult for any candidate to have a comprehensive plan to put the state s pensions on a sustainable path well it s hard to have a solid plan given the magnitude of the shortfall and as a result i don t think we have a solid plan that s out there he said pritzker s campaign website says that the governor has reduced state pension liabilities by fully funding pension contributions going above and beyond with payments his campaign did not respond to questions about what he would do during a possible second term as governor to address the state s underfunded pension systems actuaries have said that the state s statutory funding method is inadequate to address the state s pension liabilities according to letters included in pension reports bailey s campaign website doesn t include the state s pension system in its issues section and his campaign did not respond to a request for details about his plans to address the cost of promised pensions or the state s pension liabilities schluter outlined his plan for the state s pensions on his campaign website if elected schluter said he would work to close the general assembly retirement system of illinois which is the retirement system for state lawmakers at 21 3 gars has the lowest funded ratio of the state s five pension systems he said that if state lawmakers insist on taxpayer funded retirement benefits he will push for 401 k style plans for members of the general assembly schluter further said that he would move state pensions to the private economy by working with lawmakers to build a plan that will honor current contracts while phasing out the public pension system his plan for that would be to offer only 401 k or similar private plans to new hires give existing employees the option to leave the pension systems and save for retirement through a self managed plan offer optional 401 k to existing

bloomberg is there too much esg regulation or should there be more that s among the topics covered in the bloomberg esg survey it s not long and we don t collect your name or any contact information click here to share your views professional investors think the asset managers looking after their esg allocations need more regulations to rein them in a recent survey by pwc showed that 71 of institutional investors want stronger esg regulatory requirements to guide the actions of the fund management industry the hope is that extra rules can act as an important lever to build trust and decrease the risk of mislabeling pwc wrote the issue of how to treat esg fund labels is growing increasingly thorny in the us the securities and exchange commission has proposed rules that would require firms to provide more data to justify the environmental social and governance labels they use in the european union asset managers are struggling to keep up with regulations that are based on an unclear definition of sustainable investment and have already reclassified hundreds of funds amid widespread confusion meanwhile fund managers are trying to keep up with demand for sustainable investment products by reclassifying thousands of old products to fit with the eu s sustainable finance disclosure regulation an analysis by pwc shows that of 8 017 so called article 8 funds an eu designation that requires a product to promote sustainability only 989 were new at the end of the second quarter the rest were reclassified a similar analysis of 1 061 article 9 funds whereby a product needs to have sustainability as its objective showed that only 286 were new as lawyers warn of the potential legal risks attached to reclassifying renaming or mislabeling an esg fund clients are trying to make sense of the esg claims made by their portfolio managers yet there s also a risk that extra regulations are drawing fund managers resources away from much needed strategic planning and product development pwc said our survey finds that regulatory and compliance costs have increased by more than 10 the consulting firm said this development favors large asset managers with the scale and resources to absorb these extra demands and spread the costs for others it creates a barrier to entry or puts further pressure on an already squeezed middle for more on esg news click on top

us has taken a step back on the regulatory front following california s gender quotas being struck down and the challenge facing nasdaq s rule japan trails on gender diversity but new pay gap disclosure rules might provide some support low us risk the us asset management industry continues to have subdued policy risk both in terms of legislation and regulation and that trend will continue into next year most of the already released regulatory proposals focus on transparency which may lead to small increases in compliance and technology spending in a worst case scenario which has a low probability of occurring the sec may embark on a new definition for family offices that would increase their regulatory burdens new reporting rules for private equity funds are unlikely to affect fees

exploitation and corruption drive social injustice around the world governments tackling these issues are realizing that to solve them they need to first define and measure them some are turning to so called taxonomies that establish which economic practices and products are harmful to the planet and which aren t the idea is the price of goods and services must reflect the human and environmental cost of both production and disposal which in turn would spur much needed change but designing a code is fiendishly difficult double materiality should a business or an investment fund care only about making money or should it also worry about the environment social justice and good governance can the two goals overlap do they already these questions get at the heart of something called double

issue is what information should be mandatory to report and who decides esg loans virtue can bring rewards as more companies are discovering when they reach out for a loan some banks offer borrowers

use reuse and reuse again and again abc you ve probably heard of esg and may know it as a form of investing and finance that involves considering material financial risks from environmental factors social issues and questions of corporate governance if you re like most people you re probably not clear on the difference between esg and socially responsible investing impact investing and similar sometimes overlapping approaches in part because esg has come to mean different things to different people that vagueness has helped fuel rapid growth in recent years but accompanying those gains has

munis were slightly better to kick off the week while u s treasuries were firmer 10 years and in and equities rallied municipal triple a yields fell one to three basis points monday while ust saw the 10 and 30 year end the session just above 4 municipal bond yields decoupled from the treasury market last week ending basically unchanged said nuveen strategists anders s persson and john v miller ratios on monday showed further richness for munis muni ust ratios saw the three year on monday at 67 the five year was at 70 the 10 year at 78 and the 30 year at 93 according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the three at 66 the five at 70 the 10 at 80 and the 30 at 93 at a 4 p m read last week s calendar was very light due to the holiday shortened week and the release of the consumer price index report on thursday noted jason wong vice president of municipals at amerivet securities this week volume rebounds eightfold with a new issue calendar of 8 5 billion including several billion dollar deals while there was only four days of trading last week he said there was about 43 billion in secondary trading as volatility continues to hit the markets as accounts are still worried about high inflation a possible recession and the potential of more rate hikes wong said clients bids wanteds continue to be at elevated levels with about 7 33 billion in total par amounts per bloomberg data muni yields for the week rose slightly with the 10 year notes rising by just 1 6 basis points to 3 16 as munis sold off due to the higher than expected inflation numbers on thursday he said but despite munis finishing the week weaker they outperformed usts as treasury yields increased dramatically because of the cpi number with the release of the cpi figures inflation continues to be at elevated levels resulting in triple a yield curves being cut with larger losses on the short end while usts saw yields rise nine 18 basis points five years and in he said although we did not see the sharp increases in yields as we saw in treasuries keep in mind that munis usually lag treasuries as we are seeing the muni curve continue to flatten even more wong said since the beginning of the third quarter we have seen the short end yield rise by about 150 basis points while the 10 year portion only increasing by roughly 70 basis points and the long by just 65 basis points fed rate increases should continue at least for now nuveen said the 10 year ust reached 4 last week and held there on monday which remains inverted relative to short term yields this suggests they said that investors believe the fed will keep raising short term rates many expect the fed will be successful by the second quarter of 2023 when long term rates should rally they said but the muni market continues to be an area of opportunity said cooper howard fixed income strategist focused on munis at charles schwab yields have risen significantly and credit risk remains low he said we think the bulk of the move up in yields is behind us so we favor extending duration and focusing on higher rated issuers howard noted relative yields have declined recently but and are more attractive the further out the yield curve you move however fund flows continue to remain negative pressuring spreads he said while yields are attractive he said that investors continue to pull money out of muni mutual funds and etfs at a record pace putting upward pressure on credit spreads even though credit risks aren t on the rise muni bonds though remain resilient while mutual funds have seen redemptions individual investors have supported the market with heavy interest as they can buy bonds with a tax exempt 4 yield nuveen strategists said institutional investors also continue to rework their

than a100 chance of a 75 bps rate hike in november recommended by christopher vecchio cfa get your free usd forecast get my guide rate hikes are still coming in this edition of central bank watch we ll review comments and speeches made by various federal reserve policymakers since the september fed rate decision fed policymakers have been speaking in very hawkish tones dismissing the idea that the rate hike cycle is finished and that a pause is coming in early 2023 the theme of recent speeches has been that the fed will do whatever it takes to bring down inflation for more information on central banks please visit the dailyfx central bank release calendar 75 bps in november the tone deployed by fed policymakers since the september fed meeting suggests that a 75 bps rate hike is very likely in november despite fed chair jerome powell having suggested over the summer that rate hikes to such a degree were less likely moving forward to wit the fed raised rates by 75 bps in september as well the hotter than expected september us inflation report cpi and the strong september us nonfarm payrolls report have reinforced the case for additional aggressive policy tightening efforts september 25 bostic atlanta president said that as the fed fights inflation by raising interest rates the us economy could slowdown in a relatively orderly way and that there will likely be some job losses september 26 collins boston president in her first remarks since taking the job running the boston fed noted that she anticipates that accomplishing price stability will require slower employment growth and a somewhat higher unemployment rate september 27 bullard st louis president commented on the threat high inflation posed to the fed s credibility and that this is a serious problem and we need to be sure we respond to it appropriately kashkari minneapolis president affirmed that there s a lot of tightening in the pipeline we are committed to restoring price stability but we also recognize given these lags there is a risk of overdoing it september 28 bostic said that he saw at least another 125 bps worth of rate hikes in 2022 and the lack of progress thus far has me thinking much more now that we have to get to amoderately restrictive stance evans chicago president noted the fed s main rate is beginning to move into restrictive territory but with inflation as high as it is and getting inflation under control being job one it s not nearly restrictive enough september 29 daly san francisco president stated that she is completely resolute to bring inflation down bullard referenced the september summary of economic projections and observed that if you look at the dots it does look like the committee is expecting a fair amount of additional moves this year september 30 daly reiterated that our no 1 priority is to get inflation down and that she believes the fed will take additional rate hikes which is the right thing to do to bring the economy back inbalance brainard fed vice chair pushed back against the narrative that the fed would cut rates quickly in 2023 having noted that monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target for these reasons we are committed to avoiding pulling back prematurely october 3 barkin richmond president discussed the implications of fed policy for the global economy and said the thing you worry about is what collateral damage could there be to international economies and in particular their financial systems williams new york president said there have been signs that tighter monetary policy has begun to cool demand and reduce inflationary pressures october 4 daly commented that inflation is a corrosive disease it is a toxin that erodes the real purchasing power of people october 5 daly gave her support for additional 75 bps rate hikes and commented that we re data dependent when the data show what we need tosee then we will downshift bostic discussed his rate hike expectations through the end of 2022 and outlined that he would like to reach a point where policy is moderatelyrestrictive between 4 and 4 5 by the end of thisyear and then hold at that level and see how the economy and prices react october 6 kashkari pushed back on the narrative that the fed would halt its rate hike cycle soon and noted until he sees some evidence that underlying inflation hassolidly peaked and is hopefully headed back down i m not readyto declare a pause i think we re quite a ways away from apause cook fed governor said that with inflation running well above our 2 longer run goal restoring price stability likely will require ongoing rate hikesand then keeping policy restrictive for some time until we areconfident that inflation is firmly on the path toward our 2 goal evans remarked that the main rate is likely headed for 4 5 to4 75 by sometime next year waller fed governor said that the focus of monetary policy needs to be fighting inflation not using monetary policy to deal with financial stability concerns mester cleveland president like others pushed back against the narrative of a pause in the rate hike cycle and said we have to bring interest rates up to a level that will getinflation on that 2 path and i have not seen the compellingevidence that i need to see that would suggest that we couldstart reducing the pace at which we re going october 7 williams stated that the main rate will likely rise to 4 5 and the timing of that and how high do we have to raise interestrates is going to depend on the data october 10 brainard hinted at concerns that raising rates too far could hurt the us economy and commented that front loading was a good thing given how far below neutral rates were but overshooting is costly too and there is great uncertainty about how restrictive policy must actually become october 11 mester reiterated her support for additional rates hikes such that monetary policy will need to become more restrictive in order to put inflation on a sustainable downward path to 2 october 12 kashkari outlined what it would take for the fed to pause its rate hike cycle and stated for me the bar for such a change is very high because wehave not yet seen much evidence that the underlying inflation the services inflation the wage inflation the labor market that that is yet softening the september fomc meeting minutes were released which included the perspective that several participants noted that particularly in the current highly uncertain global economic and financial environment it would be important to calibrate the pace of further policy tightening with the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook bowman fed governor confirmed support for additional tightening when she said if we do not see signs that inflation is moving down my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table october 14 cook commented that she saw the need for additional rate hikes daly called the september us inflation report disappointing and said she preferred to see the main rate between 4 5 and 5 george kansas city president warned that if rates were raised too quickly they could disrupt financial markets and the economy in a way that ultimately could be self defeating markets see increased hawkishness we can measure whether a fed rate hike is being priced in using eurodollar contracts by examining the difference in borrowing costs for

refer to companies that have a market cap of less than or around 50 million these are volatile investments or trades and investors should always evaluate their risk tolerance before thinking about parking some cash in nano caps a study conducted by o shaughnessy asset management a connecticut based money management firm examined and compared the returns of small caps and large caps between 1964 and 2017 the researchers at osam found that small cap stocks returned over 5 1 per year between 1964 and 2017 and outperformed large cap stocks which returned 11 0 per year over the same period nancy prial co ceo of massachusetts based essex investment management appeared in an interview on cnbc where she made her bull case for small cap stocks here are some comments from nancy prial we saw small caps and interestingly even micro caps outperform on a relative basis in the third quarter of 2022 and small cap growth and micro cap growth were two of the only sectors that were actually up a little bit for the quarter one of the other factors for small caps here is not only are the stocks very attractively valued selling at valuations of 10x or less in aggregate on next year s earnings and those earnings might be too high but that s still a great valuation we have also seen historically that it s not really rising inflation so much as it is inflation that is high leveling out and starting to come down which is the scenario that we think we are entering today so that bodes very well for the outlook of this very neglected sector of the market small caps and micro caps we are going to go into a market that rewards individual stocks as opposed to macro themes that will be even more tailwinds for the small cap sector nano cap stocks are not ideal for risk averse investors for investors

elections 2022 seven candidates vie for three desert water agency board seats three seats on desert water agency s five person board of directors are on the ballot this november with the potential to majorly shake up the board by electing representatives from desert hot springs and the surrounding area for the first time desert water agency was founded as a groundwater management agency in the western coachella valley in 1961 and later began providing water service to customers in palm springs and cathedral city in 1968 desert water agency is also one of 29 state water contractors giving the agency the ability to import water to recharge the groundwater basin while mission springs water district formed in 1953 provides water service to desert hot springs and the surrounding area desert water agency s status as a state water contractor means it also serves desert hot springs by replenishing the local aquifer which has led to years of contention and litigation between the two water agencies dwa transitioned from at large to division elections in november 2020 and the results of the 2020 census meant dwa had to again redraw district lines this year the three seats up for grabs this year are all currently represented by at large board members so voters in the three open districts will be choosing a geographic representative for the first time the desert sun surveyed the seven candidates about their priorities some answers have been edited for length and clarity division 1 division 1 includes unincorporated mission lakes country club and stretches down both sides of highway 62 to include the communities of bonnie bell whitewater and north palm springs the division also includes palm springs neighborhoods north of vista chino including desert highland gateway estates racquet club west and racquet club estates steve bronack steve grasha and marcus miceli are competing for the division 1 seat bronack is a professor of technology and design at california state university san bernardino who also coordinates analytics for palm springs power baseball grasha currently serves as a director at the mission springs water district where his term ends in december and also is the owner of truefog usa which sells misting systems miceli is a local real estate broker why are you running for the desert water agency board bronack securing maintaining and protecting our water is the most important issue facing us all over the next four years i love this valley and i love our community the people in this division with whom i live and have interacted are some of the kindest and most welcoming people i have met i m proud to live here this is an important job that requires reasonable responsible and sound minded thinking i m running for this position because i believe i have the unique skills experience expertise and temperament it will take to get this job done right i am honored to have the opportunity to represent everyone in this division grasha i m running to make sure the water delivered to our homes is safe i understand water knowing what is in it and its quality was key in my career what scares me in this election is one candidate who stated publicly that he has never once tested the water and another opponent that quite gleefully said chromium 6 is of zero concern to him and nothing to even consider more than half the families in division 1 are drinking water that is considered unsafe for human consumption as determined by the california state department of health and the california state department of water resources due to extreme levels of the cancer causing chromium 6 giving people a false message that because something is the best tasting in water in the world does not mean it is safe to drink every day i have made it my life s work to fix the water and have been fighting for our customers for decades and i will not stop until i succeed let s never forget the out of town special interests that fund my opponents campaigns do not support making our water safe they just want everyone to look the other way so they can continue unbridled development of questionable housing stock for no other reason than corporate profits without regard to providing safe water as a condition of approval miceli i got involved in the race for a number of reasons first and foremost out of a commitment to our community to give back wherever i can as i continued to read endless stories regarding diminishing water availability i felt it was my duty to get involved and see how i could contribute i want to keep water rates down as affordability is crucial i want to promote and advance the core principles of the agency water conservation efforts reclamation and recycling maintaining our current water system and actively participate in policy initiatives that will address any future hindrance that could occur from a diminished supply of water from the co river i got involved in the race as a concerned citizen property owner and business owner i come from a political family so giving back to my community through civic duty has always been a part of my dna i believe it is the responsibility of members of the community to get involved and assist in whatever way you can to ensure the community continues long after our stewardship has ended the right to our own water is of paramount concern in this ever changing climate what are your priorities if elected bronack it is essential that each of us has access to clean and safe water in the most cost effective ways over the next four years we will face unprecedented challenges and opportunities when it comes to our water it is paramount that we work together to protect the water we have secure the water we need and keep our costs down to do this we must focus on continuing our work in conservation reclamation infrastructure innovation and efficiency we also must ensure that every dollar provided to dwa is directed toward achieving these priorities currently dwa is engaged in multiple lawsuits several with our closest neighbors lawsuits require lawyers lawyers require money and who pays them we do every dollar spent on a lawsuit is a dollar not spent on innovating our systems or finding ways to reduce the cost to customers every dollar spent disputing with our neighbors is a dollar not spent on technicians and engineers who can help us find new sources and solutions and to update our infrastructure as director my priority will be to ensure that everyone in the division is represented and that the resources provided to dwa are used wisely and transparently grasha connect to the delta water project east branch aqueduct and build a desalination plant as other cities with high salt loads have done so we can deliver safe clean affordable water to every single ratepayer not just those in south palm springs miceli if elected my main objective is to keep our water rates down and affordable for the entire community i believe that affordable water is a crucial concern of our voters i want to promote and advance the core principles of the agency which are our water conservation efforts reclamation and recycling maintaining our current water system and actively participating in policy initiatives that will address any future hindrance that could occur from a diminished supply of water from the colorado river i want to work together with my fellow board members in a constructive and respectful manner to address any concerns from our community and to continue to address policy decisions that will impact not only our water supply but the water supply for our residents for generations to come i believe we are in a critical time of planning for the future i believe we need to begin to address what we used to consider to be a drought and understand that we are living in the effects of climate change and what that means for the desert water agency in terms of long term planning and capital investment projects how do you think desert water agency is handling the state s historic drought conditions and how should conservation fit into dwa s mission what additional actions if any would you like dwa to take on conservation bronack conservation is a cornerstone when it comes to managing and maintaining our water supply although we are fortunate not to face some of the most pressing challenges others across our state are facing it is important we continue to work hard to conserve the more we conserve the less we have to replenish reclamation and reuse of water is a key component of this effort it is essential that dwa continues to push forward in this area in efficient ways as we move forward we must recognize that the challenges ahead are different in many ways than the challenges we are leaving behind incentivizing our neighbors and the businesses with whom we work to explore innovative technologies methods and approaches to use wisely every drop of the award winning water we have beneath our feet will directly impact our ability to maintain and manage our water supply in ways that will continue to support the quality of life and lifestyles we all have worked so hard to secure it is clear to me that we all are taking this seriously and that dwa is doing a good job providing incentives and support for these efforts it is essential we remain vigilant grasha as district director i have focused on sustainable water management practices during this critical time of drought recently we celebrated the historic groundbreaking of the most important advancement in local water management history beginning construction of the new regional wastewater treatment facility under my leadership securing the largest grant of its kind in california history paying 100 of construction costs ensuring no expense to ratepayers providing safe clean affordable drinking water for generations to come miceli the desert water agency has for decades been working to establish a solid water conservation policy and i believe it has been very successful the agency has a number of programs in place to encourage our community to conserve water we offer the lawn replacement incentive program recently funded with an additional 2m low flow appliances water efficient irrigation systems energystar washing machines smart controllers and many more offer options for the community to do their part and conserve water the state recently released a new water policy agenda to begin to address our climate reality we can no longer consider this to be a drought but rather our new weather reality our efforts to design and create new water reclamation projects and the understanding how we formerly captured water from the runoff of snow capped mountains may not be our reality in the future we have begun to understand that we live in a time of less snowpack in the winter and more severe down pouring rain storms and how not only our agency but agencies across the state have to adjust our practices to capture that type of storm runoff the recent redistricting process means that desert water agency will have desert hot springs residents on its board this fall likely for the first time where do you stand on desert water agency s role for desert hot springs residents and what are your thoughts on the relationship between mission springs water district and desert water agency bronack this division is a microcosm of the valley itself there are disparate groups with different needs and expectations when it comes to dwa the reason this division exists essentially is to ensure that we in desert hot springs and north palm springs have the opportunity to represent ourselves for the first time in the history of the desert water agency it is essential that our representative understands the different and perhaps sometimes competing needs and expectations across the division in ways that help us find common ground and consensus as for mswd i need to know more information before i can have a definitive opinion again my bias is toward ensure that we account for every drop and every dollar in the most cost effective and efficient ways if joining forces makes sense then that is worth exploring that being said dwa and mswd are two separate agencies serving two separate purposes the most important issue here is that before we discuss combining we must first stop fighting first step is to end the costly lawsuits and then we can explore the more reasonable ways to relate moving forward grasha the mission springs water district is not something that desert water agency should be considering for acquisition without full disclosure and thorough study of deficiencies within the system it has a great work force but the system is old and with many shortcomings in its antiquated design it s wastewater treatment plants are nowhere near the operational standards they should be mswd would be a literal money pit on the shoulders of desert water agency customers but with state funding available for such consolidations it s something our ratepayers and users believe deserves our attention and i agree miceli as i am not a member of the board yet my knowledge of the litigation is limited however i got into this race with a sense of community in mind mswd isn t our adversary they are our neighbors and i intend to use my tenure on the board to diminish any friction and disagreements and try to find common ground again it is our water our future and ours to protect additionally with the change of the divisions we will now have three board members who represent portions of dhs i believe it is the responsibility of whomever wins the election to be a representative of all of his or her constituents not just those in either palm springs desert hot springs or cathedral city for that matter i believe the future of water policy is our valley is collaborative not exclusionary in order to address and resolve the ever growing issues of climate change and the potential for drastically diminished access to our supply of water we will need to act collectively and responsibly as members of the same community which is my every intention if elected division 2 gerald mckenna and alfred valrie are facing off for the division 2 seat which includes the eastern and southern portions of desert hot springs mckenna is a retired civil engineer who also served as vice president and a representative of overseas construction companies working in california and hawaii valrie formerly worked for the los angeles unified school district where he was a program manager of the prop 39 student energy audit training program and also worked to secure water fixture rebates and retrofits for the district why you re running mckenna my primary motivation was the dwa s long history of neglect of the interests of dhs water customers in particular and its insensitivity to its ratepayers in general i have long felt that all of the desert water districts are too sanguine about the health of the aquifer and they seem willing to overdraft it year after year in a very short sighted way that can t continue i also have had concerns about the performance of some of the board members that have served on dwa and mswd i understand the democratic imperative for citizens to control these public bodies but the people who come forward to serve are frequently not equipped with the required skills i am and even as a member of the public i have observed life threatening management failings in one of our districts i want to contribute with my 50 years of experience and expertise to the management of these vital public bodies valrie i am running for division 2 to bring direct representation back to central desert hot springs and to be the watchdog on dwa for central dhs water is the lifeblood of the coachella valley sustainability and sustainable use goals are our future division 2 comprises the very heart of dhs and is perhaps the most racially and economically diverse district anywhere in the valley we require representation which will balance the fiscal realities of central dhs families with the need for continued access to dwa s water supplies as our water wholesaler dwa needs to pay more attention to how when it spends our money and allocates water to our city for example at its meeting on 10 4 the dwa board approved an additional 2m for drought tolerant landscaping rebates for its palm springs retail customers portions of that money come from dhs indirectly through our mswd billing statements and directly through our property taxes as director i would not have voted for that dhs is ground zero in the valley for what i call brown landscaping we are water savings champions here in dhs and the constituents i visited with are very concerned about water parks and other grand water use features throughout the valley priorities if elected mckenna first priority protect the aquifer from environmental contamination from any source including our own waste water set a net zero goal for our aquifer use second priority kick the water conservation programs into a higher gear double the turf removal rebate and set a maximum grass area for any new single family water service require ultra low flow toilets before establishing new or transferred water service third priority establish tiered pricing lower the cost of water with an inexpensive basic needs tier establish a lifeline service for water for low income customers as we have for all other utilities we give low income persons free cellphones but we give them nothing to help pay for their far more important need for clean water raise the tiered price sharply for excessive users and let s establish a state wide fund with every water customer paying 1 month so that we can care for the 1 million californians who do not have a drinkable water supply in their homes we should be ashamed of that situation valrie my first priority is to protect the economic and water interests of central dhs my second priority is no more taxation without representation to that end a constituent called me and asked my political party i explained that this race is non partisan but when he pressed me more i replied that i was a democrat the voter was a republican but he wanted my assurance that if he voted for me that i wouldn t go to dwa and stab him in the back that conversation matters a lot to me and i promise if i m elected i will not stab central desert hot springs in the back my third priority is to maintain fair water conservation rules for central dhs i want to do all i can to ensure that dhs families who already do a pitch perfect job of saving water be affected in the least possible way by government restrictions that being said coachella valley is at the forefront of the worst drought perhaps ever and while the bureau of reclamation spared california from additional 2023 cuts in its august 16 2022 announcement that doesn t mean our portion of colorado river water is safe from cuts in 2024 and beyond drought and conservation mckenna let s stop using the word drought we are experiencing a long term climate change which is aridifying our region we all and palm springs especially need to say goodbye to grass lawns it may have been ok in the past to try and make the valley look like maui it no longer is all our golf courses need to switch to recycled water i apologize in advance for the road work ahead signs but we need to build out a pipeline network for recycled water to get it to them let s look inside our homes too get those low flow shower heads and dual flush ultra low flow toilets into every home the water districts can afford to share the costs we will save water we will save on waste water treatment and we will all save money is anyone opposed to that let s copy los angeles you can t sell a home there until you replace all the toilets with ultra low flow models dwa can t rewrite city codes but it should deny transfer of service to a new homeowner until the toilets meet current codes the impact would be large and it would be immediate valrie the coachella valley is increasingly becoming a premiere international travel destination with our golf courses music festivals and world class hotels dwa like mwsd and even cvwd must walk a tightrope of saving water and promoting the saving of water but also fully making water available for not only residents but also guests dwa however has its share of issues with carrying out that mission for example dwa claims that the water allocation and projected use for wet n wild is built into the total calculations of usage in palm springs i don t buy that when wet n wild reopens it s only common sense to conclude that water usage in palm springs is going to go way way up in times of inflation drought and climate change that use is going to redound negatively on central dhs in the way of our property tax bills and the timing of our state water allocation that s not cool with me dwa incentivizes drought tolerant landscaping in a way that rewards rich people looking at dhs and palm springs on a satellite map is a study in brown and green contrasts if anything dwa needs to send money back to desert hot springs for our years of excellent water stewardship relationship with desert hot springs and mswd mckenna well it s time for dwa to look across the freeway the general public in dhs does not understand why they have and pay for two water districts the current situation where dhs customers pay user fees to both agencies as well as taxes to dwa is bizarre and mswd has sued dwa more then once meaning that dhs customers pay out huge legal expenses to sue dwa and also pay out huge legal expenses to defend dwa we have two headquarters buildings and two general managers and so on how can that be allowed to continue not to mention that mswd is working on wasting 20million on a new headquarters building that would not be needed and really it isn t needed anyway i have publicly criticized mswd in the past and i remain skeptical that they deliver safe affordable water change is coming to both boards of directors in november i believe there will be an opportunity to end this litigation nonsense and agree on a better water district structure obviously we have to try valrie dwa services the 1 mswd services the 99 that s an important distinction the richest property owners in southern california dot the skyline surrounding just one of dwa s sleek state of the art hillside water replenishment facilities mswd is embarking on the vital mission of finally connecting desert hot springs outlying residents to sewer we need someone on the board who s going to remember that we also need someone to remember that future agreements between dwa and mswd affect dhs principally water wise and money wise i will bridge the freeway gap between the two agencies by reviewing any agreements with my law school trained eyes i will also seek to do occasional tours of dwa to select groups of dhs high school students to introduce young people to water and sustainability careers as i did at lausd when i visited my division 2 constituents few knew of desert water agency s role in desert hot springs to be frank when i began this campaign i knew nothing of dwa s role in dhs this election changed all of that with me dhs gets a guy who loves dhs and who views his constituents views as having the force of law division 3 division 3 includes the north and east portions of the city the skyborne development on the city s western edge and a small unincorporated area to the east of the city jeff bowman president of cabot s museum board a former mission springs water district boardmember and former desert hot springs spa owner is running against d g cook a desert hot springs planning commissioner with a background in corporate management for division 3 why you re running bowman simply put i care i care about our water and i care about our community so i want to represent the population of dwa customers north of the i 10 for years we who live north of the i 10 could technically run for the dwa board and over the years we ve had a few that have tried however because the voting population of palm springs is greater than that of us north of the i 10 we ve never had enough votes to seat anyone on the dwa board this all changed in 2020 when dwa changed to election by divisions and i learned that for the first time in the history of dwa there will be at least two directors on the board who live north of the i 10 it was my experience as a director for mswd for 9 years my passion for our water and my years of service in desert hot springs that compelled me to run cook my decision to run is out of concern over my opponent s experience he has a history of voting to raise water and sewer rates he doubled rates when he served on the mswd board people struggling with this inflation and troubled economic times don t need more rate increases i don t want desert water agency to lose sight of the customers as has happened at mission springs water district also concerning is talk by those associated with mission springs water district including my opponent that think the upcoming election is about mswd taking over desert water agency that thinking has already cost ratepayers millions in legal fees this election is not a grudge match that is not the proper motivation to seek a seat on the desert water agency board priorities if elected bowman first and most important will be to demonstrate to my fellow board members that i am a thoughtful and caring director as i bring the voice of the people north of the i 10 to the formerly all palm springs board one of my strengths is my ability to listen to all sides of an issue and i will always seek the best results for our customers to keep the cost of water affordable and safe we are all participating in and must play well together in this sand box of the coachella valley second i will seek ways to end the lawsuits that dwa has been battling we ratepayers have been funding these lawsuits for years and it is time to bring all parties to the table and seek resolutions cook i am hearing candidates is this election that are dismissing the seriousness of chromium 6 in our drinking water some have publicly stated it is of zero concern to them that goes against all science even a moderate position on chromium 6 is that it must be taken seriously water quality will be a priority goal with me a goal will also be to make sure the best interests of the customers are represented we all know there are special interests that will try to pull the board in directions that are not in best interests of our customers my priority is to protect against that and i will remain professional in my relations with fellow board members even if we disagree on an issue decorum must be maintained drought and conservation bowman dwa and all water agencies are facing an enormous challenge with the drought conditions i believe we need to continue to encourage and incentivize residents businesses and public facilities to use native desert plants and replace water hungry greenery dwa has some good programs running but as i understand they are being hindered by a customer backlog i d want to help the district discover ways to more quickly implement the conservation programs in addition i think we need to look at all options to assist people in conserving we have a huge number of tourists who visit our valley and we need to market our water conservation to them as they vacation here cook we have no choice but to conserve we are in a severe drought but we have choices on how to go about it desert water agency programs i have reviewed are effective but we need to make sure we help our water customers ease into conservation targets without fines on the other hand as other communities have found out wealthy customers ignore conservation thinking that if they just pay the fine it is okay it is not okay desert water agency must have the ability to cut back or turn off water of such gross water wasters relationship with desert hot springs and mswd bowman finally we who live north of the i 10 will have at least 2 people on what has always been a palm springs board this will bring input and representation of dhs to the board that has been lacking since the beginning with my experience on the mswd board my experience running a hotel and leadership in the tourist industry i will bring fresh positive input to the dwa board there are some who are running for a seat on the board who feel that dwa should take over mswd i m not in favor of this both water districts have different aquifers that they manage mswd deserves to continue to manage its award winning water as it has done since the beginning both water districts have logistical and unique needs that are best served by their own agencies those who are voicing the merge idea are the same ones who wanted dhs to abandon its own police force and go with the sheriff several years back as it turned out their claim of cost savings was disproven and we would have paid more for less service i m ready to serve all the rate payers cook first the costly legal battle between these two agencies that i see as mostly the doing of mission springs water district must come to an end this will not happen by electing someone to the desert water agency board who pushed for the lawsuits as my opponent did while at mswd frankly i don t see how relationships are repaired by having someone on the board that spoke so terribly of an agency where he is now seeking appointment hard feelings between the two agencies need to be resolved by those who have not been in the thick of that battle the same as candidates in the other dwa division races have been saying we need to mend this seat i seek is not about conquering desert water agency the role of a desert water agency board member is to ensure desert hot springs and all of the desert water agency service area is provided a clean and sufficient supply of water that the health of our aquifers is maintained and that we operate efficiently to keep rates as low as possible erin rode covers the environment for the desert sun reach her at erin rode

ashland ore 25 mayors across oregon are asking the state for 123 million to address homelessness a letter was sent to the three gubernatorial candidates and the legislature on friday the oregon mayors association is requesting the money be distributed on an annual basis however the plan doesn t include any specifics on what the money can be used for ashland medford and klamath falls mayor s are all part of the task force for this plan ashland s mayor hopes additional funding will be used to build more affordable housing what i would do is take that money and use it to subsidize housing ashland mayor julie akins said we need more housing we re 20 years behind on housing stock re subsidize so people can afford to live here she said the reason cities are asking for the funding is because of the lack of money they have to address homelessness the plan is in its early stages but in addition to the allocation of money investments in specific shelter and transitional housing projects would be required 2024 kobi tv nbc5 all rights reserved unless otherwise stated

the market is full of opportunities even during a pullback here are two tsx stocks that are defying the market slump to consider volatility remains king in 2022 year to date the market has dropped just shy of 12 fortunately that drop doesn t encompass all investments some tsx stocks are defying the market slump and even posting handsome gains here s a look at two of those market beating tsx stocks defying the market slump and whether you should buy them now gas and milk can make you rich right alimentation couche tard tsx atd is outperforming the market by selling us the goods we need in good times and bad as of the time of writing couche tard is up 10 year to date for those unfamiliar with the stock couche tard is one of the largest convenience store and gas station operators on the planet the company has taken an aggressive stance towards growth which has allowed it to swell to approximately 14 000 locations in two dozen countries that s an impressive feat considering that the convenience store chain only branched outside of canada into the u s market two decades ago adding that impressive growth couche tard has also weathered the pandemic and more recently volatile fuel prices and rapid inflation by way of example let s look at some results in the most recent quarterly update couche tard saw revenues jump 37 year over year an increase in service revenue was attributed to those gains overall the company earned us 872 4 million or 0 85 per diluted share in the quarter this was a stark improvement over the us 764 4 million or 0 71 per diluted share reported in the prior period turning to the future couche tard is focused on expansion just last month couche tard announced a master license agreement to bring couche tard s circle k branded stores to south africa the company is also growing out an ev network within the u s following success in rolling out a network in europe couche tard is looking to have a 200 location network operational within the next two years in short couche tard is a must have investment defying the market slump buy it hold it and watch it grow defying the market slump and ready for strong growth another unlikely stock defying the market slump is dollarama tsx dol canada s largest dollar store isn t exactly the investment you might be thinking of during a market slump but it should be dollar stores thrive during market pullbacks unlike other traditional retailers consumers seeking less expensive alternatives often end up in a dollarama store once there dollarama s unique pricing model takes over dollarama offers a wide variety of goods that are priced along several fixed price points up to 4 additionally many lower priced items are bundled together providing shoppers with an added sense of value in short the approach has proven wildly popular in a year full of volatility and rampant inflation that s helped dollarama s stock rise well over 25 year to date that s not even the best part despite those solid gains there s still more growth to come dollarama has swelled to a network of over 1 400 locations across every province the company also has a growing presence in several latin american countries under its dollar city brand we re also heading into the busy holiday shopping season the first in which stores will be fully open since the pandemic started in other words dollarama is a great stock option that has defensive appeal and plenty of long term growth potential final thoughts finding the right mix of investments takes time it also means understanding that no investment even the most defensive is without risk fortunately both dollarama and couche tard are market leaders in their respective segments with strong growth prospects in my opinion one or both would do well as part of a well diversified portfolio

by barbara starr and katie bo lillis cnn the us defense department is trying to speed up the delivery of two advanced surface to air missile systems to ukraine as russia has increasingly used iranian supplied drones that explode on impact to pummel ukrainian cities and infrastructure the pentagon s effort is just the latest evidence of a newly urgent push by the us and its allies to help ukraine build a comprehensive air and missile defense system to protect itself against these drones which killed four in an attack on kyiv on monday the drones have become an increasingly urgent problem for ukraine and one that has drawn us condemnation the state department on monday said that the drones are a violation of a un security council resolution which restricts certain arms transfers to or from iran with its reserves of precision munitions believed to be running low moscow has turned to these loitering drones to maintain its ability to strike high value targets and terrorize ukrainian cities from afar western analysts say in recent days they have been used to strike energy infrastructure unlike more traditional larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles the iranian supplied drones are designed to crash into a target and explode detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process they are smaller and more easily controlled than cruise missiles the us doesn t know exactly how many drones iran has provided to russia but military analysts say the number is clearly substantial russia fired 43 on monday alone with 37 shot down by air defense systems according to ukraine s air force one us defense official estimated the total number to be in the hundreds the big effect is definitely economic exhaustion attacking ukraine s electricity availability going into the winter and also keeping the war nationwide said michael kofman the director of the russia studies program at the center for naval analyses they re essentially using these drones as sort of a poor man s precision guided weapon against ukrainian infrastructure a us defense official told cnn monday that the pentagon is now trying to accelerate the delivery of two national advanced surface to air missile systems or nasams systems owned by 12 nations and already used to protect washington dc the us has already committed eight nasams to ukraine including the two being accelerated according to pentagon officials the us first announced it would send two nasams to ukraine on july 1 in a ukraine security assistance initiative package of military assistance and announced it would send six more on august 24 the systems are currently being manufactured by raytheon in a joint partnership with norway s kongsberg defense and aerospace according to the pentagon the us now is hoping to complete manufacturing two of the systems by the end of october or early november perhaps as much as a full month sooner than originally slated once the systems are completed they must still be transported to ukraine the nasams will be flown to a nearby country and then shipped over land into ukraine drone attacks reflect russian weakness even as they remain deeply concerned about the success russia has had with the iranian drones sources familiar with the intelligence and western military analysts say that their heavy usage reflects a weakness in russia s arsenal western officials believe that russia is running low on its precision guided munitions and according to one source familiar with western intelligence is likely on the brink of dipping into its strategic reserves to continue the war later on monday the top us spy chief said russia has been firing its precision munitions at an unsustainable rate leaving them reliant on lower end weapons and technological band aids that are probably leading to weapons and systems that are less capable russia entered the war with prodigious stocks of munitions but it has been firing them at an unsustainable rate director of national intelligence avril haines told an intelligence conference in washington this is especially true for high end precision weapons such as cruise missiles they use in strikes on ukraine s electric grid and other targets in short they re running through their stocks meanwhile haines said us sanctions and export controls have helped contribute to major supply shortages in ukraine forcing russia to turn to iran and north korea as well as rely on makeshift solutions export controls have forced russia to rely on contraband chips where it can and to frankly jury rig microelectronic components when no alternatives exist steps that are probably leading to weapons and systems that are less capable she said russia still has plenty of older less precise soviet weapons the source familiar with western intelligence said although it s not clear how much of the old soviet stockpiles moscow has managed to bring to the fight because the west doesn t know how many were sold or stripped for parts after the cold war still ukraine remains deeply vulnerable to attack from the air at a meeting of allied defense chiefs focused on ukrainian aid last week us chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen mark milley said that the us and its allies should contribute air defense systems they have and then help ukraine knit the systems together to create a comprehensive defense many countries have other systems there s a whole series of israeli systems that are quite capable the germans have systems as we mentioned so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems milley said milley suggested if multiple countries send the air defense systems they have ukrainians can link them together with a command and control and communication systems the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights reserved cnn s ellie kaufman jennifer hansler and ivana kottasová contributed reporting

there may be less treats and more tricks this halloween which bodes ill for the holiday shopping season the national retail federation nrf estimates that 69 percent of u s consumers plan to participate in this year s halloween celebration that s an increase from last year s 65 percent and in line with the prepandemic 68 percent in 2019 total halloween spending is expected to rise nearly five percent to a record 10 6 billion up from last year s record of 10 1 billion that sounds pretty good until you adjust the figures for inflation the consumer price index is up 8 2 percent over the past 12 months candy prices are up 13 1 percent according to last week s report from the department of labor this suggests that real spending on halloween is down 8 1 percent what s more that spending is spread out over a bigger portion of u s households on a per household basis spending is down by even more consumers plan to spend 100 on average for halloween candy decorations and costumes according to the nrf although that would be the second highest spending on record it is last year s 103 so spending is expected to fall nominally as well the commerce department on friday reported that retail sales were flat in september compared with the prior month which means the fell lower in real terms economists had been expecting a gain of three tenths of a percent some of that weakness may have been due to hurricane ian bank of america analysts who tracked credit and debit card usage said that ian caused a collapse in total card spending in florida north carolina and south carolina the bank estimates that hurricane ian shaved 0 2 to 0 3 percentage points off the month over month 0 1 percent growth in sales excluding autos but the bank points out that spending was weak across the country suggesting that something more is at work one of the reasons for weaker consumer spending is probably sticker shock faced with higher prices on just about everything consumers are pulling back from purchases discretionary spending around holidays is likely particularly vulnerable there are three other factors sending a chill through retail first the pandemic shopping spree saw consumers stock up on goods like appliances furniture and computers the appliance upgrade cycle that might otherwise have lasted several years got compressed into just a year and a half one result is that some of the spending that would otherwise have taken place in the second half of this year has already happened second the slowdown in the housing market is lowering demand for household goods existing home sales have fallen every month since january and were down 0 4 percent from august to september and 19 9 percent from a year ago this slowdown hurts sales because moving is a major trigger for purchases sales at furniture stores were down 0 7 percent in september and sales at appliance stores were down 0 8 percent third wages have not kept up with prices last week the department of labor said real average hourly earnings decreased 0 1 percent from august to september compared with a year ago the average real wage is down 3 0 percent many workers are pulling back on spending because they have no other choice this does not mean people that will forgo buying christmas presents even in the direst of economic times people still spring for gifts to put under the christmas tree but it likely means that retailers are in for another disappointing holiday season
