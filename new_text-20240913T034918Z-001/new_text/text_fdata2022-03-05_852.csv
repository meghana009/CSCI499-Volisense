african students trapped in ukraine face war racism collapse three days after russia invaded ukraine ojonugwa zakari was trying to pretend life was going on as normal in her university halls she d woken up early showered and was brushing her hair when the first mortar shell exploded i don t think anything prepares you for war it was like my heart stopped beating she says speaking over a crackling line from sumy a city in northeastern ukraine just 30 miles from the russian border i was thinking is this real as panicked students fled to a bunker where they hugged each other and tried to confirm what was happening ms zakari a medical student from nigeria had another grim realization with sumy state university located just a stone s throw from the invading country the closest ways to safety would be hundreds of miles west or south to the borders of poland moldova hungary or romania as those huddled began discussing how they might flee on whatsapp and telegram groups for international students one sixth of the university s students are foreigners mostly from india and sub saharan africa another fear cropped up one that some black people say is ever present in ukraine reports of racism against those fleeing russian attacks gripped the students who felt frozen in place a black mother and baby forced to give up their train seats a young black man beaten after waiting hours in line in subzero temperatures a group of terrified black african students repeatedly refused entry to a safe haven traversing hundreds of miles in search of another border these were among the stories reported by nigerian nationals to consular officers indian national papers carried reports of students who say they were viciously beaten by ukrainian and polish border guards and dozens of similarly frightening incidents had begun circulating on social media the reports were part of the reason ms zakari had hesitated to flee earlier choosing instead to stock up supplies and hunker down now as the students whispered among themselves was that machine gunfire in the streets she realized she had no chance of leaving widespread reports of mistreatment nine days after russia began bombarding ukraine from the air land and sea more than a million people have fled across international borders to safety among them are tens of thousands of african nationals who have been swept up in a war far from their own homes while overwhelmed neighboring countries have largely welcomed those pouring into its borders the african union said monday that it was also disturbed by widespread reports of african citizens being beaten thrown off trains or simply refused the right to cross borders reports that africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist and breach international law the au said in a statement allegations of racist mistreatment have been leveled against ukrainian polish and hungarian border guards we hear about the racism going on at the polish border we that are caught here are worried that we might face this racial problem when we finally manage to make it to the border says ms zakari it will really be bad if that happens after all this stress that we are currently going through yara nardi reuters people who made it across the border of poland await transit to a refugee center in przemyśl poland march 1 2022 noting allegations of racist mistreatment that have been leveled against ukrainian polish and hungarian border guards the african union said reports that africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist and breach international law like about a dozen other stranded african students and their parents who spoke to the monitor ms zakari says she felt only the presence of the international media or ideally of united nations officials would guarantee her right to safe passage once at the ukrainian border nigeria africa s most populous country said march 3 it would begin evacuating some 5 000 nationals from ukraine and neighboring countries ironically ukraine has a long history of racial diversity alongside one of discrimination many african nations have complicated ties with both russia and eastern european countries dating back to the cold war when the continent s newly independent countries largely allied with the soviet bloc against their former western colonizers in recent decades ukraine has been seen as a cheaper alternative to western europe and the united states making it a popular destination for students from across africa and india now its besieged cities are home to around 20 000 indian students while morocco nigeria and egypt account for 16 000 more students western media sets racist tone but accusations of deeply entrenched racism go beyond ukraine s borders beginning with the way the war is being reported by western media outlets peter dobbie an al jazeera english anchor was criticized for using comparisons of arabs and north africans in his descriptions of ukrainian refugees and the network apologized for his comments what is compelling is that just looking at them the way they re dressed he observed these are prosperous middle class people these are not obviously refugees trying to get away from areas in the middle east that are still in a big state of war these are not people trying to get away from areas in north africa they look like any european family that you would live next door to in other cases contributing to this tone appeals to humanity have been based on the fact ukraine is a white western nation it s very emotional for me because i see european people with blonde hair and blue eyes being killed every day with putin s missiles and his helicopters and his rockets david sakvarelidze ukraine s former deputy general prosecutor said unchallenged in a bbc interview on saturday ukraine s foreign ministry initially dismissed allegations of racism by border officials as russian disinformation but as both the number of reported incidents and an ensuing backlash which has been particularly ferocious on social media continued to increase ukraine s foreign ministry said march 3 it had set up an emergency hotline specially for african and asian students garba shehu an adviser to nigerian president muhammadu buhari praised the generosity of spirit of the ukrainian people that currently enables some 4 000 nigerians to study there we also appreciate that those in official positions in security and border management will in most cases be experiencing impossible expectations in a situation they never expected he added but for that reason it is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favor some african countries have begun slowly evacuating their citizens although efforts have been patchy as airspaces remain closed for parents at home on the continent the days have trickled by as they anxiously await news ibrahim umar a 52 year old lawyer in kaduna in northern nigeria said he had barely slept after hearing about the war eight thousand miles away his 19 year old son usman a medic at the university of dnipro fled tuesday after his student lodging came under fire the family scraped together money for him to get a train ticket to poland but on arrival five days later more agonizing news came we were happy to hear that they had arrived at the border safely only for him to call me back saying that polish officials were selecting only white people and allowing them into poland and that black people were not allowed mr umar says of his son s odyssey again the umar relatives organized another round of fundraising for the younger mr umar to head to romania where again the student was turned away at this point the boy was crying i was crying his mother has been crying since the war broke out says the elder mr umar eventually his son was able to cross the hungarian border we took these kids abroad to study because of the problems we have with our universities here but now it s war and racism we get in europe he says imagine having time to be racist as news arrived march 3 of the first major ukrainian city being captured by russia ms zakari the nigerian medical student said she and her fellow foreign students felt their morale slipping but ms zakari who has ventured briefly out to the town twice to top up food and water says where once there were daily running gun battles between russian and ukrainian forces now the city s empty streets are chilling and both residents and students believed any attempt at fleeing would be too dangerous hungry russian soldiers were looting shops and houses in the region local press reported after another night of fierce bombardment ms zakari said today that her group s water supply is good for just two days but she was finding solace with her fellow international students sharing hopeful news and funny memes as they tried to keep their spirits up the university s nigerian student union had made a video appeal for all african students to be safely evacuated which students from angola to zambia were disseminating among friends family and consular officers her only hope ms zakari says is to get to a western border town safely once the fighting calms down and then pray she isn t stopped because of the color of her skin imagine that you re in the same situation as everyone else and you still have time to be racist she says her voice breaking on the phone

the binary weapon extermination plot becomes clear mrna spike protein injections suppress dna repair followed by global nuclear events that unleash dna damaging radiation it is now becoming abundantly obvious what the next phase is going to be for achieving global depopulation the vaccine bioweapon phase has achieved some level of morbid success in the eyes of the globalists likely killing 1 2 billion human beings over the next decade as the spike protein damage takes its toll but even this is nowhere near enough for the demonic entities controlling our planet as they seek something closer to a 90 total reduction of the human population suddenly their strategy is crystal clear the spike protein mrna injections cause about a 90 suppression of the dna repair mechanism known as nhej non homologous end joining this is a cellular mechanism that exists inside the cells of humans animals and plants to maintain genetic integrity a necessary condition for life because of the nhej mechanism we are able to automatically repair double strand breaks dsbs in our chromosomes when we are subjected to ionizing radiation common sources of ionizing radiation include sunlight exposure commercial jet flights and mammograms when our nhej engine is working normally chromosomes damaged by ionizing radiation are repaired and do not become cancer tumors but when nhej is suppressed the body cannot repair dna damage and begins to grow micro tumors the following chart is taken from the bombshell nhej suppression study published in the journal viruses you can find it here it shows the near 90 percent suppression of nhej in the presence of the spike protein which we now knows penetrates the nucleus of the cell in the conclusion of the paper the authors write â we found that the spike protein markedly inhibited both brca1 and 53bp1 foci formation figure 3dâ g together these data show that theâ sarsâ covâ 2 fullâ length spike protein inhibits dna damage repairâ by hindering dna repair protein recruitment â micro tumors over time and especially in the toxic blood environment of the average vitamin d deficient person become large tumors and those tumors lead to death sometimes death by chemotherapy five billion people now injected with mrna gene therapy can be easily killed with low levels of ionizing radiation from any source so right now all across the world there are about five billion people who have received covid vaccination injections source which are actually experimental gene therapy treatments that alter their dna and suppress their dna repair mechanisms all that is necessary for globalists to kill those five billion people is to unleash a new source of low level ionizing radiation that circulates across the globe and then let physics do the rest starting to get the picture of how evil these globalists really are this nefarious goal can be achieved by the globalists in any of the following ways unleashing a new nuclear accident in ukraine or anywhere else setting off a nuclear bomb anywhere in the northern hemisphere including doing so as a false flag event to blame russia detonating a dirty bomb anywhere in the northern hemisphere potentially as an act of nuclear terrorism in any of these three scenarios ionizing radiation is released and spreads across the globe due to winds various radioisotopes likely to be released in these events include iodine 131 cesium 137 strontium 90 plutonium 241 and others these isotopes have various half lives that will unleash intense iodine 131 exposure for about 10 weeks or so followed by cesium 137 which will contaminate soils waterways and the food supply for about 300 years that s about 10 half lives strontium 90 has a similar half life and decay time no one will be able to escape the radiation exposure in the northern hemisphere when mrna vaccinated people are exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation they will immediately start growing a swarm of new micro tumors across their entire body a normal healthy person with functioning nhej can repair ionizing radiation damage especially if the exposure is spread out over time but mrna vaccinated people have lost around 90 of that repair capability this is why mrna injected people are already experiencing 2000 increases in cancer rates anecdotally reported and it s why we re seeing shocking increases in all cause mortality as reported by several life insurance providers the addition of a new source of global low level ionizing radiation would be devastating to those who have taken the mrna injections they would lose genetic integrity across their bodies with tissues and organs mutating into non functioning attempts at blood vessels and protein strands in effect these people s own cells would turn against them and it wouldn t be long before they would suffer catastrophic failures of one or more organs or organ systems such as the circulatory system during autopsies it would appear as if their bodies were ravaged by a sudden wave of cancer similar to acute radiation poisoning but acting more slowly importantly these deaths would be diagnosed as cancer deaths not vaccine deaths and if a nuclear bomb could be blamed on russia in any way then putin could be the scapegoat for global cancer deaths and the near extermination of humanity of course the mrna injections were necessary to set up the conditions for this mass die off once in place all the globalists needed was a new source of ionizing radiation to be released and that s fairly simple for the deep state since russian made nuclear materials were smuggled out of ukraine during the fall of the ussr in 1991 and western intelligence sources got their hands on russian nuclear material during the chaos this means the globalist deep state has russian nukes on hand and can set them off anywhere they want then blame russia for the heinous act the obedient propaganda media of the west will gladly go along with the lie similarly putin might actually be pushed into using his own nuclear weapons due to the extreme economic war actions that have been unleashed against russia we could then experience a global nuclear exchange involving several nuclear powers either way it s clear that america and nato are attempting to drive the world into a nuclear event of some kind and as i ve described in this story i think we know the reason why it s the second part of the binary weapon for global depopulation the world is run by a suicide cult of demonic lunatics who seek the total destruction of the human race i ve stated this many times before but only now are many people seeing how the dots connect it s now obvious that the attacks on humanity have been planned to take place in multiple vectors economic biological radiological psychological etc when they are layered together on unprepared or weak minded individuals the result can be so devastating that their lives are quickly ended this process is already under way and is being rapidly accelerated with the conflict in europe bill gates must be thrilled about 63 of the world has been injected with mrna nearly 100 will be exposed to ionizing radiation as soon as the nuclear detonations or dirty bombs can be achieved by the globalists 100 of the world population will face famine starvation fiat currency collapse and insane fuel prices due to the economic war that has recently been unleashed and of course nearly 100 of the population is subjected to the psychological terrorism of the lying corporate media and government propaganda not surprisingly very few individuals can withstand all of this with their minds and bodies intact count your blessings because you are among these very few people understand though that if the globalists achieve their desired escalation many of the people you know will be dead within two years they will die from cancer from famine suicide lawless violence immunological disorders etc very few people

to confirm what was happening ms zakari a medical student from nigeria had another grim realization with sumy state university located just a stone s throw from the invading country the closest ways to safety would be hundreds of miles west or south to the borders of poland moldova hungary or romania as those huddled began discussing how they might flee on whatsapp and telegram groups for international students one sixth of the university s students are foreigners mostly from india and sub saharan africa another fear cropped up one that some black people say is ever present in ukraine reports of racism against those fleeing russian attacks gripped the students who felt frozen in place a black mother and baby forced to give up their train seats a young black man beaten after waiting hours in line in subzero temperatures a group of terrified black african students repeatedly refused entry to a safe haven traversing hundreds of miles in search of another border these were among the stories reported by nigerian nationals to consular officers indian national papers carried reports of students who say they were viciously beaten by ukrainian and polish border guards and dozens of

now as the students whispered among themselves was that machine gunfire in the streets she realized she had no chance of leaving widespread reports of mistreatment nine days after russia began bombarding ukraine from the air land and sea more than a million people have fled across international borders to safety among them are tens of thousands of african nationals who have been swept up in

allegations of racist mistreatment that have been leveled against ukrainian polish and hungarian border guards the african union said reports that africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar

currently enables some 4 000 nigerians to study there we also appreciate that those in official positions in security and border management will in most cases be experiencing impossible expectations in a situation they never expected he added but for that reason it is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favor some african countries have begun slowly evacuating their

crying his mother has been crying since the war broke out says the elder mr umar eventually his son was able to cross the hungarian border we took these kids abroad to study because of the problems we have with our universities here but now it s war and racism we get in europe he says imagine having time to be racist as news arrived march 3 of the first major ukrainian city being captured by russia ms zakari the nigerian medical student said she and her fellow foreign students felt their morale slipping but ms zakari who has ventured briefly out to the town twice to top up food and water says

too dangerous hungry russian soldiers were looting shops and houses in the region local press reported after another night of fierce bombardment ms zakari said today that her group s water supply is good for just two days but she was finding solace with her fellow international students sharing hopeful news and funny memes as they tried to keep their spirits up the university s nigerian student union had made a video appeal for all african students to be safely evacuated which students from angola to zambia were disseminating among friends family and consular officers her only hope ms zakari

in better times ukrainian drone enthusiasts flew their gadgets into the sky to photograph weddings fertilize soybean fields or race other drones for fun now some are risking their lives by forming a volunteer drone force to help their country repel the russian invasion kyiv needs you and your drone at this moment of fury read a facebook post late last week from the ukrainian military calling for citizens to donate hobby drones and to volunteer as experienced pilots to operate them one entrepreneur who runs a retail store selling consumer drones in the capital said its entire stock of some 300 drones made by chinese company dji has been dispersed for the cause others are working to get more drones across the border from friends and colleagues in poland and elsewhere in europe why are we doing this we have no other choice this is our land our home said denys sushko head of operations at kyiv based industrial drone technology company droneua which before the war was helping to provide drone services to farmers and energy companies sushko fled his home late last week after his family had to take cover from a nearby explosion he spoke to the associated press by phone and text message friday after climbing up a tree for better reception we try to use absolutely everything that can help protect our country and drones are a great tool for getting real time data said sushko who doesn t have a drone with him but is providing expertise now in ukraine no one remains indifferent everyone does what they can advertisement unlike the much larger turkish built combat drones that ukraine has in its arsenal off the shelf consumer drones aren t much use as weapons but they can be powerful reconnaissance tools civilians have been using the aerial cameras to track russian convoys and then relay the images and gps coordinates to ukrainian troops some of the machines have night vision and heat sensors but there s a downside dji the leading provider of consumer drones in ukraine and around the world can easily pinpoint the location of an inexperienced drone operator and no one really knows what the chinese firm might do with that data that makes some volunteers uneasy dji declined to discuss specifics about how it has responded to the war dji makes its products entirely for civilian use and we deplore any use of our products to cause harm company spokesperson adam lisberg said by email however just like the manufacturers of pickup trucks or mobile phones we are unable to control how they are ultimately used taras troiak a dealer of dji drones who started the kyiv retail store said dji has been sending mixed signals about whether it s providing preferential access to or disabling its drone detection platform aeroscope which both sides of the conflict can potentially use to monitor the other s flight paths and the communication links between a drone and the device that s controlling it in the meantime ukrainian drone experts said they ve been doing whatever they can to teach operators how to protect their whereabouts there are a number of tricks that allow you to increase the level of security when using them sushko said sushko said many in the industry are now trying to get more small drones including dji alternatives transported into ukraine from neighboring european countries they can also be used to assist search and rescue operations advertisement ukraine has a thriving community of drone experts some of whom were educated at the national aviation university or the nearby kyiv polytechnic university and went on to found local drone and robotics startups they ve got this homebuilt industry and all these smart people who build drones said faine greenwood a u s based consultant on drones for civic uses such as disaster response troiak s dji branded store in kyiv which is now shuttered as city residents take shelter was a hub for that community because it runs a maintenance center and hosts training sessions and a hobby club even the country s president volodymyr zelenskyy once paid a visit to the store to buy a drone for one of his children troiak said a public drone focused facebook group administered by troiak counts more than 15 000 members who have been trading tips about how to assist ukrainian troops one drone photographer who belongs to the ukrainian association of drone racing team told the associated press he decided to donate his dji mavic drone to the military rather than try to fly it himself he and others asked not to be named out of fear for their safety the risk to civilian drone operators inside ukraine is still great said australian drone security expert mike monnik locating the operator s location could result in directed missile fire given what we ve seen in the fighting so far it s no longer rules of engagement as we have had in previous conflicts some in ukraine s drone community already have experience deploying their expertise in conflict zones because of the country s long running conflict with russian backed separatists in eastern ukraine monnik s firm dronesec has tracked multiple instances just in the past year of both sides of that conflict arming small drones with explosives one thing that ukrainians said they ve learned is that small quadcopter drones such as those sold at stores are rarely effective at hitting a target with explosive payloads advertisement it would seem somewhat short sighted to waste one said greenwood the consultant based in cambridge massachusetts i assume the chief goal would be recon but if things are getting desperate who knows dji also has experience in responding to warfighters trying to weaponize its drones and used so called geofencing technology to block drone movements during conflicts in syria and iraq it s not clear yet if it will do the same in ukraine even if it does there are ways to work around it but its rival u s based drone company skydio without mentioning dji by name warned this week that russia and its allies including china could force technology companies subject to their laws to suspend operation or to provide intelligence on ukrainian forces the california company said it has not previously sold products in ukraine but is now looking at getting some in the hands of ukraine s defense forces small civilian drones are no match against russian combat power but will likely become increasingly important in a protracted war leaving drone makers no option to be completely neutral any action they take or avoid is indirectly taking a side said p w singer a new america fellow who wrote a book about war robots we will see ad hoc arming of these small civilian drones much the way we ve seen that done in conflicts around the world from syria to iraq and yemen and afghanistan singer said just like an ied or a molotov cocktail they won t change the tide of battle but they will definitely make it difficult for russian soldiers ap video journalist nathan ellgren contributed

next time you re at starbucks sbux waiting for that 5 25 double shot venti caramel macchiato you might consider spending your money on what may be a better bargain a tall order of the company s stock a punishing blend of pandemic related forces has pushed the stock of the world s largest premium coffee seller down to levels last seen during the fall of 2020 when lockdown restrictions were still in force that turned out to be a great time to scoop up shares as they rose to a record high of 126 32 less than a year later when the world started to reopen following the pandemic s first wave now investors are presented with another buying opportunity starbucks shares closed at 90 03 friday that s up from their 52 week low of 87 24 on feb 24 the day russia invaded ukraine but down nearly 23 year to date and 14 year over year its p e of 28 2 times 2021 earnings is markedly below its three year historical median of 30 6 and five year of 31 1 times adding some investment protection is the company s annual dividend of 1 96 a share yielding 2 17 that compares with the s p 500 s dividend yield of 1 38 with the second wave of the pandemic receding and the world learning to cope with covid starbucks is again poised for gains consumer spending remains strong international expansion continues particularly in china and the company is pushing ahead with new product introductions in january starbucks launched a line of drinks baya energy in partnership with pepsico pep that is available at grocery and convenience stores the energy drink market is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 7 a year and is expected to reach 86 billion by 2026 moreover the starbucks rewards program is a powerful business within a business that shows no sign of let up morningstar analyst sean dunlop puts a fair value estimate on starbucks of 106 per share that is an 18 gain from current levels based on a forward price earnings of 33 times and enterprise value forward of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda of 20 times dunlop expects near term margin pressures to ease as starbucks wide moat advantages help bolster its dominant position in the global coffee industry expanding to 59 000 stores worldwide by 2031 from today s 34 317 and leveraging its powerful brand cache to manage costs it s a rare growth at scale story dunlop says investors are over discounting near term pressures revenue rises on customer traffic rewards program fiscal first quarter revenue at the coffee chain rose 19 to top 8 billion as global same store sales gained 13 in the u s first quarter revenue rose 23 year over year to 5 3 billion spurred by a double digit increase in customer traffic as starbucks continues to widen its appeal throughout the day by offering a range of different food and drink options and targeting them to its most loyal patrons those regular customers are a significant plus for the company activations and reloads on starbucks cards exceeded 3 billion in the quarter and its starbucks rewards program increased membership by 21 to a record 26 4 million 90 day active members starbucks rewards represents 53 of total revenue they have the best rewards program in the industry says morningstar s dunlop noting rewards members spend two to three times more than other customers frequently visit the stores and are a valuable source of customer behavior data starbucks uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to win customer loyalty by tracking their preferences providing free birthday rewards as well as free add ons and refills for coffee and tea the rewards program also benefits the grocery chains and retailers that it partners with to distribute its packaged coffee by boosting customer foot traffic as members earn points when they purchase coffee and other starbucks products through the outlets if starbucks does well the retailers do too the company dunlop adds has had meaningful sales traction the past few quarters as consumer demand stayed strong despite product price hikes in october and more recently in january we re not seeing demand elasticity dunlop explains indeed in discussing first quarter earnings chief executive kevin johnson said the company has additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year which play an important role to mitigate cost pressures including inflation as we position our business for the future china sales down u s costs up despite delivering record revenue growth in the recent fiscal first quarter ended jan 2 starbucks earnings and margins took a hit from the unexpected resurgence of covid that spread around the world late last year leading to higher expenses and more severe operational disruptions in its two main markets the u s and china the company considers the pressures to be temporary and is addressing the higher costs by continuing to raise prices and cutting back spending on marketing especially as consumer demand remains strong another problem headline risk from union organizing efforts in the past six months workers at more than 100 locations out of around 9 000 stores in the u s filed to hold union elections and three have voted to unionize the actions come despite wide recognition that starbucks pay scales are higher than the industry average and that it provides generous benefits including college tuition in china where starbucks has been expanding aggressively and now has more than 5 500 stores the country s zero covid policy and mobility restrictions led to a significant disruption in store hours and transaction volumes hurting sales and profitability store closures and reduced operations at three quarters of its stores in china led to a 10 decline in same store sales growth responding to the restrictions starbucks upped its delivery and online services by partnering with meituan china s biggest food delivery platform members of starbucks rewards in china which contributes 75 of sales receive the same benefits using the meituan app in the u s staffing shortages at third party delivery providers along its supply chain required starbucks to seek alternative and more expensive distribution solutions to meet strong consumer demand covid related worker benefits including self isolation pay vaccine shot paid leave vaccine side effect pay and temporary covid 19 paid sick days were significantly higher than expected and further eroded margins costs to train new employees rose well above historical levels amid high worker turnover in addition to attract and retain workers amid a severe industrywide labor shortage starbucks hiked wages to an average of 17 an hour with a minimum wage of 15 in some markets workers will earn as much as 23 an hour employees with two or more years of service will qualify for a 5 raise in 2022 and those with five or more years a 10 raise for perspective starbucks pay scale is already 25 higher than the median average in the restaurant industry the cost squeeze while considered temporary is expected to continue through the year in reporting first quarter results in early february the company forecast gross margin of about 16 5 in fiscal 2022 down from its historical levels of 18 to 19 and said fiscal 2022 earnings per share will decline by 4 to 6 from the previous year reflecting that margin pain and lowered outlook it s the worst performing stock among its industry peers including mcdonald s mcd chipotle mexican grill cmg and darden restaurants dri for the three month period union organizing efforts spread nationally despite its comparatively generous wage and benefits package starbucks finds itself confronting the reputational risk of an unprecedented labor uprising as baristas or partners as they are referred to internally certain stores have successfully waged union organizing campaigns with workers at two locations in buffalo and one in mesa arizona voted to unionize workers at three more stores in buffalo and locations in boston chicago and seattle are also scheduled to hold votes in the coming months the actions are being encouraged by u s sen bernie sanders i vermont who has been egging on union organizers at starbucks and other companies such as amazon amzn and hershey hsy via his website twitter feed and other social media platforms those organizing efforts have been challenged by starbucks management on a store by store basis that s an expensive endeavor and has led some big institutional investors focused on environmental social and governance issues such as trillium asset management and parnassus investments to urge starbucks to reconsider they want the company to adopt a neutral stance that respects the rights of workers to organize starbucks isn t alone in seeing increased union activism and whatever happens will have implications for the restaurant industry as a whole meanwhile starbucks customers will likely still queue up for their favorite frappuccinos and cold brews and investors can rely on the long term double digit earnings growth the company expects

gender affirming care is emerging as a top target of texas republicans this year and lies at the heart of a legal battle over trans rights texas usa for lgbtq mental health support call the trevor project s 24 7 toll free support line at 866 488 7386 you can also call the national suicide prevention lifeline at 800 273 8255 or text 741741 from anywhere in the country to text with a trained crisis counselor note click here to read the texas tribune s mental health resource guide for more information gov greg abbott has asked a state agency to determine whether it s child abuse to allow transgender kids to have certain gender confirmation surgeries but experts said the surgeries abbott mentioned are rarely performed on children that came after texas lawmakers failed earlier this year to pass legislation that sought broader bans on transition related medical care for transgender kids including gender affirming care that is widely accepted by leading health care groups medical experts say republican lawmakers justifications for the bills have falsely claimed doctors and parents are allowing children to go through irreversible medical treatments lgbtq advocates say the mere specter of banning transgender kids access to some medical care exacts a mental health toll on them and now medical providers are worried that any future legislation could impact their ability to provide treatment to texas transgender kids if you can t even talk about it and these kids can t get the mental health services that they need and the counseling services that they need then that has a huge detrimental impact on those kids said seth kaplan president of the texas pediatric society what is gender affirming care areana quiñones executive director for the texas nonprofit organization doctors for change defined gender affirming care as judgment free individualized care oriented toward understanding and appreciating a person s gender providers often work with counselors and family members to ensure they have everything they need to navigate the health care system under the gender affirming model of care more time is spent allowing kids to socially transition instead of focusing on medical treatment a social transition consists of the steps a child takes to affirm their identity an example could include allowing a child assigned male at birth to wear clothing grow their hair or use a different name that better fits their identity this transition is done with their family and community s support the most important message is that trans kids are kids kaplan said and they deserve to have the same health care that all kids have which is evidence based health care that serves to promote their growth and development to help them become healthy fully functioning adults sometimes more medical support is needed for the child puberty or hormone blockers are used to give a transgender kid time before deciding what permanent transition related treatment they want what are puberty blockers puberty blockers are a type of medical treatment that delays puberty they are completely reversible it is not uncommon for puberty blockers to also be a treatment for children who aren t transgender since early onset puberty can cause health issues into adulthood they have been an approved medical treatment for children for decades hormone blockers are used for a lot of different medical purposes not just for transgender youth quiñones said so i think that it s a slippery slope when you re saying you re going to prohibit physicians from using this as a potential treatment for something do transgender children have procedures more advanced than puberty blockers some transgender children have more advanced medical procedures like starting testosterone therapy those instances are rare especially if they are allowed to go on puberty blockers which give them more time to decide what medical procedures they want in the future when they are an adult language in legislation targeting medical care for transgender children hasn t reflected this reality however one bill filed during the special legislative session by state rep matt krause r fort worth would ban gender transitioning and lists procedures that do not fall under gender affirming care the standards are to support pre pubertal youth where they are said celia neavel director of the center for adolescent health at the people s community clinic in austin there s nothing going on with hormones or surgery there s only living your life and being supportive of who you are are gender affirming surgeries used on children medical experts say transgender children rarely if ever have surgeries like orchiectomies hysterectomies and mastectomies before they re adults still gov greg abbott cited such procedures in an aug 6 letter directing the texas department of family protective services top official to determine whether such gender confirmation surgeries are child abuse under existing state law experts took issue with abbott s language in the letter which repeatedly referred to gender confirmation surgery as genital mutilation it s literally the harshest language possible because he wants a reaction from his side said andrea segovia transgender education network of texas field policy coordinator and they can gain supporters in that of like oh that sounds awful yeah we shouldn t be doing that to our minors what bills targeting transgender people have texas lawmakers pushed in recent years major legislation targeting transgender texans has been introduced in recent regular legislative and special sessions in 2017 abbott called a special session to among other issues pass a controversial bathroom bill that would have restricted which restrooms transgender texans could use the legislation ultimately failed in that special session after also failing in the preceding regular session experts warn legislation like this demonizes transgender people which can lead to them facing higher rates of violence and mental health issues these kids already suffer from much higher rates of mental health concerns related to anxiety and the higher levels of suicidal ideation because of all the stress that they re under said kaplan president of the texas pediatric society and so these laws have the potential to just have a dramatic impact on these families this was the first time legislators were faced with the reality of what was happening in a deeper way emmett schelling transgender education network of texas executive director said in a 2019 conversation about building trans political power in the midst of tragedy we were able to really make legislators understand the cost of the rhetoric and what our community was paying yet little more than a month after the conversation abbott and texas attorney general ken paxton urged state agencies to investigate whether a mother supporting her 7 year old child s gender transition was committing child abuse jeffrey younger the child s father posted falsehoods on his blog about gender affirming care capturing outrage from republican politicians like abbott paxton and u s sen ted cruz texas lawmakers promised to file legislation in response to the younger case equality texas ceo ricardo martinez said earlier this year texas filed more anti lgbtq bills during the regular session than any other state legislature according to bill tracker freedom for all americans only tennessee matched the amount of anti transgender legislation introduced in texas a federal court in arkansas recently blocked a law criminalizing gender affirming care from going into effect seventeen state attorneys general including paxton had filed a brief in support of the law krause and state sen charles perry republicans who championed some of the bills targeting transgender children this year did not respond to the tribune s request for comment abbott also did not respond how do these legislative attempts affect transgender youth lgbtq advocates say the political rhetoric surrounding anti transgender legislation and the possiblity that the bills could become law have dire consequences for trans kids mental health the trevor project found 52 of transgender and nonbinary youth have seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year it also found that over 70 of transgender kids have experienced symptoms of generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder over the last year the organization which offers crisis counseling for lgbtq youth has received over 9 400 crisis contacts from texas a majority of trans individuals have struggled with depression or anxiety at a minimum during their life and their process said adrian warren president of the texas counseling association and any time the government or really any entity has an anti trans position that does further harm and so when it is something like the government there s a very large potential for harm what do transgender texans think transgender texans are paying attention to further moves officials could make to stifle gender affirming care in texas many transgender kids and their families already have spent hours testifying at the capitol in support of gender affirming care along with doctor and counselors some are considering leaving the state if any further action is taken landon richie and his family have considered such a move now 18 richie began socially and medically transitioning as a teenager he also got involved in transgender activism and is now an intern with transgender education network of texas a third generation texan he has a younger nonbinary sibling and his family has discussed moving if they have to trans people absolutely do belong in the state of texas richie said we make up an integral part of the fabric of this state but every other year that s the message that is sent that trans people don t belong they re second class citizens texas doesn t want us to exist in public life disclosure equality texas and texas medical association have been financial supporters of the texas tribune a nonprofit nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations

a class action complaint filed today in the southern district of new york alleges that s p global cusip global services cgs the american bankers association aba and now factset cgs s new operator have conspired for decades to eliminate competition in the use of cusip numbers and that the hefty licensing fees that s p and cgs have for years charged financial institutions to use the numbers are based on bogus and malleable claims that a copyright owned by the aba allowed them to impose these restrictions the complaint names broker dealer dinosaur financial group llc and swiss life investment management holding ag as plaintiffs but was filed on behalf of a class which includes all persons or entities not including data vendors who paid a license fee to s p or factset pursuant to cgs s subscription agreement and use of services statement at any time beginning at least four years prior to the complaint s filing furthermore the complaint alleges that neither s p cgs nor the aba had the legal right and factset does not have the legal right to control the use of cusips by financial institutions and that the parties therefore had and have no legal basis to impose either the license agreements or the license fees adding that such conduct violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman antitrust act which was enacted in 1890 to protect against monopolistic behavior section 4 of the clayton act an anti trust law enacted in 1914 and the us copyright act of 1976 the plaintiffs are seeking a judgment on whether the defendants have engaged in anti competitive conduct and restitution of fees paid by financial institutions including plaintiffs among other reliefs the plaintiffs requested a trial by jury should the complaint go forward representatives for s p cusip global services and factset declined to comment the aba did not respond to a request for comment i m stunned says a sell side source and cusip user who also does not think the case will go far i think the trial by jury is a leap because most of the agreements stipulate arbitration as a means to resolve contractual issues object of scorn in north american securities markets the nine digit cusip number is the most widely used identifier of its kind it functions as a unique barcode on all stocks and registered bonds in the us and canada its 12 digit counterpart serving the rest of the world the international securities identification number isin is owned by the international organization for standards iso but operated by more than 120 national number agencies which are responsible for isin assignments in their respective countries in the us cusip global services cgs is responsible for assigning us isins in addition to cusips the cusip system including us isins has long drawn ire from the industry which has no choice but to use it for functions that include trading clearing and settlement reporting internal data management and record keeping making it a de facto industry utility for each individual use of a cusip number users must pay for issuance and licensing an end user using the cusip numbers of more than 40 000 securities throughout four or more business lines in three or more regions would potentially incur 477 750 in fees since cgs was established the majority of revenue and fees had gone to s p while a minority royalty was paid back to the aba on each cusip contract inked it s understood that structure has not yet changed under factset which closed on its acquisition three days ago in a blockbuster deal announced in december 2021 factset acquired cusip global services for nearly 2 billion from s p global which had operated the standard on behalf of its owner the american bankers association for more than 50 years the european commission had previously stipulated that s p divest cusip as part of its ongoing merger with ihs markit lawyers leiv blad of competition law partners and david nimmer of irell manella both of whom are representing the plaintiffs declined to comment this is a developing story
we felt daily welcome we supplied every day around 100 drones and users is civilian users users military users and everybody started to use these drones to find some enemies in our country and it s helpful and i know many examples when it s saved the life of our ukrainian people so we have drawn through thermal cameras from this guy and from another rep brands as well that used at night so we see the soldiers at night we see the tanks at night and for sure it s scary to use the drone in ukraine right now because it s a huge risk for your life that you will be detected and destroyed buy them so you have to follow some rules to avoid to be detected there constantly filming and so they re gathering video and then that video can be used in information warfare that video can be sent viral across youtube or instagram or twitter you name it the final thing that we haven t seen yet but we can expect it will happen is the same way that small civilian drones were used in wars like iraq jury rig arming them basically taking the small drone and mounting some kind of weapon on it um in iraq for example isis would mount hand grenades or mortar shells or homemade bombs onto the drone and then they fly it over and it would drop it with this kind of homemade dropping mechanism um some of them they turned them into like kamikaze drones so some of them for example d g i drones they don t go over 40 mph you re not going to use a fighter jet to shoot it down it would be hard even for a helicopter there also you know they re like literally this big so the responses to them range from you know old school using guns of some kind to what the u s military turned to was a variety of jammers and reportedly the russians have that kind of technology have seen images on their convoys civilian vehicles that are not just about drone jamming their cellphone jamming and we think this is going to be one of the things that they deploy into these cities as they also deploy the rest of their tanks and the like advertisement ukrainian drone enthusiasts sign up to repel russian forces share copy link copy in better times ukrainian drone enthusiasts flew their gadgets into the

silver city new mexico will join other states making moves to cut state investment in funds that might benefit russia as that country s invasion of ukraine continued into its second week moments after signing a landmark free college tuition bill into law at western new mexico university gov michelle lujan grisham s office released a letter to the new mexico state investment council which manages over 36 billion in funds including the state s land grant permanent fund and other permanent funds and 1 84 billion in other investments those assets include 7 9 million in russian stocks and bonds the governor s office said russian president vladimir putin has directed his forces to invade the sovereign nation of ukraine without justification lujan grisham wrote in the letter thousands of ukrainians have been senselessly murdered and many more will likely perish in the upcoming days weeks and months i stand with the ukrainian people and wholeheartedly condemn these egregious acts of violence which cannot go unchecked the state of new mexico has substantial investments that may be directly or indirectly aiding the russian invasion this is unacceptable the letter calls on the council to scour its portfolios for any investments that may benefit the russian government and its supporters in its war against ukraine and divest from them more residents gather in support of ukraine at new mexico state university investment council spokesman charles wollman said the council has been examining the portfolio s ties to russian companies since invasion began on feb 24 he said the investments are diverse suggesting they were not limited to the petroleum and related services sector but details were not available of four securities held by the state with exposure to russian funds wollman said two might be eliminated on their own as index fund managers restructure them to remove russian investments a miniscule portion of the portfolio consists of a bond due to mature later in 2022 wollman said and pointed out that at present it is illiquid meaning it cannot be sold immediately as the moscow exchange has remained closed to trading for a week and will remain so at least into next week two of the four securities might require directives from the council to investment managers wollman said but further details were not yet known wollman said it was not clear whether the governor s reference to russia s supporters in its war against ukraine was intended as a reference to belarus a bordering state aligned with putin which had announced it would assist in military operations in ukraine on friday belarusian president alexander lukashenko walked that commitment back saying belarusian armed forces would not participate reuters reported also unclear in the short term is whether there might be legal obstacles to divesting targeted holdings from pension funds since retirement funds may be bound to a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the investment rather than for political objectives that issue has previously challenged efforts in new mexico to exclude private prison companies from pension funds on the other hand with the effect of wide ranging global sanctions that have effectively isolated the russian government and many of its wealthiest citizens and political figures from much of the global financial system the value of those holdings may make divestment simpler algernon d ammassa can be reached at 575 541 5451 adammassa lcsun news com or algernonwrites on twitter

and the s p 500 were both down by 1 3 each the market move comes after russia attacked the zaporizhzhia plant in southeast ukraine such reckless attacks on a nuclear plant compounds fears about just how far putin is prepared to go in ukraine noted craig erlam senior market analyst uk emea oanda there is a real fear that the worst is yet to come which is obviously deeply worrying sanctions were never going to come without an element of self harm and we re seeing evidence of that this week said erlam with putin clearly undeterred further measures will be demanded which will come at a further cost on the economic front the us created 678 000 jobs last month which far exceeded expectations not to mention wednesday s adp number which has never been reliable noted erlam the big question is what this means for monetary policy all things being equal stronger than expected employment growth coupled with other positive economic data over the last month and seemingly ever increasing inflation would virtually guarantee a sharp tightening especially given jerome powell s comments earlier this week so the fed will be under scrutiny to move quickly and decisively to hike rates at its next meeting commented shafiq shabir head of electronic trading at intertrader erlam said that the dollar softened a little after the report but remained much higher on the day it s a strong report but does little to shift interest rate expectations ahead of the meeting in a couple of weeks the next three meetings will probably deliver 75 basis points of hikes 8 50am payrolls data surprisingly strong the us economy added 678 000 jobs in february bringing down the employment rate to 3 8 and pointing at a robust labor market as the federal reserve inches forward to raise interest rates economists had expected to see a 440 000 increase in non farm payrolls in february and the unemployment rate falling to 3 9 from 4 0 a month earlier after the data us stock futures continued to point to a weaker open with more attention being paid to the intensifying russia ukraine conflict contracts for the dow jones industrials average were down by 0 9 while futures for the tech laden nasdaq 100 and the broader s p 500 were both lower by 0 8 and 0 9 respectively we have a very tight labor market and it confirms that there is plenty of room for the fed to increase the interest rates said naeem aslam chief market analyst of avatrade the initial reaction in the forex market for the dollar index has been positive because the data has brought good news for them he noted that as for the equity markets we also see a relief there but the main focus among traders is the ongoing geological tensions in ukraine and they are likely to remain there investors are concerned that the jobs report is not going to matter much in terms of correcting the surging inflationary pressures fed chair jerome powell recommended a 25 basis point hike in his testimony to the congress last week 6 30am us stocks

silver city new mexico will join other states making moves to cut state investment in funds that might benefit russia as that country s invasion of ukraine continued into its second week moments after signing a landmark free college tuition bill into law at western new mexico university gov michelle lujan grisham s office released a letter to the new mexico state investment council which manages over 36 billion in funds including the state s land grant permanent fund and other permanent funds and 1 84 billion in other investments those assets include 7 9 million in russian stocks and bonds the governor s office said russian president vladimir putin has directed his forces to invade the sovereign nation of ukraine without justification lujan grisham wrote in the letter thousands of ukrainians have been senselessly murdered and many more will likely perish in the upcoming days weeks and months i stand with the ukrainian people and wholeheartedly condemn these egregious acts of violence which cannot go unchecked the state of new mexico has substantial investments that may be directly or indirectly aiding the russian invasion this is unacceptable the letter calls on the council to scour its portfolios for any investments that may benefit the russian government and its supporters in its war against ukraine and divest from them more residents gather in support of ukraine at new mexico state university investment council spokesman charles wollman said the council has been examining the portfolio s ties to russian companies since invasion began on feb 24 he said the investments are diverse suggesting they were not limited to the petroleum and related services sector but details were not available of four securities held by the state with exposure to russian funds wollman said two might be eliminated on their own as index fund managers restructure them to remove russian investments a miniscule portion of the portfolio consists of a bond due to mature later in 2022 wollman said and pointed out that at present it is illiquid meaning it cannot be sold immediately as the moscow exchange has remained closed to trading for a week and will remain so at least into next week two of the four securities might require directives from the council to investment managers wollman said but further details were not yet known wollman said it was not clear whether the governor s reference to russia s supporters in its war against ukraine was intended as a reference to belarus a bordering state aligned with putin which had announced it would assist in military operations in ukraine on friday belarusian president alexander lukashenko walked that commitment back saying belarusian armed forces would not participate reuters reported also unclear in the short term is whether there might be legal obstacles to divesting targeted holdings from pension funds since retirement funds may be bound to a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the investment rather than for political objectives that issue has previously challenged efforts in new mexico to exclude private prison companies from pension funds on the other hand with the effect of wide ranging global sanctions that have effectively isolated the russian government and many of its wealthiest citizens and political figures from much of the global financial system the value of those holdings may make divestment simpler algernon d ammassa can be reached at 575 541 5451 adammassa lcsun news com or algernonwrites on twitter

topshot the body of a russian serviceman lies near destroyed russian military vehicles on the roadside on the outskirts of kharkiv on february 26 2022 following the russian invasion of ukraine ukrainian forces repulsed a russian attack on kyiv but sabotage groups infiltrated the capital officials said on february 26 as ukraine reported 198 civilian deaths including children following russia s invasion a defiant ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky vowed his pro western country would never give in to the kremlin even as russia said it had fired cruise missiles at military targets photo by sergey bobok afp photo by sergey bobok afp via getty images afp via getty images in his book on war the prussian general carl von clausewitz surmised that peace is maintained by the equilibrium of forces and will continue just as long as this equilibrium exists and no longer by invading ukraine on february 24 2022 russia brought that truth home to europe the russian invasion exposes the weakness of europe s strategic policies pursued since the fall of the berlin wall concurrently it allows china to put the foundations of western global hegemony in check using russia as a delusional pawn on the international chessboard origins of china providing tacit support to russia february 24 2022 will find its way into the history books next to november 9 1989 the fall of the berlin wall and the september 11 2001 attacks more interestingly is the link with another date september 15 2008 the day of the demise of lehman brothers and the onset of the great financial crisis the 2008 financial meltdown resulted from an unbridled u s financial system which refused to regulate derivatives fully endorsed by larry summers and hank paulson was unable to contain the insatiable risk appetite of the banks and which left insufficient capital buffers and highly leveraged positions unattended the undoing started under the clinton and rubin administration with the promulgation of the 1999 gramm leach bliley act which dismantled the foundational 1934 glass steagall act the glass steagall act ensured stable segregation between predictable retail banking and more risk prone investment banking the crisis triggered a global housing price bubble burst brought on by too lenient global monetary policies irresponsible u s banking practice outright fraud and unsustainable global financial leverage part of the global fault line was reflected in the substantial trade imbalance between china and the u s china benefited enormously from the globalization trend triggered by the fall of the berlin wall and the relocation of global production capacity towards its lower cost base china became the global production house this position was further bolstered by china joining the world trade organization wto in december 2011 however china was left unchallenged in managing its exchange rate which is usually a quid pro quo for wto membership china recycled its excess u s dollars by building up a 1 tr position of treasury securities the move allowed china to keep its cost base artificially low by not selling the export generated revenue on the foreign exchange rate market the 2008 financial crisis revealed to china the vulnerability of the u s financial system china saw the safe haven status of its abundant treasury position unravel during the 2008 crisis after an animated meeting between u s treasury secretary hank paulson and his chinese counterpart during the 2008 peking summer olympics china started taking its fate into its own hands first through seeking global dominance to be followed by the global reserve currency status since the ukraine invasion china has been silent about sanctions as was india and it abstained at the march 2 u n general assembly vote denouncing the attack remarkably half of the 35 nations representing 4 billion citizens overall which abstained were african amongst others mozambique senegal uganda south africa zimbabwe it would be insightful to review if the mozambique u n vote was directed by the chinese write off of its debt in march 2021 would there be similar u n voting patterns in relation to african sovereign debt extended or restructured by china the invasion and its broader ramifications were probably discussed during putin s visit to china s winter olympics where the no limits partnership was inaugurated on february 4 under the partnership both countries announced mutual support over standoffs on ukraine and taiwan furthermore both countries committed to collaborate more against the west on issues as diverse as climate change artificial intelligence and space artyom lukin professor of international relations at the far eastern and federal university in vladivostok explains that the china russia relationship is part of a post west world construct several years in the making ukraine seems to have been an opportunity too good to miss for both countries the decision makers in moscow understand that without chinese assistance without the backing of china russia would be unable to withstand confrontation with the west russia has been for many years an ardent and reliable ally supporting china s global ambitions to erode the western world s power base the russian invasion is in fact part of a string of proxy wars between the u s and china the aim is for china to take over world hegemony russia s performance on the world scene 2008 2022 early in the first decade of this century the russian invasions of georgia 2008 and crimea 2014 tested nato s response mode and resolve the july 2014 shooting down of malaysia airlines flight 17 over ukraine killing 297 mostly dutch passengers was perpetrated by russian soldiers in the donbas region also tested nato s willpower in september 2015 the sudden appearance of russian troops in syria at the request of the syrian regime jolted russia back onto the global power scene russian airpower proved critical in preventing the collapse of the iranian backed assad regime assad a member of the shia minority is still in power today through this intervention russia proved its mettle by strategically positioning itself in the middle east its position has an even greater pull in the face of a potential u s withdrawal from the region in february 2022 president macron s decided to withdraw french troops from mali after they had encountered severe backlash including from the private wagner military group sponsored by russia significantly mali is the third largest producer of gold and has considerable uranium supplies the french troops had been deployed since 2013 as part of operation barkhane the code name for the anti jihadist operation covering mali burkina faso and niger the efforts are now centered around niger as the sixth global producer of uranium niger is a critical purveyor of uranium to france running 56 nuclear power plants ukraine is the ninth largest global producer of uranium these transgressions all to seek influence and access to essential primary resources occurred with no hard hitting price to be paid by russia russia had only green lights russia performed tasks that benefited china for which the payback is at minimum tacit support and at best from the russian point of view accommodation and compensation through the chinese barter and financial system europe the indulgent facilitator since 1989 europe has misread putin s and his kgb entourage s intent to reinstall the grandeur of the russian empire in the eyes of a despotic putin europe didn t deserve the expansion it was afforded at the expense of the lost russian imperial eminence europe shuffled along on at least five strategic axes energy policy defense spending cyber security illicit political party financing and financial regulation 1 energy policy and the flawed decarbonization imperative nowhere has europe positioned itself so vulnerably as in its energy policy since the first oil crisis hit europe in 1973 europe has reduced its fossil fuel dependency by only a paltry amount generating only 11 of its overall energy needs from renewables and a similar amount from nuclear energy as of 2022 europe is still reliant for almost 75 of its primary energy sources on fossil based oil 39 gas 25 and coal 11 regarding natural gas dependency germany relies on russia for 50 of its natural gas italy for 33 and the netherlands for 25 combined with the urgent climate change adaptation recommendations articulated in the latest ipcc report europe no longer has an excuse to delay the geostrategic imperative to decarbonize 75 of its primary energy resources into renewables the behind the scenes pressures exercised by gazprom and other energy lobbyists to classify natural gas as a green energy source during the e u green taxonomy review should be made public pressure from the e u commission to modify the e u green taxonomy should also be brought into the limelight the gazprom managed nordstrom p2 pipeline aims to delay the essential decarbonization process and geo politically is nothing else than a trojan horse eu gas pipelines and lng carriers le monde diplomatique cecile marin 2 defense spending europe has been betting for too long on the peace dividend emanating from the fall of the berlin wall military spending as a percentage of gdp dropped from 2 4 in 1989 to 1 5 in 2020 germany reversed this trend by announcing on february 27 2022 a surge in military spending of euro 100 bn 112 bn bringing their expenditure to 2 of their gdp earlier indications floated by the trump administration of a less u s dominant nato alliance also projected fissures within the western front low defense spending in europe and the diminished u s support for nato under trump let putin believe that rebuke and resolve would be weak in case of another incursion 3 cyber intelligence a cyberattack in february 2022 disrupting several european oil refining hubs within the amsterdam rotterdam antwerp ara area was only the latest of a string of ransomware strikes aimed at impairing crucial infrastructure and supply chain architecture the attacks exposed the need to secure legacy systems especially in the energy and communications sectors which have been outpaced in design due to accelerated digitalization and vulnerable connectivity to the internet this is a major challenge both for europe and the u s through the digital europe programme europe decided to invest 1 6 billion into cybersecurity capacity for the period 2021 2027 this wholly inadequate amount is testimony to the seriously flawed understanding of this strategic military challenge 4 illicit political party financing russia has secretly funded european political parties with a staunch anti eu stance russia is indiscriminate about financing parties both from the left and the right of the electoral spectrum so long as they promote an anti eu narrative one example in june 2020 the french far right national front party settled a controversial 10 mm loan dispute with a russian aircraft parts company furthermore there are suspicions that russia through hacking and disinformation meddled in the 2014 scottish independence referendum and the 2016 brexit referendum the u k leaving the european union caused a severe dent in the western bloc similar tactics were deployed when russian operatives leaked internal emails from democrats during the 2016 u s election the 2019 mueller report provides precise detail of russian interference in u s politics ingenious fiscal constructions make it more difficult to follow the money according to the tax justice network the netherlands ranks fourth in locations that facilitate tax evasion by multinational corporations behind the british virgin islands cayman islands and bermuda such fiscal structures in the slipstream benefit oligarchs and despots from around the world which are the financial institutions facilitating these transactions and on whose behalf under which regulatory regime do they operate and who in europe is controlling these hidden money flows 5 financial regulation the e u is only as strong as its weakest links since joining the european union in 2007 malta and cyprus have offered e u citizenship for foreign cash this policy allows foreigners to gain e u passports and access to visa free travel across the e u in the case of cyprus total bank deposits 58 bn are now a multiple of its gross domestic product 24 bn on the day of the ukraine invasion the russian state owned vtb bank which faced both european and u s sanctions transferred its stake in cyprus russian commercial bank to the two remaining shareholders both of which are companies registered in cyprus how are the cyprus central bank and the european central bank overseeing these developments in addition far too accommodating listing requirements have offered russian companies straight access to primary markets in europe there are 23 russian companies listed on the london stock exchange even after the suspension of vtb capital the german stock exchange hosts 61 listed russian companies however the operator of deutsche börse s qontigo indices stoxx decided to ax all russian companies from its indices as of march 18 both nyse and nasdaq have now halted trading of about ten russia based companies the recent data leak at credit suisse exposed the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture drug trafficking money laundering corruption and other serious crimes the 30 000 accounts represent 105bn of hidden assets switzerland has abandoned its neutrality and joined the e u sanctions against russia with the invasion can we rest assured that no other european and american financial institutions are abetting similar clients even after years of anti money laundering and know your customer practices what is next the slew of sanctions imposed on russia has led to severe financial damage the ruble declined to 102 from 80 against the dollar the russian central bank doubled interest rates to about 20 the same central bank is precluded from accessing 630 billion in mostly dollar reserves in contrast two major sources of export revenue are skyrocketing oil is quoted at 110 per barrel and the dutch april gas contract hit a new record high of 185 per megawatt hour though swift banned russian banks from its messaging system european and u s banks are still clearing euro and denominated payments as part of sanction exemptions this represents about 550 mm in daily revenue for russia s state controlled energy companies at current rates oil and gas generate about 200 bn in annual revenue russia spent about 70 bn on its military capacity in 2021 europe has received a tragic wake up call now it needs the resolve to tackle its main strategic challenges the immediate priority for europe should be to reduce the reliance on russian energy and fossil fuel altogether diplomatically and militarily europe should remember that the current axis of evil is run by putin and some 50 of his acolytes the post putin era should be envisioned with a moscow alternative power base in mind which could quickly take over the reins ultimately a decarbonized industrial and military alliance ranging from san francisco to vladivostok could be mapped it would be a formidable bloc to balance out the global ambitions of china in the meantime the critical question remains what role is china playing behind the scenes will bp s sale of its 20 rosneft stake at a loss of 25 bn end up in the hands of sinopec on the cheap will china national offshore oil corporation take over shell s lng sakhalin joint venture position with gazprom what are the state administration of foreign exchange safe and the people s bank of china facilitating on behalf of russia during this crisis are they supporting the ruble as one would expect given that the ruble should have fallen much further because of the magnitude of sanctions applied will people s bank of china intermediate any gold sale residing on the russian central bank balance sheet to the tune of about 20 of its reserves given the potential of chinese intervention behind the scenes china can also influence the reach of putin s military moves jimmy carter famously remarked that china since its 1979 vietnam invasion has been at peace with its neighbors and the world over and above crimes committed against its uyghurs minority population china knows exceptionally well how to entice other nations to engage on the battlefield on its behalf the time has come to call out china and end the human tragedy in ukraine as russia overplayed its hand under china s watch yet it will demand some astute chess play as china still sits on 1 tr of treasury securities which could find their way on the market some day on a most inopportune moment for western markets it would be just another chinese steppingstone next to its central bank digital currency initiative it its bid for global dominance and renminbi to become the global reserve currency
we felt daily welcome we supplied every day around 100 drones and users is civilian users users military users and everybody started to use these drones to find some enemies in our country and it s helpful and i know many examples when it s saved the life of our ukrainian people so we have drawn through thermal cameras from this guy and from another rep brands as well that used at night so we see the soldiers at night we see the tanks at night and for sure it s scary to use the drone in ukraine right now because it s a huge risk for your life that you will be detected and destroyed buy them so you have to follow some rules to avoid to be detected there constantly filming and so they re gathering video and then that video can be used in information warfare that video can be sent viral across youtube or instagram or twitter you name it the final thing that we haven t seen yet but we can expect it will happen is the same way that small civilian drones were used in wars like iraq jury rig arming them basically taking the small drone and mounting some kind of weapon on it um in iraq for example isis would mount hand grenades or mortar shells or homemade bombs onto the drone and then they fly it over and it would drop it with this kind of homemade dropping mechanism um some of them they turned them into like kamikaze drones so some of them for example d g i drones they don t go over 40 mph you re not going to use a fighter jet to shoot it down it would be hard even for a helicopter there also you know they re like literally this big so the responses to them range from you know old school using guns of some kind to what the u s military turned to was a variety of jammers and reportedly the russians have that kind of technology have seen images on their convoys civilian vehicles that are not just about drone jamming their cellphone jamming and we think this is going to be one of the things that they deploy into these cities as they also deploy the rest of their tanks and the like advertisement ukrainian drone enthusiasts sign up to repel russian forces share copy link copy in better times ukrainian drone enthusiasts flew their gadgets into the sky to photograph weddings fertilize soybean fields or race other drones for fun now some are risking their lives by forming a volunteer drone force to help their country repel the russian invasion kyiv needs you and your drone at this moment of fury read a facebook post late last week from the ukrainian military calling for citizens to donate hobby drones and to volunteer as experienced pilots to operate them one entrepreneur who runs a retail store selling consumer drones in the capital said its entire stock of some 300 drones made by chinese company dji has been dispersed for the cause others are working to get more drones across the border from friends and colleagues in poland and elsewhere in europe why are we doing this we have no other choice this is our land our home said denys sushko head of operations at kyiv based industrial drone technology company droneua which before the war was helping to provide drone services to farmers and energy companies sushko fled his home late last week after his family had to take cover from a nearby explosion he spoke to the associated press by phone and text message friday after climbing up a tree for better reception we try to use absolutely everything that can help protect our country and drones are a great tool for getting real time data said sushko who doesn t have a drone with him but is providing expertise now in ukraine no one remains indifferent everyone does what they can unlike the much larger turkish built combat drones that ukraine has in its arsenal off the shelf consumer drones aren t much use as weapons but they can be powerful reconnaissance tools civilians have been using the aerial cameras to track russian convoys and then relay the images and gps coordinates to ukrainian troops some of the machines have night vision and heat sensors but there s a downside dji the leading provider of consumer drones in ukraine and around the world provides a tool that can easily pinpoint the location of an inexperienced drone operator and no one really knows what the chinese firm or its customers might do with that data that makes some volunteers uneasy dji declined to discuss specifics about how it has responded to the war taras troiak a dealer of dji drones who started the kyiv retail store said dji has been sending mixed signals about whether it s providing preferential access to or disabling its drone detection platform aeroscope which both sides of the conflict can potentially use to monitor the other s flight paths and the communication links between a drone and the device that s controlling it dji spokesperson adam lisberg said wartime uses were never anticipated when the company created aeroscope to give policing and aviation authorities including clients in both russia and ukraine a window into detecting drones flying in their immediate airspace he said some users in ukraine have reported technical problems but dji has not disabled the tool or given preferential access in the meantime ukrainian drone experts said they ve been doing whatever they can to teach operators how to protect their whereabouts there are a number of tricks that allow you to increase the level of security when using them sushko said sushko said many in the industry are now trying to get more small drones including dji alternatives transported into ukraine from neighboring european countries they can also be used to assist search and rescue operations ukraine has a thriving community of drone experts some of whom were educated at the national aviation university or the nearby kyiv polytechnic university and went on to found local drone and robotics startups they ve got this homebuilt industry and all these smart people who build drones said faine greenwood a u s based consultant on drones for civic uses such as disaster response troiak s dji branded store in kyiv which is now shuttered as city residents take shelter was a hub for that community because it runs a maintenance center and hosts training sessions and a hobby club even the country s president volodymyr zelenskyy once paid a visit to the store to buy a drone for one of his children troiak said a public drone focused facebook group administered by troiak counts more than 15 000 members who have been trading tips about how to assist ukrainian troops one drone photographer who belongs to the ukrainian association of drone racing team told the associated press he decided to donate his dji mavic drone to the military rather than try to fly it himself he and others asked not to be named out of fear for their safety the risk to civilian drone operators inside ukraine is still great said australian drone security expert mike monnik locating the operator s location could result in directed missile fire given what we ve seen in the fighting so far it s no longer rules of engagement as we have had in previous conflicts in recent days russian language channels on the messaging app telegram have featured discussions on ways to find ukrainian drones monnik said some in ukraine s drone community already have experience deploying their expertise in conflict zones because of the country s long running conflict with russian backed separatists in eastern ukraine monnik s firm dronesec has tracked multiple instances just in the past year of both sides of that conflict arming small drones with explosives one thing that ukrainians said they ve learned is that small quadcopter drones such as those sold at stores are rarely effective at hitting a target with explosive payloads it would seem somewhat short sighted to waste one said greenwood the consultant based in cambridge massachusetts i assume the chief goal would be recon but if things are getting desperate who knows dji also has experience in responding to warfighters trying to weaponize its drones and used so called geofencing technology to block drone movements during conflicts in syria and iraq it s not clear yet if it will do the same in ukraine even if it does there are ways to work around it small civilian drones are no match against russian combat power but will likely become increasingly important in a protracted war leaving drone makers no option to be completely neutral any action they take or avoid is indirectly taking a side said pw singer a new america fellow who wrote a book about war robots we will see ad hoc arming of these small civilian drones much the way we ve seen that done in conflicts around the world from syria to iraq and yemen and afghanistan singer said just like an ied or a molotov cocktail they won t change the tide of battle but they will definitely make it difficult for russian soldiers ap video journalist nathan ellgren contributed to this report

notes as possessing almond vanilla hay and citrus flavours it sounds delicious but it is completely irrelevant said vellinga who in the past week has undergone a transformation from her business meaning everything to her to it being the least of her concerns perhaps even trivial in the face of global events the executive is now fielding 500 messages a day from her contacts in a war zone and premium vodka certainly isn t the subject line nobody is thinking about their business right now she said from her home in oakville ont the 52 year old s ukrainian roots run much deeper than just dollars and cents her parents are ukrainian canadians and while she was born in canada she didn t speak english until she was five nobody is thinking about their business right now katherine vellinga

of business is future proofing or taking steps to prepare an enterprise for the worst case scenario so vellinga took note when reports of irregular russian troop movements started trickling out in december my childhood was canadian by day ukrainian by weekend katherine vellinga the ukrainian distillery she is partnered with is a few hours south of kyiv in a factory nicholas ii of russia commissioned more than 100 years ago the master distillers she works with are women a norm she said in the ukrainian tradition the ingredients used to make the vodka are sourced country wide including in the east home to a years long running conflict between russian supported separatists and ukrainian troops we were considering every scenario vellinga said honestly we thought this was a lot of sabre rattling a frozen conflict an attempt to scare off foreign investment and weaken ukraine as december tipped into january she started working with her ukrainian partners to get more product out of the country a process that bumped up against european union import export regulations and her canadian vendors who ignored her pleas to frontload orders before it was too late advertisement 5 story

to come and her idea wasn t to rescue the business but to stockpile advance orders pay off suppliers use up raw materials and keep the money flowing into ukrainian hands just in case the worst happened trucks were ordered to transport the vodka but the trucks cancelled more trucks were arranged but the russians invaded the day they were to arrive recommended from editorial ethereum co

the squeeze on bakers what you need to understand is it doesn t even matter vellinga said it is nothing compared to what the ukrainian people are going through last thursday she felt helpless hopeless a day later it came to her it was time for action and while she can t arrange a shipment of weapons for ukraine she is donating 100 per cent of her profits to humanitarian aid in ukraine drinkers take

liquor stores and bars are showing solidarity through discontinued use of russian products example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video macon ga central georgia is a long way from ukraine but some folks in the peach state are standing with the country some bars and liquor stores are taking russian products off the shelves for some it s personal conviction i just can t support the aggression of it and obviously economically supporting the country is support of some form a perry bar owner said for others it s personal connection the grandmother who had a good part in raising me came here from the ukraine back in the middle of the russian revolution back in the teens as a young girl a macon liquor store consultant said the one thing these central georgia businesses agree on is russian made vodka doesn t go down smooth as it once did we have decided to not carry any russian vodkas or liquor period or any russian products at all for that matter zachary bibbins said as ukraine and russia s conflict rages on zachary bibbins the owner of main street bar in perry has chosen to change around menu items and even his liquor stock yeah a few asked me what i planned on doing and if i was dumping out the bottles or giving them away i can t give them away so i had to dump them out he said he s not the only one shutting russia out lee alexander of macon beverage outlet says he is also standing with ukraine what is more impactful we felt was trying to find a ukrainian vodka alexander said in the united states only about 1 2 of imported vodka in the comes from russia but for alexander it s long term the bigger impact is if we all kind of turn the faucet off and don t buy any additional supplies of russian vodka alexander said as store shelves hold the outcast bottles and bars display unused moscow mule cups standing for something has a silver lining it kind of crosses the political lines and brought us together and i think that is a great thing bibbins said

tafadzwa zimoyo senior lifestyle writer social media has created more overnight celebrities than reality television shows and movies in the name of influencers and africa is fast catching up with its own a list social media influencers the advent of social networking apps like facebook snapchat youtube twitter instagram and even the most recently popular tiktok has created a soft landing for anyone with the time and consistency to carve a niche and make a name for themselves many can say social media has also opened doors for content creators to be their own bosses slowly diminishing the relevance of the orthodox talent scouts because the larger world community now has access to the internet and with the world becoming a global village brands and organizations have also shifted much of their advertising to social media this paradigm shift has led to the rise of what we all know as social media influencers again social media influencers of today can be likened to the movie and music stars that only needed to take a picture with a brand or product for the particular brand or product to get more mileage a social media influencer is a person with a large audience who has garnered and held the attention and follower ship of thousands or millions of fellow social media users and has become like a sort a manual on who to follow and what to buy or who and what to patronize a few years ago being a socialite was unheard of it was taboo for a woman to pose in lingerie or nearly nude on social media but due to modernization being a socialite has become acceptable saturday herald on lifestyle this week caught up with popular radio and television samantha musa affectionately known as misred who shared her amazing story misred is a game changer with the distressed at heart everything that she touches turns gold and that midas touch has made her an enemy among fellow socialites and of course the attention seeking twelebs unlike other socialites who can do the unthinkable only to grab headlines misred has been doing the complete opposite so passionate about changing the distressed souls lives is misred that he can make a huge sacrifice in recent months she has given hope to those in despair by compiling a book while her radio programmes continue to heal bleeding soul by merely taking stock of what she has done in the past year the curvaceous presenter has shown us the other side of her beauty by unveiling a refreshingly new talkshow the tea with misred which has beenwell received she also caters for the policy makers such as captains of industry on her new web series the multi tasking media personality related how she came up with the idea of the talkshow and her dream of changing people s loves i have always wanted to create a space where we could share our successes and failures as well as celebrate each other s stories as zimbabweans i also wanted to share stories from my angle and provoke a culture of understanding before judging what better time than now says misred who has gone through a patch in her life although she has just started web series along with her production team eleven dogs inc she hasn t ruled out taking in to the small screen she also believes that reinventing it is guaranteed since the world has gone digital digital is the new way to own your content but i started television my first show being coke on the beat but having been on television in zimbabwe south africa and ghana so i definitely wouldn t rule it out in the very near future says misred with many of her followers hoping that the web series is likely to be a repetition of her from your normal radio slots if she doesn t think outside the box misred has a solution definitely not duplication on zifm stereo i m on a drive time show which is predominantly music and entertainment based we don t talk much because it is also not a talk radio station but on the tea with misred you will find content creators policy makers captains of industry socialites and so much more with very deep hearty conversations that with have you learning and laughing like any other influencer misred says she is inspired by those who started before her interestingly enough honourable supa mandiwanzira inspires me a lot because he managed to create a media empire having come from television himself and i believe i can also aspire to that level women like nigerian media mogul mo abudu who has created a multi million dollar empire in africa where movie making isn t as viable as hollywood she managed to change the narrative not just for women in this industry but the industry as a whole so their stories inspire my bold approach to a lot of what i do and still intend to do says misred with her new talkshow misred is also keen on giving exposure to other role models i hope to give a platform to new role models to enhance social consciousness provoke debate and grow our interest in the different people who make our teapot country tick even when it seems like there is little to celebrate let s celebrate what we can misred who is unquestionably one of the most hated characters on social media reckons she has found a way of handling social media trolls cyber bullying and fake news are probably one of the biggest but unspoken diseases we are dealing with as a generation on the 3 december 2021 the data protection act was gazetted and came into effect same day this makes me so happy because there is now legal recourse available to everyone when it comes to such things i have experienced this for some years and the sad thing is it s become an acceptable norm i think moving forward it s important to use all forms of arsenal available to you but i ve also learnt to reduce my time on social media sometimes starving the situation of food is the best way to kill it she says on her love life and family misred was blunt relationships are important for balance sometimes and we are thankful for them life wise my two daughters are my greatest achievement but in terms of my career i haven t reached my greatest achievement yet she says misred also opened up about her special relationship with her children my daughters hannah 12 and peter renee 4 are so very independent of me at home there is no misred just mom but they both have very independent ways of thinking and going about their lives i wish for them to pursue their own destinies with no pressure to be like me because they are their own people unlike most of her peers who want to be called socialites misred thinks otherwise i wouldn t call myself a socialite i m a media personality so i definitely do attend a lot of functions and events because of the nature of my job but the most difficult thing is finding balance between work family and celebrity life i m still in the process of trying to figure it out she says outside her busy schedule misred as a way of spending her time i play a lot of golf i found out that the best way to work out for me was to do something social that i liked that kept me moving and usually by the 18th hole i will have done a fun 10km walk which i found to be easier than going to the gym diet wise i drink a lot of water and eat very little starch i ve cut down my sugar intake although pancakes are my weakness given a chance to meet one of her favourite television personality misred said i would love to meet tyler perry i love how he turned his passion into a multi million dollar business when everyone told him that no one was interested in the stories of black people

gear obsessed editors choose every product we review we may earn commission if you buy from a link why trust us two thousand years after the indian mathematician and poet acharya pingala first described it the fibonacci sequence is still showing up in new places the series in which each number is the sum of the previous two bears the nickname of the italian mathematician who introduced it to europe leonardo bonacci fibonacci means son of bonacci recently scientists have found that the sequence 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 maps beautifully onto some of the most complex systems in nature offering a tantalizing clue about the mechanics of biological growth michael simon toon was not looking for these famous numbers when he began designing synthetic trees for a solar energy project toon noticed that although other solar tree designs exist no one had yet successfully replicated the structural stability and surface area efficiency that natural trees use to harvest light energy the inspiration for toon s version came from another ancient insight leonardo da vinci s widely accepted area preserving rule which postulates that the sum of the thickness of all of a tree s branches cannot exceed the thickness of the trunk you think math is incredible so do we let s dive deep into its mysteries together a los angeles california based artist designer and contractor toon had previously encountered the power of mathematical beauty in his modernist lighting fixtures and building designs so the idea of basing a bio inspired design on an ancient law of botany made perfect sense i d seen tree shaped solar projects before but they looked nothing like real trees he tells popular mechanics most importantly they were unrealistic you never see a symmetrical tree to build his model toon planned to fit aluminum pipes of a few stock sizes between 1 and 4 inches in diameter into custom 3d printed connectors with three openings the connectors or crotches in botanical parlance would be responsible for making the tree conform to da vinci s rule by carefully balancing the relative sizes of the pipe holes to make a realistically asymmetrical tree shape toon constructed the three holes of each connector in three different sizes you have one single trunk coming out of the ground and it splits off into two smaller branches in a tree crotch one branch is slightly smaller than the trunk itself and the other is smaller than either the trunk or the other branch he explains in other words every branch connector in this biomechanical tree model connects three branches of different sizes with the largest at the bottom and the smallest two at the top toon thought the incorporation of a 550 year old botanical insight would lend his model some of the beauty and structural resilience of a natural tree what he didn t expect was to discover a new instance of the fibonacci sequence in his own design all i did was make as many tree crotches as were required to complete the tree and then i counted the number of crotches of each size that i needed toon recalls and lo and behold it was the fibonacci sequence as the tree is built from the trunk up the branch connectors decrease in size in order to accommodate the tubelike branches each crotch must share one to three hole sizes with another crotch so for example the first connector has its largest bottom hole matched to the width of the tree s trunk while the middle and smallest size holes on top are each the same size as one of the bottom holes on the next highest connector that s when the sequence showed up toon found that given these fixed relationships da vinci s rule the fixed unequal ratios of hole sizes in each connector and the necessity of matching the bottom hole size of each connector to one of the top hole sizes of the next lowest connector the frequency of each size of connector he printed would follow the fibonacci sequence if you were to label each connector by size there would be one of the largest connector size a one of size b two of size c three of size d five of size e eight of size f and so on sergi escribano getty images agave victoriae reginae queen victoria agave royal agave is a small species of succulent flowering perennial plant noted for its streaks of white on sculptured geometrical leaves and popular as an ornamental fibonacci sequences are well documented in the spirals of certain flower petals and have been reported in other natural branching systems like rivers roots and bronchial tubes despite their fame and ubiquity however new examples of the numbers in nature don t appear every day structural regularities like this may emerge naturally in living forms due to the demands of biological survival all trees have the same priorities using minimal energy to transfer water and nutrients between the roots and the crown without being knocked over and the same available materials with which to achieve them so optimizing resources for survival forces them into a limited range of possible architectures the result is adherence to mathematical laws like da vinci s and the emerging fibonacci sequence toon found in biosynthetic trees the implications of this discovery are hard to predict from a scientific perspective observations like toon s can help guide research into the growth patterns of the original plants a well supported mathematical model of development can help scientists answer long held questions about why plants grow the way they do in theory if you can prove that growth happens at a predictable rate or in a reliable geometric pattern you can start testing theories relating to plant behavior against that pattern in order to since ancient times physicists and architects like da vinci himself have studied natural forms for inspiration the past decade has seen an explosion of research into design approaches based on living forms variously called biomechanical bio inspired and biophilic design rather than mimicking existing organisms directly these approaches use observed laws like fibonacci spirals and da vinci s rule above to construct synthetic versions that retain some of the structural advantages of the living originals designs based on these emergent natural laws also have the advantage of being aesthetically gorgeous the golden ratio in which the size relationship of a part to its whole is roughly 1 1 618 has been famous since the days of euclid as a way of describing natural beauty in everything from renaissance paintings to human faces applying the fibonacci sequence to branching systems certainly helps make toon s constructed trees and diagrams look breathtakingly realistic the project called the tree of water and power is currently in development the first installation is due to open in december 2022 but toon is encouraged by the emergence of the famous sequence i didn t do it on purpose he emphasized i just followed the rules of the tree
we felt daily welcome we supplied every day around 100 drones and users is civilian users users military users and everybody started to use these drones to find some enemies in our country and it s helpful and i know many examples when it s saved the life of our ukrainian people so we have drawn through thermal cameras from this guy and from another rep brands as well that used at night so we see the soldiers at night we see the tanks at night and for sure it s scary to use the drone in ukraine right now because it s a huge risk for your life that you will be detected and destroyed buy them so you have to follow some rules to avoid to be detected there constantly filming and so they re gathering video and then that video can be used in information warfare that video can be sent viral across youtube or instagram or twitter you name it the final thing that we haven t seen yet but we can expect it will happen is the same way that small civilian drones were used in wars like iraq jury rig arming them basically taking the small drone and mounting some kind of weapon on it um in iraq for example isis would mount hand grenades or mortar shells or homemade bombs onto the drone and then they fly it over and it would drop it with this kind of homemade dropping mechanism um some of them they turned them into like kamikaze drones so some of them for example d g i drones they don t go over 40 mph you re not going to use a fighter jet to shoot it down it would be hard even for a helicopter there also you know they re like literally this big so the responses to them range from you know old school using guns of some kind to what the u s military turned to was a variety of jammers and reportedly the russians have that kind of technology have seen images on their convoys civilian vehicles that are not just about drone jamming their cellphone jamming and we think this is going to be one of the things that they deploy into these cities as they also deploy the rest of their tanks and the like advertisement ukrainian drone enthusiasts sign up to repel russian forces share copy link copy in better times ukrainian drone enthusiasts flew their gadgets into the sky to photograph weddings fertilize soybean fields or race other drones for fun now some are risking their lives by forming a volunteer drone force to help their country repel the russian invasion kyiv needs you and your drone at this moment of fury read a facebook post late last week from the ukrainian military calling for citizens to donate hobby drones and to volunteer as experienced pilots to operate them one entrepreneur who runs a retail store selling consumer drones in the capital said its entire stock of some 300 drones made by chinese company dji has been dispersed for the cause others are working to get more drones across the border from friends and colleagues in poland and elsewhere in europe why are we doing this we have no other choice this is our land our home said denys sushko head of operations at kyiv based industrial drone technology company droneua which before the war was helping to provide drone services to farmers and energy companies sushko fled his home late last week after his family had to take cover from a nearby explosion he spoke to the associated press by phone and text message friday after climbing up a tree for better reception we try to use absolutely everything that can help protect our country and drones are a great tool for getting real time data said sushko who doesn t have a drone with him but is providing expertise now in ukraine no one remains indifferent everyone does what they can unlike the much larger turkish built combat drones that ukraine has in its arsenal off the shelf consumer drones aren t much use as weapons but they can be powerful reconnaissance tools civilians have been using the aerial cameras to track russian convoys and then relay the images and gps coordinates to ukrainian troops some of the machines have night vision and heat sensors but there s a downside dji the leading provider of consumer drones in ukraine and around the world provides a tool that can easily pinpoint the location of an inexperienced drone operator and no one really knows what the chinese firm or its customers might do with that data that makes some volunteers uneasy dji declined to discuss specifics about how it has responded to the war taras troiak a dealer of dji drones who started the kyiv retail store said dji has been sending mixed signals about whether it s providing preferential access to or disabling its drone detection platform aeroscope which both sides of the conflict can potentially use to monitor the other s flight paths and the communication links between a drone and the device that s controlling it dji spokesperson adam lisberg said wartime uses were never anticipated when the company created aeroscope to give policing and aviation authorities including clients in both russia and ukraine a window into detecting drones flying in their immediate airspace he said some users in ukraine have reported technical problems but dji has not disabled the tool or given preferential access in the meantime ukrainian drone experts said they ve been doing whatever they can to teach operators how to protect their whereabouts there are a number of tricks that allow you to increase the level of security when using them sushko said sushko said many in the industry are now trying to get more small drones including dji alternatives transported into ukraine from neighboring european countries they can also be used to assist search and rescue operations ukraine has a thriving community of drone experts some of whom were educated at the national aviation university or the nearby kyiv polytechnic university and went on to found local drone and robotics startups they ve got this homebuilt industry and all these smart people who build drones said faine greenwood a u s based consultant on drones for civic uses such as disaster response troiak s dji branded store in kyiv which is now shuttered as city residents take shelter was a hub for that community because it runs a maintenance center and hosts training sessions and a hobby club even the country s president volodymyr zelenskyy once paid a visit to the store to buy a drone for one of his children troiak said a public drone focused facebook group administered by troiak counts more than 15 000 members who have been trading tips about how to assist ukrainian troops one drone photographer who belongs to the ukrainian association of drone racing team told the associated press he decided to donate his dji mavic drone to the military rather than try to fly it himself he and others asked not to be named out of fear for their safety the risk to civilian drone operators inside ukraine is still great said australian drone security expert mike monnik locating the operator s location could result in directed missile fire given what we ve seen in the fighting so far it s no longer rules of engagement as we have had in previous conflicts in recent days russian language channels on the messaging app telegram have featured discussions on ways to find ukrainian drones monnik said some in ukraine s drone community already have experience deploying their expertise in conflict zones because of the country s long running conflict with russian backed separatists in eastern ukraine monnik s firm dronesec has tracked multiple instances just in the past year of both sides of that conflict arming small drones with explosives one thing that ukrainians said they ve learned is that small quadcopter drones such as those sold at stores are rarely effective at hitting a target with explosive payloads it would seem somewhat short sighted to waste one said greenwood the consultant based in cambridge massachusetts i assume the chief goal would be recon but if things are getting desperate who knows dji also has experience in responding to warfighters trying to weaponize its drones and used so called geofencing technology to block drone movements during conflicts in syria and iraq it s not clear yet if it will do the same in ukraine even if it does there are ways to work around it small civilian drones are no match against russian combat power but will likely become increasingly important in a protracted war leaving drone makers no option to be completely neutral any action they take or avoid is indirectly taking a side said pw singer a new america fellow who wrote a book about war robots we will see ad hoc arming of these small civilian drones much the way we ve seen that done in conflicts around the world from syria to iraq and yemen and afghanistan singer said just like an ied or a molotov cocktail they won t change the tide of battle but they will definitely make it difficult for russian soldiers ap video journalist nathan ellgren contributed to this report

great cornbread recipe this one from darlene smith i liked the green onions so much i d probably double or even triple the quantity next time close for barnes it was a chance to share knowledge food

that i read in the morning starting with the obits and then the food and the arts before i get depressed with the politics barnes says with a laugh i really miss the recipe column before recipe swap there was kitchen hotline a regular column launched by the paper s then food editor and home economist evelyn larson in 1977 the purpose was similar to provide readers an opportunity to exchange interesting or little known recipes kitchen hotline folded in 1980 when larson left the free press to pursue a career as a food researcher her post was quickly filled by political columnist alice mullin née krueger who was looking for a change of pace food was kind of a hobby for me mullin says over the phone from her home in morden and i decided gee i m getting a little cynical about writing about politics i m gonna see how this works mikaela mackenzie winnipeg free press freshly baked skillet cornbread while she took a hard news approach to food writing focusing on things like food prices the restaurant industry grocery store marketing tactics and nutrition recipes often worked their way into her articles in 1992 she relaunched the home cooking exchange as recipe swap these kinds of columns were gaining traction at newspapers across north america and the association of food journalists a professional organization dedicated to responsible food reporting and reviewing started promoting the format as an effective way to engage with readers the latter certainly rang true for mullin i got stacks of mail she says i m back at the legislature and you d go to interview a cabinet minister and he d say yeah but after we re finished i want to talk to you about that rib recipe i couldn t believe the kind of following it had alice mullin interest continued long after she returned to politics several years later i m back at the legislature and you d go to interview a cabinet minister and he d say yeah but after we re finished i want to talk to you about that rib recipe i couldn t believe the kind of following it had home cooking it turned out was a great equalizer mullin got messages from homemakers doctors with a passion for food local chefs and even then premier ed shreyer s wife lily who once sent in a lasagna recipe at no other time during her 28 year career with the free press did mullin have such a close connection with the public as when she was writing

toast syndrome a malnutrition issue experienced by elderly folks unable to cook like they used to was a trending topic at the time she received a hamburger soup recipe from a winnipeg woman named mrs anna linderholm the pair started chatting over the phone and eventually met in real life to share a bowl of soup what a lovely lovely person she was mullin says when she died i got notified by her family from minneapolis inviting me to her funeral you really did engage with people as a food writer mullin joined a long line of women to hold the position food and cooking have historically been the domain of women and in some ways the idea persists today the vast majority of free press food writers critics and columnists for example have been women at the winnipeg tribune where mullin worked as a news reporter for four years in the 1960s food content was relegated to the women s section of the paper the topic got the same treatment over at the free press it was as if the rest of the paper was not of interest to women university of winnipeg history professor janis thiessen says it tended to focus on fashion and domestic health household hints and recipes while women s sections were largely designed to sell products to homemakers they offer historians a valuable glimpse into domestic life food and recipes are intrinsically linked to the history of people and places it was as if the rest of the paper was not of interest to women it tended to focus on fashion and domestic health household hints and recipes u of w history professor janis thiessen one of the most important sites of food production is the home but there isn t often a paper trail of what goes on in the home thiessen says adding that newspaper cooking columns such as recipe swap fill an important gap in the historical record that to me is a wonderful way of knowing how people are actually cooking for mullin writing about food and recipes was an important pursuit because it was important to others everyone eats after all people tend to think of food writing as kind of fluffy and that political writing or the hard news end of it is the tough stuff she says it is different but in seeing the kind of response there was from the food page it was very gratifying winnipeg free press alice krueger launched the recipe swap column in 1992 it ran every wednesday taking over recipe swap was a career defining moment for ilana simon who ran the column from 1994 to 2006 when the opportunity came up i jumped at it she says it was a natural fit for the local freelance writer and foodie that would later open doors to the national cookbook market simon penned two recipe swap cookbooks during her tenure with the free press and later published four more about everything from fondue to indoor grilling the column honed her skills as a recipe tester and developer simon s goal was to share recipes that had been vetted in her own kitchen in order to build trust and reliability over the years she tried out more than 1 000 submitted recipes it was a lot of taste testing not that her family minded both of my boys had very sophisticated palates from a young age simon says with a laugh pumpkin

staples such as borscht pickerel and butter tarts to imitation jeanne s cake and other dishes from iconic winnipeg restaurants naturally the work expanded simon s own recipe repertoire it s hard to pick a favourite but the pumpkin cheesecake sent in by brenda marantz during her first year as a columnist has become a family thanksgiving tradition a lot can change in 12 years simon watched culinary trends evolve appetizers for example had a major moment in the early 2000s and communication methods shift in real time the internet was still in its infancy and social media hadn t yet become a gathering place for those with niche interests like recipe sharing it was a sweet spot in time for a column that relied on a captive audience still even as email gained popularity simon had a dedicated contingent of letter writers pen pals as she called them i can still see those handwritten recipes on yellow lined paper i would recognize their handwriting on the envelopes she says it was touching that they spent so many hours writing out their recipes and posting them for the column s 10th anniversary she recognized 10 loyal swappers who contributed regularly edna mroz was unsurprisingly at the top of the list simon got to know people through regular exchanges and started connecting with readers in person during cooking demonstrations at the forks and elsewhere those who followed along felt a sense of ownership over recipe swap community was the goal and the best part of the job ruth bonneville winnipeg free press ilana simon longtime editor of the recipe swap column puts the finishing touches on one of her favourite recipes pumpkin cheese cake the tone that i wanted to set was a kind of coffee klatsch vibe she says we were just a bunch of manitobans sitting around the kitchen table sharing family recipes with each other and i think that resonated with people when she resigned from the column in 2006 it was because life was getting busy she had moved into a communications job and there was little time left over for freelancing the news was met with a letter to the editor imploring the paper to reinstate recipe swap there must ve been more than one letter because the feature returned several months later with darlene henderson an avid home cook who worked in the free press s advertising department at the helm she carried the torch for three years until alison gillmor took over in 2010 up to then gillmor had been working as the paper s freelance movie reviewer and pop culture columnist food was at that point an interest not an area of expertise i had some spectacular failures she says laughing while reminiscing about her recipe testing days ruth bonneville winnipeg free press a pumpkin cheese cake recipe submitted by reader brenda marantz is among ilana simon s family favourites it was daunting to take on such a popular long running series but the fact that all of the recipe swap columnists were home cooks without any formal culinary training quelled her anxiety in one way i sort of felt underqualified but then the core of it is the idea that you re also a home cook doing the best you can she says you were in there trying to figure things out too and trying to become a better cook and learn alongside the readers and gillmor learned a lot from readers her baking skills especially when it came to pie crusts pastry and bread got stronger thanks to hours spent in the kitchen trying out submissions a skillet cornbread made with cheddar cheese and green onions that was published in 2013 remains a personal favourite like simon gillmor s family were happily enlisted as taste testers the free press photo crew tasked with getting food pictures for the column also became a regular part of the dinner routine they would be setting up their lights and stuff and sometimes we would be waiting around for them to finish so we could eat she says in one way i sort of felt underqualified but then the core of it is the idea that you re also a home cook doing the best you can alison gillmor gillmor ran recipe swap until 2016 when it was decided the feature had run its course the torrent of letters had slowed to a trickle and there was no longer enough reader engagement to keep up a weekly publication online cooking forums and food blogs had exploded making a newspaper recipe section somewhat obsolete it was also around this time that she started writing restaurant reviews recipe swap was gillmor s first foray into food writing and reviewing was an entirely different world i think home cooking at its heart is about expressing your love and care for people around you she says and restaurant cooking is often a little bit more about showing off your expertise simon agrees adding that the column often created a reciprocal relationship between relative strangers you re helping someone else and you re also pleased that someone will be trying your recipe she says i think interacting with other people over recipes sort of speaks to that labour of love when someone goes to the trouble of preparing something for you that s the joy of cooking the act of recipe sharing is something prof janis thiessen thinks about often she is the lead investigator with the manitoba food history project and has spent the last several years travelling around the province in a retrofitted food truck collecting recipes and personal stories like the dishes featured in recipe swap much of what s shared on the truck has deep connections to personal and regional history the simple act of sharing a recipe can add new layers and meaning to that history there s tremendous amounts of information transferred from individual to individual it s an important part of understanding food prof janis thiessen there s tremendous amounts of information transferred from individual to individual thiessen says it s an important part of understanding food as recipes get inherited and passed along they inevitably get tweaked to suit the tastes ingredients and methods of the day with each maker adding a dash of their own story to the meal it s one of the reasons food is a universal language and a way to have conversations with folks with whom you might not have anything else in common thiessen says it s why breaking bread even over newsprint is an effective way to build community this is the latest story

no matter what you ve heard there is no one definitive or best gumbo recipe out there gumbo is a deeply personal dish and there are as many versions of it as there are cooks in louisiana perhaps even more there are cajun gumbos creole gumbos and numerous variations like the one served at new orleans restaurant turkey and the wolf with tamarind paste and potato chips this rendition keeps things fairly classic with the holy trinity of onions celery and green peppers a roux and chicken stock andouille sausage adds smokiness that s balanced by the chicken and okra helps thicken the stew some argue that there s no gumbo without filé powder so we ve made it optional made from sassafras leaves that are dried and ground it further thickens the dish it s crucial that it s added at the end of the cooking just before serving and never allowed to boil which makes it bitter if you prefer gumbo with tomatoes a nod to creole tradition give this one a try and if you re not a fan of okra this rendition is made without no matter the recipe rice is a good accompaniment editor s note this recipe was originally published in our january 2012 issue
vol 46 no 9 friday march 4 2022 ukrainian drone enthusiasts sign up to repel russian forces the associated press print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required in better times ukrainian drone enthusiasts flew their gadgets into the sky to photograph weddings fertilize soybean fields or race other drones for fun now some are risking their lives by forming a volunteer drone force to help their country repel the russian invasion kyiv needs you and your drone at this moment of fury read a facebook post late last week from the ukrainian military calling for citizens to donate hobby drones and to volunteer as experienced pilots to operate them one entrepreneur who runs a retail store selling consumer drones in the capital said its entire stock of some 300 drones made by chinese company dji has been dispersed for the cause others are working to get more drones across the border from friends and colleagues in poland and elsewhere in europe why are we doing this we have no other choice this is our land our home said denys sushko head of operations at kyiv based industrial drone technology company droneua which before the war was helping to provide drone services to farmers and energy companies sushko fled his home late last week after his family had to take cover from a nearby explosion he spoke to the associated press by phone and text message friday after climbing up a tree for better reception we try to use absolutely everything that can help protect our country and drones are a great tool for getting real time data said sushko who doesn t have a drone with him but is providing expertise now in ukraine no one remains indifferent everyone does what they can unlike the much larger turkish built combat drones that ukraine has in its arsenal off the shelf consumer drones aren t much use as weapons but they can be powerful reconnaissance tools civilians have been using the aerial cameras to track russian convoys and then relay the images and gps coordinates to ukrainian troops some of the machines have night vision and heat sensors but there s a downside dji the leading provider of consumer drones in ukraine and around the world can easily pinpoint the location of an inexperienced drone operator and no one really knows what the chinese firm might do with that data that makes some volunteers uneasy dji declined to discuss specifics about how it has responded to the war dji makes its products entirely for civilian use and we deplore any use of our products to cause harm company spokesperson adam lisberg said by email however just like the manufacturers of pickup trucks or mobile phones we are unable to control how they are ultimately used taras troiak a dealer of dji drones who started the kyiv retail store said dji has been sending mixed signals about whether it s providing preferential access to or disabling its drone detection platform aeroscope which both sides of the conflict can potentially use to monitor the other s flight paths and the communication links between a drone and the device that s controlling it in the meantime ukrainian drone experts said they ve been doing whatever they can to teach operators how to protect their whereabouts there are a number of tricks that allow you to increase the level of security when using them sushko said sushko said many in the industry are now trying to get more small drones including dji alternatives transported into ukraine from neighboring european countries they can also be used to assist search and rescue operations ukraine has a thriving community of drone experts some of whom were educated at the national aviation university or the nearby kyiv polytechnic university and went on to found local drone and robotics startups they ve got this homebuilt industry and all these smart people who build drones said faine greenwood a u s based consultant on drones for civic uses such as disaster response troiak s dji branded store in kyiv which is now shuttered as city residents take shelter was a hub for that community because it runs a maintenance center and hosts training sessions and a hobby club even the country s president volodymyr zelenskyy once paid a visit to the store to buy a drone for one of his children troiak said a public drone focused facebook group administered by troiak counts more than 15 000 members who have been trading tips about how to assist ukrainian troops one drone photographer who belongs to the ukrainian association of drone racing team told the associated press he decided to donate his dji mavic drone to the military rather than try to fly it himself he and others asked not to be named out of fear for their safety the risk to civilian drone operators inside ukraine is still great said australian drone security expert mike monnik locating the operator s location could result in directed missile fire given what we ve seen in the fighting so far it s no longer rules of engagement as we have had in previous conflicts some in ukraine s drone community already have experience deploying their expertise in conflict zones because of the country s long running conflict with russian backed separatists in eastern ukraine monnik s firm dronesec has tracked multiple instances just in the past year of both sides of that conflict arming small drones with explosives one thing that ukrainians said they ve learned is that small quadcopter drones such as those sold at stores are rarely effective at hitting a target with explosive payloads it would seem somewhat short sighted to waste one said greenwood the consultant based in cambridge massachusetts i assume the chief goal would be recon but if things are getting desperate who knows dji also has experience in responding to warfighters trying to weaponize its drones and used so called geofencing technology to block drone movements during conflicts in syria and iraq it s not clear yet if it will do the same in ukraine even if it does there are ways to work around it but its rival u s based drone company skydio without mentioning dji by name warned this week that russia and its allies including china could force technology companies subject to their laws to suspend operation or to provide intelligence on ukrainian forces the california company said it has not previously sold products in ukraine but is now looking at getting some in the hands of ukraine s defense forces small civilian drones are no match against russian combat power but will likely become increasingly important in a protracted war leaving drone makers no option to be completely neutral any action they take or avoid is indirectly taking a side said pw singer a new america fellow who wrote a book about war robots we will see ad hoc arming of these small civilian drones much the way we ve seen that done in conflicts around the world from syria to iraq and yemen and afghanistan singer said just like an ied or a molotov cocktail they won t change the tide of battle but they will definitely make it difficult for russian soldiers ap video journalist nathan ellgren contributed to this report
note as we write this piece our hearts and thoughts are with the people of ukraine our sadness at watching the situation unfold is leavened only by the inspiring courage demonstrated each day by those under attack it is challenging to write about the impact of geopolitical and humanitarian tragedies on the market it can feel uncaring and narrowly siloed it is our job however to monitor the crypto markets on behalf of our clients and we have been receiving many questions about ukraine in recent days we have done our best to address the most common of those questions below in this issue we discuss why comparing bitcoin to gold during sell offs misses a key part of the story why comparing bitcoin to gold during sell offs misses a key part of the story how weaponizing the world s financial system might hasten the embrace of crypto around the world where crypto is entering the national security conversation and what the consequences might be the media wants there to be a simple answer to the question what is the impact of ukraine on crypto they either want it to be good a monetary escape valve for individual citizens or bad a tool for evading sanctions the reality is more nuanced there are threads in current developments that if pulled could be radically positive for crypto expanding and accelerating the market dramatically but there are also threads that could be challenging in the thrum of a fast moving event a full analysis of the situation should lead to probabilities not declarative statements for that reason it s important to highlight the things we already know about the relationship between current events and crypto and what recent developments could augur for the market with that goal in mind we ve set out to answer the two most common questions we re hearing about ukraine question 1 does the recent price action change our view of bitcoin as a safe haven asset let s start here every time the broad capital markets suffer a risk off shock two things usually happen bitcoin sells off over the short term and some market pundits readily assert see bitcoin isn t gold consider the last three major risk off sell offs over bitcoin s lifetime march 2020 covid panic the s p 500 index dropped 16 5 from the close of trading on friday march 6 through thursday march 12 one of the sharpest corrections on record bitcoin fell more than 45 over the same time frame the media was all over it cnbc bitcoin lost its allure as a safe haven asset this week march 2020 covid panic the s p 500 index dropped 16 5 from the close of trading on friday march 6 through thursday march 12 one of the sharpest corrections on record bitcoin fell more than 45 over the same time frame the media was all over it cnbc bitcoin lost its allure as a safe haven asset this week q4 2018 fed rate hikes the s p 500 fell 13 7 as the federal reserve hiked interest rates causing investors to worry about recession bitcoin fell over 40 marketwatch wrote here s why bitcoin isn t the next gold in one chart q3 2011 eurozone debt crisis the stock market suffered one of its worst quarters ever skidding 17 1 on concerns that greece and other european nations would default bitcoin tumbled more than 60 this academic paper captures the zeitgeist at the time bitcoin is not the new gold a comparison of volatility correlation and portfolio performance this pattern repeated again last week as putin invaded ukraine bitcoin and other risk assets sold off sharply the world s largest crypto asset was trading near 40 000 before the invasion and fell below 35 000 as russian tanks entered ukrainian territory predictably the commentariat pounced one declared ukraine the nail in the coffin of the digital gold narrative in our opinion this is wrong and can harm investors it s time to correct it if there is one thing investors can agree on about bitcoin it s that it is volatile and future oriented during periods of acute market stress investors tend to discount the future in favor of the present and sell volatile assets to raise cash as a result bitcoin typically acts like a risk asset during such periods far from being surprising however this pattern is part and parcel of what has made bitcoin the best performing asset in the world over the past three five and ten years and what has convinced investors from ray dalio to paul tudor jones to stanley druckenmiller to allocate to bitcoin as an emerging store of value a short term spike in correlation does not change bitcoin s value as a long term hedge against monetary disorder or geopolitical risk these risks are not intraday phenomena they develop over years and as any insurance sales rep will tell you a hedge should match the duration of its risk in other words a successful hedge against inflation or geopolitical stress should play out not only over weeks or quarters but years through this lens bitcoin has done remarkably well posting a 4 000 000 return over the past decade the media s gotcha reaction to short term sell offs does a disservice to investors provoking them to question bitcoin s role during stressful moments and possibly to panic and sell as we write this bitcoin is up more than 25 from its lows that often happens after these sharp risk off pullbacks it is hard to know today with 100 confidence if bitcoin will be a successful hedge against inflation in the future it is rightly understood as an emerging store of value one with significant opportunities and certain risks but if you close your eyes and imagine a world with runaway price increases financial instability or one where the dollar loses its role as the world s sole reserve currency do you want to own more or less bitcoin question 2 what will ukraine mean for crypto in the long term while the people of ukraine battle russia in the streets global allies are battling russia in the market so far this includes sweeping sanctions against russian financial institutions and individuals steps to cut off russia s central bank from its currency reserves and efforts to partially remove russia from the swift messaging system that underpins the movement of money worldwide this represents an unprecedented weaponization of the world s financial infrastructure the potential long term implications for crypto are profound for starters it seems likely that these developments will hasten the world s movement away from a unipolar and dollar focused financial ecosystem non nato countries like china and russia will take heed of the west s steps to remove russia from swift and accelerate the development of alternative financial rails these may be proprietary russia is attempting to build its own swift alternative but this pressure will simultaneously reinforce the value of and desire for a robust neutral settlement network such as the type that crypto provides crypto is one of the only technological platforms designed to not only withstand but thrive in a multi polar world order some would argue that this is exactly the type of situation that crypto was intended for expect to hear more about this crypto use case going forward beyond this impact however the other major takeaway from these developments is that governments are realizing in real time that crypto is now a critical part of the world s financial ecosystem from ukraine collecting over 20 million in crypto donations to resist the invasion to the biden administration asking crypto exchanges to ensure they are not being used to evade sanctions crypto is moving from being a quirky asset class to having a seat at national security discussions one likely outcome is that western nations will speed up their efforts to bring crypto rails inside the regulatory perimeter there is a risk at these moments that regulators in some countries will overreach but there is an equal chance that governments may see working with the crypto industry as more of an opportunity than a threat and look to foster the growth of crypto in their markets after all you can only regulate entities if they are built on your shores one last item worth noting this crisis has once again demonstrated the utility and resilience of crypto financial networks during times of turmoil as ukrainian and russian citizens queued at atms to get their hands on vanishing cash and as point of sale transaction networks like apple pay stopped working crypto networks functioned well and allowed individuals a means to access and use their money stories like this one of danish reporters forced to buy a car with bitcoin because credit card transactions stopped working are a reminder that decentralized networks have significant advantages over their centralized peers no one can forecast what path prices will follow

with global oil prices jumping to over 100 per barrel on tuesday largely due to the war in ukraine shippers could see fuel surcharges as trucking fleets and small carriers pass on the costs higher oil prices are translating directly to higher diesel prices on monday the energy information administration reported u s diesel prices were 4 104 per gallon up 4 9 cents in a week and 1 032 from a year before diesel prices are likely to go higher as russia and ukraine continue to fight and as oil companies pull business from russia the third largest oil producer in the world after the united states and saudi arabia gasoline is also shooting up at 3 608 per gallon up 7 8 cents from the previous week and up 89 7 cents from the comparable week a year ago not surprisingly prices in california are significantly higher than the norm diesel is 5 077 per gallon in the golden state for now fleets in general will pass the costs on to shippers via fuel surcharges said tim denoyer act research vice president and senior analyst but those surcharges do not cover empty miles and those fuel costs can squeeze margins of profitability fuel is the second largest expense for a fleet after driver wages fuel costs a truck 43 3 cents per mile or about 24 of a truck s expenses according to the american transportation research institute s november 2019 report big fleets usually have pricing deals with fuel suppliers and they have fuel surcharges written into contracts but not everyone does the recent surge in diesel prices has the phones ringing at the owner operator independent drivers association with drivers asking how to attach fuel surcharges to their per mile rates it will hit the small guys hard said lewie pugh executive vice president of ooida i m sure there is more to come it s going to affect members some customers wouldn t pay a fuel surcharge some would lewie pugh executive vice president at the owner operator independent drivers association pugh said the rising fuel costs will pinch everyone including shippers and big fleets the small trucker may get hit the hardest however he found that when he was an independent owner operator some customers wouldn t pay a fuel surcharge some would diesel prices were already rising through 2021 and for the bigger fleets the latest earnings cycle didn t show a major effect in q4 however some executives spoke of trends they saw partially caused by higher fuel costs at j b hunt fuel prices were putting pressure on shippers to consider intermodal over trucks as an organization we see tremendous pent up demand to convert highway freight to intermodal with elevated truck rates the tight labor market higher fuel prices and a 60 improvement in carbon efficiency intermodal offers versus truck said shelley simpson j b hunt s chief commercial officer and evp for people and human resources during the company s investor call on jan 19 but the increase in fuel charges has tended to bump up general revenues for big fleets especially with e commerce still booming within the economic recovery j b hunt reported 3 5 billion in revenue in q4 up 28 from a year before the sky is the limit phil flynn an oil analyst at the price futures group said he sees no immediate decrease in prices at least not ones caused by sudden peace in ukraine or an increase in oil production the sky is the limit said flynn it s being based on fear and the unknown the one thing that could bring prices down is demand destruction flynn said something that often augurs a recession as it did in 2008 when oil prices peaked around 150 per barrel demand destruction caused by high fuel prices can mean fewer consumer purchases and less freight moving denton cinquegrana chief oil analyst with opis agreed as it currently stands demand destruction is the only thing that could cool off prices said cinquegrana there s not much you can do if the economy is growing to complicate matters a portion of u s diesel stock is imported from russia said cinquegrana in 2021 the u s imported an average of 209 000 barrels per day of crude oil and 500 000 per day of other petroleum products from russia according to the american fuel petrochemical manufacturers that small share could be ended if the federal government decides to push private companies to end diesel imports from russia even that little bit could hurt as diesel supplies are tight said cinquegrana flynn said the oil price spike was not a surprise to him because it was an accident waiting to happen the biden administration took office a year ago he said and cut down on oil and gas production most dramatically by canceling the permit for the expansion of the keystone xl oil pipeline from alberta canada a release of 50 million barrels from the u s strategic petroleum reserve in november did little to slow down prices flynn said on tuesday night in his state of the union address president joe biden announced the united states agreed with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from world reserves america will lead that effort releasing 30 million barrels from our own strategic petroleum reserve said biden and we stand ready to do more if necessary unified with our allies the announcement did not immediately calm oil markets as west texas intermediate oil broke 109 per barrel by wednesday afternoon

morehead city n c wildlife advocates are suing the state of north carolina saying it s failed to protect coastal fisheries over the years at the heart of the issue is an argument over how much flounder should be brought in by professional fishermen and those fishing for fun the atlantic southern flounder is one of the staples of the n c coast for years professional fishermen and amateurs alike have flocked to the morehead city area hoping to reel in the flat fish but experts say they ve caught too many the stock assessments for southern flounder show that at least for the last 20 years the stock has been over fished said david sneed the executive director of coastal conservation association nc cca nc has been suing the state since 2020 accusing it of failing to sustainably manage coastal fisheries the argument is if the state s not responsible for the proper management of these resources then who is sneed said a spokesperson for the state department of environmental quality declined to comment on the lawsuit where one of the main issues is the flounder sneed said historically commercial fishermen have brought in 70 percent of all flounder caught in the state with 30 percent coming from recreational anglers as part of a plan to build back the fish s population the state s marine fisheries commission decided in february to make that 70 30 split a rule limiting each group to bring in that proportion each year through 2024 before splitting the harvest 50 50 starting in 2026 sneed said the plan is unfair to recreational fishermen those 20 years of overfishing i m referring to the commercial industry was taking 70 to 80 percent of the harvest said sneed they are the reason that we re in this boat today they re the ones that have made the biggest impact on the stock commercial anglers have a different take the state destroyed the industry just plain and simple said rodney rose the owner of rose seafood market in beaufort rose has been catching flounder to sell since the 1980s he said with commercial fishermen facing shortened fishing seasons and weight limits for their catch already a 50 50 quota could throw out whatever income they have left no title provided now it s nearly impossible to even think about making a living out of flounder he said until their flounder quota gets lowered rose said all they can do is keep fishing and hope for the best
it s been another wild week in the markets with news and movements largely centered around what s happening with russia s invasion of ukraine agweektv s michelle rook said on this week s agweek market wrap wheat was up this week on news out of the black sea region where ports are shut down the biggest gains were in the chicago and kansas city markets while minneapolis wheat lagged a bit while martinson said wheat put in a heck of a week he thinks that market is overvalued and likely has run its course he thinks feed grains like corn and barley will be the focus in the future if ukraine can t get a crop planted another factor is that europe may be considering opening up set aside acres to farming which could increase available stocks martinson said he highly doubts the u s would do anything similar with conservation reserve program acres but of course much will depend on what happens next in ukraine will russia cease control or will ukraine hold them off how long will the conflict last and what happens when it s over we re at the mercies of a madman right now and what his actions are going to be in this country martinson said noting there are more unanswered questions than there are answers now it could be three to six months at minimum until ports are reopened and operational but longer depending on the course of the conflict he said advertisement martinson said estimates are now that there are about 14 million metric tons about 500 million bushels of corn and about 7 million metric tons about 250 million bushels of wheat that were slated to be shipped out of ukraine in march april or may he expects some sales could move to the u s as the buyers need to get product elevators in many places are bidding either no quote or are pricing grain based on the july contract rather than on march or may martinson explained that s due to the elevators not seeing demand and facing unusual volatility once we start to see no grain being bought at the elevators that s a sign things are changing he said soybeans aren t shipped out of the black sea region so they didn t move as much as wheat and corn sunflowers and sunflower oil in particular do ship out of there and do impact the soybean oil market but soybean oil also is impacted by palm oil which martinson said imploded this week other news that held the soybean market back was of negative crush margins in china and some rains falling in south america soybeans however can t lose much ground to corn and wheat without risking losing acres a strong corn market was hard on the livestock markets this week rook said and the cattle market was fairly ugly also weighing on cattle were issues like the stock market price of fuel and expected increases in interet rates however martinson said he s still friendly cattle long term and expects them to find a floor soon hogs had a tough week too though rook said it likely had something to do with traders getting money out of the market martinson agreed and said it s likely a short lived thing this is a week where fundamentals didn t matter technicals didn t matter he said it was about money flow and pushing the market
critics receiving the prepublication galleys of hernan diaz s new novel trust riverhead may may be forgiven for being confused the book comes in a box bearing the cover image of another novel bonds by harold vanner and inside are flaps announcing the titles of still other books by the time one unpacks diaz s actual novel its title comes to seem like a winking challenge after such dissimulation the trustworthiness of the book and perhaps of fiction in general has been called into question and that is very much diaz s purpose trust which follows diaz s 2017 pulitzer finalist debut in the distance presents four takes on the story of andrew bevel a fictional early 20th century financial titan and his wife mildred the first is a novelization of the couple s life by vanner the second is a memoir by bevel himself the third is a first person narrative by bevel s young secretary ida partenza and the fourth is a diary by a character whom it would spoil the ending to identify set in the years leading up to and following the 1929 stock market crash the novel is in large part an investigation of capitalism s intoxicating pull on the american consciousness diaz speaking via zoom from his home in brooklyn heights says he wanted to explore the force the sheer magnetic mystical transcendental force of money in its focus on the financial barons of the roaring 20s trust seems at first seems like a far cry from in the distance that novel told the story of a swedish immigrant making a bloody and surrealistic trek across the american west in the mid 19th century but for diaz the two novels are part of a broader intellectual and artistic preoccupation in both these cases i saw what to me were two essential myths he says in the case of in the distance it s the western in the case of trust it s the myth of capital this latter myth strikes diaz as one ripe for further study you have a ton of books henry james edith wharton that deal with the symptoms of wealth he says but there are very very few novels that deal with the process of accumulation of capital this to me was baffling here we have this essential component of the american dream which is wealth and the american literary tradition has somehow skirted this issue diaz observes american mythologies with the clarity of an outsider he was born in 1973 in buenos aires and spent his childhood in sweden before returning to his native country by the time he was in his teens he knew he wanted to be a writer and he opted to follow that path by way of academia there weren t any creative writing programs or workshops or anything like that he says studying literature was the only thing you could do if you wanted to pursue anything seriously after moving to new york city in his 20s diaz received a phd in philosophy from new york university i was very absorbed by academic writing he says it took over from fiction for a good while when he finally did return to fiction writing he faced the usual tidal wave of discouragement i wrote a lot and got rejected a lot there was a whole novel written before in the distance and a good pile of stories in the distance made its way into the world humbly as an unagented submission to coffee house press but it became a hit with critics and a regular on the awards circuit the book won the william saroyan international prize for writing and was nominated for both the pen faulkner award and the pulitzer prize now diaz says i feel like i get the luxury of calling myself a writer diaz s scholarly background served him well in the writing of trust to flesh out the life and mind of bevel who in the novel is accused of profiting off the 1929 crash by manipulating the market and shorting distressed assets diaz conducted intensive research on high finance and monetary policy to understand bevel s wife mildred he read the papers of adelaide frick at new york s frick collection going through these papers diaz says what struck me first was the loneliness the profound profound boredom and suffocation that comes across women in new york s high society at the time he adds although having all the material means in the world almost literally were confined to reduced roles trust also gave diaz an opportunity to experiment with genre conventions vanner s novel about the bevels in its psychological subtlety and mannered delicacy calls to mind the classical literary realism of henry james the autobiography by ida partenza bevel s secretary takes cues from the style of new journalism and the concluding diary diaz intended as a modernist cabinet of curiosities as if virginia woolf had written wittgenstein s philosophical investigations importantly no single one of the four stories that make up trust lays claim to any authoritative truth for much of the novel the question of how bevel so consistently outsmarted the market and of what his and mildred s interior lives consisted of remains largely a mystery not only to the readers of trust but to the novel s characters themselves this ambiguity the failure of any narrative to deliver a conclusive account of the world is critical to diaz s project in march 2021 diaz delivered a lecture at the yale macmillan center titled the heart of fiction the title is a reference to james s famous essay the art of fiction like many writers diaz suffers from henry james obsessive disorder the lecture was in part a response to the recent flourishing of autofiction and that genre s arguably dubious claims to veracity fiction diaz said in the lecture rather than presenting us with truthful content shows us how we experience truth if autofiction offers the illusion of unmediated authenticity diaz says i think trust and my view of literature in general double down on the notion of mediation and removal for him the trust we place in narrative is as precarious as the trust we place in money both are mere representations of reality that we agree to take at face value but what gives us confidence that a dollar bill has the purchasing power it signifies what gives us confidence that any writer whether vanner bevel partenza or diaz himself is portraying the world accurately and what effect might these distancing representations both narrative and financial have on the soul and its ability to connect to others in diaz s view these questions are central to the literary enterprise fiction s relationship to truth he says lies precisely in those mediations and removals and in describing the ultimate inability to reach out and touch the world daniel lefferts is a writer living in new york city

nx earnings call for the period ending december 31 2021 quanex building products nx 1 17 q1 2022 earnings call 11 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day and thank you for standing by welcome to the first quarter 2022 quanex building products corporation earnings conference call please be advised that today s conference is being recorded i would like to hand the conference over to your host today scott zuehlke svp cfo and treasurer please go ahead scott zuehlke senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks for joining the call this morning on the call with me today is george wilson our president and ceo this conference call will contain forward looking statements and some discussion of non gaap measures forward looking statements and guidance discussed on this call and in our earnings release are based on current expectations actual results or events may differ materially from such statements and guidance and quanex undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement to reflect new information or events for a more detailed description of our forward looking statement disclaimer and a reconciliation of non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures please see our earnings release issued yesterday and posted to our website i ll now discuss the financial results we reported revenue of 267 million during the first quarter of 2022 which represents an increase of 16 compared to 230 1 million during the first quarter of 2021 10 stocks we like better than quanex building products when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and quanex building products wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 3 2022 the increase was largely attributable to volume increases in our fenestration segment combined with higher prices related to the pass through of raw material cost inflation more specifically we realized net sales growth of 14 5 in our north american fenestration segment 15 5 in our north american cabinet components segment and 18 6 in our european fenestration segment excluding the foreign exchange impact we reported net income of 11 2 million or 0 34 per diluted share for the three months ended january 31st 2022 compared to 7 9 million or 0 24 per diluted share during the three months ended january 31st 2021 on an adjusted basis net income increased by 25 9 to 11 3 million or 0 34 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2022 compared to 9 million or 0 27 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2021 the adjustments being made to eps are for restructuring charges loss on the sale of a plant foreign currency transaction impacts and transaction and advisory fees on an adjusted basis ebitda for the quarter was essentially flat year over year at 24 4 million compared to 24 3 million during the same period of last year the increase in earnings for the three months ended january 31st 2022 was attributable to continued strong demand operational efficiency gains and increased pricing however the decrease in margin percentage was driven by inflationary pressures and time lags on material index pricing mechanisms moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet cash used for operating activities was 21 7 million for the quarter compared to 3 4 million for the same period of last year due to the typical seasonality in our business free cash flow was negative in the first quarter of this year in addition the value of our inventory increased further due to inflationary pressures which had a negative impact on working capital as a reminder we usually generate most of our cash in the second half of each year our balance sheet continues to be strong our liquidity position is solid and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda was at 0 4 times as of january 31st 2022 we will remain focused on generating cash paying down debt and opportunistically repurchasing stock as the year progresses as stated in our earnings release demand remains healthy but the rate of inflation continues to pressure margins however based on improvements in labor performance the expected continuation of our pass through pricing strategy conversations with our customers and the latest macro data we re now comfortable providing the following guidance for fiscal 2022 net sales of 1 13 billion to 1 15 billion adjusted ebitda of 135 million to 140 million depreciation of approximately 31 million amortization of approximately 15 million sg a of 115 million to 120 million interest expense of 2 million to 2 5 million tax rate of 28 capex of 30 million to 35 million and free cash flow of 55 million to 60 million while we do expect some level of volume growth in our fenestration segments for the remainder of the year note that our current expectation is that revenue growth for the remainder of the year should be driven more by price as opposed to volume and we expect margin expansion to be second half weighted from a cadence perspective for q2 we expect net sales to be up mid to high single digits year over year in each segment however due to inflation and the time lag associated with passing on price increases for most of our raw materials we believe it will be a challenge to realize margin expansion in any segment in q2 looking ahead into the second half of the year on a consolidated basis we currently expect mid single digit net sales growth year over year in q3 and q4 in addition due to easier comps and the expected benefit from our pricing strategy coupled with some volume growth in our fenestration segments we expect to realize some margin expansion in q3 and q4 i ll now turn the call over to george for his prepared remarks george wilson president and chief executive officer thanks scott prior to my comments i would like to take a moment to acknowledge joe rupp for his long and dedicated service to quanex as a board member and as our lead independent director joe s guidance was key during our transition into a pure play building products company several years ago and more recently his mentorship and support proved invaluable as i transitioned into the ceo role i would like to thank joe for all he has done and i wish him all the best i will now discuss results for the quarter and then conclude with a discussion on the macro environment and guidance demand was healthy across all product lines during the first quarter of 2022 volume growth in our fenestration segments and higher prices in all segments mostly related to the pass through of raw material cost inflation resulted in revenue growth of 16 year over year on a consolidated basis we estimate that revenue growth for the quarter was weighted approximately 10 due to an increase in volume and approximately 90 due to an increase in price the first quarter began with continued supply chain challenges and significant labor disruption caused by covid absenteeism driven by the omicron variant however these issues started to subside toward the end of the quarter the rate of raw material cost inflation remains a challenge as we typically see a 30 to 90 day time lag in passing these increases through to our customers looking at the individual segments i will start with the north american fenestration this segment generated revenue of 146 6 million in q1 which was 18 5 million or 14 5 higher than prior year q1 strong demand in our ig spacer and screen product lines volume growth in vinyl fencing components and price increases across all product lines were the main drivers of the growth we estimate that revenue growth in this segment was weighted approximately 45 due to an increase in volume and approximately 55 due to an increase in price adjusted ebitda of 16 3 million in this segment was essentially flat versus prior year q1 the improved pricing volume related efficiency gains and productivity related improvements were more than offset by inflationary pressures on raw materials which caused margin erosion of approximately 170 basis points for the quarter however our current expectation is for margin expansion in this segment later in the year assuming that the rate of inflation subsides our european fenestration segment generated revenue of 58 9 million in the first quarter which was 9 8 million or 20 higher than prior year excluding foreign exchange impact this would equate to an increase of 18 6 we estimate that revenue growth in this segment was weighted approximately 20 due to an increase in volume and approximately 80 due to an increase in price strong demand in both ig spacers and vinyl extrusions combined with material related price increases accounted for the strong performance year over year these favorable volume related impacts and pricing actions were more than offset by inflationary pressure on raw material costs and by inefficiencies caused by the covid related absenteeism early in the quarter as such adjusted ebitda came in at 10 4 million for the quarter which was 300 000 less than prior year and yielded margin compression of approximately 420 basis points similar to our expectations for other segments we do anticipate that margins will improve as the year progresses again assuming that the rate of inflation subsides our north american cabinet components segment reported net sales of 62 4 million in q1 which was 8 4 million or 15 5 higher than prior year volumes decreased in this segment year over year mainly as a result of customers decisions to reduce overtime hours worked in their plants increases in hardwood index pricing as well as discretionary pricing actions offset the volume and resulted in revenue growth year over year adjusted ebitda was 2 million for the quarter which was 1 2 million less than prior year and resulted in margin compression of approximately 280 basis points improvements in lumber yield and labor efficiency were more than offset by a significant increase in hardwood lumber costs during the quarter weather related challenges in the appalachian wood region as well as increases in maple demand were the main drivers of the increases in lumber costs as a reminder we have material index pricing mechanisms in place but they typically have a 90 day lag and we will require a period of flat or declining wood pricing before we re able to catch up on our margin performance in this segment as we look forward through the remainder of the year we feel good about the demand environment across all of our product lines in north america the housing market remains strong and our customers continue to have high levels of backlog which we anticipate will slowly dwindle throughout the year the rate of inflation and the potential for further interest rate hikes could impact demand at some point in the future but we do not expect this to occur in the near term due to the high backlog levels in continental europe and the u k the demand environment remains healthy although consumer confidence could ultimately be impacted if inflation continues to ramp and energy costs continue to increase from a quanex perspective we have seen enough improvements in our supply chain and stabilization in our labor force to say that the main challenge we now face is the rate of inflation and the ability to pass through price in an expedited manner as scott mentioned earlier we have enough data points and adequate visibility into our customers backlog to give us confidence in providing full year guidance again we expect to generate revenue of 1 13 billion to 1 15 billion and adjusted ebitda of 135 million to 140 million if we execute to plan and are able to post results within these ranges it will mark the third straight year of record performance for the quanex team moving on to a more recent tragic subject which is the russian invasion of ukraine it is difficult to see these events unfold in real time and watch what you believe to be unfathomable turn into reality we have employees and business partners with personal ties to ukraine and our hearts are with them their families and all the ukrainian people being affected by this pointless and horrific war at this point it is too early for anyone to accurately predict or estimate the impact that this war will have on the european or global economies or what supply chain disruptions or other impacts this may have on our industry we anticipate there will be challenges especially if the situation worsens substantially however at this point it is much too early to predict or forecast those impacts nonetheless our team has managed through covid and numerous global supply chain challenges over the past two years and we are very confident in our ability to navigate this event as well and with that operator we are now ready to take questions questions answers operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of daniel moore with cjs your line is open please go ahead daniel moore cjs securities analyst thank you thank you george and scott for all the color and taking questions and particularly around pricing quantity that s really helpful maybe talk obviously inflations the kind of the remaining challenge as you described just talk about looking across each of the segments the cadence of what you re seeing whether prices are flattening reaccelerating kind of in real time and just trying to get a sense for your confidence around the trajectory of margins recovering in the back half of the year and i ve got a quick follow up thanks george wilson president and chief executive officer it really varies dan by product line but in general if i look at each of our raw material segments the ones that continue to see the most levels of inflation are primarily tied to oil or chemical based raw materials so resins any of the components like carbon black some of our butyl rubbers that are very tied to oil still see some significant inflationary pressures at one point we started to see some leveling out in the metals but those have ticked up again and same thing with wood we started to see some leveling out of wood but we ve had a pretty tough winter in the appalachian region with snow and rain that makes it really hard to forest some of those and harvest some of those lumber yards so those are primarily the biggest issues right now daniel moore cjs securities analyst and when i kind of look at let s say the midpoint of your guidance range does that imply kind of pricing where we are today is it there will be room for some additional inflation just how do we think about that george wilson president and chief executive officer yes i mean as you can imagine that s very hard to forecast inflation and pricing however we had a pretty good handle on the pricing aspect which some of that s built into the model as well as some cushion on inflation inflationary costs going a little higher from where we are today daniel moore cjs securities analyst perfect really helpful scott i typed as fast as i could can you just repeat the sg a as well as if there s a capex guidance for the year scott zuehlke senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer sure capex 30 million to 35 million sg a 115 million to 120 million daniel moore cjs securities analyst perfect and one more and i ll jump back in the queue but obviously seasonally this is typically a little bit of a use of cash and yet the balance sheet remains extremely strong you it implies you ll generate 80 million plus potentially in the next three quarters just talk about capital allocation the when you might be willing to be a little bit more aggressive or sort of retrigger the buybacks given the authorization and what the m a pipeline looks like if anything thanks again george wilson president and chief executive officer so as we look forward and i think your cadence on the cash flow is correct i think we ll stay focused on payment repayment of debt we ve made it public that our target is to approach net debt free by the end of the year we have some pretty large capex projects that we re going to be focused on throughout those years so those two will remain the priority we ll opportunistically balance our cash flow incoming and where the stock price is and we ll be active as we told you the board authorized a 75 million repurchase plan so as our projects align we will repurchase stock and then finally the m a pipeline there are things that we ll continue to look at and be interested in i would say that the amount of deals crossing our desk seems to have slowed and i think that that s been reinforced by some of the feedback that we get from the banks that the deal pipeline in general slowed down a little but we re going to continue to remain diligent on our checklist of things that meet our requirements for an m a and if something is there we re in a great position to capitalize on it but at this point nothing imminent daniel moore cjs securities analyst all right very helpful i ll jump back with any follow ups thanks george wilson president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of steven ramsey with thompson research group your line is open please go ahead steven ramsey thompson research group analyst hey good morning maybe to start with the expectation that inflation subsides in the second half is that the main reason for margin expansion at that time or what other factors help is that pricing flowing through better volume output maybe just talk through the drivers and what ranks in order of magnitude to drive that margin scott zuehlke senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i think if you looked back at last year s second half we started to see inflation really kick up in the third and especially in the fourth quarter so from a comp perspective the comps get a little easier from a margin perspective in the second half so what should drive that margin expansion year over year obviously volume is going to help but i think more so is going to be pricing as we enter the second half and like i said there is a little bit of an assumption that inflation ticks up a little higher from where we are today but we do expect it to subside at least we re forecasting for that george wilson president and chief executive officer yeah it s more the rate of inflation and at some point even if inflation continues to tick up at least it gives us the ability to catch up so i think that s the major assumption we see in the second half at least at this point steven ramsey thompson research group analyst ok make sense and then is it kind of all segments with margin expansion in the second half or do certain segments expand more and others go flattish to down scott zuehlke senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer the expectation is definitely in north america for margin expansion in both of those segments i mean europe we re hopeful that will happen in 3q but probably more likely in 4q i mean margin profile in europe continues to be strong steven ramsey thompson research group analyst ok and then one more thinking about inflation with the sg a guidance the low end of that sg a range flattish year over year kind of surprised given inflation in the u s normalizing of t e maybe you can talk to how you re thinking about sg a and budgeting for that george wilson president and chief executive officer i think we ve done a good job of continuing to find ways to optimize our whole sg a structure so we have internal projects where we ve been able to reduce sg a in some areas the stock based comp has obviously had a big benefit to that as well as we ve aggressively managed our medical cost and it s i think performed relatively well and although we see inflation it s i think we ve done better than the market in managing our medical costs so those are the three big areas that i think has allowed us to remain flat in sg a even with the inflationary pressures that we see steven ramsey thompson research group analyst great and then last quick one for me if i think about the high end of the guidance range on sales and ebitda it implies lower incremental margin on the high side of both numbers than it does on the low end curious if there are certain drivers to drive that result or if it s just a math problem scott zuehlke senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i wouldn t there s nothing really to point to to explain either one i think it s more of the math and the ranges there i will say that sitting here today we re probably more comfortable with the higher end of the revenue guidance range than we are on the ebitda range just because of the inflationary environment we re in steven ramsey thompson research group analyst makes sense thank you scott zuehlke senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of julio romero with sidoti company your line is open please go ahead julio romero sidoti and company analyst hey good morning george and scott george wilson president and chief executive officer good morning julio romero sidoti and company analyst so really appreciate you guys providing guidance you listed a couple of contributing factors to that decision the improvements in labor performance continued pricing and speaking to customers etc is it fair to say the biggest kind of swing factor is labor improvement i know you were having some issues last quarter in terms of short term delivery schedules and truckers kind of showing off for the day are you seeing better visibility on that and if so could you expand on that george wilson president and chief executive officer i think the improvement in labor comes from a couple of areas one is the supply chain started to stabilize that obviously helps the scheduling of our plants and the ability to schedule production in the most efficient manner so that had a big impact i think our human resource teams across the company have done a very good job of filling in in filling the open positions across all the plants we made some labor adjustments in terms of our wage rates throughout last year and so as you bring new people on and get them acclimated to our processes the learning curve around that has improved versus prior year and that s been a big deal and then just finding continued different ways to operate in this environment we re getting better at it in our north american cabinet components segment where we talked about our customers reducing labor hours that s mainly attributable to them losing labor so the reduction of overtime and scaling back to a five day or a 40 hour and 48 hour workweek has been a big help in that area as well especially for that segment julio romero sidoti and company analyst so the labor improvement sounds a little more broad based than just kind of drivers george wilson president and chief executive officer yes julio romero sidoti and company analyst are you seeing better retention rates george wilson president and chief executive officer i would say in general yes i mean it s that tends to be more plant specific but i think as we try to do different things internally we have some very active retention projects in place across the company it has begun to improve so we re pretty happy with the internal actions that we have going on right now focusing on training and those types of projects on a go forward basis we ll continue to help that as we look ahead julio romero sidoti and company analyst ok understood and then just last one for me and i appreciate the commentary on russia ukraine and very early to kind of understand all the impacts there but if i could try to zero in on just any aluminum impact since that kind of just sticks out to me as a potential impact from my seat how are you thinking about any potential availability constraints in terms of aluminum in europe george wilson president and chief executive officer yeah so i think as i look at it as it relates to quanex the main areas that i m going to be focused on as it relates to our impact was first and foremost will be the european economy what will it do to the window in demand what will it do demand to demand in general and what will it do to some of the components that go into a window for example glass to make glass it takes a lot of energy a lot of that energy in europe is provided by russia as we know so a rapid inflation of heating and energy costs will drive and could drive the cost of glass and the components up to pretty significant levels that may impact obviously the price of a window and negatively impact demand so keep i keep an eye on that in terms of our components aluminum pricing which we re already starting to see on the rise and i m not as worried about supply but people are trying to capitalize on this to drive price up we ll obviously be able to recover it but then it goes into the time lags and then the other areas tend to be things like carbon black and butyl rubbers which do have a lot of components that have micro ingredients that come from russia so those are the areas that i m going to stay focused on as it relates to quanex julio romero sidoti and company analyst really helpful definitely appreciate the detail you provided there thanks very much george wilson president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ken zener with keybanc your line is open please go ahead ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning gentlemen george wilson president and chief executive officer good morning ken ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst so i wonder if you can comment on not just your right supply cost challenges but also as a supplier in the window business you kind of are right northern europe much spacers u k actual the windows versus the u s can you just talk about how demand trends might be a little different in covid using the u k and the u s as counterpoints just not an extended answer but just how different those markets have been in terms of demand george wilson president and chief executive officer when i look at them demand has been extremely strong in both of those markets because a lot of the fundamental economic indicators are the same i mean both companies have tight housing markets the discretionary spending has been high in both markets so we ve seen strong demand in both areas i think where i contrast on a go forward basis in the u k and europe i think discretionary impact will be impacted more by increases in energy costs even more so than what we complain about here in the u s about fuel and heating fuel and energy costs going up it s significantly higher in europe so i think it will have an the potential to impact the u k and europe much faster than we ll see here in the u s ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst and then george scott i m not sure which one have you made the comment or which region but i believe you said something about customers or somebody not doing it over time as much could you talk about that in the u s what that means in terms of the backlogs that you are seeing in terms of backlogs going down i know there s been some public companies they have talked about four months backlog falling down to half that or more can you just talk about your customers ability to handle or work through backlog george wilson president and chief executive officer yes so i made that comment as it related to the cabinet components segment in those markets the labor piece of it especially in 2021 when it was so difficult you had wages going up and so many job openings across the entire country people when you have companies that are working 50 to 60 and sometimes more than nine hours a week you will lose significant loss of employees you cannot continue to work at that level someone will go across the street make the same amount of money and so they realized in that segment our customers there that they re working too many hours so they physically made the decision we re going to back off and let the backlogs grow and that s what we saw during the course of last year and it s remained now they ve also as they start to retain their employees because of the reduction in working hours we re seeing better performance because they re able to retain their labor so i don t think we ll see the continued growth in that backlog but that s what happened ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst and then in windows since you called out cabinets could you talk to the cadence perhaps of your customers there and i think last i mean you talked one of the things people focus on is does do when these price increases create demand destruction which you mentioned and i don t know if you just were being very holistic in your comments but if you could george wilson president and chief executive officer yep ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst are we seeing that labor issue in the window category at all and then since the brought up pricing just some comments there thank you very much george wilson president and chief executive officer yes so the two pieces i ll start with the your second question first i was being a little holistic in terms of my discussion on the impact of the of the impact that additional costs will have on our demand we have not seen that yet could it be a possibility sure but we haven t seen it at this point and that was more related to europe than it is to u s now in terms of the backlogs with my window customers they seem to be handling that more i don t think the backlogs have been growing and we anticipate that their continued improvement in operations will continue to drive that down not to the level where it will disappear so that s what gives us so much confidence as we look at our demand going forward because of such backlogs they ve done a very good job of being able to control their labor and fulfill demand as much as possible so ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst thank you appreciate it operator thank you and our next question is a follow up question from the line of daniel moore with cjs your line is open please go ahead daniel moore cjs securities analyst sorry i just got to get off mute thank you again this has been an obviously multiple years of an unprecedented operating environment with everything that s gone on if we ever get back to normalization one thing we haven t talked about as much in recent calls is what kind of opportunity is left to drive margins higher longer term and i realize europe is at pretty significant margins right now but specifically in north america fenestration and or the cabinets be it with automation or other internal initiatives thanks george wilson president and chief executive officer so we ve touched on this in the past and i don t think it s changed much i think going forward in a more normalized environment and it s anybody s guess what normal means going forward but i think you re right in europe the margin profile is strong and it s really more about protecting margins there than growing margins there we ve done a lot of work in north america i still think and we still think that the biggest opportunity for margin expansion is in the cabinet components business we ve gone through quite a long period here of chasing price and the 90 day lag hurting us and it s really masked all the things we ve done on the shop floor to improve efficiencies and things of that nature and i think once pricing does stabilize and come down on the woodside you re going to see that margin expansion at some point i just don t know when that s going to be and then in the north america fenestration segment we still think there s some meat left on that bone too and it s probably more related to our screens business and the vinyl business and not so much the vinyl windows business as you know we ve been ramping up production and manufacturing of the vinyl fencing business and i think going forward that should start to move the needle at some point daniel moore cjs securities analyst very helpful thank you again george wilson president and chief executive officer all right operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time and i would like to hand the conference back over to george wilson for any further remarks george wilson president and chief executive officer we appreciate everyone s time today thanks for joining and we look forward to providing an update on our next earnings call in june operator duration 37 minutes call participants

here s why our roundtable loves legend biotech heron therapeutics and pieris pharmaceuticals so far 2022 has been an ugly year for a lot of stocks but if you look out over the next five years you can find some amazing opportunities our roundtable of three motley fool contributors has found three biotech stocks that might be 11 baggers in five years patrick bafuma is bullish on legend biotech legn 2 29 and thinks it might be worth 55 billion by 2027 george budwell believes his pick heron therapeutics hrtx 1 38 could jump 1 000 in that time frame and taylor carmichael feels tiny pieris pharmaceuticals pirs 0 99 could leap from micro cap to small cap and pull off an 11 bagger in five years here s why we think these biotechs could seriously outperform the market a multibillion dollar opportunity check patrick bafuma legend biotech lost amid the recent market doldrums has been some incredible news a promising new one time car t therapy called carvykti has been recently approved for multiple myeloma in the u s with a 50 50 partnership with johnson johnson outside china and a 70 30 partnership in its favor in greater china legend biotech has a deep pocketed friend watching over sales of carvytki and at a 5 3 billion market cap legend seems like a bargain the j j partner s one time treatment for multiple myeloma produced a 98 overall response rate with a 78 stringent complete response meaning that just under four out of five patients had no detectable cancer in either their blood or bone marrow at 18 months after a carvytki infusion not to mention that all patients had received at least three prior lines of therapy with 66 of patients receiving five or more prior lines of treatment these results were in a difficult to treat population who had already received a median of six prior lines of therapy with data seemingly better than its competition johnson johnson has high hopes for the treatment estimating peak sales of over 5 billion while carvykti alone might not push legend into 11 bagger territory the company has a few other car t therapies in the pipeline the cutting edge biotech has four different treatments across an array of cancers that it is developing and the company has proved it can move briskly through trials the first data was revealed for its recently approved multiple myeloma therapy just five years ago at the 2017 american society for clinical oncology conference by bringing a highly effective treatment to market with a deep pocketed partner in combination with a budding pipeline legend has 11 bagger potential nowhere to go but up george budwell heron therapeutics heron therapeutics has been one of my worst stock picks ever over the past seven years i ve consistently picked this company as a top growth play due to the commercial potential of its non opioid pain medication zynrelef during this period however the food and drug administration fda has rejected the drug not once but twice and when the agency finally did approve it last year zynrelef s initial label was so restrictive that it generated less than 1 million in net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of this series of unfortunate events heron s stock has lost approximately 85 of its value since i first called it a buy back in late 2015 all that being said i still think heron s stock is a table pounding buy especially at these depressed levels the key reason i m convinced that it is finally ready to shine is zynrelef s recent label expansion this all important decision will reportedly increase the drug s target market by 7 million patients per year according to a recent investor presentation what s more heron is also working toward a second major label expansion that could turn this acute pain drug into a blockbuster product before the end of the decade the company expects to have this second label expansion application for orthopedic and soft tissue surgical procedures in front of the fda later this year what s the big picture wall street thinks zynrelef ought to generate sales in excess of 500 million by 2025 and given the well documented need for nonaddictive pain medications in the acute care setting this revenue forecast is probably on the conservative side so while heron s value proposition has taken far longer to come to fruition than most expected the company does appear to be close to an inflection point as such i m not willing to throw in the towel on this stock just yet in fact i think heron s shares will deliver 11x returns for shareholders within the next five years pieris owns the rights to a new class of molecules taylor carmichael pieris pharmaceuticals pieris pharmaceuticals is a tiny micro cap right now with a 220 million valuation it s an early stage biotech that s flying under the radar normally i m not interested in drug companies that are so far away from any fda approvals but this is a special situation pieris owns the rights to a new class of molecules called anticalins these are artificial proteins that are eight times smaller than monoclonal antibodies mabs that small size might make a huge difference in patient outcomes for instance in respiratory diseases like asthma anticalins can go directly to the lungs something antibodies cannot do you can t inhale a monoclonal antibody but you can inhale an anticalin that s why astrazeneca azn 0 29 has partnered with pieris five years ago astrazeneca paid 57 million and agreed to a possible 2 1 billion in milestone payments if the anticalin drugs make it through clinical trials the lead drug candidate prs 060 is a treatment for moderate to severe asthma that s a potentially large market opportunity with almost 30 million patients in the u s and europe astrazeneca is running the phase 2 trial and we re expecting a topline readout later this year if it s a positive readout that will be a validation for pieris whole platform other collaborators include roche in respiratory and ophthalmology cases and seagen in cancer pieris stands to earn up to 8 billion in milestone payments if these various programs are successful and that doesn t include royalties from sales while pieris is a micro cap now any success at all will catapult this company much higher an 11 bagger would take pieris into the small cap range so the upside is pretty significant 2022 promises to be a pivotal year for the company as it will have phase 2 readouts from its asthma drug with astrazeneca as well as efficacy data for a gastric cancer drug pieris is keeping in house

mitchell as city leaders push to bring more affordable housing to mitchell an aberdeen organization that has assisted hundreds of people become homeowners is stepping in to help through its programs that provide funding assistance for aspiring and existing homeowners the nonprofit organization known as homes are possible inc hapi has helped bring over 260 affordable homes to the aberdeen community and developed more than 250 acres of land since its inception in 2000 leaders of the mitchell area development corporation are striving to provide that type of impact in mitchell through its newly formed partnership with hapi this will have a big impact on mitchell s housing and we are excited to hit the ground running and address the lack of affordable homes in mitchell said geri beck ceo of the mitchell area development corporation madc leaders of the organization met wednesday with a group of mitchell realtors and city leaders to break down the programs that are now available for aspiring home buyers in the mitchell area hapi executive director darin beckius touted the success of the closing cost assistance and home repair funding programs that hapi offers for individuals or families who are at or below a county s median household income advertisement for example a two person home with an income level of at least 46 200 would qualify for hapi s programs which is calculated by using davison county s area median income level ami for davison county a home s median income level is 72 100 the organization s closing cost assistance program offers up to 5 000 for qualified home buyers in the form of a non interest bearing loan to help the type of homebuyers who qualify and may not have the cash to pay for the closing costs beckius said the closing cost assistance program offers a silent second mortgage silent second mortgages are typically used to supplement a traditional mortgage when a homebuyer cannot afford the full payment on a primary mortgage but what makes hapi s silent second mortgage unique is it s zero interest what it does is it takes away the fixed rate plus program loan so the lender and the buyer are still able to qualify at the 3 rate instead of having to go to the 4 beckius said that s a huge deal while the silent second mortgage is not forgivable beckius said the respective mortgage can be paid back to the organization after the homeowner sells cashes out or refinances their respective house beckius noted local lenders are much better to work with for the closing cost assistance program because some national lenders don t accept it due to not fully understanding the program he said for both the down payment and home repair funding program beckius said each qualified applicant is required to take homebuyer education classes led by hapi hapi s ability to provide the home repair funding and closing cost assistance programs is made possible through a couple funding sources with one being the south dakota housing authority advertisement the organization was recently awarded 500 000 for its housing assistance efforts which beckius said has to be spent within a year i m asking for your help to help us spend that money it s one of those things that if you don t spend you lose it beckius said hapi s home repair funding with the large amount of aging homes in mitchell hapi s repair funding program that can provide between 5 000 and 20 000 for homeowners seeking to repair their houses caught the attention of the local realtors in the room during wednesday s meeting craig tischler a real estate agent with mitchell s exit realty said coming up with enough funds and getting financing for the enormous amount of houses in mitchell that were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s and are in serious need of repair is a major challenge there are homes that like you said you re not able to put enough lipstick on or are very hard to get financing because of it we either need to replace those or fix them tischler said for the home repair funding program hapi can provide a homeowner with between 5 000 and 20 000 to fix their house beckius said the type of repair work that can be done with the help of the home repair funding program is vast that money can be used for basically any work that needs to get done in the house whether that s repairs like windows siding or if there is a mobility issue that may come up and need a ramp beckius said it is forgivable after five years every year there is a 20 reduction approximately hapi funds the repair work that s done by the contractor up front through a grant which is then paid back to the organization by the homeowner through a forgivable grant beckius noted the homeowner is responsible for choosing the contractor to make the repairs advertisement the contractor then does the work and hapi pays the funds directly to the contractor we ask the homeowners to get two bids before choosing contractors beckius said jeff mitchell former executive director of hapi joined the group of local realtors during wednesday s meeting and emphasized the home repair funding program is not intended to flip houses rather he said it s meant to repair homes and allow the existing homeowners to continue residing in them what we really want to try and do is take housing stock that is maybe getting close to that point of no return and keep it still usable and viable mitchell said occasionally we will have some we come across that is too late and you can t put enough lipstick on to make it viable kickstarting ridge view on foster housing development after developing over a dozen subdivisions in the past two decades hapi s model of building out housing developments has helped the mitchell area development corporation drum up new ways to approach the proposed ridge view on foster affordable housing development next to firesteel heights while there was plenty of excitement among city leaders when the madc announced its plan to use 21 acres of land donated by avera queen of peace to build as many as 90 homes the plan was shelved after it was approved in 2020 due to what then project leaders said was uncertainty amid the covid 19 pandemic since then leadership in the key organizations involved has changed hands and building costs have made large scale developments much more difficult but terry sabers chairman of madc s housing committee said wednesday the ridge view on foster development that s aiming to bring around 90 homes to the piece of land near firesteel heights is still on the table to address the shortage of affordable homes in mitchell the madc created a new organization called mitchell area housing inc with the creation of the housing organization sabers said it could help kickstart the ridge view on foster development i think everyone remembers the development on the land that avera donated and that is one of the projects that we re going to be working on to facilitate sabers said there are a number of different infrastructure funding avenues that are being looked at right now at the federal and state level advertisement while project leaders coordinate plans to get madc s housing

declines in the stock market couldn t stop these winners the stock market continued to post declines on friday as short term traders seemed unwilling to go into the weekend without protection against the extremely volatile geopolitical and macroeconomic climate right now losses for the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 and s p 500 gspc 1 20 weren t all that big but the nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 suffered bigger declines index daily percentage change daily point change dow 0 53 180 s p 500 0 79 35 nasdaq 1 66 225 some stocks managed to move sharply higher despite the pressure on the market overall among top performers in the large cap stock space were occidental petroleum oxy 0 97 and kroger kr 0 29 and below we ll look more closely at the factors that helped move those shares upward on friday occidental benefits from higher oil prices shares of occidental petroleum rocketed higher on friday finishing the day up nearly 18 from where it closed thursday the move sent the oil stock back to levels it hadn t seen in nearly three years the obvious catalyst for the upward move in occidental s stock was a renewed push higher in crude oil prices west texas intermediate crude oil closed at 115 per barrel hitting levels not seen in the u s market since 2008 some analysts expect that oil prices could continue to move upward toward 150 in the short run especially if the war between ukraine and russia escalates and leads to measures that could prevent or limit the release of russian produced oil and energy products on global markets yet occidental also seemed to be the focus of some short term trading groups that singled out the oil exploration and production company occidental s peers were also higher but gains of 8 for chesapeake energy chk 1 16 and oasis petroleum oas and 6 for drilling services specialist baker hughes bkr 1 81 showed that occidental seemed to be getting special attention from shareholders investors are excited that high oil prices might help more leveraged companies like occidental reduce their debt and get in healthier financial condition it s unclear how long crude might remain at elevated levels but for now shareholders are optimistic about the positive effect of tight energy markets on the company s prospects kroger keeps looking tastier meanwhile shares of kroger added to recent gains the stock s rise of 7 on friday followed a 12 gain on thursday thursday s gains stemmed largely from the grocery store chain s most recent quarterly financial report kroger s revenue was up 7 5 on a 4 rise in comparable sales and adjusted earnings rose 12 year over year even after a strong performance in the previous year s period as well on friday stock analysts added to kroger s upward momentum at least three wall street analyst companies boosted their price targets on kroger s stock with bmo capital s 16 boost to 57 per share being the biggest upgrade to be clear kroger still faces some major challenges wage pressures are hitting the grocery store operator especially hard and continued tightness in labor markets means that kroger will likely struggle to get the workers it needs at least in the short run however as investors look increasingly defensive in their stance with their portfolios kroger s reliable business in providing necessities to consumers should hold up better than providers of more discretionary items

team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and etsy wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 20 2022 this video was recorded on feb 25 2022 chris hill the urge to time the market is a strong one it s also the wrong one which is why we never time the market motley fool money starts now it s the motley fool money radio show i m chris hill and i m joined by motley fool senior analyst jason moser and ron gross good to see you as always gentlemen ron gross how are you doing chris jason moser hey chris hill we ve got the latest headlines from wall street we ll talk with trade desk ceo jeff green and as always we ve got a couple of stocks on our radar but we begin with what was looking like another rough week for investors before a surprising turnaround on thursday we re recording this while there are still a few hours left in the trading day on friday but as of right now both the s p 500 and the nasdaq are positive for the week ron when you consider everything in the market russia s invasion of ukraine this is one more reminder of why we never try to time the market ron gross that s exactly right chris believe me i wish i could time the market that would be awesome i m not against having superpowers that would be really cool but i don t see how it s possible and i think history shows us that it s not possible you mentioned the ukraine conflict did anyone out there really predict that the nasdaq would be up 3 on thursday the day the war began the largest conventional military conflict since world war ii i did not expect the market to be up let alone up 3 now there is plenty of theories why it was up we had some solid economic data we believed that maybe the fed would trend a little bit more lightly reports that russia may come to the negotiating table my colleague john rotonti pointed out that maybe buy algorithms kicked in when the nasdaq hit the 20 decline level who really knows on the other side of the coin who expected the covid correction to rebound so quickly how many people sold out of the market in early 2020 and didn t get back in time for this incredible rebound that happened when vaccines came into play my point is who really knows history has proven we do not need to know buy great companies stay in the market don t trade don t have money at risk you need over the next three years that way you can just sit tight you can watch it all unfold in front of you without any major financial impact to your life chris hill yeah jason you and i spend a decent amount of time on twitter and it seemed like particularly on thursday so many people were scrambling to come up with how and why this was happening and fortunately there were a few people to ron s point making the point on twitter like hey look nobody knows why this is happening again this is why we don t time the market jason moser yeah i feel like every time we run into these stretches my mind immediately just goes back to this is why we invest the way that we do i know that sounds like a broken record but it s important it matters we need to keep reiterating it there are plenty of studies out there that show over the course of decades if you exclude the 10 best and the 10 worst days of the market in any given decade that alone can have a profound impact on your returns but then think about that from the perspective of how likely are you to be able to predict any of those days 10 days within a decade think about that for a second you re not going to be able to do it it really does just all go back to what ron said find great businesses invest in them and you can afford to be patient in times like these understanding that over time those good businesses will continue to perform market dynamics will change as situations change chris hill let s go to some companies then and we re going to start with etsy fourth quarter profits were much higher than expected and the company is raising its seller transaction fee from 5 to 6 5 a 1 5 increase may not sound like much jason but shareholders appear to love this decision jason moser indeed it was a strong holiday quarter for etsy this was really what the doctor ordered for this company gross merchandise sales for the quarter 4 2 billion it was up 16 5 from a year ago that resulted in revenue of 717 million that was up 16 2 and so that gives them a take rate there of 17 1 which is really what helps guide this business forward they continue to grow that gross merchandise sales number and that revenue just continues to follow along because they provide such a valuable service for so many of their merchant customers for the year they pushed through 13 5 billion in gross merchandise sales most of that was etsy but i was really pleasantly surprised to see that reverb that acquisition of the music space they made a little while back that was responsible for 950 million so very impressive they continue to grow the seller base and the buyer base they have now have 7 5 million active sellers 96 3 million active buyers a lot of those buyers are repeat buyers this is a mobile company 65 mobile gross merchandise sales for the quarter as you mentioned raising that seller transaction fee just a little bit 5 6 5 but that is going to give them additional capital to reinvest back into their network and continue building out the services and tools that their merchant customers value so much chris hill transaction revenue for block rose in the fourth quarter the company formerly known as square also highlighted the growth of its cash app as a driver behind strong guidance for the year ahead and shares of block up more than 20 on friday ron ron gross strong results strong rebound stock is still off 60 from its 52 week highs so we ve got some work to do to get back to those levels but i think they are on the right track with some good numbers here total revenue up 29 that s pretty strong revenue from bitcoin purchases in the fourth quarter were almost 2 billion that s almost half of block s total quarterly sales but those transactions don t really contribute much to profit 46 million is in gross profit for the bitcoin part of that business so not really a contributor here if you exclude bitcoin total revenue revenue was actually up 51 for the year so again a very strong quarter they processed 46 billion in gross payment volume that was up 45 gross profits were up 47 if you look at the different parts of the business as you said cash app growing nicely the gross profit of that business up 37 with the overall square ecosystem business their gross profit up 54 things look like they re really on track the cash app had 44 million active monthly users at the end of december that was up from 40 million adjusted ebitda of 184 million was better than expected you may recall they made their acquisition of the buy now pay later platform afterpay interestingly that acquisition was originally valued at 29 billion but with the drop in block s share price there was a stock deal it closed at actually 15 billion versus the 29 billion originally cited that s just an interesting note better than expected guidance cash app looks strong they expect gross profit growth each quarter for both cash app and the seller business so that s pretty strong stock s at 60 times still 60 times for a business though that will put up strong growth numbers into the future that s still a little pricy for me i m a shareholder it s a little pricy but we re going to see them grow into that valuation i think chris hill big week for the home improvement industry as both home depot and lowe s issued their fourth quarter reports both companies saw profits and revenue came in higher than expected but the reaction was much worse for home depot which had its worst post earnings stock drop in 20 years jason i m not sure where the pessimism is coming from but it should not overshadow the fact that lowe s just continues to thrive under the leadership of ceo marvin ellison jason moser indeed this is a great time to be a company named lowe s or home depot i wouldn t read too much into that market reaction there regarding home depot because that was a strong quarter as well but we ve got a tight housing market and we ve got an aging housing market they continue to reiterate that statistic there that 50 of our homes in the u s are over 40 years old and that just means that they re going to require repair and maintenance for a lot of years going forward and that is really both of these companies bread and butter so to speak when you look at the actual numbers lowe s just tremendous total sales for the quarter 21 3 billion that grew modestly from a year ago but they grew earnings per share 34 you look at the comparable average ticket that grew 9 4 while the actual transaction count fell 4 4 they actually saw a little gross margin expansion there encouragingly enough and particularly in inflationary times that can be a little bit difficult to achieve but it just goes to show the pricing power that they have in the value proposition that they bring to the table i think home depot much of the same really sales grew 10 7 for the core of 35 7 billion if you look at the actual tickets versus transactions their comp average ticket grew 12 3 while comp transactions fell 3 8 it s a very similar dynamic to lowe s they grew earnings per share 21 actually home depot interestingly enough saw a little gross margin compression not much just a modicum but something just to keep an eye on there as we move into 2022 chris hill more after the break so stay right here you re listening to motley fool money welcome back to motley fool money chris hill here with jason moser and ron gross beyond meat s loss in the fourth quarter was bigger than expected and revenue was lower than expected in response ceo ethan brown said he expects beyond meat to substantially moderate the growth of operating expenses ron i m a little surprised by this in part because of all of the optimism we ve seen recently around their partnership with mcdonald s ron gross yeah although i hate the name mcplant i must be honest with you but yes there s some excitement surrounding mcplant going into 600 u s locations there s actually some excitement around their joint venture with kentucky fried chicken for the beyond fried chicken nuggets which sounds to me personally better than the mcplant but they re moving in the right direction with respect to these trials but they don t necessarily mean they will translate into growing revenues and profits in the future we re still in the very early stages of some of these things stocks off 74 from its 52 week high a lot of excitement in the early days have clearly come off for the quarter not so great nothing to really get so excited about fourth quarter sales down 1 u s food service international channel net revenues were offset by reduced u s retail revenue which fell almost 20 it s a pretty big number that reflects softer demand five fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter increased trade discounts and as i said to a lesser extent loss of market share which if you re a beyond meat shareholder i think that comment should be troubling to you and we got to keep an eye on what that actually means gross margins got slammed they re down to 14 from 28 that s due to product mix revenue per pound decreases trade discounts again the company had increased manufacturing costs they had to write off some revenue they ended up losing about 80 million for the quarter some things they ve got to work through here management noted a temporary disruption in u s retail growth for its brand and the broader category something again to watch out for and continue to watch out for these somewhat interesting and exciting joint ventures chris hill i m not saying this to make you feel better you re not the only one who has a problem with the name mcplant ron gross good to hear chris hill mercadolibre lost 46 million in the fourth quarter but investors seemed more focused on the fact that revenue for the latin american e commerce company grew more than 60 year over year shares of mercadolibre up 15 this week jason jason moser yeah they can run into some currency exchange issues there given their latin american roots that s always worth remembering when you consider the bottom line with the business like this but this is one that really does require that amazon type mindset for investors thinking probably a bit more long term than you might with other companies but if you could do that i think this is still a very compelling story latin america remains one of the fastest growing e commerce markets in the world then so the numbers again like you said that sales growth net revenues for the fourth quarter they were 2 1 billion which was up 74 on a currency neutral basis gross merchandise volume grew to 8 billion that was up 32 2 currency neutral again a company that s really executing on the mobile front mobile gross merchandise volume was 75 5 of total gross merchandise volume really making a lot of progress on the mobile front you can t really talk about mercadolibre without talking about mercado pago their payments solution the total payment volume through mercado pago hit 24 2 billion that was up 72 8 currency neutral and a lot of that growth really it s amazing the off platform growth here that was up 96 5 16 1 billion for the quarter payment transactions up 69 4 a business that really continues to execute do what they say they re going to do stock has gotten hammered here recently and it does look like it could be an opportunity for folks willing to stay patient chris hill fulgent genetics posted better than expected results for the fourth quarter while shares fell in after hours trading the stock bounced back up on thursday along with pretty much everything else in the market ron forget about the stock what do you see when you look at fulgent s business ron gross some context here will probably tell listeners everything they need to know fulgent is a genetic testing company whose business got a huge boost from covid post covid things are starting to settle back down to earth and will likely see a reversal to pre covid levels of business that s very important to understand the stock s off 50 from its 52 week high but because of this huge boost it s actually up 300 still over the last two years depending on your term as a shareholder you re either happier or a little troubled here the changing of the business shows up in the numbers total revenue down 15 their core testing revenue grew to over 200 but that only represents 15 of revenue which is 40 million for the quarter that s the part of the business that will remain once covid subsides and starts to go away even more that s what we ll be left with that base of business billable tests were up 13 from the third quarter but down 22 year over year again you re seeing some of those trends they are still profitable but a lot of those profits again are due to this covid boost that they re seeing they expect their core business to grow by 20 that ll equate to about 120 million in revenue but that s against 600 million of total revenue that they actually have again because of covid when we look at the stock when we look at valuations we have to i think remove covid from the business and see yes it s trading only at around 8 5 times but those earnings are not sustainable in reality it s trading at a much higher valuation than that chris hill booking holdings ramped up its fiscal year with improving profits in revenue despite increasing signs of optimism around covid restrictions being lifted the parent company of priceline warned of negative impacts on travel demand jason do you think they are just being appropriately conservative in their guidance jason moser i think probably so i think this was a good quarter i d say management the tone seems cautiously optimistic about the state of the industry it does feel we re setting ourselves up for a pretty strong 2022 year in the travel industry but it s still early of course the quarter itself though strong performance gross bookings their 19 billion was up 160 from a year ago room nights booked for the fourth quarter grew 100 from a year ago and they had strengthened airline tickets booked that was up 116 from a year ago as well they re making a lot of investments in that flight part of the business you hear them talk a lot about this connected trip mentality this connected trip strategy that the business is focused on they made an acquisition recently or are acquiring e traveling for their flight booking tech you also hear them talking more and more about the payment solution that they continue to build out on their platform as well taking advantage of that payment solution taking advantage of their mobile presence there and now about 30 of gross bookings were processed through their payments platform in the fourth quarter and that was up considerably from just 2019 where it was about 15 they re making progress there they continue to buy back shares the share count is down to 17 over the last five years it feels if you are looking for travel exposure this is one of those companies that you want to have the top of list chris hill we ll see a little bit later in the show but up next the conversation with the trade desk ceo jeff green stay right here this is motley fool money welcome back to motley fool money i m chris hill one of the highlights of our recent investing event for motley fool members was a conversation with jeff green ceo of the trade desk our chief investment officer andy cross talked with him and started with a question that green is frequently asked about the business he runs andy cross first i want to kick it off with a question that came right from a motley fool member we have a lot of members watching here and some who may not be that familiar with the trade desk and some who may know it very well i want to give you the opportunity to explain the trade desk to a nine year old as if you were talking to a nine year old how would you break down the trade desk jeff green yes let me probably start by just saying historically not done this very well i know a bunch of family members have asked me this question which is something like what exactly do you do as i ve heard them repeat the answer later i ve learned that i m not very good at this nevertheless but here it is if you want to buy ads on facebook and instagram you go to facebook if you want to buy ads on google and youtube you go to google but if you want to buy ads on pretty much everything else on the internet you come to the trade desk where we especially have focused in recent years is on what we call cross to buys that all starts with television the ads that you see on paramount or on peacock or on any of the ads that you see on any of your favorite ctv apps hulu are likely coming from the trade desk but also on your phone on your computer all the various apps all the various websites that you go to there s a lot of science that goes into figuring out which ad should i put in front of which user and what does that ad worth how much is it worth to be on the bottom of the page hoping someone scrolls versus the top of the page figuring out what that is for an advertiser is really hard we ve focused on helping the advertiser makes sense of the really complicated ads on the internet andy cross let s talk a little bit about that jeff when you talk about the various players in the internet facebook twitter you mentioned a lot of the larger players you certainly are large one when it comes to serving ads on behalf of your clients who are really agencies and gosh fortune 500 companies brand lots of good consumer brand companies that many of us are using now you re representing them to match them up in a programmatic way i want you to just to break that down to explain what that means versus maybe the way it was 20 years ago when the internet was really just starting with an advertising model jeff green if you go back even further pre internet you buy an ad that is a billboard or in the middle of the paper you look at the numbers in terms of what does the circulation of the paper and then you just assume a certain number of them look at the ad it s not very data driven it s about what is the audience and what are our best guesses about how this will work out but now there s no barrier to creating new ads you can almost create infinite supply now it s about figuring out what s really going to be impactful it s really coming down the the math it used to be about hunches don drapers of the world controlling advertising now as people that are more equities traders and portfolio managers then it is the don drapers of the world what they are doing is just to boil down the math they re basically 13 million ad opportunities available every single second think of that as an auction we re going to run an auction that will last one tenth of one second and there s 13 million of those every second if you pick any brand we represent the majority of the s p 500 if you pick any brand whether it s home depot or nike or coca cola and say of those 13 million they need to buy or just pick a number or something like 2 157 which 2 157 opportunities are going to have the most impact for them per dollar because it will cost more to be at the top of the page than the bottom of the page will say i got into account the cost will be in front of this user than a different user we ll take that into account and we re trying to gain market share in specific geographies let s take that into account let s bring data and data science into the equation so that marketers can be very intelligent about the way that they spend their money because if they just buy random or just hope to get good stuff they re going to lose every single time it has to be data science driven going forward andy cross yeah that also i know 50 of my advertising budget there s money i just don t know which 50 or whatever the old line about advertising spending is you re trying to help the agencies and the consumer brands really from the buy side that s different then you don t represent i want to be clear about this you re not a publisher you don t represent the washington post or the motley fool for example on our ads you really work with the clients who are out there purchasing on advertising space that is going to be shown on these various platforms be it online web mobile then you mentioned ctv as connected tv i know that s a big initiative to you and ben and i want to get more into that but you really represent them and you ve built a business that way specifically to give you the independence to represent the brands without having any of the conflicts with the inventory or managing that inventory i just wanted you to clarify if i m getting that wrong but i want to make sure that s very clear with our people watching jeff green i appreciate you making that clear and i don t have to clarify anything but i will underline what you just said i was recently in market for a house the realtor that was representing me as the buyer was also representing the seller when we went into negotiations i m like who do you represent me or them the truth of the matter is they don t represent either of us they depend when the transaction happens they weren t telling me the things that were wrong with the property they were just trying to get a deal done because they make money on both sides of the equation that happens all the time in advertising where there s conflicts of interest we believe that the future is all about data and especially the data that informs what an advertiser should buy for instance if you take our brand and i m just picking at random a brand like nike there s a lot of nike loyals people love that brand if you buy one product you re actually much more likely to buy five products there s a lot of loyalty there you want to make certain that your advertising and spending more on those that have loyalty but also nike i want them to trust me with their data about what does their consumer look like so that i can help them go find other stuff then i can help them decide should i buy the front page of yahoo or should i buy the audio out on spotify i buy paramount or should i buy peacock there s all these questions that if i have a dog in the hunt i m a horrible advisor by pledging to them i don t own any inventory i never will now i can make objective decisions for you between all those various properties and now we re aligned most importantly now you can trust me with your first party data so that i can put that to work on your behalf if i was representing both sides even if i run a much bigger company i will be operating at a disadvantage because i just wouldn t be able to win trust we think one of the advantages we have over many of the much bigger technology companies is that we have objectivity and allegiance and they do not andy cross i just want you to talk a little bit about the international opportunities i think most of your spend businesses is concentrated the client spend is in the u s i just wanted you to talk a little bit about the opportunities internationally especially over in china such a massive market and a lot of the walled gardens obviously not allowed into china and what opportunities the trade desk has over there jeff green you bet first let me just the world outside of the u s because we represent the fortune 500 nearly all of them most of them are interested in being all over the world i imagine most of the people watching this travel outside the united states you can t go anywhere in the world and not see signs for brands like coca cola or fortune 500 brands all over the world mcdonald s in certain ubiquitous brands here those brands are interested in technology that will take them all over the world and it becomes very important that in order for us to represent them or to have a partnership with them we have to be in the major media markets all over the world we have offices all over the world over 25 and of course across europe and asia and americas and australia we ve been especially bullish on our opportunity to help them in ctv in 2020 we were leading the market in the us and australia only very progressive in terms of svod and moving to online in terms of traditional content becoming available online many parts of the world were a little bit slower than that but in 2021 we became market leader in both the u k and germany part of the thing that makes me so optimistic is that when you re playbook works in one country you can say okay but what about everywhere else but when it s worked in many different environments like germany uk london and australia and then of course the us then you know your playbook with some adaption can work everywhere the fact we have four x growth in ctv in emea last year and 200 growth in asia and ctv were just really phenomenal you mentioned china though just to touch on that just very briefly andy cross please jeff green one of the things that s unique about our approach to china because there s a ton of especially u s based companies that have just been killed trying to go into china we think we re in a different situation in large part because we re not trying to take money out of china we re doing two things number 1 we re bringing money into china first of all which is the biggest brands in the world want to sell more products in china we want to buy ads on baidu alibaba tencent if you compare that to like a facebook who would want to come into market and people spend time on facebook that would arguably take away viewership from tencent china would be much less interested in something that would take away from a chinese company versus something that s going to come bring money in then the last thing is we re helping chinese manufacturers and brands be known to the rest of the world taking those everywhere else once again just helping chinese companies do well that helps the global economy but with that different value proposition it s one of the reasons why our china offices have been the fastest growing for our company in the world chris hill coming up after the break jason moser and ron gross return we re going to dip into the fool mailbag and they ve got a few stocks on their radar stay right here you re listening to motley fool money as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear welcome back to motley fool money chris hill here once again with jason moser and ron gross our email address is we ve got two we want to share first from kenny ray who writes i wanted to take the time to simply say thanks i started my investing journey with the motley fool about a year ago after coming home from an overseas deployment with the us army i knew nothing about investing and i d taken advice from the morning brew newsletter to become a motley fool member i listened to every podcast and watch the motley fool live video stream when i can over the last year i ve watched my portfolio start to grow and then turn red that being said i truly appreciate the constant reassurance advice and personal experiences shared from so many people at the fool the community keeps me grounded and resilient even with this year starting out rocky and the current situation in ukraine i m comfortable staying in the market and riding things out i m 35 years old and realize i have plenty of time to watch my positions bounce back and grow thanks again for all you do thank you for that kenny and that s awesome that is the way to go we love to see that we got a question from bruce in tampa florida i ve heard multiple analysts say they like to have 25 35 stocks in their portfolio that s an incredible amount of stocks and it s obviously well into the six figures how do you build that portfolio one stock at a time or small increments across the board for all stocks many people have received a one time influx of money due to the sale of their homes in the past couple of years when investing with a one time large sum do you believe in dollar cost averaging or just going all in keep up the great work ron a lot to get through there but in terms of the portfolio building what do you think ron gross thanks bruce and go bucs what i would say is 25 stocks you don t need to do that overnight you can build up to 25 stocks over a multi year period of time it doesn t have to be tens of thousands or even thousands of dollars each time 1 000 in each stock 25 000 500 in each stock 12 500 can get you where you need to be it s great if you can buy fractional shares if your broker allows that because that will allow you to buy some of the higher priced stocks and not worry about getting a whole share or a whole two shares again remember it s not shares that matter it s the dollars invested in each company just take your time be methodical about it your second question i like to dollar cost average in but the market goes up over time so theoretically if you put your money in now over time that money will rise as well chris hill jason the second part of bruce s email reminded me of something you ve talked about before the approach of buying in thirds jason moser i think generally speaking most of us like the dollar cost average in because we feel like we can be a little bit more in control and be a little bit more opportunistic there s actually a study out there from northwestern mutual wealth management though that shows that the lump sum option does work this study looked at rolling 10 year returns on 1 million starting in 1950 and basically just compared a lump sum versus dollar cost average assuming a 100 stock portfolio the return on lump sum investing outperformed dollar cost averaging 75 of the time portfolio composed of 60 stocks and 40 bonds that outperformance rate was 80 and a 100 fixed income portfolio outperformed dollar cost averaging 90 of the time there is data out there that shows a lump sum certainly can work for you if that s an option you prefer chris hill let s get to the stocks on our radar our man behind glass rick engdahl s going to hit you with a question ron gross you re up first what are you looking at this week ron gross i m going to do something different this week and thank you for giving me the permission to do so chris i m going to recommend a basket of stocks of my own creation during times like this weakness in the market i love to buy more of my favorite stocks at discounted prices these are companies usually with impressive management teams strong cash flow rock solid balance sheets let s call them resilient stocks i m not giving one radar stock this week i m giving my resilient basket and you can buy all of these companies at significant discounts to their 52 week highs costco is down 10 from its 52 week high microsoft down 15 domino s down 26 home depot down 26 disney down 27 and target down 28 i think those six companies right there will give you a nice little basket of resilient companies chris hill rick question about ron gross resilient basket rick munarriz it s a very nice basket ron you ve got there but come on which one s your favorite ron gross i love costco its business model its culture i think it s a pretty special company chris hill jason moser what are you looking at this week jason moser keeping an eye on zoom video communications ticker zm earnings on monday february 28th after the market closes if you recall recently zoom had the five9 acquisition they were trying to make that deal was called off an interesting press release this week zoom contact center is rolling out now this is essentially their effort at developing that five9 dynamic to the business without actually making the five9 acquisition but i think it s really interesting to see because we talk about this idea of what is zoom going to become you can see all of these different initiatives it feels like we re watching them become a little bit more like salesforce in some ways here focusing on that customer relationship management side of the market opportunity there it could absolutely be a tremendous opportunity for the business that they execute the stock is 70 off its 52 week high it could be one worth keeping an eye on here for patient investors i think chris hill rick question about zoom rick munarriz i m tired of zoom in the way i m tired of facebook and things like that it s just yes i m tired of it but i know it s going to be here forever is that the story for zoom are we stuck with it for the long term future you think or is there anything going to come along and disrupt it ron gross i think for better or worse yeah for some of us more than others yeah we re probably stuck with it microsoft teams of course is a competitor in the space as well hopefully the hybrid workforce won t steer too many people into that glass half empty mentality with zoom but i do understand exactly where you re coming from i feel like any other zoom meeting like getting another hole in my head chris hill we re out of time guys ron gross jason moser thanks for being here jason moser thanks chris

highlights and speak to performance both financial and operational for q4 and full year 2021 firstly on financials i m pleased to report steady year over year growth in the following key financial metrics 2021 adjusted ebitda of nearly 1 1 billion increased 24 year over year from 869 5 million largely from new facilities that came online in 2021 on the renewable side including maverick creek wind and altavista as well as contribution of new facilities on the regulator side including empire wind and a full year of contribution from belco and sr our 2021 adjusted net earnings per share of 0 71 was up 11 from the 0 64 reported in the prior year and came in line with our expectations last year we reported annual dividends per share of 0 67 representing our tenth consecutive year of dividend increases we also exited the year with approximately 16 8 billion in assets a 27 increase over the 13 2 billion reported in the prior year secondly on execution the company undertook a number of successful growth initiatives and continue to execute on strategic priorities in 2021 which are positioning us well for the future we continue to focus our efforts on algonquin s three strategic pillars growth operational excellence and sustainability and i will provide more details on each of these pillars earlier this year we pushed on the acquisition of new york american water which services over 125 000 customer connections across seven counties in southeastern new york and we officially welcome the new york american water employees into liberty the transition has gone very well as planned staying on the topic of growth i want to provide you an update on our pending 2 8 billion acquisition of kentucky power company and aep kentucky transmission company we remain excited and firmly committed to this transaction and look forward to bringing the benefits of our local operating model to eastern kentucky as we ve previously mentioned our expectation of enhancing kentucky power s local operating model bringing benefits to customers by exploring opportunities to reduce customer rates through investing in green energy and creating increased local employment are all attributes that are expected to help customers and the local communities while driving value for our shareholders to that end you are likely aware that we jointly filed with adp an application with the kentucky commission on january 4 for the approval of the acquisition of kentucky power by statute the commission must issue an order on the application within 120 days we expect to close the transaction in mid 2022 after receipt of state and ferc level approvals and satisfaction of all other closing conditions to date we have already received hart scott rodino and cfius approvals staying on the regulatory front our review at empire electric continues to progress well on february 4 2022 our stipulation was reached among empire electric office of the public counsel staff of the missouri public service commission and other intervenors hearings were held on february 7 on rate design and a hearing on the stipulation was held on february 10 with new rates expected to be implemented in may of 2022 we believe the settlement represents a fair outcome for our customers and the company we continue to invest in our network to deliver mission critical services to our communities while keeping customer affordability top of mind another growth pillar in our regulated business is focused on deploying capital to benefit our customers in 2021 the regulated services group invested over 1 9 billion including the completion of our midwest greening initiative where we brought 600 megawatts of wind generation online in the coming years we expect to invest between 800 million and 1 2 billion annually into our rate base to improve safety security reliability resiliency and customer experience turning to the growth levers on our renewable business in this business our ability to originate and execute projects is a critical growth lever 2021 has been a record year for algonquin with nearly 1 200 megawatts of new renewable projects either closing or reaching commercial operations in december 2021 we completed our latest project to achieve commercial operations the 24 megawatt ebr wind facility in quebec with all of the energy being sold to hydro quebec the 175 megawatt blue hill facility in saskatchewan with all of the energy under contract with sas power is on track to achieve commercial operations in march 2021 our construction program continues with the expected start of construction in q2 2022 of the deerfield ii and sandy ridge ii wind projects also we continue to progress our partnership with chevron and expect to start construction on the first two of these solar projects in midyear the fact that we continue to successfully execute on construction in the midst of the covid pandemic and supply chain challenges is a testament to the hard work entrepreneurial culture and experience base of our employees at our investor day we discussed our strong development platform where our ongoing development has resulted in growing our greenfield pipeline of prospective generation projects to 3 800 megawatts by the end of 2021 this growth is net of projects totaling 640 megawatts which advanced from our greenfield pipeline into our five year capital plan the 640 megawatts that advanced includes the riverbend wind project in michigan the blue violet combined wind solar project in illinois and four projects being developed in partnership with chevron in new mexico and texas two other important initiatives in 2021 to establish a strong fund list and for future growth include building a 1 700 megawatt hour pipeline of prospective energy storage projects and entry into renewable natural gas with the agreement to acquire sand hill a developer of rng projects sand hill represents an attractive platform giving us immediate entry by its portfolio of four projects in the state of wisconsin two of which are currently under construction with first production expected around the end of q1 and two projects which are in late stage development according to a u s environmental protection agency report wisconsin represents the state with the second largest universe of renewable natural gas opportunities and we are excited to utilize sand hill as an rng growth platform this acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2022 moving on now to operational excellence in a mission critical industry safety and reliability are always key areas of focus i m very pleased to share that we have passed an impressive milestone of over 715 days that is nearly 11 million work hours without a single lost time injury across our north american business while keeping our customers and communities safe and maintaining our system reliability and resiliency i want to thank all of our employees for their ongoing focus on safety and preparedness for weather events i want to particularly call out and thank the electric team in tahoe as that area received record breaking snowfall over the christmas holidays liberty crews worked hard throughout the holiday weekend to restore power to our customers and communities as quickly and safely as possible during harsh weather conditions the hard work and dedication of our employees did not go unnoticed by the customers and local communities we serve and finally we remain firmly committed to sustainability through the inclusion of environmental social and governance values in our broader corporate strategy and day to day operations in 2021 we announced our target for net zero for scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050 with a critical path supported by our strong decarbonization track record extensive experience in regulated utility management and deep expertise in renewables development on the governance side we successfully embedded sustainability into our management s compensation model continuing to enhance how esg factors are embedded throughout the organization s business goals and finally in 2021 aqn s esg ratings continue to improve in the aggregate positioning the company as a sustainability leader more recently i m pleased to report the company s inclusion in the 2022 bloomberg gender equality index for the third year in a row our inclusion into the index is a testament to our continued efforts for continued gender equality improved generating quality and transparency as we target above market gender representation at our board and executive levels with that i ll pass it over to arthur who will speak to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results arthur arthur kacprzak chief financial officer thank you arun and good morning everyone i m pleased to report that algonquin has reported steady fourth quarter and full year results reflecting the benefits of our diversified and resilient business model and proven track record of disciplined growth our fourth quarter 2021 consolidated adjusted ebitda was 297 6 million which is up approximately 18 from the 253 1 million we reported for the same period last year the regulated services group delivered 191 4 million in operating profit in the current quarter which compares to 162 4 million in the same quarter last year an increase of about 18 this improvement reflects contributions from our midwest wind facilities which were placed in service in 2021 as well as contributions from belco our bermuda electric utility and essal our chilean water utility as both acquisitions closed during q4 of 2020 results also benefited from new rates implemented on calpeco and granite state electric systems as well as park water and apple valley water systems in california this was offset by lower consumption driven by milder weather results were also impacted by higher nonpassthrough fuel costs at empire electric as well as higher operating costs at granite state and calpeco the renewable energy group reported fourth quarter divisional operating profit of 123 9 million which compares to 97 9 million in the same quarter last year an increase of about 27 the addition of the sugar creek and maverick creek wind generation facilities contributed to the year over year increase in operating profit our investment in atlantica also continued to provide benefits with dividends received and increasing by 4 4 million over the prior year q4 also benefited from the sale of our new market solar facility through a joint venture with our renewable construction partner ares resulting in a recognized gain reflecting a step up in the value created through the development process however this increase was partially offset by lower overall production of some of our wind and solar generation facilities and higher operating costs while performance at our sanger facility was negatively impacted this quarter while higher compliance costs and lower capacity payments our investment in the texas coastal wind facilities was also negatively impacted by higher than expected basis costs lower than expected production and an acceleration of hlbv losses of 9 million related to q1 hedge settlements caused by winter storm uri and are expected to largely reverse in the future fourth quarter corporate expenses were higher by approximately 10 5 million as compared to last year driven primarily by higher administrative expenses and a higher overall net development expenses as compared to last year in total our q4 adjusted net earnings per share came in at 0 21 which is in line with last year in addition to the drivers discussed our results were negatively impacted by financing costs associated with the capital deployed in 2021 and an increase in the weighted average shares related to the kentucky power acquisition funding for the full year adjusted net eps came in at 0 71 and compares to 0 64 reported in the prior year representing an annual growth in adjusted net eps of 11 showing solid year over year growth although we delivered strong results we did encounter various headwinds throughout the year as a result of record load wind resources experienced throughout the early part of the year which was an industrywide phenomenon generation on our wind facilities was down approximately 10 from long term averages also much warmer than normal weather in the midwest negatively affected customer usage in the early and latter parts of the year compared to normalized weather patterns this represents an impact of approximately 48 million on our 2021 operating profit or about 0 055 on our adjusted eps moving on to the balance sheet and financing activities first i wanted to spend a few minutes to provide an update on our progress toward the financing of the kentucky power acquisition on the announcement of the deal back in october of last year we executed a canadian dollar bought deal offering of common shares raising a u s dollar equivalent of approximately 640 million in proceeds early this year we issued approximately 1 1 billion of hybrid debt in a concurrent public offerings in the u s and canada recall that hybrid debt received 50 equity credit from s p and fitch and never converts to common shares we have issued this financing on an attractive expected 10 year rate of approximately 4 9 or at 5 after factoring hedging that brings the total rates for the transaction to just over 1 7 billion toward the 2 8 billion purchase price on closing we expect to assume approximately 1 2 billion of kentucky power company debt of which approximately 500 million is targeted to be refinanced using liberty utilities established 144a debt platform which we would expect would benefit our future kentucky customers we continue to see this acquisition as providing compelling value and look forward to closing later this year moving on to the broader capital and financing plan in 2021 algonquin deployed 3 7 billion of capital on organic initiatives relating to the safety and reliability of our electric water and gas systems as well as delivering new renewable generation from our projects including maverick creek wind altavista solar and our midwest greening for 2022 algonquin is targeting to spend over 4 3 billion in capital with the majority related to the acquisitions of new york american water which closed earlier this year and kentucky power which is expected to close in the middle of this year our funding plan for the remainder of the year is predicated on maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet targeting a bbb investment grade credit rating i spoke to the funding associated with the kentucky power acquisition already the remaining funding requirements can be solved by a combination of various funding sources available to us including retained cash to more hybrid debt proceeds and some more hybrid debt proceeds from securitization of certain regulatory assets and as well as issuance of long term debt as we discussed during our investor day asset recycling we re selling down a portion of our nonregulated renewables can also be viewed as another source of potential value accretive capital for us this year considering the various funding sources available we do not expect to raise additional capital when we have issuance of discrete common equity for the remainder of this year our funding plan is supported by a strong liquidity position at the end of 2021 we had approximately 2 billion of committed capital and reserves available not counting the acquisition facility that was arranged in connection with the kentucky power transaction before turning things over to arun i d like to provide a brief update on our 2022 adjusted net eps guidance we continue to expect our 2022 adjusted net eps per share to be within a range of 0 72 to 0 77 which was communicated previously at our investor day we continue to assume in our earnings guidance normalized weather patterns and rate decisions in line with expectations as well as resource production and realized pricing on a renewable generating facilities consistent with long term averages we also assume that there are no impacts from covid 19 on our operations we look forward to continuing to deliver solid earnings from our diversified and growth oriented business model which along with our history of superior dividend growth we believe will continue to drive strong shareholder returns with that i will now hand it back to arun to outline our strategic plans arun banskota president and chief executive officer thanks arthur before we close out our prepared comments this morning i want to give an update on our strategic initiatives at our december investor day we updated our five year capital investment program which projects 12 4 billion from 2022 through the rest through the end of 2026 with a very visible capital plan of that we have already closed on new york american water earlier this year executing on approximately 600 million of the capital plan in january on the regulatory side of the business the additions of new york american water and kentucky power are expected to drive long term adjusted net eps growth while a large portion of the capital plan is being spent on organic investments to improve the safety reliability and resiliency of our network on the renewables side we are excited about the growth potential and believe that we have a once in a generation opportunity to accelerate renewables growth and add shareholder value in just over a period of one year we have made investments and have grown our prospective greenfield pipeline from 3 400 megawatts to 3 800 megawatts while converting 640 megawatts from that greenfield pipeline into our new five year capital plan we also introduced a new prospective pipeline of storage opportunities of 1 700 megawatt hours at our december investor day we believe this validates the strength of our development platform we now have scale across both our development platform as discussed and we own and have investments in over 4 000 megawatts of renewable generation at our investor day we spoke of accelerating renewables growth and adding shareholder value as we plan to increase our investments in greenfield development which we expect will allow us to capture the higher development margins and take a number of those projects through construction once in construction we see an opportunity to partner with institutional investors wishing to make alternate sustainable investments with our ability to develop and deliver on long term contracted sustainable assets in particular we should be able to sell down to these investors while earning an operating fee we could then deploy somewhere all of the capital gains in further greenfield development creating a potential new recurring source of earnings for our investors with scale we expect to get incremental benefits including improved negotiating power lower transaction costs and access to greater opportunities we are on our way to completing planning and plan to execute this strategy in 2022 i m excited about the prospects for algonquin s regulated and renewables businesses which are both well positioned to contribute to and benefit from the decarbonization transformation that is currently underway and which will only accelerate over the coming years in summary our three strategic pillars of operational excellence growth and sustainability will be a key foundation as we continue to build the business and strive to bring long term value to our shareholders we remain well positioned to continue to execute on our growth strategies while pursuing our sustainability goals with that i will turn the call over to the operator for any questions from those on the line questions answers operator your first question today comes from the line of sean steuart with td securities your line is now open sean steuart td securities analyst thank you good morning everyone arun banskota president and chief executive officer good morning sean sean steuart td securities analyst good morning a couple of questions the new market solar project sale to the joint venture with ares how should we think about that project pipeline going forward for future sales into that vehicle arun banskota president and chief executive officer sure sean so look we have been talking a few times now about the ability for us to provide recurring shareholder value through the growth of the development and construction pipeline and so what i talked about toward the end of my presentation was really how that new market solar also fits into our strategy of doing producing recurring shareholder value through such sell downs so because of the fact that we believe it s going to be a recurring source we thought we believe it was prudent to not adjust that out of our earnings sean steuart td securities analyst ok understood right the pace going forward though for future projects to be sold into that vehicle any context you can provide there arun banskota president and chief executive officer well we re about done with our planning process and starting our execution process on that sean so we ll probably be able to give a lot more detail at the next quarterly call sean steuart td securities analyst ok the sand hill acquisition and i guess context on the amount of capital you expect to invest into those projects and more broadly speaking larger investment opportunities for whether it s rng or other energy transition type investments any details you can provide on that front jeff norman chief development officer hey sean it s jeff yes i think the sand hill acquisition and the four projects are anaerobic digesters and so they re relatively small in terms of capex it s important to us because of the benefits of advancing in rg and improving our knowledge in that area more so than an absolute capital play that being said we do see rng expanding our rng includes hydrogen and so as we start to build our knowledge start to build how we trade and expand more we do see that as an important area but there s still a lot of information to unfold sean steuart td securities analyst ok thanks jeff that s all i have for now thanks guys arun banskota president and chief executive officer thanks sean operator your next question comes from the line of david quezada with raymond james your line is now open david quezada raymond james analyst thanks morning everyone my first question here just on new york american water now that that s closed i m curious what kind of potential you see there i guess for spending capex either organic or otherwise i think at the time of the acquisition there were some talk about opportunities for consolidation there so any thoughts around that would be appreciated arun banskota president and chief executive officer look i mean we are very much in a planning process for continued investments in new york american water our next rate case is not due for some time but as with all of our other utilities we continue to invest in the safety and reliability and resiliency of that water system as with anything else now given our unique positioning in terms of renewable energy i mean as you know there s quite a bit of energy required to transport water one of the unique things we do do is look at opportunities to see how we can substitute the current energy profile with our renewable energy generation to serve our water utilities also which i think is a unique capability that we have and we have utilized that already so that s something we re taking a closer look at as well david quezada raymond james analyst excellent thanks arun maybe just one more for me just on the topic of cost inflation and i m thinking specifically about your regulated business curious if you ve had any discussions with regulators especially on your active regulatory dockets if inflation is has been raised as a concern there at all and how are those discussions going arun banskota president and chief executive officer sure look david i mean inflation is the current topic du jour right so obviously we re seeing more inflation than we have seen in the past it s probably been what 10 15 years at least i think on the regulated side of the business i mean look i mean inflation is largely a pass through but at the same time we are acutely aware of the potential impact on customer affordability so we track that extremely closely and that s a continued source of discussion we have with regulators on how to balance all the cost increases vis a vis the right level of customer rates on the renewable energy side it s largely a function in our minds of you have three significant contracts on the renewable energy side right you ve got your large equipment contracts you ve got your epc contract you ve got your offtake contracts once you sign those three agreements all of them are fixed price contracts and so in our mind the strategy we employ is trying to sign those three contracts as closely concurrently as possible so that we are not left holding the inflation risk and that s the balloon being able to protect our return margins david quezada raymond james analyst excellent appreciate the color thanks arun that s all i have arun banskota president and chief executive officer thank you david operator your next question comes from the line of rob hope with scotiabank your line is now open rob hope scotiabank analyst good morning everyone first question just on the it looks like a little bit of a pivot on the renewable power strategy to a bit more of a capital level strategy is this what s driving the investment in capital projects on the renewable energy group of 5 million to 30 million in 2022 because if i look at slide 7 it looks like it should be a relatively busy year so is the assumption that you re going to be kind of bending down more than half of these projects equity count for them and kind of recoup your capital here pretty quick arthur kacprzak chief financial officer that s basically irrelevant already it s out there what you re seeing there is basically the spend that s really the on balance sheet spend but obviously a lot of activity going on in the year and certainly a lot of development spend and continuing construction spend but there that spend is mostly reflected in our construction jvs arun banskota president and chief executive officer and then that activity is only likely to keep on increasing rob and then that s why if you notice we started including a slide that shows you the level of construction activities which is fairly significant so we have not slowed down in terms of continuing to advance our greenfield projects through the development process through construction and do anything to operations rob hope scotiabank analyst all right that s helpful and then i guess the question is how should we think about the 3 6 billion of capex that you put forward at your investor day is that then more of a 100 number and then net to aqn could be significantly smaller than we ll add on more projects as they come arthur kacprzak chief financial officer yeah that is you can think of that as the growth number i mean obviously as we think about how much is actually retained versus monetized and so forth will be determined in the future rob hope scotiabank analyst got it thank you arun banskota president and chief executive officer thanks rob operator your next question comes from the line of nelson ng with rbc capital your line is now open nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and good morning everyone just a quick follow up to that question in terms of the jv so can you give a bit more give a bit more color on your relationship with ares management are they a long term buyer of your assets is that part of the plan jeff norman chief development officer yeah nelson it s jeff i wouldn t characterize it as a long term buyer so we ve got a strong relationship with ares and we expect to do more than one transaction with them but it s not an exclusive relationship and i think there s a very robust market out there and we want to keep our options open nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst ok so i know in the past you would move assets into a jv have it constructed and then at the end you would you usually kind of buy it back at a nominal price but this isn t the case right like ares will be a long term equity shareholder in new market and the other assets is that right jeff norman chief development officer yeah there s two elements to think of on that the first one is on the development side where we are moving projects through and they re participating in the risk on those projects and then there s the construction type jvs i think the primary difference is ares the primary difference between the original construction projects and this would be we may not take them back at the end but it may not be ares that is the long term goal there may be a third party that picks up thereafter as well so that s not absolutely certain at this time nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst ok thanks and then just one last follow up question in terms of timing so is it the plan to have things sold down and moved to a jv at i guess on financial close or just prior to construction or during construction rather than on or after completion i presume there s still a bit of extra value to be had if after you hit cod arun banskota president and chief executive officer the plan is that we re in the best position to derisk these projects through development and through construction those are clearly areas of expertise we have and take them through a certain period of operation and to take care of all the initial bidding down issues fees of the store and then sell down nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst ok thanks for that sorry go on arthur kacprzak chief financial officer no i was just going to add and i mean with the construction jvs algonquin will still look to retain the full obviously upside value throughout the construction cycle nelson ng rbc capital markets analyst ok got it all right i ll get back in the queue thanks everyone arun banskota president and chief executive officer thanks nelson operator your next question comes from the line of ryan greenwald with bank of america your line is now open ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone maybe starting with any additional color how you re thinking about the dividend growth going forward it looks like excluding the gain on sale here you guys were tracking at approximately 100 payout ratio is there any way to help frame how you re thinking about that ahead of the annual cadence in which you typically revisit it arthur kacprzak chief financial officer yeah i would say it s our stance really hasn t changed what we communicated previously look our dividends we certainly want it to be sustainable dividends and i think we ve communicated in the past in the 80 to 90 payout ratio target i mean it s long term targets that s what we re targeting between 80 to 90 so there is going to be a lumpiness in certain years but from an overall long term perspective that s where we end up seeing and certainly do some further dividend growth as well ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it that s helpful and then in terms of the sale to ares instead of aui can you just talk about that and how you re thinking about the ay relationship going forward arun banskota president and chief executive officer look the ay relationship remains strong right i mean as you saw we have dropped down some other assets into ay as well like i ve told multiple times i mean we like the esg profile of atlantica so the relationship remains strong and i just want to remind folks that the whole construct around with ay on the drop down that it is going to be around nonregulated non north american assets right so this does not obviously necessarily fall into that category so i think as a company we as we grow our renewables portfolio we find ourselves in a good position that we have multiple options ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes understood and then maybe just one more if i may in terms of your appetite for further m a in the market environment can you touch on that a bit and then perhaps separately given where ldcs have been transacting from a private valuation perspective will regulated divestment be on the table or is any asset recycling going to be more on the renewable side arun banskota president and chief executive officer look i mean ryan i would tell you that we re always looking to increase shareholder value and then we re never closing any doors and saying because there are no sacred cows here right having said that from a strategic perspective when we look at all of our assets in our portfolio and given the external market as well we believe that the first phase is really the sell down on the renewable side of the business because we see our ability to be able to control more that development pipeline the construction pipeline the flow of the number of projects into operations so it s a much more recurring and it s a much more controllable pace of recurring shareholder value rather than one offs right now having said that we re not against doing one offs either and so one of the ways we look at that is any particular asset more valuable in our under our ownership versus somebody else s ownership so that s something we re always looking at ryan greenwald bank of america merrill lynch analyst great i ll end it there thanks so much for the time arun banskota president and chief executive officer thanks ryan operator your next question comes from the line of ben pham with bmo your line is now open ben pham bmo capital markets analyst hi thanks and maybe i want to start off to follow up on based on the questions you had on ares and some of the structures that you re utilizing i m wondering when you look at asset drop downs or asset sales like how do you position where it sits is ares mainly development construction ay operating assets and then you compare that to third party how do you there s a bunch of different structures going so would be interesting to see how you think about where things sit arun banskota president and chief executive officer so basically when we look at development and construction one of the options we have obviously is to utilize this joint venture with ares right so we do not have any other but we could develop it totally ourselves as well so we have that flexibility of doing either or we are not normally developing projects or going through construction with atlantica on the operational side by and large we are the operating entity on our asset base and atlantica is the operator on their set of assets i mean we obviously try to learn from each other but those are two separate operation platforms ben pham bmo capital markets analyst ok and then your 2022 guidance or even thinking the 7 to 9 i would assume correct me if wrong there s a drop down element baked into those numbers arthur kacprzak chief financial officer yeah we do certainly look at extracting value out of our greenfield development pipeline and we have to bake that into the guidance now whether it s a pure drop down or a pure gain or whether it s extracted through different ways such as management fees and so forth that s to be we still work through but there is certainly one thing we are looking at is obviously some of the value created to our current growth platform ben pham bmo capital markets analyst ok i understand and then my last one you mentioned some of the bridges on funding for kentucky power i wasn t sure arthur were you suggesting that you re now fully funded for kentucky power or there s still a slice left arthur kacprzak chief financial officer yeah we re basically done in terms of the notional melts for kentucky power with our hybrid debt of 1 1 billion we ve funded the cash purchase price we obviously need to put everything into the mix and make sure our credit metrics come out right on the other side of all of this so there s the rest of it are from funding plans certainly considered with that ben pham bmo capital markets analyst ok got it ok thank you operator your next question comes from the line of andrew kuske with credit suisse your line is now open andrew kuske credit suisse analyst thanks good morning i guess the first question is really around the ability to monetize certain assets portions of it entirely and then use those proceeds to effectively accelerate growth all that can be pretty compelling but how do you balance just a more complicated structure versus being more simple and how do you think about that and whether the financial terms are sort of warm or fuzzy kinds of feelings arun banskota president and chief executive officer andrew great question thank you so fundamentally if you really look at it what we re trying to do is leverage there s two specialized skill sets we have right one on the development side and one on the operations side and i think over the years now we have a certain level of scale on both sides of the business and we believe that we should be able to just accelerate that growth by utilizing and leveraging those specialized costs even more given the external environment and the whole decarbonization fees that s out there right so that s really the fundamental thesis now obviously to grow significantly along that renewable energy portfolio you obviously need to access a lot of capital and our view is that again looking at the external market with the amount of a number of sustainable investors out there we believe that we should be able to sell down to those sustainable investors at a point where we can provide recurring value to our shareholders right so that s really the thesis of that flywheel if you will continue to expand our renewables the greenfield pipeline taking those derisking goes through development construction and operations selling down redeploying that capital back into more renewables growth andrew kuske credit suisse analyst ok that s helpful i appreciate that and then maybe just thinking about that flywheel and your businesses and the transactional markets we ve seen in the u s more recently on the ldc side is there an opportunity to really focus your expertise in both the renewables business and the utilities business more broadly through the caribbean because you ve got the exposure in bermuda but there s other assets there that do have good decarbonization storage renewable needs and offer just more compelling value from an investment standpoint how do you think about just that region more broadly arun banskota president and chief executive officer well we were attracted to burn it up from a lot of different factors including the size we even look at things like hurricane profiles things of the sort where the bermuda does experience even fewer hurricanes than the other parts of the carribean so there s obviously a lot of things we look at when we look at any acquisitions scale is important we believe in terms of being able to do a lot more with less so some building scale across any one of our three modalities especially electric and water are things that we look at very closely but again we end up looking at a lot more opportunities than in terms of executing against those just because we continue to be extremely disciplined around which assets we bring under our fort we just have a lot of financial metrics risk metrics that we need to those assets we need to fit but again i hope i m answering your question andrew it s a long winded question answer andrew kuske credit suisse analyst it wasn t a concise question either so i appreciate your time arun banskota president and chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of naji baydoun with industrial alliance your line is now open naji baydoun industrial alliance analyst hi good morning just wanted to start off with i guess a clarification on the balance of funding for this year so you had the large hybrid debt offering and in terms of the priorities for asset recycling can you just clarify if you re thinking about existing asset monetizations or noncore asset sales or is that is it really just more focus on development sell loans for this year arthur kacprzak chief financial officer so for this year i mean as we think about our funding plan look we ve got i would say first of all we ve got optionality as always we ve got a lot of different funding sources that we can look to tap i mean asset recycling is certainly one of those funding sources and that would potentially come from existing assets that are in our fleet but again it s we ve got quite a lot of funding sources to potentially satisfy what we need to do this year naji baydoun industrial alliance analyst ok so there s now i guess a necessity in terms of accelerating some of that here in the short term arthur kacprzak chief financial officer yeah naji baydoun industrial alliance analyst ok just the other question i have was about the accelerating renewables growth that you mentioned i know that you have a lot of projects in the pipeline for this year but maybe just beyond 2022 and 23 can you just give us an update on how the new development projects are going that could potentially extend that runway over time jeff norman chief development officer naji it s jeff and i think arun referred to our greenfield pipeline the 3 800 megawatts which we rolled out at investor day that is what we see feeding our five year capital plan and we continue to add to that pipeline as well as advance the projects in that pipeline for pull down into the capital plan so we feel like we ve got the pump well primed or the flywheel turning here and we re making good progress across the spectrum from new entrants into that greenfield pipeline and pulling stuff out into the capital plan and so 22 23 24 we won t be able to say anything concrete until we have names ready to share with you but the process is certainly working well arun banskota president and chief executive officer and on top of that we also showed you the 1 700 megawatt hours of storage pipeline which we re pretty bullish about naji baydoun industrial alliance analyst sure of course and again just to be clear i think you said you re looking to add about a gigawatt of new projects in the next five years so are you do you feel like you re still on track to do at least 200 megawatts this year of new development jeff norman chief development officer yes in terms of new development that would fall into the capital plan that we shared at investor day we would expect at least 200 megawatts naji baydoun industrial alliance analyst yeah thanks everyone arun banskota president and chief executive officer thank you naji operator your final question today comes from the line of rupert merer with national bank your line is now open rupert merer national bank financial analyst hi good morning everyone another question on asset recycling of freight can you talk about potential to sell your existing assets are you only looking to do sell downs on development assets or could you do sell downs on existing assets as well jeff norman chief development officer rupert it s jeff yeah existing assets are certainly on the table and we believe they ve got good value given the transactions we re seeing in the market and to the extent that we re looking to monetize anything in the shorter term that s where the more material amount would be rupert merer national bank financial analyst and then would you look to aim or look to say control 51 of assets in the future so you re going to maintain control and then you have a joint venture accounting somewhat like you have with your texas assets arun banskota president and chief executive officer not necessarily rupert i mean we have not decided exactly what level of ownership we re going to take i believe what is more important for us is to make sure we are the operating and asset management entity because again creating and furthering scale on that side of the business also continues to be important for us so that s what we will focus on exactly what percent is we sell down the debt that s still in the planning stages rupert merer national bank financial analyst ok great and then just finally on texas you saw some headwinds ath the coastal wind assets i know you gave us some color on that situation back in december just walking wondering if you could walk us through what you saw in q4 and what the outlook is for these assets going forward i understand you re looking at improved transmission there over time but what does the outlook look like for the remainder of this year arun banskota president and chief executive officer sure so rupert so there was really a combination of factors right on those coastal wind facilities first of all there were lower wind resource which again i believe is an industrywide phenomenon that affected quite a number of our north american wind assets in 2021 on top of that during periods of oversupply the prices were obviously lower than anticipated in the market and third one of the projects actually got to cod later than anticipated and finally as you saw the tours later the year they were general transmission constraint that is announced by ercot so it really was a combination of factors we believe that the first three of those should be transitory the fourth one we believe is going to go away with time because of the announcement of a general cash constraint that means that both ercot and the commission have already approved transition upgrades around that region and that facility so we believe that over time starting 2024 that basis risk is going to be should significantly go away so of those the four factors i talked about three of them are transitory one we believe will continue until 2024 rupert merer national bank financial analyst ok very good i ll leave it there thank you arun banskota president and chief executive officer thank you rupert operator there are no further questions at this time arun i turn the call back over to you arun banskota president and chief executive

investors were happy with the company s latest quarterly results what happened the stock market as a whole sagged on friday but you wouldn t know it from the performance of the gap s gps 2 76 shares the veteran clothing company s stock traded sideways on the day thanks to better than expected quarterly results so what for its fourth quarter of its fiscal 2021 the gap posted net sales of 4 5 billion that was 2 higher on a year over year basis and essentially matched the average analyst estimate it was also on the back of a comparable sales figure that rose by 3 on the bottom line the retailer flipped to a loss of 16 million from the year ago profit of 234 million on an adjusted per share basis the shortfall was 0 02 far better than the collective prognosticator estimate of 0 12 the coronavirus pandemic may be receding but the gap s results still trail those of 2019 as the company contends with current supply chain issues the company is recovering notably though the latest net sales figure was only 3 below the same period of 2019 the gap quoted its ceo sonia syngal as saying that after two years of restructuring including divesting smaller non strategic brands transitioning our european market to an asset light partnership model and shedding underperforming north american stores our core business is strong and we are poised for balanced growth across our four billion dollar lifestyle brands now what the gap also proffered encouraging guidance for fiscal 2022 it believes its top line will expand in the low single digit range compared to 2021 while adjusted per share net earnings should land between 1 85 to 2 05 investors were likely cheered by the latter range as this implies a good chance of exceeding the consensus 1 86 analyst estimate for the period

or blue it s about green motley fool money starts now i m chris hill joined once again by motley fool senior analyst bill mann thanks for being back here by popular demand bill mann i think it was just you and one other guy though chris hill that s popular demand there are a couple of things i want to get to as you and i are talking at the moment the federal reserve chair jay powell is across the river on capitol hill spending some time with the nice people at the us house committee on financial services we will get to that long time listeners know this is not a political show this is not the show for those who are looking to mix a lot of business and politics however i would be remiss if i didn t notice that the president of the united states gave the state of the union address last night and one of the ripple effects of that speech is continued conversation of the oil and gas industry as the conflict continues with russia s invasion of ukraine all of that laid out in front of you where are we now with the oil and gas industry what do you think as you watch the last 48 hours play out the way it has bill mann it is interesting and yet we try not to be political but sometimes politics shows up on business s door and this is absolutely one of those occasions chris i think that we are in some ways seeing the result of a rather unserious energy policy here in the us and in europe as well it s the thing where a lot of the people who really track the energy industry have said was coming for a long time have said that europe for example was leaving itself way too vulnerable to russia for example just for their energy needs there s a cliche that energy is life one of the things i was hoping for was to see a little bit more of a recognition of the fact even if we don t like it even while the good person in me says that in time i want us to be a country that s run primarily on renewables that we need to recognize now that our energy policy as it pertains to the oil and gas industry it doesn t help us at all and it definitely helps our adversaries at this point in particular russia chris hill this is not specific to the oil and gas industry this is the case with pretty much every industry that when there are overarching conversations in the media about a given industry the attention goes to the biggest companies and the biggest names the usual suspects in the oil and gas industry are companies like exxonmobil and chevron where else should we be looking as investors because this is an enormous industry i chuckle every time someone refers to the healthcare industry and i want to say which part because it s an enormous industry bill mann it s like asking about business tell me what s your favorite business in the business sector chris hill in terms of oil and gas where else should we be looking beyond the usual suspects bill mann i would look specifically in the exploration and production patch one of the big issues that has happened is we ve had about 10 15 years of deep underinvestment in exploration and production in the us there is a really neat measurement it s called drilled but uncompleted wells it s just it s a measure of how many wells are not producing right now but are ready when we talk about turning on the taps this is what you would talk about in terms of turning on the taps in 2020 there were almost 9 000 now there s about 4500 there really is not that much available ready to turn on taps in this country so if you re looking at places where there is going to be an obvious demand i would look at the exploration companies anadarko is one and by the way not a small company at all 13 billion in annual revenue occidental petroleum is another these are companies that are out doing the exploration for really the fuel that s going to be running our economy for a long while whether we like it too or not chris hill i want to go back to that metric because i ve never heard of that before drilled but uncompleted wells that s the metric bill mann yeah d u c let s go acronym on everything chris it s d u c they re called drilled but uncompleted wells if you have a bloomberg connection or you have access to the eia the energy intelligence agency excuse me those metrics are listed there these are 95 percent complete you could turn them on the number that we have right now both for energy policy and then also through the reality that following the drop in oil prices in 2020 there was a lot of losses in the oil and gas industry in terms of capital chris hill let s go to our friend jay powell i ve been saying to you earlier today i feel like the conversation that is taking place primarily on wall street about the federal reserve and will it increase interest rates if so when to me it is like the financial version of a bad rom com storyline where it s will they or won t they get together bill mann has daphne noticed yet that niles has a thing for her chris hill start dating or don t start that s where i am as an investor with interest rates like hey look raise them don t raise them can we just move on that s when i m being petty and childish when i become more serious i think let s assume just for the sake of this conversation that the way the tea leaves are reading right now come to fruition and in mid march the federal reserve raises interest rates a quarter percent in your opinion then what happens bill mann if you re talking about from the markets as we record right now it has already happened the markets in the us are up strongly today the s p 500 is up about two percent chris hill i m sorry just to interrupt up strongly today because powell s testimony came out it was either his written testimony or in answer to your question he basically said yes this is where we re headed you can draw a straight line from when he made that comment to when the market started heading bill mann thank you for not presuming along with me that everyone has paid very close attention to this today i guess it s really important to note that the market really is a discounting device by discounting it is really good at valuing in right now things that are known that will happen in the future the fact that chairman powell came out and said that this was something that he believed was going to happen it narrows the potential that there might be no interest rate increase a fed fund rate increase or that there might be a larger one in a time in which there is an awful lot of uncertainty given the geopolitical conditions that we find ourselves in the fact that he went out and has put some boundaries around what it is that they re planning on doing the market i don t think will react then because it has already reacted today chris hill are there industries that become more or less attractive as a result of this bill mann not so much chris hill because just on the surface bill a quarter percent isn t that much bill mann no especially from where we are we are still at a multi sensory low in interest rates i think that the reason that interest rates ultimately go up and down is to guarantee an orderly operation of the economy i would remain interested in the higher quality companies that are generating lots and lots of free cash flow the ones that have the ability to raise price and be the ones that are financially in better shape and don t really need the debt so companies like google let s go back to some of the old standbys the largest most important companies in the world apple is another these companies just really don t have much need for debt they re cash rich and this gives them some more options chris hill just thinking about cash you re not surprised that when berkshire hathaway came out with their latest quarterly report you know what i like the fact that they released it on a friday afternoon but given that this is what i do for a living i don t actually appreciate it i would prefer they do it at a time when it s easier for me to talk about it but i m assuming you re not surprised that buffett and munger and their team just continue to stay as disciplined as possible because when you think about businesses that have billions and billions of dollars from the balance sheet berkshire hathaway is right there they re not doing anything really other than buying back their own stock bill mann yeah and they came out in the letter wherein warren buffett essentially said that they didn t find too many things outside of the ones that they are already owned to be that attractive i think warren buffett and any company that has a lot of cash is just really actually excited to see a point in time in which they are competing with less alternatives for acquisitions i know that buffett had mentioned in the letter this time that they are poised and ready to go but they re not doing it yet the fact that they have plenty of cash so much more than they need for the operations of berkshire hathaway the business and all of its subsidiaries that speaks volumes for what it is the type of environment that they may really thrive and it s not one in which money is as easy as possible for anybody and everybody chris hill bill mann great talking to you as always thanks for being here bill mann thank you chris chris hill while the s p 500 is up today it is still down for the year and we ve talked before about the natural temptation to try and time the bottom but since doing that is basically impossible we wanted to share some allocation advice for the bottom of the market referred down market here s matt frankel and jason moser matt frankel it s been quite a wild ride for investors lately plenty of things going on around the world to keep the markets guessing we re getting plenty of questions regarding how to think about portfolio allocation in a down market as we speak right now the s p 500 is down almost 9 percent year to date the nasdaq is down about 12 percent but there are some clear do s and don ts that come with this territory we wanted to take a few minutes today to talk about that i guess first thing really what goes through your mind when we see market corrections like we ve seen this year jason moser everyone always says i want to find cheap stocks to buy that s what everyone wants to do but i like to use it as an opportunity to get in on stocks that i may have missed out on which there have been quite a few of those over the past couple of years i complain to you for how long that i missed out on paypal matt frankel yes i remember that jason moser so now i look at it as kind of a second chance to add stocks like that to my watchlist that maybe i missed the boat on the first time around and now i m being given a second chance if that makes sense matt frankel it makes perfect sense i like that i think we probably all have that list of stocks we feel like we missed the first time around honestly we do try to combat that you can feel like maybe you missed it but by the same token a good business is a good business and i feel like i d rather ultimately own that good business as opposed to just letting it go even if i feel like the price ran away from me but to your point paypal is a great example we ve seen paypal along with block and other payments companies really come back to earth here lately so it s nice to see that you ve got that company back on you it sounds to me like while it s easy to get a little bit worked up during volatile times it can be easy to want to sell and run for the hills generally speaking it feels like really you should be more excited about this and i think you just keyed in on that you re getting a chance not only to perhaps revisit some companies that you feel like might have gotten away but also probably add to some businesses that you already own that you ve maybe developed some more conviction along the way matt frankel one mistake i see people making is trying to time things like they ll say i don t want to buy paypal now because it might go down more which is definitely a valid point i don t want to add to block because it might go back down to the 80s like it was a couple of weeks ago don t try to time things it s always a good time to buy good businesses you have to be willing to look like an idiot in the short run if it makes you look like a genius in the long run i ll give you a perfect example of that back in march 2020 when the covid pandemic first started and there s tons of uncertainty in the market you probably remember me saying i was buying ryman hospitality because it so badly i ended up getting shares at about 14 a share i think was my cost basis it proceeded to go down another 20 percent finally bottoming it like 11 i looked like an idiot at that point i timed it poorly but today it s trading for about 90 a share so you have to be willing to get the timing issue out of your head because it s always possible that stocks could go down more if the situation in ukraine gets worse i would expect pretty much every stock in the market to go down more with the exception of maybe oil stocks you don t want to try to time it they can always go down further but it s always a good time to add good businesses for long term investing jason moser i like that and it really takes me back to something my father taught me when i was a teenager when he was first teaching me about investing and just the entire the concept of it he told me first things first he s like listen when you buy a stock you need to prepare for it to go down it s going to be lower than what you paid for he said you re never going to buy the bottom and you re never going to sell the top so just get used to that and don t worry about it he s right it takes some going through the motions it takes going through that to really become a believer i think it s one thing for us to sit here and say it but the benefit of going through times like these as an investor is it makes it easier the next time we go through them because the next time is inevitable it s not a matter of if it s a matter of when i want to go to that market timing point that you were making because i think that s a really good one we obviously talked about that a lot here at the motley fool and that s not i think necessarily just our philosophy i think a lot of folks out there believe in that as well but it takes me to a study that i found recently at bank of america a study on the s p 500 returns and it broke down returns by decade going back to 1930 it looked at the returns over the course of the decade but then it also took a closer look at if you excluded the worst 10 days per decade if you excluded the 10 best days per decade and then if you excluded the best and the worst 10 days per decade and it was just interesting to me to see how profound an impact this can have on returns so if you look at the decade from 2010 2020 the s p returns were 190 percent now if you exclude the worst 10 days in that decade your returns go to 351 percent that sounds like a great deal maybe we should start focusing on trying to time the market if the returns are going to be that significantly better the flipside of that coin is if you exclude the best 10 days per decade your returns all of a sudden sink down to 95 percent so you can see a profound impact on both sides of the coin there and ultimately this gets back to that point we re talking about a decade what do you think the chances are of actually picking those 10 days in over the course of a decade trying to pick those ten days over the course of a month i think would be challenging enough to do it over the course of a decade i think we all would agree it s impossible you re not going to able to do it there are additional costs that come with that there are taxes that you would have to consider there s opportunity cost of getting out potentially good ideas and into ideas that aren t necessarily as good but i think the ultimate point here is that while the numbers can make people perhaps want to time the market i think it s better to look at the bigger picture try to take this in a context and try to assess what do you think the chances actually are of executing that timing perfectly because i think you would agree too chances are pretty much zero matt frankel yes one cannot i ve incorrectly called the bottom of february about 10 times it s impossible to do and i have said this feels like a bottom probably about 10 times in february so it s not possible to do and you re more likely to lose out by being hesitant to pull the trigger than you are of gaining by trying to time the bottom jason moser now how do you view because i know that we ve seen the nasdaq i think growth stocks in particular if it felt a little bit more pain here than in others i know a lot of folks out there own a lot of these stocks and are probably feeling that pain along with us how do you view allocation when it comes to stable companies versus those highflier growth stocks maybe they re not profitable yet maybe they you got to look a little bit further down the road to really understand the potential there but how do you view asset allocation when you re looking at those stable companies versus the unprofitable riskier ideas matt frankel one of the good parts of having a portfolio of boring banks and real estate stocks in normal times is it gives me a lot of wiggle room to pursue the growth opportunities when times get rough but that aside i definitely think there needs to be some balance in your portfolio if you ve generally been a growth stock investor and you re getting clobbered and stuff like that maybe it s time to look at some high quality real estate stocks that haven t been beaten down or high quality bank stocks because those are starting to look very attractive right now because a lot of them have some exposure so it could be a great time to try to find some long term investments in an area you re not focused on in addition to picking up shares in some of your favorite companies that you have been focused on but there definitely needs to be some balance there s opportunities on both sides jason moser i tend to agree i ve said it before i feel like if you can own one of those nice stable companies for every highflier that you own i know in the near term it may not seem as sexy maybe you re not really benefiting from the tailwinds of those growth stocks that you may be hoping for but then honestly if you could own some of those stable companies it really does make the investing journey much easier it makes it really easy to sleep at night and it makes it a lot easier to stomach the volatility that we see during times like these i think there really is a lot of merit in trying to make sure that you re well diversified and focusing on stability to go with that growth it really does make investing i think a lot easier matt frankel one of the great parts about being willing to attack investing from all different sides is i have not had a day where my entire portfolio is down it just hasn t happened and that s because i diversify i look for the best opportunities regardless of growth value what sector things like that there s always going to be a winner somewhere and diversifying lets you find them jason moser why i like that matt i appreciate your insight today i m sure our listeners do as well thanks so much for taking the time it s good talking to you again matt frankel always good to be with you chris hill that s all for today but coming up tomorrow we ll have three stocks to put on your watchlist for inflationary times as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow
there s more to the electric car maker than just a disappointing 2022 outlook what happened shares of lucid group lcid 2 41 are crumbling just this week the electric vehicle ev stock was down 15 5 as of 12 30 p m et friday according to data provided by s p global market intelligence that drop in the stock price now means lucid shares have lost 41 5 already this year as of this writing blame lucid s underwhelming outlook for this week s loss so what lucid s fourth quarter earnings report was one of the most awaited in the ev industry the start up that made tesla sit up and take notice when it beat the ev leader s range rating was to report its first ever revenue from ev sales since going public in mid 2021 also investors were eagerly waiting to hear how many cars lucid had delivered since starting its deliveries in october last year and how fast the company was ramping up production contrary to expectations lucid delivered a bummer of a report on the evening of feb 28 and its stock crashed by a double digit percentage next morning here are four areas where lucid faltered revenue lucid generated 26 4 million in revenue in the fourth quarter but that missed wall street estimates by a huge margin lucid generated 26 4 million in revenue in the fourth quarter but that missed wall street estimates by a huge margin deliveries lucid delivered only 125 units of its debut sedan the air dream edition in 2021 in october lucid said it will build 520 dream editions and will start deliveries of its three other trim versions only after delivering all dream editions investors therefore expected to see much higher deliveries in fact even as of feb 28 lucid had yet to deliver almost 200 units lucid delivered only 125 units of its debut sedan the air dream edition in 2021 in october lucid said it will build 520 dream editions and will start deliveries of its three other trim versions only after delivering all dream editions investors therefore expected to see much higher deliveries in fact even as of feb 28 lucid had yet to deliver almost 200 units net loss the net loss more than tripled and crossed 1 billion in the fourth quarter the net loss more than tripled and crossed 1 billion in the fourth quarter production lucid cut its production estimate for 2022 drastically to a range of 12 000 to 14 000 units from its previous estimate of 20 000 units on the positive side lucid had secured more than 25 000 reservations as of feb 28 across all four models which can bring in more than 2 4 billion in sales if all reservations are converted into confirmed orders expansion at lucid s only factory situated in arizona is also on track and the ev maker announced it ll build a factory in saudi arabia this year this is an important development as it reassures saudi arabia s partners in the ev maker that nation s sovereign wealth fund the public investment fund is a major shareholder in lucid lucid s production cut though didn t go down well with investors and analysts who consider lucid as one of the promising ev start ups in the days following its earnings release at least two analysts downgraded their expectations for the stock including adam jonas from morgan stanley who cut his price target from 16 a share to 12 now what it s worth noting that lucid has so far stated supply concerns and not company specific problems as the major reason it expects low production this year a crunch in the supply of key inputs like semiconductor chips has hit nearly every automaker hard so if you re dumping your lucid shares in panic you might want to think again and keep an eye on bigger things like lucid s reservation numbers and the launch of other models so far its reservation growth is strong and it has also started manufacturing and delivering the grand touring trim a model it says is already seeing strong demand

new mexico increases focus on race in k 12 despite backlash original publication date march 04 2022 3 31 pm santa fe n m ap new mexico s k 12 students will see a greater focus on race and ethnicity including native american history in their curriculum over the next two years under new standards aimed at making social studies teaching more culturally responsive the new mexico public education department recently finalized the changes following months of debate that included pushback from parents worried their kids would be labeled racist the standards don t mandate specific lessons or textbooks but will require school districts to increase their focus on social identities and understanding the world through the lens of race class and privilege new mexico is the latest democratic led state to approve new public school standards amid a move toward more open discussion of race as in washington and new york the standards require students to identify and articulate their cultural identity starting in elementary school ethnic studies will now be part of the high school curriculum though not required for graduation as in california a dozen other states have passed laws to restrict topics related to race and gender over concerns particularly among the gop about critical race theory which has become a catch all term for identity politics in education in virginia the governor is looking to root out all traces of inherently divisive concepts some parents believe could make children feel as if they are racist because of their skin color in new mexico hundreds of parents teachers and grandparents weighed in for and against the proposed changes last fall officials heard public comments in thousands of letters and hundreds of appearances in an all day zoom forum supporters backed a closer look at the history of indigenous communities in the state and more discussion of race and identity at an earlier age the final rule published feb 16 rebutted some criticisms about identity and integrated a plea for including personal finance in the curriculum changes school districts will begin training teachers on the new standards next year and implement them in the classroom in the fall of 2023 it s the state s first overhaul of social studies standards since 2001 expanding sections in history geography civics and economics the new standards change the way native american histories are taught in the coming years students are more likely to study the state s 23 tribes on their own terms and more in depth in the past that history was cursory and focused on comparing and contrasting with european conquerors state education officials are also under pressure to make the k 12 school system more relevant to the 11 of students who are native american owing in part to an ongoing lawsuit a court ruled in 2018 that the state isn t meeting the educational needs of indigenous kids and the education department has yet to release a plan to address the issues laid out by the court and faces further litigation alisa diehl an education attorney at the new mexico center on law and poverty representing the plaintiffs calls changes to the social studies standards a first step toward providing a public education system that takes students cultures languages and life experiences into account as required by our statutes and constitution opponents of the new approach expressed fears that children would be labeled as victims or oppressors based on their race some commenters color coded the entire proposed rule identifying language that they saw as echoes of critical race theory including phrases like unequal power relations privilege or systemic inequity and requirements that students identify their group identity starting in kindergarten the agency also removed mentions of sexuality communism police brutality and gun violence following concerns raised by the public said gov michelle lujan grisham spokeswoman maddy hayden the agency decided to keep the privilege power and inequity language and even increased the instances of those terms in an effort to make the language consistent across different sections of the final rule in response to public comment the response to those criticisms stated that critical race theory is suited for graduate school level discussions and is not contained in the standards at the heart of the debate is whether discussing differences in the classroom hardens social divisions or softens them earlier this month republicans in the new mexico legislature proposed banning critical race theory they also proposed replacing leadership at the education department currently appointed by the governor with an elected board both measures failed in a letter to state education officials last week released wednesday republican leaders said they would advocate for districts to use wiggle room in the curriculum requirements to keep conservative textbooks and lesson plans they said education officials ignored public opposition the department had no real intention of making significant changes to the proposed standards which were clearly outside of the mainstream of new mexico s values and traditions the letter said the letter was signed by house republican leaders including rebecca dow of truth or consequences dow is one of three members of her party fighting in a primary to take on the sitting governor a democrat whether they fit all the definitions of critical race theory or not the new standards appear designed to divide new mexicans by race ethnicity and economic status said paul gessing president of the libertarian think tank rio grande foundation authors of the changes say identity has become a more important and more visible aspect of society and needs to be studied it s more like a deep exploration that there are identity differences that exist and that everybody is not always going to think the same but the level of respect for everybody s varying opinions is what we want to bring out in the classroom said irene barry an english teacher in aztec new mexico barry says the biggest changes in the social studies standards are an incremental introduction to social identity from k 12 and the expansion of civics and geography into high school the previous standards didn t focus on identity and wrapped up geography and civics in middle school education department leaders said removing the language advocated by barry and other teachers would devalue their work despite the many objections from the public voiced in comments you want to be respectful of them and their voice and the role they played in creating these education standards said gwen perea warniment deputy secretary of teaching learning and assessment for the education department in economics the agency responded to public comments with sweeping changes adding an entirely new section on personal finance following a letter campaign backed by a local education policy think tank by fifth grade students can be learning how to track spending and savings in high school standards include sections on understanding credit scores the consequences of credit cards and ways to build wealth with tools such as stocks savings and real estate new mexico now joins the 45 other states that include personal finance in their k 12 education standards which is an important first step to tackling intergenerational poverty said abenicio baldonado education reform director for think new mexico which promoted the letter campaign baldonado is advocating for personal finance to be required for high school graduation ___ this version has been corrected to reflect that the social studies standards were last overhauled in 2001 not 2009 it also has been updated with additional examples of changes

to a global shortage of computer chips and because some of their parts came from ukraine many wouldn t specify which parts are missing but volkswagen said it gets electrical wiring harnesses and numerous interior switches from ukraine in the auto business one missing part can halt production stellantis ceo carlos tavares said friday that the company closed a plant near moscow that it jointly operates with mitsubishi due to sanctions and lack of parts the supply chain is completely disrupted he told reporters the rest of the company he said has not been affected yet because it generally doesn t get parts from eastern europe if the war continues though more auto plants could close if companies find that some of their european parts suppliers get smaller components from ukraine or russia i m not excluding that because i know that with a longer pipe you can discover things a few days if not a few weeks later said tavares who leads the world s fourth largest automaker i will need

santa fe n m ap new mexico gov michelle lujan grisham wants to join other u s states in reconsidering public investments that might aid russia as it wages war against ukraine the democrat announced friday that she is urging the directors of the state s permanent funds and two major pension funds for public employees to examine investments that may benefit russia and its supporters and take steps to divest it is critical that the state of new mexico demonstrates its support for the people of ukraine and disclaim any investments that may directly or indirectly aid the russian government s unjustified war she said in a letter state sen jacob candelaria of albuquerque made a similar plea earlier this week the state investment council is in charge of managing more than 35 billion in investments on behalf of new mexico council spokesman charles wollmann said the state s exposure to russian stocks or bonds amounts to 7 9 million or about 0 025 of the state s portfolio the council sends out more than 12 times this amount to beneficiaries that include public schools and the state s general fund every month wollmann said some of the state s investments are in emerging market indexes which are now being restructured by their originators to remove russian stocks for other related investments the council could instruct external investment managers to make changes once russian markets reopen russian securities markets have been closed for several days halting trading still the council will likely have to discuss the governor s request as a matter of policy wollmann said the effect of sanctions by u s states often pales in comparison to national ones but officials from new york to arkansas and indiana have said they wanted to show solidarity with ukraine and do what they could to build upon the penalties imposed on russia by the u s government and other western nations

we felt daily welcome we supplied every day around 100 drones and users is civilian users users military users and everybody started to use these drones to find some enemies in our country and it s helpful and i know many examples when it s saved the life of our ukrainian people so we have drawn through thermal cameras from this guy and from another rep brands as well that used at night so we see the soldiers at night we see the tanks at night and for sure it s scary to use the drone in ukraine right now because it s a huge risk for your life that you will be detected and destroyed buy them so you have to follow some rules to avoid to be detected there constantly filming and so they re gathering video and then that video can be used in information warfare that video can be sent viral across youtube or instagram or twitter you name it the final thing that we haven t seen yet but we can expect it will happen is the same way that small civilian drones were used in wars like iraq jury rig arming them basically taking the small drone and mounting some kind of weapon on it um in iraq for example isis would mount hand grenades or mortar shells or homemade bombs onto the drone and then they fly it over and it would drop it with this kind of homemade dropping mechanism um some of them they turned them into like kamikaze drones so some of them for example d g i drones they don t go over 40 mph you re not going to use a fighter jet to shoot it down it would be hard even for a helicopter there also you know they re like literally this big so the responses to them range from you know old school using guns of some kind to what the u s military turned to was a variety of jammers and reportedly the russians have that kind of technology have seen images on their convoys civilian vehicles that are not just about drone jamming their cellphone jamming and we think this is going to be one of the things that they deploy into these cities as they also deploy the rest of their tanks and the like advertisement ukrainian drone enthusiasts sign up to repel russian forces share copy link copy in better times ukrainian drone enthusiasts flew their gadgets into the sky to photograph weddings fertilize soybean fields or race other drones for fun now some are risking their lives by forming a volunteer drone force to help their country repel the russian invasion kyiv needs you and your drone at this moment of fury read a facebook post late last week from the ukrainian military calling for citizens to donate hobby drones and to volunteer as experienced pilots to operate them one entrepreneur who runs a retail store selling consumer drones in the capital said its entire stock of some 300 drones made by chinese company dji has been dispersed for the cause others are working to get more drones across the border from friends and colleagues in poland and elsewhere in europe why are we doing this we have no other choice this is our land our home said denys sushko head of operations at kyiv based industrial drone technology company droneua which before the war was helping to provide drone services to farmers and energy companies sushko fled his home late last week after his family had to take cover from a nearby explosion he spoke to the associated press by phone and text message friday after climbing up a tree for better reception we try to use absolutely everything that can help protect our country and drones are a great tool for getting real time data said sushko who doesn t have a drone with him but is providing expertise now in ukraine no one remains indifferent everyone does what they can unlike the much larger turkish built combat drones that ukraine has in its arsenal off the shelf consumer drones aren t much use as weapons but they can be powerful reconnaissance tools civilians have been using the aerial cameras to track russian convoys and then relay the images and gps coordinates to ukrainian troops some of the machines have night vision and heat sensors but there s a downside dji the leading provider of consumer drones in ukraine and around the world provides a tool that can easily pinpoint the location of an inexperienced drone operator and no one really knows what the chinese firm or its customers might do with that data that makes some volunteers uneasy dji declined to discuss specifics about how it has responded to the war taras troiak a dealer of dji drones who started the kyiv retail store said dji has been sending mixed signals about whether it s providing preferential access to or disabling its drone detection platform aeroscope which both sides of the conflict can potentially use to monitor the other s flight paths and the communication links between a drone and the device that s controlling it dji spokesperson adam lisberg said wartime uses were never anticipated when the company created aeroscope to give policing and aviation authorities including clients in both russia and ukraine a window into detecting drones flying in their immediate airspace he said some users in ukraine have reported technical problems but dji has not disabled the tool or given preferential access in the meantime ukrainian drone experts said they ve been doing whatever they can to teach operators how to protect their whereabouts there are a number of tricks that allow you to increase the level of security when using them sushko said sushko said many in the industry are now trying to get more small drones including dji alternatives transported into ukraine from neighboring european countries they can also be used to assist search and rescue operations ukraine has a thriving community of drone experts some of whom were educated at the national aviation university or the nearby kyiv polytechnic university and went on to found local drone and robotics startups they ve got this homebuilt industry and all these smart people who build drones said faine greenwood a u s based consultant on drones for civic uses such as disaster response troiak s dji branded store in kyiv which is now shuttered as city residents take shelter was a hub for that community because it runs a maintenance center and hosts training sessions and a hobby club even the country s president volodymyr zelenskyy once paid a visit to the store to buy a drone for one of his children troiak said a public drone focused facebook group administered by troiak counts more than 15 000 members who have been trading tips about how to assist ukrainian troops one drone photographer who belongs to the ukrainian association of drone racing team told the associated press he decided to donate his dji mavic drone to the military rather than try to fly it himself he and others asked not to be named out of fear for their safety the risk to civilian drone operators inside ukraine is still great said australian drone security expert mike monnik locating the operator s location could result in directed missile fire given what we ve seen in the fighting so far it s no longer rules of engagement as we have had in previous conflicts in recent days russian language channels on the messaging app telegram have featured discussions on ways to find ukrainian drones monnik said some in ukraine s drone community already have experience deploying their expertise in conflict zones because of the country s long running conflict with russian backed separatists in eastern ukraine monnik s firm dronesec has tracked multiple instances just in the past year of both sides of that conflict arming small drones with explosives one thing that ukrainians said they ve learned is that small quadcopter drones such as those sold at stores are rarely effective at hitting a target with explosive payloads it would seem somewhat short sighted to waste one said greenwood the consultant based in cambridge massachusetts i assume the chief goal would be recon but if things are getting desperate who knows dji also has experience in responding to warfighters trying to weaponize its drones and used so called geofencing technology to block drone movements during conflicts in syria and iraq it s not clear yet if it will do the same in ukraine even if it does there are ways to work around it small civilian drones are no match against russian combat power but will likely become increasingly important in a protracted war leaving drone makers no option to be completely neutral any action they take or avoid is indirectly taking a side said pw singer a new america fellow who wrote a book about war robots we will see ad hoc arming of these small civilian drones much the way we ve seen that done in conflicts around the world from syria to iraq and yemen and afghanistan singer said just like an ied or a molotov cocktail they won t change the tide of battle but they will definitely make it difficult for russian soldiers ap video journalist nathan ellgren contributed to this report

how might the war in ukraine affect the relationship between russia and china perhaps the most important prospective big power alliance in the world the honest answer with a lot of these issues is it s such a black box that we don t really know china expert anthony saich said during a discussion of the subject thursday afternoon the daewoo professor of international affairs and director of the harvard kennedy school s ash center for democratic governance and innovation saich was interviewed by alexandra vacroux executive director of harvard s davis center for russian and eurasian studies a week into the fast moving crisis that saich said would realign the global order for some time to come their conversation touched on subjects from china s wheat imports to russia s implied nuclear threats to the taiwan question the fraught issue of china s designs on the island nation but again and again both kept returning to uncertainties and thorny contradictions in some ways saich said the war may bring russia and china closer together for reasons both economic and ideological as the sanctions imposed by the united states and european nations make trade with other large partners nearly impossible russia may begin to depend more heavily on china for imports of food and manufacturing parts and to sell its own exports especially food and energy already saich said after sanctions were first announced after the initial invasion china customs announced it was lifting the restrictions on russian wheat for example there are also measures about expanding pipeline capabilities for lgn coming into china but because china imports its oil supply the run up in international crude oil prices in response to the russian invasion will be costly for its economy but there is also reason for china to be cautious saich added especially as the sanctions deepen and widen the potential risk for china is being too closely identified with moscow s interests and getting sucked into the backlash chinese companies engaging with russia will have to be careful not to trigger penalties for themselves calling the relationship between china and russia largely transactional rather than a deeper partnership saich said it will be interesting to see how much china is willing to accommodate supporting russia moving forward a lot will depend on what happens subsequently in ukraine and the international response western nations decision to remove russian banks from the swift messaging network was probably a real shock for the leadership in beijing he added because china is so heavily integrated into global financial markets it s a 5 trillion engagement the west needs china in that sense but china also needs continual access to global financial markets the swift sanctions may wind up changing how the country holds its own financial reserves so that they do not suffer from that kind of vulnerability the chinese government is walking a difficult tightrope ideologically saich continued last week china abstained from voting on a united nations security council resolution condemning russia and on wednesday the new york times reported that xi jinping knew of vladimir putin s plans to invade ukraine and asked him to delay until the beijing olympics ended still saich said there are some signals from china s reaction that the severity of the russian movements caught them by surprise it s impossible to be sure but my suspicion he said is that probably putin told xi that he was going to move into the eastern parts of ukraine and that the operation would be quick it would be clean and it would be very quickly resolved saich noted the joint statement released by the two leaders when they met at the start of the olympics in early february which deepened the two countries diplomatic ties and asserted that the friendship between them has no limits that statement now puts china in a bind it s very difficult for any official agency to shift too far away from that narrative in some ways though he added china may not wish to shift the narrative in its official statements the country s foreign ministry has lamented the conflict called for a negotiated peace settlement and said it respects ukraine s sovereignty but it persistently continues with the view that this is the fault of the west saich said it can t bring itself to say this is an invasion it can t bring itself obviously to bring any critical notion of what russia is doing instead always buried in its comments is the question that this is the need for russia to have effective security on its borders and that what has destabilized this is not putin s actions but the eastward expansion of nato those statements lay particular blame on the united states whose relationship with china has deteriorated significantly in recent years so if we look at it from that perspective saich said china hasn t really changed its tune since it began responding to this toward the end of the discussion vacroux turned to the elephant in the room taiwan china perceives the island as a breakaway province that will eventually be reunified with the mainland taiwan sees itself as a separate and democratic country vacroux asked saich whether russia s war in ukraine and the west s intense reaction to it might alter chinese leaders calculus about taking action in taiwan i m not sure it changes the situation saich said the question does come up of course about how long they are willing to wait with this being pushed off into the future but i don t think there is any intention from beijing to invade taiwan it would be an almost impossible task it would probably be the end of the chinese communist party if they did because of the havoc caused by western economic sanctions and also the difficulty of maintaining the military presence required to repress a large island population in beijing clearly they do not think it s a linked issue between ukraine and taiwan ukraine is a sovereign country as far as beijing is concerned taiwan is not it s an integral part of the mainland so i think they don t want to draw those parallels that s why in the joint statement between russia and china taiwan was mentioned explicitly but ukraine was not finally saich offered three broad questions whose eventual answers might illuminate china s evolving relationship with russia as the ukraine crisis unfolds the first is whether china begins to veto united nations resolutions condemning russia rather than merely abstaining the second clear sign would be if putin installed a puppet government would beijing move to recognize it and how soon would it move to recognize it and third as it becomes ever clearer and unavoidable that civilians are being targeted and killed and cities attacked will china alter its refusal to label russia s actions as an invasion does the no limits in the joint statement have some bearing to this relationship moving forward or are we looking at a situation where china does not throw its lot in so obviously with russia to maintain some space for itself
as harvard emerges from a global pandemic that has upset work norms everywhere it faces its own questions about the kind of workplace it will become the university took a productive step when despite initial inclinations it largely maintained service workers pay and benefits as the coronavirus caused its campus to be depopulated and dining halls and dormitories to close in the spring of 2020 and into the next academic year doing so cost a reported 60 million a pittance relative to the budget and the reputational damage harvard would have incurred from laying off 2 800 employees and contract workers during a crisis not to mention an unexpected godsend once operations resumed given difficult hiring conditions now maintaining the service workforce was laudatory particularly as professional staff members could work from home or even more idyllic settings but as normal life resumes how will the university navigate the disparity between those who must work in person and those who have the latitude to fulfill their obligations from afar addressing these issues is a universal conundrum of course but residential colleges and universities aren t just like other places most people here maintain that in person instruction technologically enhanced to be sure trumps all remote education that living studying and pursuing extracurriculars together advance students civic intellectual and moral development and that scholars probing the frontiers of knowledge benefit mightily from direct interactions some staff members have to be proximate to support this activity dining hall workers aren t going to feed the resident population remotely nor can grounds and facilities personnel run this magnificent campus by drone these are of course the very people who are most exposed to risks of a pandemic or of traveling to work during blizzards and who are at the bottom of the university payscale clearly the people who analyze spreadsheets or review invoices are not similarly constrained they might well like to work for harvard but from a place where housing is cheaper and commuting does not elevate blood pressure in that light the arguments seem simple accommodate remote work hire great people wherever they may be and repurpose university offices or shed leases to cut costs not so fast given the residential academic mission and the character of the university s workforce there are real if soft costs to separating the staff into those able to toil from anywhere and those required to be present further privileging those who work in offices compared to those who do not seems likely to divide staff members from one another unnecessarily as for the culture of the place so long as harvard remains a residental operation it ought to want every team member to embrace the mission given the choice between say a financial analyst who wants to be immersed in the community and one who would rather run excel from the exumas the university ought to perceive the value in the former that won t show up in a cell on a spreadsheet as office costs surely will but it is a real value nonetheless ignore it and bit by bit the culture of the place will be diminished nor is remote work the only cultural issue concerning the terms of employment to emerge during the pandemic the boston globe reported extensively on the corporate board service of leaders of area hospitals many of them harvard affiliated teaching institutions such cases can pose conflicts a hospital president and moderna director profiting from moderna stock sales as the staff worked on clinical trials of the company s coronavirus vaccine that could erode public confidence in the integrity of the research they also raise conflicts of commitment the leader of an academic medical center ought to have plenty to do without outside board meetings and of culture running a nonprofit institution for which one receives a seven figure salary plus collecting fees for outside board service that easily outstrip the compensation of highly skilled nurses medical technicians and others delivering critical coronavirus care and who face simultaneous salary and benefits freezes harvard doesn t control its affiliates governance but it should hope for better awareness of these concerns and better examples for its medical students doing their clinical training on the hospitals premises like the hospitals harvard is a big and complicated place to run one that provides enough challenges and moments of excitement wanted and not one would think to engage any academic leader it pays decently for the work the president earns about 1 million the provost 750 000 and so on that s less than some other higher education institutions pay and certainly less than such talents could make in other roles but plenty for a someone dedicated to the mission of a premier nonprofit university perhaps the university should now assess the issues of culture and commitment that arise as it happens like the healthcare executives some senior harvard leaders have joined corporate boards during the past decade given the circumstances perhaps the university like the hospitals should now assess the issues of culture and commitment that arise as a result even assuming that its executives are highly energetic service on an outside board faithfully performed takes time and mental effort and can understandably be seen as a diversion from the demands of leading harvard and within the enterprise which has taken some commendable steps to be progressive about compensation charging employees with higher salaries more for health benefits and to avoid the excesses that have arisen elsewhere the fees for board service can rankle during times of financial strain the fallout from the 2009 crisis the year after the pandemic began the university imposed wage freezes on its nonunion workers at times like that the six figure board fees don t help tending to harvard s culture matters as much as caring for its other assets people facilities endowments to ensure its future the past two years highlighted some of those strengths but also vulnerabilities as leaders of an exceptional place in all senses of the word the university s fiduciaries might proceed gingerly in the months ahead making sure that harvard learns the right lessons and not just the expedient ones as it emerges from the pandemic justifiably proud

the center square inflation has risen steadily since president joe biden took office and his new plan to fight rising prices has been met with skepticism by critics biden vowed to fight inflation during his state of the union address by pushing a buy american agenda one way to fight inflation is drive down wages and make americans poorer biden said i have a better way to fight inflation lower your costs not your wages biden emphasized the role of the supply chain not soaring federal spending as the cause of inflation we re going to make more cars and semiconductors in america biden said more infrastructure innovation in america more goods moving faster and cheaper in america more jobs that you can earn a living a good living by here in america instead of relying on foreign supply chains let s make it in america again the consumer price index has risen the fastest in 40 years with food and energy costs among the most affected gas prices have risen about 1 from the same time last year the president found a lot of boogiemen to blame for the steepest inflation in 40 years including businesses to whom he instructed lower your costs not your wages said joel griffith an economic expert at the heritage foundation the inflation scourge and supply shortages evidenced by sparse shelves and lengthy delivery times stems from the senseless covid 19 restrictions that suppressed production wreaked havoc on transportation networks and kept millions of workers off the job griffith acknowledged the supply shortages role in inflation but pointed to something biden did not focus on in his speech skyrocketing federal debt spending meanwhile our federal government stoked demand at a time of plunging supply by spending trillions of dollars he said the federal reserve aided much of this spending by purchasing government bonds with newly printed money and directed yet more new money into the housing and financial markets it s no surprise that artificially reduced supply combined with a system awash in newly minted cash is stoking sky high inflation biden has taken fire for his covid 19 relief bill in particular it cost nearly 2 trillion and created federal unemployment benefits that reports show increased unemployment predictably mr biden assigned no blame to his excessively large american rescue plan for stoking inflation by providing the country with its largest peacetime budget stimulus on record at a time that monetary policy was very loose and the economy was recovering strongly said desmond lachman an economic expert at the american enterprise institute he also offered very little in the way of policies to get the inflation genie back into the bottle other than offering to release a minimum amount of oil from the u s strategic stockpile encourage companies to buy american pass parts of his build back better program and adopt cost cutting measures in selected sectors of the economy critics of biden s buy american push said it will not fix the problem of inflation and may make it worse any attempt to tame inflation through buy america policies is unlikely to succeed said colin grabow an economic expert at the cato institute as president biden himself stated in his state of the union address the best way to lower costs is through increased competition but policies that discourage or prohibit americans from purchasing foreign products or incorporating other countries into supply chains are the precise opposite of that restricting the ability of americans to source foreign products is a restriction on competition it is not a coincidence that the low inflation enjoyed by americans in recent decades has correlated with increased global economic integration and the vigorous competition it has produced biden said solving this issues is a top priority but we know that despite this historic recovery too many families are still struggling with higher costs he said i get it our top priority must be getting prices under control success an email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup error there was an error processing your request get our free newsletters never miss a headline with northcentralpa com newsletters sign up today morning headlines would you like to receive our daily morning newsletter afternoon update what s happening today here s your update daily obits get a daily list straight to your email inbox

crude oil s price surge has historically been associated with recessions nothing works better than a historical chart to illustrate my point here a 47 price surge in brent and a 48 increase in wti this year alone will become a substantial drag on the us and global economy this year have a look at this chart from pictet using the real oil price and if you have any doubts look at this historical chart from goldman sachs noting the recessions are shaded below the price line for crude oil i hope that you can see the shading also as we know russian oil sales are increasingly under an embargo in all but name threatening a vital source of global crude supply while there are currently no sanctions in place preventing companies from purchasing the nation s crude buyers are refusing to take it and tanker companies are unwilling to ship it refineries are racing to secure alternative supplies from other markets pushing some gauges in the futures market to the strongest in years such as the front futures spreads in fact brent and wti timespreads surged to unprecedented levels yesterday and remain so today with most gauges over the next 12 months the strongest since at least 2007 the market has moved into super backwardation with m1 m6 spreads trading above 15 today options markets were sent into a frenzy amid the huge price gyrations brent prices passed through 100 for june bringing almost 40k contracts into the money while call skews were some of the biggest on record while equities rally investment grade corporates cds spreads keep widening i know which side i choose to take tina to the us dollar as the reserve currency if the last dozen years or so has taught us anything about markets and the economy it s that anything can happen no matter how unlikely the us housing market was considered as solid an investment as there ever was because prices never fell nationally until the subprime crisis came along the idea that the european union would ever come close to breaking apart and taking the euro with it was unthinkable until greece defaulted and everyone knew that inflation like that of the late 1970s was never coming back until the pandemic snarled supply chains worldwide so it s natural that a sort of cottage industry has sprung up in the last decade or so trying to anticipate the next so called black swan event that could upend the global economy and markets right on cue there is a growing concern that perhaps russia s invasion of ukraine could mark the beginning of a turning point for the us dollar and not for the good as recently espoused by credit suisse s zoltan pozsar the thinking is that the us has weaponized the dollar through heavy financial sanctions imposed on russia including preventing that country s central bank from accessing its foreign currency reserves as such so the thought process goes it may make less and less sense for global reserve managers to hold dollars for safety given that they could be taken away right when they re most needed make no mistake any such move away from the dollar would have earth shattering consequences the dollar has been the world s reserve currency since the us and its allies agreed at the 1944 bretton woods conference to peg it to a rate of 35 per ounce of gold according to the imf the dollar s share of global reserves stands at 59 far above the euro at 20 5 after the euro there s a steep drop to the no 3 slot which is occupied by japan s yen at 5 83 as the world s primary reserve currency the us enjoys the exorbitant privilege that goes along with that such as interest rates that are lower than they might otherwise be and the government being able to fund budget deficits in perpetuity see footnote on triffin s dilemma at the end of this article to consider how difficult it is to come up with a viable alternative to the dollar consider china s yuan the euro doesn t count given how close the european union came to breaking up over its debt crisis a decade ago plus it s more of a monetary union than a fiscal one the asian nation which has the world s second largest economy after the us has spent a lot of time and effort over the past decade trying to make the yuan a viable alternative to the dollar and yet less than 3 of the world s foreign exchange reserves are denominated in yuan on top of that only about 3 of global transactions are conducted in yuan compared with 40 for the dollar according to swift the messaging service that facilitates the vast majority of money transfers globally the benefit to holding reserves in dollars is that us markets are so much deeper and more liquid than any other at 23 trillion the us treasury market is more than double the size of japan s government bond market and even if you wanted to buy jgbs you probably couldn t because the bank of japan owns a vast majority of them so much so that no trading is done in the jgb market on some days as for europe the uk france italian and german bond markets are all less than 3 trillion in size foreign holdings of u treasuries have soared to 7 74 trillion from around 1 trillion at the start of the century according to the us treasury department and while america s politics and brand of democracy can seem messy at times especially lately foreign investors do take comfort in the country s strict adherence to the rule of law that draws capital from all around the world in good times and bad although global foreign direct investment flows surged 77 to an estimated 1 65 trillion in 2021 the us experienced an even bigger jump of 114 to 323 billion according to the un conference on trade and development the dollar s share of global currency reserves has slowly eroded over the years dropping from around 73 in 2001 but the current level is still up from the low of around 45 going back to the early 1960s and although the rise in cryptocurrencies offers bad actors another option to park their money out of the reach of regulators and other authorities no country of consequence is going to attempt to park their reserves in bitcoin indeed that is the point as long as the world does not suddenly see a string of bad actors launch megalomaniacal attacks on their neighbors they don t really have to worry about having their dollar assets frozen the sanctions on russia are extraordinary because russia s misbehavior under vladimir putin is extraordinary of course nothing is forever but it can sure seem like it in the forex market before the dollar the british pound was the world s dominant currency having held the crown throughout the 1800s until world war ii by that measure the dollar has a long way to go before being toppled the simple fact is there is no alternative tina footnote the economist robert triffin gained enormous influence by reviving the interwar story that gold scarcity threatened deflation in particular he held that central banks needed to accumulate claims on the us to back money growth but the claims would eventually surpass the us gold stock and then central banks would inevitably stage a run on it he feared that the resulting high us interest rates would cause global deflation however the us gold position after wwii was no worse than the uk position in 1900 yet it took wwi to break sterling s gold link and better and feasible us policies could have kept bretton woods going this history serves as a backdrop to two later extensions of triffin one holds that the dollar s reserve role required us current account deficits this current account triffin is popular but anachronistic and flawed in logic and fact nevertheless it pops up in debates over the euro s and the yuan s reserve roles a fiscal triffin holds that global demand for safe assets will either remain dangerously unsatisfied or force excessive us fiscal debt less flawed this story posits implausibly inflexible demand for and supply of safe assets thus these stories do not convince in their own terms moreover each lacks triffin s clear cross over point from a stable system to an unstable one triffin s seeming predictive success leads economists to wrap his brand around dissimilar stories yet triffin s dilemma in its most general form correctly points to the conflicts and difficulties that arise when a national currency plays a role as an international public good rates market volatility is at unsustainable levels being headline driven i have regularly mentioned how the fed can no longer suppress volatility given the shift to a tightening bias and what should be a significant one at that given my macro background i was referring to all markets not just the vix so let s look at the interest rate market using yesterday s closing levels the risk reward has worsened for owning rates volatility which is at elevated levels that are unsustainable over time the timing for vol to decline remains tricky given the geopolitical threats and uncertainty around the outlook which can support realized volatility coupled with poor liquidity conditions while i expect this year to be more volatile it may be less than what is currently priced when viewed on a terminal basis the vol surface is dislocated with the term structure inverted across tenors and imbalance with the left side short tenors much higher than the right side while the fed seems to be sticking to the playbook for now

institute for the study of war russia team with the critical threats project aei march 4 2022 isw published its most recent russian campaign assessment at 3 00 pm est on march 4 this daily synthetic product covers key events related to renewed russian aggression against ukraine key takeaways march 4 russian forces have advanced rapidly on the eastern outskirts of kyiv likely from the sumy axis and may attempt to encircle and or attack the capital on the east bank of the dnipro in the coming 24 48 hours russian troops did not press a ground offensive against kharkiv in the last 24 hours but have instead diverted forces to the west and southeast likely supporting efforts against kyiv and in and around donbas respectively russian troops have surrounded mariupol and are attacking it brutally to destroy it or compel its capitulation russian forces have renewed their ground advance on mykolayiv having secured kherson city likely to set conditions for a further attack toward odesa russian naval infantry are likely poised to conduct amphibious landings near odesa when russian forces have secured or are close to securing a reliable ground route from crimea to odesa the kremlin dramatically limited russia s already isolated domestic information environment and criminalized unfavorable coverage of the war in ukraine on march 4 setting conditions to improve the domestic efficacy of its information operations ukraine is attempting to increase the flow of information about russia s invasion of ukraine to russian citizens to increase domestic russian opposition to the war the kremlin set conditions to justify potential russian conscriptions and more aggressive operations in ukraine the russian defense ministry said foreign citizens fighting for ukraine will not be considered legal combatants and will not be protected under international law belarusian president alexander lukashenko reiterated that belarus will not enter the war in ukraine but has likely already committed belarusian troops nato rejected ukraine s request to establish a no fly zone over ukraine russia has not yet followed through on its agreement with ukraine to establish the humanitarian corridors that would enable civilian supply and evacuation the us department of defense established a deconfliction line with its russian counterpart to prevent accidental escalation near the ukrainian and belarusian borders finland and sweden continued high level discussions on nato membership and multilateral defense measures key events march 3 4 00 pm est march 4 4 00 pm est military events the russian military has concentrated considerable combat power around mariupol to encircle and ultimately seize or destroy it the purpose of this effort is not entirely clear the capture or destruction of mariupol will not likely materially affect the outcome of the war whose decisive operations are more than 600 kilometers northwest around kyiv russian forces have also renewed their ground offensive west from crimea toward odesa currently focusing on advancing from kherson to mykolayiv and seized the zaporizhya nuclear power plant north of crimea the continued pursuit of objectives along three diverging axes by the same group of forces in crimea has hindered the russian military s ability to generate decisive effects on any of the three russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time 1 main effort kyiv russian operations on the kyiv axis consist of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and supporting efforts along the chernihiv and sumy axes to encircle it from the northeast and east russian forces are continuing their grinding effort to envelop kyiv from the west making limited gains but continuing to suffer notable setbacks the russians have been more successful in their advance on kyiv from the east especially on the axis from sumy via konotop and nyzhin russian forces are unlikely to complete the encirclement of kyiv on the west side without significant reinforcements as long as ukrainian defenses continue to hold as they have done over the past few days russian forces have focused on sumy rather than on their chernihiv axis over the last 24 hours the rapid advance of russian forces on the sumy axis will likely slow as russian troops enter the more built up and congested areas of eastern kyiv and its suburbs 2 supporting effort 1 kharkiv russian forces around kharkiv appear to have focused on continued bombardment of the city combined with drives to the east and west bypassing it in support of other efforts rather than attempting to take it russian troops have not encircled the city or launched renewed ground offensives against it in the past 24 hours the likelihood of a renewed russian ground offensive to take kharkiv in the next 24 48 hours is unclear as is the likely outcome of any such attempt russian forces for now appear to be de emphasizing the seizure of kharkiv itself in favor of supporting other efforts 3 supporting effort 2 mariupol russian forces still encircle mariupol and are continuing an artillery rocket and missile barrage on the city while concentrating ground forces likely in preparation to seize and secure it within the next 24 48 hours russian and proxy forces will likely secure and or destroy mariupol within the coming days 4 supporting effort 3 kherson and advances westward russian forces have taken advantage of having consolidated control of kherson city to launch a renewed offensive toward the city of mykolayiv which houses the headquarters of the ukrainian navy ukrainian efforts to stop the renewed russian advance have had limited success thus far although it remains to be seen how well russian forces will be able to retain their momentum as they enter the dense and congested areas of mykolayiv itself russian ground forces likely must secure most of mykolayiv city if they are to secure a key bridge to establish a reliable ground line of communication between crimea and odesa russian naval infantry may be waiting for ground forces to secure mykolayiv s bridge before attempting an amphibious landing near odesa russian forces attacked and captured the zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant and surrounding areas after a firefight with ukrainian forces that caused a fire resulting in a damaged nuclear reactor the kremlin falsely blamed ukraine for attacking russian forces near the plant russian forces seized ukraine s zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a direct assault on march 4 causing a fire in the nuclear complex the kremlin likely targeted the plant to gain the ability to shut down a substantial portion of ukraine s electrical grid zaporizhzhia supplies about half of ukraine s total electricity the kremlin attempted to deflect international outrage by falsely reframing the incident as a dangerous ukrainian attack on a russian controlled facility while ukrainian leadership leveraged the russian aggression to call for additional nato intervention in the conflict plant status more than half of ukraine s nuclear reactors are offline after russian forces seized the zaporizhzhia powerplant on march 4 international atomic energy agency iaea director general rafael grossi said in a march 4 press conference that there was no radiation release or damage to the reactors grossi stated that no security or safety systems have been compromised near the reactors themselves and that technical operations are continuing normally russian forces took control of zaporizhzhia on march 4 the head of nuclear power generator energoatom petro kotin claimed via a march 4 telegram that russian forces are forcing zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant employees to work at gunpoint russian framing russian ministry of defense spokesperson maj gen igor konashenkov falsely claimed that a ukrainian sabotage group attacked a mobile patrol of the russian guard adjacent to the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the early morning of march 4 resulting in a firefight and set fire to the facility as they fled the fire sparked international alarm after it caused a fire in the administrative building and the training center resulting in damage to the structure of the reactor compartment and one of six reactors konashenkov falsely claimed that the nuclear plant had been under russian control since february 28 and russia claimed to have secured enerhodar on march 2 konashenkov again claimed around 4 35 am local time on march 4 that russian forces took control of enerhodar city the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the territory adjacent to it russian forces likely forced enerhodar mayor dmytro orlov to release under duress an awkward march 4 video stating that russian forces did not fire live rounds at ukrainian civilians and that any rounds people may have heard or seen were blanks unconfirmed march 4 reports described russian forces patrolling the streets of enerhodar and destroying caches of molotov cocktails ukrainian framing ukrainian officials confirmed russia s seizure of zaporizhzhia to the new york times on march 4 ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy accused russia of conducting a premediated terror attack that involved intentionally firing at nuclear reactors on march 4 the ukrainian ministry of internal affairs reported that 90 russian units belonging to chechen leader ramazan kadyrovwith amassed near enerhodar with thermal imagers and night vision gear prior to the engagement workers at the power plant allegedly told ukrainian media that chechen forces control the nuclear facility as of march 4 and have placed explosives near the reactors isw cannot independently confirm those claims ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky reiterated his request to nato to implement a no fly zone over ukraine and said that only a closed sky over ukraine would guarantee russia would not bomb nuclear installations ukrainian ministry of internal affairs official vadim denisenko stated at 3 28 pm local time on march 4 that ukraine still controls zaporizhzhia and the ukrainian flag remains above the city council building but that russian forces control the perimeter of zaporizhzhia denisenko s claim that ukraine still controls zaporizhzhya is likely false russian activity the kremlin dramatically limited russia s already isolated domestic information environment and criminalized unfavorable coverage of the war in ukraine on march 4 setting conditions to improve the domestic efficacy of its information operations russia could also leverage the information blackout to commit additional atrocities in ukraine without further eroding domestic russian support of the invasion russian mass media censor roskomnadzor blocked several western media outlets for spreading fake news on march 4 the blocked sites include facebook twitter voice of america bbc deutsche welle meduza and radio free europe the

of which help migrants and refugees on march 4 russian forces announced that they had liberated the so called kherson people s republic on march 4 as russia seized control of local media outlets the

tower broadcasting ukrainian stations to disseminate pro russia propaganda and disinformation in kherson ukraine on march 3 russian forces broadcasted 24 russian tv channels and 3 radio stations that promoted russians as liberators of kherson on march 3 russian forces likely took kherson based ukrainian channels offline to monopolize the information environment and more effectively control the local population the kremlin set conditions to justify potential russian conscriptions and more aggressive russian operations against ukraine on march 4 russia the kremlin emphasized that the west may be planning nuclear provocations against russia that would force russia to respond setting conditions for a false flag operation to justify additional demands on the russian population and to stoke
