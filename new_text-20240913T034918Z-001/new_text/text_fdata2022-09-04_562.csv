demand destruction requires higher for longer the dji is down 2 000 points since powell made it perfectly clear in his august 26 jackson hole speech that the fed is determined to do whatever it takes to bring inflation back down to 2 regardless of the combination of factors which caused it to rise substantially above the fed s target the market has acquired greater respect for the fed s resolve to continue tightening financial conditions in an attempt to crimp demand as a result the us dollar index has surged to new 20 year highs interest rates are higher across the curve the 2 year treasury yield is at a 15 year high and real rates have surged to their highest level in three years the leading american stock indices have all given back 60 of the gains made during the mid june to mid august rally when the prevailing sentiment was that peak fed had been reached at the mid june fomc meeting currencies the us dollar has been smoking hot against virtually all currencies since the summer of 2021 the british pound is at a 35 year low against the us dollar the japanese yen is at a 24 year low and the euro is at a 20 year low here s a chart courtesy of martin murenbeeld of a usd index made up of only those three currencies the usd soared to the 1985 high during ronald regan s first term and on the back of volker s monetary policy here s a chart of the adxy an index of asian currencies showing the usd s pervasive strength the weakness of the asian currencies helps asian countries maintain substantial trade surpluses with the usa the canadian dollar ended august at its lowest monthly close against the usd in two years the primary driver of cad weakness since june 2021 has been the ultra strong usd the cad has a historically high correlation with commodities which have been in an uptrend since april 2020 but since last june when the cad was at a 6 year high against the usd the ultra strong usd has trumped the cad commodity correlation the cad still gets a massive boost from strong commodity markets the cad is at a 10 year high against the euro a 14 year high against the yen and a 37 year high against the british pound first signs of monthly exhaustion in the dollar my long time friend and excellent technical analyst ross clark published a report this week noting that the usdx is starting september with an upside exhaustion alert there have been five previous examples since 1970 and each time the usdx has made a minor top within a month corrected and then made new highs i highly recommend ross to my readers gold gold has struggled despite the highest inflation in years mainly because the usd and real interest rates have soared the last time the tips yield was at current levels march 2020 the gold price was 1 500 the last time the us dollar index dxy was at current levels june 2002 the gold price was 300 silver and gdx the gold miners etf traded at 2 year lows this week interest rates bond yields registered historic lows in august 2020 the 10 year yield hit a low of 0 50 but yields have been rising sharply this year with the 10 year yield hitting 3 25 this week it briefly touched 3 5 in mid june the 60 40 problem stocks and bonds have been falling ytd which is a problem for the classic 60 40 stock bond portfolio the bank of america reports that the classic combo is down 19 ytd on track for the worst annual performance since 1936 energy european natgas futures which had soared this summer tumbled sharply this week nymex gasoline futures hit all time highs in june but have fallen 40 trading this week at levels last seen before the russian invasion of ukraine wti crude oil futures closed this week at their lowest levels since january down 33 from the highs made immediately following the russian invasion and subsequent western sanctions against russia the energy heavy goldman sachs commodity index closed this week down 24 from its march 2022 highs right on the significant uptrend line from the 2020 lows are energy shares historically cheap relative to the broad market even as energy itself is historically expensive perhaps esg mandates have restricted capital flows into the energy sector d ya think last week i noted that canada has the lowest natgas prices in the world mainly because we have no lng export facilities a subscriber sent me this link to a terrific article by david yager dated august 30 2020 which takes an in depth look at the natgas market in canada it s a 10 minute read and pulls no punches i highly recommend it my short term trading i was long t notes at the end of last week and was stopped out of that position when the market re opened sunday afternoon i bought the t notes a couple of hours after powell s jackson hole speech noting that both the long and the ultra long bond futures were green on the day i took that to mean that the bond market saw powell s resolve to fight inflation as good for bonds even if it meant pushing the economy into a recession i was wrong bond prices tumbled monday to thursday and i was glad to have been stopped for a slight loss as bonds tumbled monday to thursday so did the stock market continuing the route that had begun last friday following powell s speech by thursday s low the s p futures were down 300 points from last friday s highs the djia was down 1 800 points and when the market rallied back from thursday morning lows and took out the floor session opening highs i bought the s p futures i liked the hammer daily chart pattern in a highly oversold market the market continued to rally into thursday s close and i kept my position knowing that early friday morning s employment report could cause the market to make a big move up or down the market was very volatile friday morning following the report but continued higher and by later that morning my trade was ahead by 70 points given that the market had digested the employment report and had traded 120 points above the thursday lows i raised my stop to a point where i thought if the market drops to here after the big gains it made earlier today i don t want to stay long another influence on where i placed my stop was my desire to try to lengthen my trading time frames over the past few months i felt i had been pulled into becoming a day trader because of the wild price swings across markets but i wanted to get away from that i thought i had a better edge with a swing trading time frame a few days to a few weeks i did not raise my stop to a level that had any relationship to my entry point i was not trying to ensure that at worst i would break even on the trade about three hours after the floor session began the market topped and fell quickly my stop was hit about two hours later and the trade resulted in a slight loss the market continued to drop as much as 115 points from the day s highs the story was that the russians had indefinitely suspended natgas exports to europe but it did not take out thursday s low i was frustrated with the loss and remembered my recent rule about taking quick profits if i was in a counter trend trade and staying with a trade if i was trading in line with the trend that rule seemed at odds with my desire to get away from day trading so i overrode it to stay with the trade for longer i shrugged off the loss remembering that years ago a veteran trader had told me that markets try to teach you bad habits for instance if you are tired of getting stopped and decide to quit using stops when the market bounced off the intraday lows without taking out thursday s low i re established the position and kept it into the weekend on my radar we ve got a 3 day weekend and many times over the years i ve seen markets come back with a bang after labor day meaning that we may see severe reversals of the stories and the price action from late summer i ve been in a semi summer holiday mode for two weeks and i m looking forward to trading more aggressively this fall the barney report barney and i were in the ocean wednesday he was scheduled for his visit with the vet on thursday and i expected he would be restricted from swimming for at least the next two weeks so we took the opportunity to go for a swim we were on a giant sand bar in about three feet of water so barney needed to swim if i threw the ball for him to fetch we stopped playing fetch for a minute and barney stood on his hind legs to look around he held that position for a good minute much to my amazement he looked terrific standing there and i didn t have my cell to get a photo he developed a taste for blackberries on our recent forest walks he will bite them off the vine but prefers if papa picks them for him his surgery was routine but instead of having to wear the cone of shame the vet gave him a one piece suit to wear to keep him from licking the incision my wife calls it a muscle shirt and barney has taken it in stride a request if you like reading the trading desk notes please forward a copy or a link to a friend also i genuinely welcome your comments and please let me know if you d like to see something new in the td notes listen to victor talk about markets i ve had a regular weekly spot on mike campbell s

nicholas wright introduction the toronto based franco nevada nyse fnv released its second quarter of 2022 results on august 10 2022 note i have been covering fnv quarterly on seeking alpha since mars 2017 this article is an update of my preceding article published on may 9 2022 franco nevada owns 413 assets worldwide fnv map presentation franco nevada presentation 1 2q22 quick snapshot franco nevada came out with adjusted quarterly earnings of 1 02 per share or 195 8 million beating analysts expectations the company generated 352 3 million in the second quarter up 1 5 from last year s same quarter metals production was lower than a year ago with 131 574 geos sold compared with 145 937 geos last year higher contributions from hemlo gold quarry and subika ahafo were not enough to offset lower deliveries from antamina guadalupe goldstrike and stillwater however this quarter s energy revenues were very high and reached 91 5 million the company sold 191 052 geos in 2q22 including the

company is highly dependent on the gold price representing 54 13 of the total revenues in 2q22 the energy sector is growing significantly and now represents 30 2 stock performance as i have indicated for years franco nevada is one of my most significant long term investments in the streaming sector followed closely by wheaton precious metals wpm the company s fundamentals are flawless with no debt and a cash position of 910 6 million up strongly quarter over quarter data by ycharts fnv has followed its competitor wheaton precious metals closely fnv is down 14 on a one year basis whereas wpm is

risk profile with 91 of assets owned located in the americas fnv assets presentation by region franco nevada presentation however one recurring disappointment is the lack of a decent dividend with a

with resistance at 134 0 and support at 123 65 the trading strategy for this quarter has not changed since my preceding article the dominant strategy that i regularly encourage in my marketplace the gold and oil corner is to keep a core long term position and use about 25 35 to trade lifo while waiting for a higher final price target for your core position trading lifo allows you to sell your most recent purchases with a profit while keeping your long term position often underwater until the stock has appreciated enough to consider selling your core position i suggest buying fnv below 127 7 with potential lower support at 120 conversely it is reasonable to take profits between 133 5 and 134 with higher resistance at 141 2 note the lifo method is prohibited under international financial reporting standards ifrs though it is permitted in the united states to generally accepted accounting principles gaap therefore only us traders can apply this method those who cannot trade lifo can use an alternative by setting two different accounts for the same stock one for the long term and one for short term trading warning the ta chart must be updated frequently to be relevant it is what i am doing in my stock tracker the chart above has a possible validity of about a week remember the ta chart is a tool only to help you adopt the right strategy it is not a way to foresee the future no

the u s jobs report indicates there might be a bumpy road ahead for major cryptocurrencies what happened the general sluggishness in top cryptocurrencies over the past few days was extending into the weekend on saturday afternoon both bitcoin btc 5 36 which continues to hover around the psychologically important 20 000 barrier was down slightly over 1 over the preceding 24 hours the no 2 coin ethereum eth 6 00 was falling at a deeper rate of 1 8 so what many alt asset investors are looking for macroeconomic signs that favor cryptocurrencies and they re not getting them friday morning the government s labor department released its latest monthly jobs report this revealed that the u s economy added 315 000 jobs in august although that was the lowest figure since april 2021 it wasn t far from many economists estimates it also indicated that the american labor market continues to tighten a dynamic that could drive up wages and thus exacerbate inflation in that case the federal reserve would continue or even accelerate its policy of raising interest rates to tame inflation and as interest rates rise the lure of defensive investments like blue chip stocks and various flavors of bonds increase as we ve seen this can freeze out assets taken to be more speculative and for many the leading exhibit in the gallery of speculative assets is cryptocurrencies now what taken together bitcoin and ethereum provide a major bellwether for the sentiment on cryptocurrencies in general not surprisingly numerous other coins and tokens fell along with them on saturday or traded sideways we can expect that trend to continue as long as there are few economic signals at least weakly flashing green for that asset class

over the course of 175 years and more than 2 million pages of newsprint it s no surprise the lewiston falls journal and its successors have on occasion gotten some things wrong sometimes egregiously so for instance consider the lewiston evening journal s august 1972 take on watergate an incident that must be rated as trivial compared to the major issues that should be the focal point of attention during the 1972 presidential campaign when richard nixon who won the race resigned in disgrace from the presidency two years later the journal s editorial stood out as notably off the mark but shortsighted is one thing unforgiveable is quite another from 1900 through the 1930s the journal backed a movement mired in the pseudo science of eugenics which led followers to conclude that bettering the human race required active steps to prevent some people from having children the newspaper at times endorsed involuntary sterilization and flirted with the notion of having the government murder people to prevent them from having sex and potentially bring children into the world who might share qualities the movement frowned on such as intellectual disabilities or addiction to liquor advertisement the lewiston newspaper wasn t alone in its support for the real life application of eugenics theory the ideas pushed by eugenics adherents proved so popular that many states passed laws allowing forced sterilizations including maine and many prominent men and women from winston churchill to helen keller endorsed it the embrace of eugenics became common enough to be taught in many schools touted in international conferences and endorsed by such diverse organizations as the u s supreme court and germany s nazi party nazi leader adolf hiter once told comrades i have studied with interest the laws of several american states concerning prevention of reproduction by people whose progeny would in all probability be of no value or be injurious to the racial stock according to the former head of his economic policy office cited in stefan kuhl s 1984 book the nazi connection eugenics american racism and german national socialism the american eugenics movement began to fade in the 1930s and fell into disfavor nearly everywhere after hitler carried its ideas so far that his minions slaughtered millions in a bid to snuff out people seen as unfit including jews homosexuals communists and people with mental and physical challenges academics who have since delved into the eugenics push in america cite it as one of the intellectual foundations for hitler s concentration camps advertisement peaceful extermination arthur staples who worked at the journal for 57 years and edited it for two decades laid out how he saw the problem in a 1925 column in which he complained we have bred from the worst to the worst in the most foolish way as a result staples wrote we are striving to lug along incompetents and feeble persons in the march of progress he pointed out how potato farmers throw away the small potatoes while society coping with far more important choices was attempting to raise the culls when it comes to people who are idiots imbeciles and sub normals then staples took an even greater leap he said men of conscience and courage no doubt including himself among them wonder if a certain form of peaceful extermination were not better advertisement though staples immediately said he wasn t advocating any such thing merely pondering it he proceeded to compare these poor travesties of human beings with demon possessed swine staples concluded society must take care that imbeciles and sub normals do not reproduce urging the state to sterilize them to improve the overall quality of mainers the state he said must stop the growing rot in the seed of the race and not be squeamish about telling things as they are at the time staples and the journal were hardly alone in their calls for government to sterilize people they regarded as lesser beings the supreme court in the never overturned 1927 case of buck v bell widely noted as one of its most dreadful rulings agreed with justice oliver wendell holmes jr when he insisted three generations of imbeciles are enough in a ruling granting the right for states to sterilize residents to prevent feebleminded and socially inadequate people from having children it was a decision and a movement which led to the forcible sterilization of at least 60 000 americans many of them black women maine was among the states to do so advertisement not surprisingly nazi defendants at the war crimes trials at nuremberg after world war ii sought to justify their crimes by citing the precedent set in the united states for sterilization and extermination the judges didn t buy it but there was some truth to their finger pointing news and views supporting extermination on march 2 1900 the journal carried a news story under the headline by painless extermination beneath it was a lengthy account of a new book by dr duncan mckim of new york who proposed the betterment of society and the abolition of the evils of heredity by the gentle removal from this life of incorrigible criminals idiots imbeciles epileptics and habitual drunkards he said they could be led into a lethal chamber where they could be gassed to death advertisement the painless extinction of these lives would present no practical difficulty mckim said the number of individuals to whom the plan would apply is large mckim wrote in his book the journal s story did not question either the idea motivating mckim s proposal or his suggestion for implementing it mckim s heredity and progress published by g p putnam was part of a movement promoting the notion that people should in effect be bred like livestock or pedigreed dogs aiming to improve the overall quality of humanity by culling the least fit it is not the mere wearing of a human form which truly indicates a man mckim wrote the idiot and the low grade imbecile are not true men for certain essential human elements have never entered into them and never can nor is the moral idiot truly a man nor while the sad condition lasts the lunatic he wrote they are no more human than beasts of prey advertisement once dismissed as mere animals it wasn t hard for some in the movement to embrace the suggestion that involuntary sterilization or death was a reasonable solution to the problem mckim identified it s an idea the journal found attractive in its book chat column on feb 24 1900 the journal s illustrated magazine praised the volume and hailed mckim s call for a gentle and painless death to those who are very weak and very vicious degenerates who are under the absolute control of the state including murderers habitual drunkards nocturnal house breakers and people with epilepsy who were seen by some as a uniquely criminal class in those days dr mckim has brought the darker side of life before us in a clear and forceful manner and his arguments are logical and convincing the journal said it was a theme repeated now and again with only occasional hesitation in many of the paper s stories and some of its opinion columns in the following decades in a 1904 front page news story headlined minds mislaid and minds lost by heredity and vice the journal noted how auburn schools had reported having 14 mentally incapacitated children advertisement the next sentences said criminal re enforcement of decadents and imbeciles is a grave menace to the state there are many cases where the reproduction of dangerous imbeciles has proved a fruitful source of municipal expenditure and moral waste to prevent the breeding and intermarriage of decadent classes is essential to the well being of the commonwealth it said feeble mindedness is typically hereditary and that to descend from a long line of paupers is to descend further into pauperism in ancient sparta the story said the answer would have been to lop the heads off the people it viewed as problematic but the journal noted with a tinge of regret that modern morality would not allow such barbarism in 1914 the paper reported favorably on the views of gertrude macdonald principal of the state school for girls in hallowell who told the maine federation of women s clubs that because defects are passed on in family lines government should see to it that the continued pollution of its bloodstream must be checked by such means that have the approval of sane far seeing men reproduction of the feeble minded the insane the grossly immoral the physically imperfect must be cut off and it should lie within the power of the state to bring this to pass by segregation for the most part and more drastic means when absolutely necessary macdonald said in the same year after a judge threw out a eugenics law in wisconsin he deemed unconstitutional the journal wrote an editorial fretting that damaged goods would multiply as what it viewed as feeble minded people reproduced until society s views on the issue change advertisement with better education it said we can climb the hill of the capitol and get into written constitutions the better things needed by the nation namely a constitutional amendment to ease the way for the practical application of eugenics a big year for bad ideas the push for forced sterilizations appears to have peaked in the journal in 1925 the year staples mused in his column about peaceful extermination of unfortunate americans in june the daily spotlighted an honor thesis by bates college student priscilla frew that insisted defectives should be controlled so they cannot multiply which means strict segregation or sterilization the following month the journal covered a talk to the lewiston and auburn rotarians by dr stephen vosburgh head of the maine school of the feeble minded in pownal he told the group that segregation and sterilization were the only ways to stop the growth of feeble minded mainers vosburgh told the rotarians that tests given to new arrivals at his school determine with ease whether the newcomer is an idiot with the mental capacity of a 2 year old or an imbecile who has the mental abilities of a typical child between the ages of 3 and 7 or a moron whose mind is equivalent to a 7 to 12 year old advertisement he said a state law prevented all of them from getting married but town clerks failed to enforce it so the state passed a law that permits sterilization of the so called feeble minded under some circumstances vosburgh also said there were many sub normal people in alms houses and attractive women of child bearing age who should be cared for and segregated in institutions until they were too old to have children otherwise he said the state would have too many morons in november 1925 the journal wrote an editorial about the state s insane asylum discussing a delicate subject that requires a lot of common sense the paper said maine ought to extend the sterilization law for idiots and imbeciles in order to sterilize these people by the authorities without having to get so many permissions after all it said society would never allow unnecessary operations of this sort only those approved after a proper hearing the chances of the idiot or the imbecile or even the moron or subnormal reproducing like to like are almost certain the paper said the chances are small that these people will produce normals advertisement nobody likes to discuss this subject the editorial noted nobody likes to sponsor these profoundly personal laws but what is to be done is society through a mawkish sentimentality to be permitted to go on doing what we do not permit cattle to do are we going to overload society with fools it went on to detail a misinterpreted and often mistaken 1877 study of an american family published by richard louis dugdale as the jukes a study in crime pauperism disease and heredity also further studies of criminals comparing the juke family to the successful descendants of famed colonial era preacher jonathan edwards the journal used their example to prove idiots produce idiots when allowed to have children and should not be allowed to reproduce it was a theme pushed repeatedly over the years by the lewiston paper until the scale of the eugenics inspired horror unleashed by the nazis became clear after the nazis the journal printed hundreds of news stories during and after world war ii detailing german crimes it wrote about the international tribunals prosecuting nazi criminals it published stories about concentration camp survivors and about the reality of the holocaust they witnessed advertisement but it doesn t appear the journal ever took note in later years of its own role in promoting eugenics or its complicity in the spread of a doctrine leading directly to the crimes against humanity laid out at the nuremberg trials of nazi war criminals that the journal chose to push eugenics is made clear by comparing its coverage in those years to its morning counterpart the lewiston daily sun which rarely mentioned eugenics and doesn t appear to have hailed it at all there is no apology possible for having played any role at all in laying the foundation for the holocaust but the paper can at last recognize its failure this was perhaps the worst thing the journal and its successors ever did in 175 years of news coverage send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
when president obama visits ireland on may 23 24 he is expected to visit moneygall in county offaly the ancestral home of his mother s family while finding irish ancestors is a favorite electoral sport of american leaders the president would be better advised to spend his time studying the irish financial crisis which has important lessons for america if this crisis continues to deepen the u s may be compelled to consider the implications of an irish default if default becomes inevitable then the u s should not simply take the side of european institutions if doing so would uselessly prolong the crisis the origins of the irish crisis in the 1980s and 1990s ireland grew rapidly fuelled by a wide ranging move toward a freer and more open economy the resulting boom in employment and wages benefited the irish people tremendously but by the 2000s it had begun to seriously erode ireland s international competitiveness then like the u s and many other european countries ireland experienced a massive real estate property bubble when that bubble burst in 2008 it exposed the leading irish banks that had underwritten so much of the bubble to overwhelming losses in september 2008 irish finance minister brian lenihan propped the banks up with a state guarantee in 2009 ireland nationalized the banks and created the national asset management agency to purchase their bad loans the costs of these interventions drove ireland s budget into deep deficit in 2009 and especially for 2010 forcing crushing tax increases on an already shaky economy along with social welfare cuts and politically painful pay cuts for the public sector unfortunately like their u s counterparts two years earlier ireland badly miscalculated the size of the banking losses and the banks were forced to resort to emergency borrowing from the european central bank ecb in november 2010 european finance ministers hoping to stop a panic over spain and portugal urged ireland to accept a bailout lenihan denied that this was necessary but the governor of the irish central bank patrick honohan almost immediately announced that it was the result was an 85 billion financial assistance program between ireland the imf and the ecb announced in late november 2010 ireland s solvency crisis the premise of the european bailout program was that ireland s taxpayers must fully repay all of ireland s liabilities repeating a consistent pattern throughout the financial crisis in both the u s and europe once again creditors received rates of return reflecting the bearing of risk and yet in the event of default they were to be protected against loss this was not what the imf wanted according to published reports it initially proposed a plan for only partial repayment but u s treasury secretary timothy geithner vetoed this plan forcing both the imf and ireland itself to accept full repayment among other things this raises the question as to just how welcoming president obama may find his ancestral home in any event the markets have given their verdict on the result the spread on irish government bonds has risen almost continuously since november and are now second in europe only to those of greece the major credit rating agencies put ireland s debt at one step above junk the bailout apparently is understood by ireland s creditors if not by its euromasters to be a temporary band aid a prologue to default ireland does have strengths on which to build and recover its exports are rising and in contrast to greece it has a functioning political and tax system but the verdict of the markets is that the premise of the measures taken to date is mistaken they have sought to solve ireland s debt problem by inoculating past creditors while piling on more debt at a 5 8 percent interest rate further as evidenced by the credit spread these measures have not allowed ireland to return to the markets to borrow money at an affordable rate because of the steadily rising scale of its debts ireland has a solvency problem yet like greece and portugal it is being treated initially as though it has a liquidity problem the relative size of ireland s future national debt is to an extent unknowable because the debts are offset by banking sector assets of uncertain value and future growth prospects are uncertain but reasonable estimates reach 250 billion in 2014 even with optimistic projections ireland s debt to gdp ratio currently at an unbearable 94 percent will reach an unsustainable 115 percent and could well top a disastrous 140 percent by 2014 the dangers of a europeanized ireland ireland could respond to its budget deficits by following latvia s course squeeze domestic consumption and government spending to bring the budget into balance but that would only address ireland s deficit not its debts the interest on which in 2010 consumed 11 percent of tax revenue a figure that will only grow over the next several years ireland could also seek to close its deficit by adopting much higher continental european tax rates this approach would be applauded by the eu but it would sharply reduce ireland s competitiveness and the economic growth it needs to have the income needed to service its debt and higher taxes again would do nothing to address ireland s indebtedness to date the ecb and the u s have concentrated on making ireland pay in full from the ecb s point of view this approach has the merit of making ireland an example for other indebted european nations especially spain and ensuring that large continental investors are shielded by the burdens that the irish people would be forced to bear but the approach also has its problems it may not work indeed failure is likely and it has further increased the peril of the ecb s already over leveraged position by europeanizing the irish crisis ireland the ecb and the u s may thus have achieved the worst of all possible worlds no relief for ireland and increased danger for the financial structure of europe lessons from ireland ireland s peril holds three lessons for the u s and for the world one is that the financial crisis that began in 2008 was truly global it manifested itself first in the u s but was not of purely u s origin nations as diverse as france germany and the united kingdom made early contributions and ireland greece and portugal are continuing the saga the second is that ireland has since 2002 been taking part in a great experiment called the euro it is being conducted to determine if political will can outweigh economic reality the irish crisis and the broader european one implies that economic reality is likely to win out the u s should therefore be cautious about policies for example in the realm of health care that are deemed by some to be so politically desirable that their economic costs are not properly assessed third the u s should also remember that it historically supported european integration and continues to support it today as a means to promoting prosperity and democracy in europe but if there comes a point when the u s or an eu member state finds that the institutions of an integrated europe are irredeemably endangering its prosperity or democracy the u s must not back the means of integration at the expense of the ends of its policy ted r bromund ph d is senior research fellow in the margaret thatcher center for freedom a division of

ahead of her astonishing victory this week in a special election to fill alaska s sole congressional seat mary peltola was delighted to get recognized at costco i was approached by some people to do a selfie she laughed it seemed like months of traversing the state for meet and greets was paying off i am getting recognized more now people all over the us are learning her name peltola who is yup ik will make history as the first alaska native to represent the state in congress and as the first democrat to hold the seat in nearly 50 years on wednesday she prevailed over the trump endorsed former vice presidential nominee sarah palin and republican party backed nick begich iii in a state that favoured trump by 10 points in 2020 she will serve out the remainder of the late republican congressman don young s term a former state legislator and fisheries manager peltola campaigned as a relentlessly amicable coalition builder i want to work with everyone and anyone who is a reasonable person to find solutions to alaska s challenges she said in a race where palin s celebrity and her self described right winging bitter clinging attack dog energy loomed large in the media and in voters minds peltola would often bring up her warm relationship with palin she d talk about how both she and palin were pregnant at the same time while peltola was serving as a legislator and palin was governor our teenagers are just a month apart she said before palin left to campaign as republican john mccain s running mate in the 2008 elections she bequeathed peltola her backyard trampoline resolute niceness peltola was born in 1973 the year that young was elected to office and her father was a friend of the late congressman while young a bombastic character with a taxidermy stuffed office a reputation for making racist and sexist jokes and a zeal for oil was very much a contrast to peltola in demeanour and philosophy voters in anchorage nonetheless said they shared a sense of pragmatic bipartisanship in 2010 peltola helped to run the write in campaign for lisa murkowski the republican senator with an independent streak now fighting for her political life after she voted for trump s impeachment first elected to the state legislature in 1998 peltola built a reputation for resolute niceness she helped build the bush caucus a bipartisan group of legislators representing the most rural and remote parts of the state and showed a knack for winning over even her most conservative colleagues to advance policies on natural resource management and infrastructure view image in fullscreen mary peltola greets supporters at a fundraiser in juneau last month photograph becky bohrer ap peltola s own politics diverge from the republicans she is often willing to work with in the us house race she was the only candidate who endorsed abortion rights alaska natives have a history of forced sterilisation against their knowledge or consent she said people should have to build their families the way when and how they choose and for that to be infringed on is very troubling a majority of alaskans support the right to choose and after the supreme court decision to revoke the constitutional right to abortion access the issue has energized voters in the last frontier as it has in other parts of the country peltola s policies on climate adaptation also reflect the nuanced realities of alaska a state whose economy is intricately entwined with the oil and gas industry and whose people live at the arctic edge of the climate crisis alaska is losing glacier ice faster than anywhere else in the world in the near term we are tied to oil and gas and in the near term that is how we are paying our bills as alaskans peltola said but i have seen firsthand the effects of climate change across alaska we had over 250 wildfires this summer before june we had the largest tundra fire we ve ever seen in may fisheries and salmon stock which many alaskans depend on for sustenance are suffering she added her platform focused on investment in renewable energy and a gradual transition for alaska s economy a focus on bipartisanship could pay off it remains unclear if peltola s moderate way will pave her path to victory in november when she ll be running again in the race to serve the next full two year term in congress alaska s ranked choice voting system which the state tried for the first time with the special election could be shaped as much by alaskans scepticism about palin as their support for peltola but in a state that tends to elect a republican but where the majority of voters declare no party preference her focus on bipartisanship could pay off we all have to help each other out if we re going to survive that s the fundamental nature of alaskans said ivan moore an anchorage based pollster who has been tracking peltola s rise in alaska politics we can be political assholes just like everywhere else but when push comes to shove when it s life and death alaskans will help each other and i think mary tapped into that she speaks in a language that connects people said shirley mae springer staten 76 an anchorage based arts educator who supported peltola there s a new wave of unkindness in politics these days and i like that mary peltola pushes against that news of her victory this week came on peltola s 49th birthday a good day she tweeted shortly after the elections division released preliminary results now more people know who she is but she s sticking with what works support a regular alaskan is the slogan

ukraine has received 5 000 nlaws from the uk together with thousands of javelins brimstones and other anti tank weapons 16 000 artillery rounds hundreds of missiles and six stormer vehicles fitted with starstreak anti aircraft missile launchers overall the value of british military support for ukraine has totalled 2 3 billion to date in the past six weeks the government has promised to supply 20 m109 155mm self propelled guns and 36 smaller l119 105mm artillery pieces the m109 broadly resembles a tank but is designed to fire larger shells over much longer ranges to bombard enemy positions accordingly it is more lightly armoured than a proper main battle tank firing high explosive shells it has a range of 21km 13 miles and requires a crew of six the l119 light gun so named because it weighs less than competing designs and is therefore more easily moved around is similar to the type of gun fired from edinburgh castle at 1pm every day it is small enough to be lifted by a helicopter or towed by a road vehicle and has a range of 11 4km 7 1 miles using 105mm shells if this sounds like britain and her allies have thrown everything including the kitchen sink at ukraine there is some truth in that view indeed the assortment of military hardware being shipped to kyiv may be creating its own problem of training familiarisation and ease of resupply a rusi report from july about the munitions supply difficulties facing ukraine s army said one challenge here is that nato standardisation is not very standardised with different countries howitzers not only having completely different maintenance requirements but also using different charges fuses and sometimes shells the current approach by which each country donates a battery of guns in a piecemeal way is rapidly turning into a logistical nightmare for ukrainian forces with each battery requiring a separate training maintenance and logistics pipeline making support to ukraine sustainable requires the provision of one or two kinds of gun and for countries to step up production of the appropriate ammunition adds the report s author jack watling ukraine will need a regular supply of shells which can vary widely even within the broad 155mm category he warns as current munition stockpiles dwindle the ukrainians are already hunting for new sources of supply sources say they have been inspecting british foundries capable of making casings for 155mm artillery shells as fired by nato howitzers which have been gifted to kyiv such as us provided m777s french caesars and german pzh 2000s the casings must be made to a high standard bae systems builds the uk s 155mm casings but ukrainian officials are understood to be keen to diversify their supplies picking several sources to minimise any delays in production bae s washington foundry in tyne and wear makes the metal shell casings these are then sent to the former royal ordnance factory at glascoed in monmouthshire wales for filling with high explosive precise figures on production capacity and the state of british military stockpiles are not made public but there is little doubt that uk officials are now having similar conversations with the defence industrial base as their us counterparts in the uk there is thought to be some capacity to add shifts to production lines to increase supply although some analysts say that basic 155mm rounds are not the critical bottleneck for ukraine newer exotic 155mm munitions are also experiencing delays for the same reason as mlrs rockets says drummond the defence analyst small arms medium calibre and tank ammunition production has been expanded without too much trouble many companies like bae systems have increased production so far there has been no need to increase the number of shifts at munitions factories drummond says overall i don t see any serious barriers to resupplying ammunition stocks he adds the real issue is the manufacture of tanks and the timeline is basically 36 months from an order being placed to delivery levelling the playing field with winter fast approaching a three year lead time for brand new military vehicles is clearly impractical this is one of the reasons that western stocks of ready to use munitions and vehicles are being sent east buying new ones and waiting for factories to deliver simply isn t an option for ukraine it s a rosier story for vladimir putin s forces at least as far as ammunition supply is concerned the russians have several years worth of artillery munitions at their disposal according to a report last month from rusi russia is firing 20 000 shells per day compared with ukraine s 6 000 it said the use of drones and radar jamming has made their strikes particularly effective against ukrainian positions although ukraine s forces have adapted recently by using decoy positions to draw russian fire countering this means having the weapons available to destroy russian military formations drummond says that production of javelins nlaws and other complex weapons is ramping up accordingly but he sounds a cautionary note adding that there are delays with long lead items such as chips and controller parts this particularly affects m31 rockets for himars he says ukraine has been given 16 of the us made himars systems which have proven formidable for attacking russian airfields and key strategic chokepoints such as bridges but the ammunition is expensive and in short supply himars also known as the us made m142 high mobility artillery rocket system is essentially an armoured lorry with six rocket launcher tubes bolted onto a flatbed trailer its operating concept is simple launch rockets at a target then quickly drive away to a place of safety so called counter battery fire the targeting of artillery batteries as they open up has become a real problem for the ukrainians because of russia s plethora of radar sensor laden drones and rapid deployment artillery vehicles of their own himars is one of the pieces of western artillery that levels the field for the ukrainians yet himars m31 rockets made by lockheed martin are far more complex than the truck that launches them the missiles are guided by an inertial measuring unit backed up by gps which means each weapon has a complex computer system built into it each of those contains computer chips antennas and processors all of which are built to exacting standards so they can survive the stresses of being launched at the speeds necessary to fly for the rocket s maximum range of 43 miles in july a retired us lieutenant general mark hertling estimated that the 16 himars rocket systems america sent to ukraine could fire 192 missiles a day equivalent to a year s worth of production in less than two months the same

risk of volcano catastrophe a roll of the dice september 03 2022 saturday sitnews the world is woefully underprepared for a massive volcanic eruption and the likely repercussions on global supply chains climate and food according to experts from the university of cambridge s centre for the study of existential risk cser and the university of birmingham in an article published in the journal nature they say there is a broad misconception that risks of major eruptions are low and describe current lack of governmental investment in monitoring and responding to potential volcano disasters as reckless however the researchers argue that steps can be taken to protect against volcanic devastation from improved surveillance to increased public education and magma manipulation and the resources needed to do so are long overdue mount rinjani indonesia stock image credit wirestock creators stock adobe com data gathered from ice cores on the frequency of eruptions over deep time suggests there is a one in six chance of a magnitude seven explosion in the next one hundred years that s a roll of the dice said article co author and cser researcher dr lara mani an expert in global risk such gigantic eruptions have caused abrupt climate change and collapse of civilisations in the distant past mani compares the risk of a giant eruption to that of a 1km wide asteroid crashing into earth such events would have similar climatic consequences but the likelihood of a volcanic catastrophe is hundreds of times higher than the combined chances of an asteroid or comet collision hundreds of millions of dollars are pumped into asteroid threats every year yet there is a severe lack of global financing and coordination for volcano preparedness mani said this urgently needs to change we are completely underestimating the risk to our societies that volcanoes pose an eruption in tonga in january was the largest ever instrumentally recorded the researchers argue that if it had gone on longer released more ash and gas or occurred in an area full of critical infrastructure such as the mediterranean then global shock waves could have been devastating the tonga eruption was the volcanic equivalent of an asteroid just missing the earth and needs to be treated as a wake up call said mani the cser experts cite recent research detecting the regularity of major eruptions by analysing traces of sulphur spikes in ancient ice samples an eruption ten to a hundred times larger than the tonga blast occurs once every 625 years twice as often as had been previously thought the last magnitude seven eruption was in 1815 in indonesia said co author dr mike cassidy a volcano expert and visiting cser researcher now based at the university of birmingham an estimated 100 000 people died locally and global temperatures dropped by a degree on average causing mass crop failures that led to famine violent uprisings and epidemics in what was known as the year without summer he said we now live in a world with eight times the population and over forty times the level of trade our complex global networks could make us even more vulnerable to the shocks of a major eruption financial losses from a large magnitude eruption would be in the multi trillions and on a comparable scale to the pandemic say the experts mani and cassidy outline steps they say need to be taken to help forecast and manage the possibility of a planet altering eruption and help mitigate damage from smaller more frequent eruptions these include a more accurate pinpointing of risks we only know locations of a handful of the 97 eruptions classed as large magnitude on the volcano explosivity index over the last 60 000 years this means there could be dozens of dangerous volcanoes dotted the world over with the potential for extreme destruction about which humanity has no clue we may not know about even relatively recent eruptions due to a lack of research into marine and lake cores particularly in neglected regions such as southeast asia said cassidy volcanoes can lie dormant for a long time but still be capable of sudden and extraordinary destruction monitoring must be improved say the cser experts only 27 of eruptions since 1950 have had a seismometer anywhere near them and only a third of that data again has been fed into the global database for volcanic unrest volcanologists have been calling for a dedicated volcano monitoring satellite for over twenty years said mani sometimes we have to rely on the generosity of private satellite companies for rapid imagery the experts also call for increased research into volcano geoengineering this includes the need to study means of countering aerosols released by a massive eruption which could lead to a volcanic winter they also say that work to investigate manipulating pockets of magma beneath active volcanoes should be undertaken added mani directly affecting volcanic behaviour may seem inconceivable but so did the deflection of asteroids until the formation of the nasa planetary defense coordination office in 2016 the risks of a massive eruption that devastates global society is significant the current underinvestment in responding to this risk is simply reckless on the web michael cassidy lara mani huge volcanic eruptions time to prepare nature 2022 608 7923 469 doi 10 1038

by dave kranzler of investment research dynamics the following is an excerpt from the latest issue of the short seller s journal i have been hitting doubles triples and home runs with my housing market related stock shorts like open hous z psa rez plus homebuilder stocks you can learn more about this weekly newsletter here short seller s journal information housing market update the homebuyer affordability fixed mortgage index from the national association of realtors has plunged to its lowest level since 1989 the late 1980 s experienced what was back then considered a housing bubble though it was much smaller in scale than the two housing bubbles this century but here s the kicker back then the average rate for a 30 yr fixed rate agency mortgage was nearly 10 price inflation and deteriorating household conditions has turbo charged the prospective homebuyer s sensitivity to small changes in interest rates relative to 33 years ago this explains why the july new home sales report was a complete disaster the headline saar seasonally adjusted annualized rate was down 12 6 from june the saar of 511k homes sold was below wall street s forecast of 520k the yoy saar plunged 29 6 and the rate of home sales is at its lowest since january 2016 however the yoy unadjusted monthly sales showed july new home sales collapsed 32 2 from july 2021 the unadjusted number is much cleaner statistically than the saar as it is not subjected to seasonal adjustment modeling errors only to data collection estimation errors the months supply jumped from 9 1 months in june to 11 2 months in july this chart should terrify anyone who recently overpaid for a new home or was thinking about buying one the supply of new homes is nearly as high as it was at its highest after the previous housing bubble popped the low inventory narrative was never completely valid but now it is preposterous pending home sales for july fell 1 from june and 20 yoy on a monthly basis pendings have dropped 8 of the last 9 months and 9 of the last 12 months on a yoy basis pendings have dropped every month for over a year not including the pandemic lockdown period the pending home sales index is at its lowest level since october 2011 needless to say the july pending home sale data suggests that august will show another monthly decline in home sales we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the mortgage purchase increase declined 0 5 from a week earlier not including the pandemic lock down period the mortgage purchase index dropped to its lowest level in nearly six years in a recent issue i mentioned that wall street corporate home buyers have been rapidly pulling back from the housing market this past week blackstone announced that its home partners of america buy to rent subsidiary will stop buying homes in 38 cities as of september 1st it will stop buying in an additional 10 cities on october 1st in addition to blackstone invitation homes invh american homes 4 rent amh and my community homes owned by kkr announced that they have slowed considerably their home purchases up until recently buy to rent or flip homebuyers represented well over 20 of all home sales over the last couple of years zillow z shut down its home flipping operations in late 2021 it s only a matter of time before opendoor open stops buying homes one of the differences between the 2008 bubble and current bubble is that the corporate buyers largely were not prevalent until after the 2008 bubble had collapsed however the corporate home buyers were one of the primary drivers of the housing bubble removing the corporate demand from the market equation will accelerate the downward momentum of the market and it s one of the reasons i believe this housing collapse will be worse than 2008 the chart below makes a compelling argument that home prices are going to go into free fall the light blue line is the case shiller average home price the dark blue line is a regression metric composed of the current mortgage rate and months supply the two lines are highly correlated going back to 1998 the start date of the study i do not foresee a scenario which prevents the light blue line from catching down quickly with the dark blue line the 60 decline yoy new orders in its fy q3 reported by tol see below is an indicator that a price collapse is coming this chart solidifies that argument unfortunately the chart from redfin only goes back to 2015 but the chart shows the percentage of active listings nationwide with price cuts in some of the biggest bubble cities boise austin denver the number of active listings with price cuts are in excess of 50 a long time colleague of mine knows the ceo of a large excavating company in colorado they primarily do dirt work for new homebuilders they are busy finishing existing projects however they do not have any new business on the books for 2023 or 2024 the ceo said it s like somebody just turned off the fountain if the fed sticks to the message delivered by jay powell at jackson hole on friday just for the next four to six months the carnage to the housing market will be biblical

because of its versatility utility and popularity the ar style rifle is inexorably embedded in the american hunting culture so ubiquitous is this style of rifle that it is outpacing its perjorative reputation in popular culture terms such as tactical style rifle and ar style rifle are becoming obsolete the associated press stylebook journalism s bible proscribes the use of assault rifle its socio political descriptor in their places has emerged a new term modern sporting rifle bill pool owner of arkansas gun traders in benton is a traditional rifleman an accomplished competitive shooter he is also an avid prairie dog hunter he prefers to build his own rifles using custom barrels that are firmly bedded into laminated stocks or high quality composite stocks that provide the rigidity and stability these attributes are essential to achieving pinpoint accuracy that certainly does not describe a modern sporting rifle stock it is so light and flexible that you can bend it against your knee however modern sporting rifles are chambered primarily for 5 56 x 45 nato or its near twin 223 remington the 223 rem is very popular among target shooters and varmint hunters hunting prairie dogs requires shooting a heavy rifle from a rest in a stationary position we don t have prairie dogs east of the mississippi river hunters in this region hunt other varmints namely coyotes and feral pigs they are also becoming the predominant quarry also in the west where it s increasingly difficult to get access to private land in some states like colorado it is illegal to hunt prairie dogs on public land for the new style of varmint hunting the modern sporting rifle is made to order a lot of guys buy sporters because they walk a lot pool said you re just going to get a few shots a lot of those guys buy a varmint caliber but they don t buy a true varmint gun the modern sporting rifle a rifle built on a modular ar 15 frame follows the trend of popularity that has existed since world war i when the returning servicemen gravitated to bolt action rifles jim eddie an associate of the shootin den in colorado springs colo said the modern sporting rifle is the preferred platform for veterans that have served in nearly 30 years of continuous warfare of the newer shooters the 40 and under category that s what they carried eddie said that s what they re used to it s not a bad platform a lot of the guys that came back had sniping backgrounds in the middle east that s what they like adaptability is the reason the ar 15 morphed into the modern sporting rifle simply by switching upper units you can convert a 5 56 x 45 into almost any caliber you want you can use a 308 winchester upper for deer hunting 300 blackout for pigs or 450 socom for black bear most of the people are going to the ar platforms more than anything else is because so much is available for it and they can make it any way they want eddie said you can change the upper to a 24 inch barrel or a 20 inch the flexibility and modularity of the ar platform makes it really easy you don t have to buy 20 rifles as hunters demand higher performance makers of ar upper units are improving the quality of their barrels the ar chambered in 5 56 x 45 was always accurate enough to hit a human silhouette target at 500 meters but now they are almost accurate enough to hit prairie dogs however the ar has inherent limitations that preclude it from being a first call prairie dog rifle pool said nearly all varmint shooters are handloaders pool said have you ever tried to find your brass shooting a semiautomatic pool said that he and his companions look for clean places to park and they often remove the ejectors from their bolt action rifles to keep them from flinging spent cartridge brass into high grass an ar throws it 10 to 15 feet in the sagebrush and you ll play hell finding half of it pool said also ar triggers don t break as clean and crisp as even a mediocre bolt action trigger imprecise trigger control translates to inferior accuracy also reloading ammo for use in a semiautomatic rifle is tricky pool said you can load cartridges with a wide range of powder charges for a bolt action rifle a semiautomatic rifle uses excess gas from propellant discharge to slam the bolt backward to re cock the firing pin eject a spent case and chamber a fresh cartridge a gas gun operates with certain amount of gas pool said any higher pressure or lower pressure and it won t function it limits you greatly on what your handloads can be in addition people that shoot modern sporting rifles prefer long detachable magazines that perpendicular element impedes shooting from a bench that magazine hangs down a long way pool said the ability to shoot a lot of ammunition quickly is also incompatible with prairie dog hunting pool said we shoot nothing but single shot guns pool said there are a couple that shoot repeater actions but they make single shots out of them because it slows you down enough in a busy prairie dog town so you don t burn the throat out we ve got a guy that brings out an ar and shoots with us he s a pretty good shot but he doesn t hit half of what we hit when he brings a bolt gun he does real well with it matt harnes owner of teton river traders gun shop in fort pierre s d said that he doesn t believe a bolt gun is more accurate than an ar he said that most people avoid modern sporting rifles for high volume shooting because they lack the self control to lay off the trigger ammo is expensive and you can shoot a lot very quickly with an ar a lot of guys figured out they have self control problems and they burn up their ammo pretty quick harnes said we see lot of guys go back to bolt rifles but not for accuracy a bolt is not going outshoot an ar and vice versa almost all of them shoot very well harnes an ar enthusiast describes himself as a rock river arms fanboy he started shooting rock river arms 20 years ago because of their accuracy but he said the rest of the industry has closed the gap i always shot half and three quarter inch but now everything does harnes said equipped with a sound suppressor a modern sporting rifle can be very effective for killing a large number of feral pigs in a short time mother jones a bastion of progressive political dogma even put its stamp of approval on the ar 15 for this purpose in a 2013 article by tim murphy titled bringing home the bacon with an ar 15 like it or not the ar 15 is now america s rifle

statepoint between the russian invasion of ukraine and sky high oil and gas prices a significant pellet fuel supply shortage is likely this winter season industry experts say you should plan ahead and secure your fuel now for the cold winter months the good news is that currently there is plenty of supply to stock up as tim portz executive director of the pellet fuels institute explains russia is the second largest producer of wood pellets globally supplying more than 2 million tons to global markets in 2020 but sanctions and restrictions due to the invasion of ukraine have required u s pellet producers to fill the gap what s more the sticker shock americans may experience this winter when reviewing their energy bills will likely have many switching to pellet heating in search of a better deal and those with multiple heating options may start opting for pellets putting extra demand on potentially short supplies wood pellet demand fluctuates year to year however with heating oil natural gas electric and propane prices at near historic highs we could see record sales of pellets in 2022 2023 says portz consumers will need to be savvy to ensure their annual supply is secured they should stock up now wood pellets are used as primary or secondary space heat in more than 1 million homes nationwide pellets are a renewable clean burning fuel made from the waste streams generated by the manufacturers of products like dimensional lumber hardwood flooring wood pallets and cabinetry although supplies are strong right now pellet producers are highlighting the importance of keeping inventory moving through the system with the capacity to produce more than 1 million tons of wood pellets each year lignetics group the largest residential wood pellet manufacturing company in the united states notes that taking advantage of the surplus while it lasts will allow producers to run at full throttle and build inventory before usage begins to outpace production in the depths of winter because pellets are competitively priced nationwide consumers who opt for this method of heating will save hundreds of dollars over the course of a winter season compared to heating oil or propane and thousands of dollars compared to electric heat many have already turned to wood pellet heating and many more are expected to do so amid the current energy crisis says brett jordan ceo of lignetics group however these consumers will need to take their wise choice a step further by being prepared fueling up now on your normal pellet supply will mean being able to take advantage of this sustainable and cost efficient option all winter photo credit c srecko stipovic istock via getty images plus

fibrosis and malaria discoveries into their phase 1 trials and beyond and to extend our unique model to other research and discovery partners dr jack a elias ocean biomedical s scientific co founder described the potential impact of his lab s discoveries saying we believe we have discovered a master pathway that regulates multiple key cancer inducing moieties including critical immune checkpoint inhibitors in the lung in turn interventions based on this master pathway control the ability of tumor cells to develop spread to the lung and grow once they re in the lung he notes that these are very novel observations that give us a completely new vision for the processes that regulate anti cancer immune responses in the lung via immune checkpoint inhibition dr elias also notes that based on these findings his team believes they have developed anti chi3l1 monoclonal antibodies and bi specific antibodies that are extremely exciting potential therapeutics the combination with aesther will allow us to further expand our development activities in this area malaria is one of the most significant killers of children on earth said scientific co founder dr jonathan kurtis we believe our team

i would never want anyone to feel judged equally if the data shows that currently there is no scientific evidence behind something i will stand by what i say even if you don t love it mills knows acutely how it feels to be judged in 2017 there was a backlash against the approach she was advocating when a bbc three documentary clean eating s dirty secrets drew attention to the issue of orthorexia an eating disorder characterised by obsessive behaviour in pursuit of a healthy diet mills with her sugar free gluten free and dairy free recipes was an obvious target for media criticism it was a bruising experience especially as she says clean eating was never a term she used i wrote clearly in the first book do what works for you adapt it to suit your life but that s nuanced you have to read it to see it she understands that a lot of people might have felt the need to push back against this sudden onslaught of health missives being hurled at them but that vitriol she coolly distils down to a few pieces that were just personal attacks on a young woman in her early 20s who d had a bad health problem ironic response instead of standing her ground she got hurt if the same thing happened today she says she would feel better equipped to reply to her critics but i was so young i was an absolute baby and it was really challenging on a personal level and i think you can t move past the fact that everyone in the firing line was a woman and a young one and equally had a message which from a public health perspective we need and that the government is completely ignoring the latter point is what she finds so ironic about the whole clean eating backlash in retrospect it s frustrating because we know that we have a health crisis but if i had published books about making double chocolate cakes i wouldn t have had a problem and i think that is a problem i didn t have the confidence to say that at the time equally she thinks people are more receptive and less challenged by her message today the idea that what you eat affects your health is well and truly mainstream still mills is always quick to cite her sources and reel off the relevant numbers during the course of our hour long chat she tells me that the world health organisation has said 71 per cent of premature deaths are from diseases linked to our lifestyle that almost 60 per cent of our diet in the uk is from ultra processed food that only 25 per cent of us eat our five a day that we barely get more than the 50 per cent of fibre we need she is also acutely aware of the impact of food production on climate change if we re going to keep our contribution to global warming in the uk to under two degrees then we need to consume 60 per cent less dairy 66 per cent less poultry 89 per cent less beef all of which checks out with mainstream sources

according to the most recent figures 20 percent of all home sellers have dropped the price of their listings because of sagging demand as a result for the first time in over a year and a half the average home sells for less than the list price the data from redfin show homes are sitting on the market longer than they did a year ago and the median price dropped by 14 000 consequently the supply of homes is rising the national association of realtors reported that listings are 20 lower than in july 2021 higher mortgage rates have exacerbated the problem the redfin data also reveals showings and buying services down with homes lingering a lot longer on the market meanwhile goldman sachs predicts home price drops will affect nearly 40 of metropolitan areas in 2023 the seemingly good news is that strategists at gs say overall prices will rise 0 7 this forbes report indicates that big metropolitan areas in western states will be affected a fortune report reveals why on a year over year basis new home sales and existing home sales are now down 29 6 and 20 2 and single family housing starts and mortgage purchase applications are down 18 5 and 23 respectively simply put housing activity is contracting fast mortgage rate volatility and upward ticks record breaking home prices a looming economic recession and a weaker labor market are other factors contributing to a market with nowhere to go but down additionally the homebuyer affordability fixed mortgage index from the national association of realtors has plunged to its lowest level since 1989 and the outlook turns pretty grim a report for seeking alpha by dave kranzler hammers this home he points out blackstone s subsidiary home partners of america halts buying homes in 38 cities with another ten cities in the works in reality analysis of the market is not rocket science the world is on the brink of an economic paradigm shift and the current administration seems to have no fix in the works finally the new york post s thomas barrabi recently quoted famed guru jeremy grantham voicing a kind of financial doomsday on the horizon referring to the current economic bubble we re sitting on despite a summer rally the us stock market is still an unprecedented superbubble that will cause financial tragedy for investors when it bursts grantham compared the current situation to the crash of 1929 1973 and 2000 experts predict recessions worldwide but total economic collapse in the uk and the eu and the picture gets turned into a more crisp focus our global connectedness has its adverse effects my take this is not about partisan politics or personal preferences there s just not a lot indicating we re headed in any suitable direction the nation is divided and even segments are being marginalized rising inflation uncertainty over energy a cooling job market even goldman sachs has a freeze the administration redefining what recession is the messages are all bad so when political bullhorns like npr start telling us what a happy song will do for us in an economic disaster it s time to start worrying no i am not kidding they reported on this winter s coming and you can expect a lot of belt tightenings to come
for years twitter s problems were overshadowed by those of its much larger rival social network facebook not anymore the past year has brought a parade of bad press for the blue bird from the ouster of its ceo to an ownership battle with elon musk to a federal whistleblower complaint and on tuesday we learned the san francisco based firm tried to develop an adult content service only to scuttle it amid concerns over its inability to police child pornography for a major global tech company one of the few things more embarrassing than being forced to turn to porn to boost revenue is proving incapable of doing so sundry as twitter s scandals might seem they share a common source a broken business model that is fundamentally at odds with the freewheeling nature of its platform and they aren t likely to abate until it resolves that tension one way or another the company s year from hell started when its co founder and ceo jack dorsey abruptly stepped down in november 2021 amid pressure from activist shareholders to dramatically grow the business his successor parag agrawal embarked on a sweeping reorganisation that was interrupted by musk s out of nowhere takeover bid one that promised shareholders a premium on their stock at 44 billion then perhaps realising his mistake in valuing twitter as if it were a healthy business musk tried to renege on his offer sparking a high stakes legal battle the primary reason dorsey was ousted is the same reason musk could afford to buy twitter which is also the same reason musk realised he was overpaying for twitter its business simply isn t healthy or lucrative enough to sustain a public social media platform of its global size and significance at least without cutting a lot of corners last week dorsey went so far as to say that his biggest regret is that twitter became a company in the first place while he may not be the most reliable analyst of twitter s troubles a lot of which were his own doing he s not wrong that there s a mismatch between the company s basic product architecture and its mandate to make piles of money from advertising founded in 2006 twitter s growth exploded in its early years and by the 2010 arab spring it was being hailed as a world changing hub for free speech unlike facebook it allowed users to remain anonymous and flaunted an anything goes approach that allowed activists and dissidents to speak truth to power while also tolerating racism bullying bots and pornography in many ways twitter was built to be unpoliceable like facebook and youtube twitter turned to advertising to make money promising to connect businesses with users based on their interests but its evolution into a site notorious for put downs pile ons and political arguments not to mention the porn made it a queasy fit for buttoned down corporate brands and the intensity of the twitter experience with its rapid fire feed assaulting users with contextless endlessly juxtaposed textbites has limited its appeal beyond the chattering classes in recent years the company has earnestly sought to tamp down the nastiness and build new products with mass appeal from the short video tool vine to the live streaming site periscope to the live audio feature spaces while the ideas were inspired the execution was often lacking and the one thing that turned out to entrench twitter as an essential part of the public square donald trump s twitter fuelled presidency only exacerbated its core problems over the past few years under dorsey twitter had attracted cadres of high minded employees determined to round off its rough edges and remould it into a venue for healthy conversations but the company s shareholders lost patience with his introspection and experimentation and issued ultimatums that forced the company s executives to prioritise growth over all else it s no surprise then that the microscope that has been held up to the firm over the past year has revealed various forms of rot in its innards last week the washington post and cnn first reported that twitter s former security chief had turned federal whistleblower leading to congressional inquiries into its allegedly flawed security practices among other issues twitter has denied many of the allegations calling the report a false narrative and on tuesday twitter confirmed a report by tech site the verge that it recently halted plans for a product that would have allowed adult performers to charge users for subscriptions to pornographic content with twitter taking a cut a business model similar to the adult site onlyfans according to the verge an internal red team a group of twitter employees tasked with finding the weaknesses or flaws in a product found that the company was already failing to police material on its main platform that depicts the sexual exploitation or abuse of minors as a result twitter abandoned the project this year in twitter s euphemistic words it was an ongoing and reflective dialogue on the topic that brought us to the decision to pause the workstream for the right reason and prioritise elsewhere per a statement from spokesperson celeste carswell twitter has zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation carswell said we aggressively fight online child sexual abuse and have invested in technology and tools to enforce our policy if there s a bright side to this story it s that twitter was at least prudent enough to pump the brakes on a bad idea after a careful internal review of the potential harms that s a more responsible approach than the move fast and break things ethos of early facebook and many other hard charging tech firms but it s also worth pausing to note just how wild it is that one of the world s most influential public tech companies was so strapped for new revenue streams that it was even considering a pivot to porn in the first place imagine google facebook or tiktok trying that less shocking is the revelation that twitter deemed its child sexual abuse material or csam problem to be insurmountable at least in the short term it has the same roots as twitter s spam problem its fake accounts problem its extremism problem and its misinformation problem that is it s what happens when you build a vast global platform where anyone can post anything anonymously and then try to police it with the perpetually limited resources of a company that s forever falling short of its financial goals of course every big social platform struggles with these issues twitter just faces a more daunting task than facebook youtube tiktok and others because it isn t minting the money needed to finance huge content moderation investments at one point in musk s takeover bid when it looked like the tesla titan still wanted to acquire twitter dorsey praised him as the singular solution to the company s problems by taking the firm private dorsey reasoned musk could insulate it from short term financial pressures and make the investments needed to realise its grandest visions exactly what those visions entailed has never been coherently explained something about decentralisation
bloomberg investors who might be looking for the world s biggest bond market to rally back soon from its worst losses in decades appear doomed to disappointment the us employment report on friday illustrated the momentum of the economy in face of the federal reserve s escalating effort to cool it down with businesses rapidly adding jobs pay rising and more americans entering the workforce while treasury yields slipped as the figures showed a slight easing of wage pressures and an uptick in the jobless rate the overall picture reinforced speculation the fed is poised to keep raising interest rates and hold them there until the inflation surge recedes swaps traders are pricing in a slightly better than even chance that the central bank will continue lifting its benchmark rate by three quarters of a percentage point on sept 21 and tighten policy until it hits about 3 8 that suggests more downside potential for bond prices because the 10 year treasury yield has topped out at or above the fed s peak rate during previous monetary policy tightening cycles that yield is at about 3 19 now inflation and fed hawkishness have bitten the markets said kerrie debbs a certified financial planner at main street financial solutions and inflation is not going away in a couple of months this reality bites the treasury market has lost over 10 in 2022 putting it on pace for its deepest annual loss and first back to back yearly declines since at least the early 1970s according to a bloomberg index a rebound that started in mid june fueled by speculation a recession would result in rate cuts next year has largely been erased as fed chair jerome powell emphasized that he is focused squarely on pulling down inflation two year treasury yields on thursday hit 3 55 the highest since 2007 at the same time short term real yields or those adjusted for expected inflation have risen signaling a significant tightening of financial conditions rick rieder the chief investment officer of global fixed income at blackrock inc the world s biggest asset manager is among those who think long term yields may rise further he said in an interview on bloomberg tv friday that he expects a 75 basis point hike in the fed s policy rate this month which would be the third straight move of that size the friday labor report showing a slowdown in payroll growth allowed markets a sigh of relief according to rieder he said his firm has been buying some short term fixed income securities to seize on the large run up in yields but he thinks those on longer maturity bonds have further room to increase i can see rates move higher in the long end he said i think we are in a range i think we are in the upper end of the range but i think it s pretty hard to say we ve seen the highs currently the employment report was the last major look at the job market before this month s meeting of the federal open market committee the upcoming holiday shortened week has some economic reports set to be released including surveys of purchasing managers the fed s beige book glimpse of regional conditions and weekly figures on unemployment benefits us markets will be close monday for the labor day holiday and the most significant indicator before the fed meeting will be the consumer price index release on sept 13 but the market will parse closely comments from an array of fed officials set to speak publicly over the coming week including cleveland fed president loretta mester she said wednesday that policy makers should push the fed funds rate to over 4 by early next year and indicated that she doesn t expect rate cuts in 2023 greg wilensky head of us fixed income at janus henderson said he s also focused on the upcoming release of wage data from the atlanta fed before the next policy setting meeting on friday the labor department reported that average hourly earnings rose 5 2 in august from a year earlier that was slightly less than the 5 3 expected by economists but it still shows upward pressure on wages from the tight labor market i m in the 4 to 4 25 camp on the terminal rate wilensky said people are realizing that the fed won t pause on softer economic data unless inflation weakens dramatically the specter of an aggressive fed tightening has also hammered stocks leaving the s p 500 index down more than 17 this year while us shares rallied off june lows until mid august they have since given back much of those gains as wagers on an imminent recession and 2023 rate cuts were unwound you need to remain humble about your ability to forecast data and how rates will react said wilensky whose core bond funds remain underweight treasuries the worst is over as the market is doing a more reasonable job of pricing in where rates should be but the big question is what is going on with inflation

last march a coalition of state attorneys general ags united for clean power announced they would be investigating any company that challenges the unproven scientific theory of man induced catastrophic climate change after the announcement u s virgin islands attorney general claude walker moved almost immediately to subpoena exxonmobil as well as the competitive enterprise institute for all of its research correspondence and communication regarding climate change including with third parties such as conservative and libertarian think tanks foundations and universities as well as individual researchers scientists and writers attorney general walker s sweeping action illustrates the danger of the ags investigations not only are the investigations a serious abuse of their legal authority they set a dangerous precedent one with serious economic implications that will undermine scientific and public policy debates and chill speech protected by the first amendment the science and policy debate science should be employed as one tool that guides public policy many proponents of action on global warming argue the science is settled and debate is over deriding climatologists who do not hold the view of the administration president obama said we don t have time for a meeting of the flat earth society the idea that the science of climate change is settled is contrary to the very spirit of scientific inquiry no consensus exists that man made emissions are the primary driver of global warming or more importantly that catastrophic global warming is occurring is accelerating or is dangerous climatologists differ on the various causes of climate change the rate at which the earth s climate is changing the effect of man made emissions on the climate the most accurate climate data and temperature sets to use and the accuracy of climate models projecting decades and centuries into the future the science may be settled that man made emissions have had some impact on the earth s temperature but the consensus stops there and even that may be a stretch indeed there are some credible scientists who also believe man made carbon dioxide emissions have played almost no role in any warming that may be occurring dire predictions by climatologists and politicians alike for global cooling global warming and more intense natural disasters have been extremely inaccurate politicians will attempt to link extreme weather events to man made warming without examining observed trends it may be convenient to point to the louisiana floods superstorm sandy hurricane katrina or the tornado in joplin missouri as evidence of man made global warming to advance a political agenda but the exact role of man made carbon dioxide emissions impact on extreme weather events is certainly not definitive and likely undetectable in fact even as man made greenhouse gas emissions have increased above allegedly dangerous levels there have been no significant trends in increased hurricanes tornadoes flooding or droughts the administration s erroneous conclusion that the science is settled has serious implications for american families and businesses most of america s and the world s energy needs are met by relatively abundant and affordable natural resources that emit carbon dioxide when used implementing restrictions and regulations that raise the cost of coal natural gas and oil will not only drive energy bills higher but also increase the costs for all of the other goods and services requiring energy to manufacture and transport the regulations will disproportionately impact low income americans who spend a larger percentage of their budget on energy expenditures heritage foundation research has found that any sort of carbon tax cap and trade or other combination of carbon regulations such as the regulations on new power plants and existing ones such as the clean power plan proposed by the u s environmental protection agency will destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs and cut income all without having any meaningful impact on global temperatures now or in the future specifically heritage analysts estimate that by 2035 the higher energy costs of the obama administration s climate agenda will contract economic production and consumption resulting in an average employment shortfall of nearly 400 000 jobs average employment shortfall in manufacturing of 200 000 jobs an aggregate gross domestic product gdp loss of more than 2 5 trillion inflation adjusted increased electricity expenditures for a family of four by at least 13 percent a year and a total income loss of more than 20 000 per family of four inflation adjusted the climate benefit for such severe economic sacrifice is a negligible change in earth s temperature according to a climate model developed by the national center for atmospheric research even if the administration pursued an aggressive impractical and impossible regulatory agenda to eliminate all carbon dioxide emissions in the united states the result would be a less than two tenths of a degree celsius decrease in global temperatures adoption of such an agenda by the developed world will not make any meaningful impact either even if the entire industrialized world eliminated all economic activity and reduced greenhouse gas emissions to zero the climate impact would still be less than four tenths of a degree celsius of averted warming by the year 2100 the legal inquisition and propaganda war begins in september 2015 20 academics at schools ranging from columbia university to rutgers sent an open letter to president barack obama and u s attorney general loretta lynch urging them to use the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico to prosecute corporations and other organizations that have knowingly deceived the american people about the risks of climate change their misdeeds in denying climate change must be stopped as soon as possible according to these ivory tower inquisitors this letter followed a call by senator sheldon whitehouse d ri in may 2015 for rico investigations of fossil fuel companies and their allies documents obtained by the competitive enterprise institute cei through a freedom of information act lawsuit against george mason university suggest this letter was written in consultation with sen whitehouse apparently these academics are oblivious to the fundamental infringement of the first amendment they were urging that the government use its legal power to shut down debate over a contentious unproven scientific theory this tactic is the exact opposite of the basic mission of academic institutions which is to have an open unrestricted intellectual environment that fosters the vigorous and free exchange of facts theories and ideas in research scholarship and public policy passed in 1970 rico is a federal law that was created as a tool to go after organized crime including drug cartels and mafia operations that engage in money laundering and other forms of racketeering since then prosecutors have extended the law s reach to encompass a long series of federal crimes ranging from murder to kidnapping to bribery to fraud any two such violations can under the law constitute a pattern of racketeering activity furthermore deriving any income from such racketeering activity in the operation of an enterprise such as a corporation partnership or other entity and any group of individuals associated in fact even if not a legal entity constitutes a violation of the law which can have very severe civil and criminal penalties many states have adopted state versions of the federal rico law including the u s virgin islands the federal statute imposes everything from substantial jail time to recovery of damages at three times the amount of actual damages as well as forfeiture of any interest in property derived from the unlawful activity injustice from the u s department of justice unfortunately both attorney general lynch and certain state attorneys general have begun taking action along the lines advocated by these academics as well as by elected officials such as senator whitehouse and some radical environmental groups in a hearing on march 9 2016 before the u s senate judiciary committee senator whitehouse urged lynch to use the rico law against those who pretend the science of carbon emissions dangers is unsettled particularly those in the fossil fuel industry who supposedly have constructed a climate denial apparatus whitehouse has also urged editorial boards to refrain from publishing any articles or letters containing what he calls phony opinion writing about the climate change debate instead of responding that the department of justice does not investigate those who hold disfavored views regarding scientific controversies lynch instead told senator whitehouse that she had discussed the possibility of pursuing civil actions against so called climate change deniers she also said that she had referred it to the fbi to consider whether or not it meets the criteria for which we could take action lynch s response so concerned five members of the u s senate that they sent a letter to the ag chastising her for using justice department law enforcement resources to stifle private debate on one of the most controversial public issues of our time climate change the senators called this approach a blatant violation of the first amendment and an abuse of power that rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct additionally they called on lynch to halt all investigations of anyone s views on climate change and to explain what steps you are taking as the federal official charged with protecting the civil rights of american citizens to prevent state law enforcement officers from unconstitutionally harassing private entities or individuals simply for disagreeing with the prevailing climate change orthodoxy however the senators concerns were not addressed when assistant attorney general peter j kadzik sent a letter on june 29 2016 stating that the justice department would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation kadzik claimed that the justice department only engages in the fair evenhanded administration of the federal criminal laws thus given a second chance the justice department once again refused to do what it should have done state categorically that it does not target those who hold disfavored views regarding scientific controversies state attorneys general publicize their criminalization of dissent less than a month after lynch s hearing on march 29 2016 more than a dozen state attorneys general held a press conference in which they announced that they had formed a coalition ags united for clean power to investigate and prosecute companies or others that misled investors and the public on the impact of climate change speaking at the press conference new york attorney general eric schneiderman said that the bottom line is simple climate change is real he explained that the coalition would step into breach left by gridlock in washington by targeting well funded highly aggressive and morally vacant forces that are trying to block every step by the federal government to take meaningful action schneiderman said that if companies are committing fraud by lying about the dangers of climate change the ags will pursue them to the fullest extent of the law at the same press conference virgin islands attorney general claude walker also made it abundantly clear that his actions were intended to change public policy rather than carry out his primary duty to enforce the law the goal of his investigation was to make it clear to our residents as well as the american people that we have to do something transformational on climate change to encourage the public to look at renewable energy which he claimed was the only solution to our energy needs anyone who disagreed with him was selfish and acting to destroy the planet the presence at the press conference of former vice president al gore who has no current government position of any kind but has profited enormously from investments in so called green or clean energy companies emphasized the political nature and political goals of these ags as opposed to neutral and dispassionate law enforcement objectives gore said that this coalition was a key step on the path to a sustainable clean energy future and that they could not allow the fossil fuel industry or any industry to treat our atmosphere like an open sewer or mislead the public about the impact they have on the health of our people and the health of our planet other state attorneys general defend the first amendment other state attorneys general criticized the targeting of climate change dissenters oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt and alabama attorney general luther strange said they would not be joining this effort because it was inappropriate for state attorneys general to use the power of their office to attempt to silence core political speech on one of the major policy debates of our time reasonable minds can disagree about the science behind global warming and disagree they do said pruitt and strange that type of scientific and political debate is healthy and it should be encouraged it should not be silenced with threats of criminal prosecution by those who believe that their position is the only correct one and that all dissenting voices must therefore be intimidated and coerced into silence on june 15 2016 13 state attorneys general including strange and pruitt sent a strongly worded letter on strange s letterhead strange to all the ags united for clean power cautioning them they should top policing viewpoints they charged that using law enforcement authority to resolve a public policy debate undermines the trust invested in our offices and threatens free speech furthermore the letter pointed out that they were unaware of any viable fraud case in light of what the ags united for clean power were doing their investigation targets a particular type of market participant the attorneys general identify themselves with the competitors of their investigative targets and their investigation implicates an ongoing public policy debate in explaining this strange warned that if it is possible to minimize the risks of climate changes then the same goes for exaggeration even if fossil fuel companies may have minimized the risks does anyone doubt that clean energy companies may have exaggerated the risks of climate change and thus could be targeted by strange and his fellow ags yet the clean power ags were only targeting companies and non profits allegedly espousing a particular viewpoint according to strange any fraud theory requiring more disclosure of exxon would surely require more disclosure by clean energy companies strange also found it unusual and a dangerous practice that the clean power ags had aligned themselves with the competitors of their investigative targets for example one of the ags present at their march 29 press conference lisa madigan of illinois emphasized that she looked forward to working with those at the press conference to advocate for a comprehensive portfolio of renewable energy sources in fact present at the press conference was a senior partner of a venture capital firm that invests in renewable energy companies yet if the focus of the ags is fraud such alignment of law enforcement sends the dangerous signal that companies in certain segments of the energy market need not worry about their misrepresentations that partner actually made the unsubstantiated claim at the press conference that global warming pollution was the reason for the spread of zika and other natural events like flooding in louisiana and arkansas and super storm sandy strange asked do these statements increase the value of clean energy investments offered for sale by kleiner perkins should these statements justify an investigation into all contributions to environmental non profits by kleiner perkins s partners should these questions be settled by our state courts under penalty of rico charges as strange and his fellow ags said may it never be strange admonished the clean power ags that what they were doing raised substantial first amendment concerns government investigations indicating that one side of the climate change debate should fear prosecution chills speech in violation of a formerly bi partisan first amendment consensus he cited supreme court justice louis brandeis s admonition in whitney v california27 that when faced with danger flowing from speech the remedy to be applied is more speech not enforced silence unfortunately here the remedy chosen by the clean power ags is silence through threat of subpoena according to strange investigations and targeting of dissenters and skeptics even before the march 29 press conference new york attorney general schneiderman had opened a securities fraud investigation of exxonmobil under the state s martin act over whether it misled the public and its shareholders over the supposed dangers of climate change schneiderman subpoenaed exxonmobil demanding extensive financial records emails and other documents to probe the company s knowledge and disclosures about climate change going back to the 1970s a legal expert at columbia university school of law merritt fox doubts that schneiderman s investigation will bear fruit since the martin act requires the state to show that a reasonable investor would not have bought or sold the company s stock if the investor had known about the omitted information but as fox says the market was well supplied with information about climate change and he would be amazed if what the exxon scientists knew was so different from what other scientists outside exxon knew and were publicly available that it would have affected the decision making of investors in fact exxonmobil has acknowledged climate change and its risks in numerous documents and filings such as a 2006 corporate citizenship report that states that the risk to society and ecosystems from rising greenhouse gas emission could prove to be significant and it is prudent to develop and implement strategies to address this risk california attorney general kamala harris launched a similar investigation of exxonmobil for supposedly lying to the public and shareholders about the risk of climate change and into whether such actions would involve securities fraud and violations of environmental laws her action was applauded by congressman ted lieu d ca who has sent letters to attorney general lynch and the securities and exchange commission urging them to open federal investigations of exxonmobil for securities fraud and violations of racketeering consumer protection truth in advertising public health and shareholder protection laws the virgin islands vs exxon mobil the competitive enterprise institute et al of the various probes being conducted by state ags the most information has been revealed about the investigation initiated by the attorney general of the u s virgin islands claude walker in april 2016 a private lawyer hired by walker linda singer of cohen milstein sellers toll served a subpoena on the competitive enterprise institute cei on behalf of the virgin islands ag in an investigation of exxonmobil cei is a non profit public policy institute that researches and publishes studies and reports on issues it believes are essential for entrepreneurship innovation and prosperity to flourish it is dedicated to the principles of limited government free enterprise and individual liberty cei is well known for its high quality objective research on energy and climate issues which clearly made it a target for walker the subpoena stated that it was issued as part of an investigation into exxonmobil s alleged violation of section 605 of the criminally influenced and corrupt organizations act which is the virgin islands version of the federal rico law specifically the investigation is over whether exxonmobil engaged in conduct misrepresenting its knowledge of the likelihood that its products and activities have contributed and are continuing to contribute to climate change in order to defraud the government of the united states virgin islands and consumers in the virgin islands in violation of 14 v i c 834 prohibiting obtaining money by false pretenses and 14 v i c 551 prohibiting conspiracy to obtain money by false pretenses the 14 page subpoena demanded that cei turn over all documents communications statements emails op eds speeches advertisement letters to the editor research reports studies and memoranda of any kind that referred to climate change greenhouse gases carbon tax climate science and other similar terms and issues in any way related to exxonmobil or the products sold by or activities carried out by exxonmobil directly or indirectly impact climate change the subpoena even demanded all of cei s text messages and communications on social networking platforms such as facebook google my space and twitter the time period covered 10 years starting in 1997 although the subpoena demanded all documents in effect during that time period too even if they were created before 1997 cei fought back against the subpoena sending an extensive objection to walker in the cover letter sent by cei s attorney andrew grossman he told the ag that the legal action targeting cei was a blatant attempt to intimidate and harass an organization for advancing views that you oppose in violation of the first amendment the subpoena was invalid because the underlying investigation is pretextual is being undertaken in bad faith is intended as a fishing expedition and is in support of an investigation of charges that have no likelihood of success further cei objected due to an interesting wrinkle in the investigation it turns out that walker was not actually conducting the investigation himself instead he had hired the same private law firm that employed linda singer cohen milstein sellers toll which has been called one of the most feared plaintiffs firms in the country on its own website the firm highlights a quote from inside counsel magazine that it is the most effective law firm in the united states for lawsuits with a strong social and political component cei claimed that the use of the private firm violated the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution because walker had delegated investigative and prosecutorial authority to private parties walker had also apparently made a substantive procedural error he had not properly domesticated the virgin islands subpoena in the district of columbia where cei is located under the applicable ordinance that requires that the subpoena be issued by a court of record rather walker had issued the subpoena himself thus the subpoena was defective on its face according to cei in addition to its objection cei filed a motion under the district of columbia s anti slapp act asking that walker s actions be dismissed and that attorneys fees and sanctions be awarded to cei against both walker and cohen milstein slapp stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation and is a law adopted by many states that is intended to stop the abuse of the legal process by plaintiffs who file lawsuits in order to punish or silence opposing points of view the district s law is meant to provide the target of a slapp lawsuit like cei with the ability to quickly dispense with litigation that has been filed to prevent it from communicating views to members of the public in connection with an issue of public interest the response filed by cohen milstein on behalf of attorney general walker demonstrated just how little basis there is for investigating exxonmobil or subpoenaing cei both walker and all of the ags united for clean power have made it clear that their investigations are based on fraud committed by exxonmobil in denying the existence or extent of man induced catastrophic climate change yet when pressed by cei in both its objection and its anti slapp motion to specifically cite the alleged fraud committed by exxonmobil the only response forthcoming from walker was two statements made by exxonmobil in a 2016 annual report and a 2014 investor guide international accords and underlying regional and national regulations for greenhouse gas reductions are evolving with uncertain timing and outcome making it difficult to predict their business impact current scientific understanding provides limited guidance on the likelihood magnitude and timeframe of physical risks such as sea level rise extreme weather events temperature extremes and precipitation these statements from exxonmobil simply express the current uncertainty that exists over the scope causes and pace of climate change and what the appropriate climate policy should be man induced catastrophic climate change is an unproven scientific theory not an indisputable fact the effects of and policy responses to climate change are matters of enormous controversy and disagreement and statements reflecting that cannot even remotely be considered as actionable fraud as the supreme court said in 2003 in illinois ex rel madigan v telemarketing associates inc simply labeling an action one for fraud does not carry the day and as referenced earlier such as in its 2006 corporate citizenship report exxonmobil has acknowledged climate change and its risks something that walker fails to mention in any of his pleadings or public statements likewise cei s experts have stated that the evidence supports the case for anthropogenic climate change but not the case for catastrophic warming and not for extreme policy measures that make society poorer and less able to adapt perhaps recognizing the legal jeopardy he was in as a result of the anti slapp action filed by cei walker withdrew his d c subpoena of cei soon after the motion was filed and then withdrew his original virgin islands subpoena just days after a hearing was held in the district of columbia court although cei s request for sanctions and attorneys fees against walker remains pending at the same time walker withdrew a subpoena he had sent to exxonmobil at its principal office in texas that subpoena was also the target of a lawsuit filed by exxonmobil in state court in texas in exxonmobil v walker the oil company sued both the u s virgin islands attorney general and his outside counsel cohen milstein claiming that walker s subpoena and so called investigation violated the company s constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures and due process of law and constitute the common law tort of abuse of process in its complaint exxonmobil pointed to the march press conference held by the state attorneys general and charged that the statements of the ags made it unmistakably clear that this was a politically motivated event urged on by activists intolerant of contrary views exxonmobil pointed out all of the factual and legal errors in walker s actions including the fact that the virgin islands rico law has a five year statute of limitations yet the company had no physical presence in the virgin islands it owns no property has no employees and has conducted no business operations in the virgin islands in the last five years thus walker had no jurisdiction over exxonmobil exxonmobil provided a concise clear description of what this investigation and subpoena were all about a pretextual use of law enforcement power to deter exxonmobil from participating in ongoing public deliberations about climate change and to fish through decades of exxonmobil s documents with the hope of finding some ammunition to enhance attorney general walker s position in the policy debate similar to cei the company also raised the issue that walker s hiring of cohen milstein on a contingency fee basis was a conflict of interest and impermissiblly delegated prosecutorial powers particularly given the fact that the law firm was pursuing an unconnected case against exxonmobil in federal court in the district of columbia and had already collected a 15 million contingency fee payment from walker in a second unrelated case according to exxonmobil this raises serious doubts about whether the firm should be allowed to serve as the disinterested prosecutor whose impartiality is demanded by law and expected by the public the oil giant asked the texas court to quash the subpoena and declare it an abuse of process the company s claims were bolstered when the attorneys general of both texas and alabama ken paxton and luther strange filed a joint plea in intervention asking the state court to allow them to intervene in the lawsuit the ags told the court that the sovereign power and investigative and prosecutorial authority of both states were implicated by the issues and tactics being used by walker and his contingency fee private attorney they accused walker of being driven by ideology and not law and colluding with cohen milstein it is disconcerting noted the ags that the apparent pilot of the discovery expedition is a private law firm that could take home a percentage of penalties if assessed available only to government prosecutors furthermore the ags stated their goal in intervening was to protect the fundamental right of impartiality in criminal and quasi criminal investigations the use of contingency fees raises serious due process considerations since they cut against the duty of impartiality by giving the attorney that represents the government a financial stake in the outcome contingency fees should not be used in criminal and quasi criminal cases like this one where a multitude of fundamental rights including speech lie in the balance faced with not only the opposition of exxonmobil but that of the texas and alabama attorneys general walker withdrew his subpoena and exxonmobil dismissed its lawsuit at the end of june through an open records request cei was apparently able to obtain a copy of the contingency fee agreement between walker and linda singer and attorneys at cohen milstein sellers toll the agreement executed by walker on april 13 2016 shows that walker obviously anticipated that he could potentially obtain hundreds of millions of dollars through these rico climate change prosecutions the agreement has a sliding scale for its payments to the law firm 27 percent of a recovery up to 100 million 22 percent of funds from 100 to 250 million and 18 percent of anything above 250 million given that exxonmobil for example has no assets or business in the u s virgin islands this agreement is simply staggering additionally the agreement appoints cohen milstein as a special assistant attorney general of the u s virgin islands and authorizes it to file pleadings and take other actions in the attorney general s name with the firm having day to day responsibility for the prosecution and conduct of the litigation giving a law firm that is motivated exclusively by profit the power to undertake law enforcement activities sue for damages and coerce settlements under government authority is extremely troubling as the supreme court has recognized scheme injecting a personal interest financial or otherwise into the enforcement process may bring irrelevant or impermissible factors into the prosecutorial decision and in some contexts raise serious constitutional questions it is particularly problematic when a governmental official stands to profit economically from vigorous enforcement here a private law firm has been appointed as a governmental official specifically so that it can profit notably if these legal efforts were to result in some other kind of relief that would appear to advance ag walker s stated aims for example if exxonmobil were to agree to run commercials on the risks of climate change to build a solar array or to fund research on renewable energy then cohen milstein would receive nothing at all its interest in the outcome of this investigation is purely pecuniary according to a detailed exposé in the new york times the boom in the contingency law business of state ags hiring private attorneys has been driven in part by lawyers such as ms singer who have capitalized on personal relationships with former colleagues that they have nurtured since leaving office often at resort destination conferences where they pay to gain access this practice where a single case can generate millions in payments to the law firm has gotten out of hand according to scott harshbarger the former democratic attorney general of massachusetts harshbarger says that it seriously threatens the perception of integrity and professionalism of the office as it raises the question of whether attorneys are taking up these cases because they are important public matters or they are being driven more by potential for private financial gain these same plaintiffs law firms have donated at least 9 8 million directly to state attorneys general and political groups related to attorneys general over the last decade according to the new york times report massachusetts v exxonmobil a similar battle is ongoing between exxonmobil and the current massachusetts attorney general maura healey healey was also a participant in the march press conference when she claimed there was no problem we need to worry about more than climate change because it threatens the very existence of our planet in april healey sent exxonmobil a voluminous civil investigative demand the equivalent of a subpoena similar to the one generated by claude walker seeking all of its research and communications with third parties on climate change among the institutions and organizations named in the cid were the competitive enterprise institute the heritage foundation the american enterprise institute the mercatus center at george mason university and even the acton institute for the study of religion and liberty healy claims this request is in connection with an investigation into whether exxonmobil has violated massachusetts general law m g l c 93a 2 unfair and deceptive practices in the marketing and sale of energy and other fossil fuel derived products to consumers as well as the sale of securities to investors exxonmobil has filed a petition in state court in suffok county in massachusetts asking that the cid be set aside or modified for the following reasons 1 the ag lacks jurisdiction over the company 2 the cid violates constitutional protections and 3 the cid constitutes an abuse of process exxonmobil has also asked the court to formally recuse healy from handling this case because her extrajudicial statements disparaging exxonmobil and prejudging the outcome of any investigation preclude her from serving as a disinterested prosecutor because healy s partisan statements also undermine the public s confidence in her conduct an independent counsel should be appointed to determine whether an investigation is warranted and if so to conduct that investigation the oil company also filed a separate lawsuit in federal court in texas in june seeking an injunction against healey barring the enforcement of the cid both cases are still pending the secret advocacy groups behind the attorney general inquisition one of the most intriguing and troubling aspects of the legal crusade against scientific dissent on climate change is the apparent involvement of certain advocacy organizations in pushing government prosecution of those who disagree with them on this issue for example in january 2016 the rockefeller family fund hosted a meeting in new york of about a dozen environmental activists the purpose of this meeting to organize this campaign against climate change dissent according to an agenda of the meeting viewed by the wall street journal the meeting s goals included to establish in public s mind that exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity and all creation toward climate chaos and grave harm and to delegitimize as a political actor part of the discussion of their grand strategy was how to include industry associations scientists and front groups in their targeting and at the top of their list for legal actions related campaigns was state ags this meeting was a coalescence of the legal and public relations strategy outlined in a workshop held in 2012 by the union of concerned scientists in california with two dozen leading scientists lawyers and legal scholars historians social scientists and public opinion experts which concluded that the tobacco litigation was the model that should be used for targeting carbon producers for u s focused climate mitigation the meeting was intended to forge a consensus on a strategy that incorporates legal action for document procurement and accountability with a narrative that creates public outrage following the january 2016 meeting in new york these anti fossil fuel activists engaged in meetings communications and briefings with some of the state ags according to internal emails and communications obtained by the energy environment legal institute through an open records request to the office of the vermont attorney general some of them secretly briefed state ags before their march press conference on arguments they could present to justify climate change litigation and the imperative of taking action now the ags and their staffs tried to hide their discussions and coordination with the activists who were labeled as outside advisors by using a common interest agreement sought to protect as privileged the discussions about defending president obama s controversial global warming rules and going after political opponents using the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico at one point matt pawa an environmental lawyer who was involved in these briefings contacted the offices of the new york and vermont ags after he was called by a wall street journal reporter pawa asked what he should say if the reporter inquired whether pawa was involved in the secret briefings eric srolovic from the new york ag s office told pawa that he should not confirm that pawa had attended or otherwise discuss the event when the involvement of these outside advisors was revealed congressman lamar smith r tx chairman of the u s house committee on science space and technology sent a letter to the groups including the union of concerned scientists greenpeace and the rockefeller family fund which had hosted the january planning meeting asking for copies of their communications with state ags over a coordinated strategy to target exxonmobil and other climate change dissenters smith and a dozen other committee members expressed their concern that these investigations were intended to silence speech and were based not on sound legal or scientific arguments but rather on a long term strategy developed by political activist organizations in an ironic legal twist that is apparently lost on them the environmental groups refused to comply with smith s request claiming it was a violation of their first amendment rights in a letter sent by the groups law firm the climate change activists said they could not in good faith comply with an illegitimate government request that encroaches so fundamentally on their protected constitutional rights apparently while these groups are entitled to claim free speech protections those who question an unproven scientific theory should not be able to claim the same protections in fact it is grossly irresponsible for such dissenters to invoke the first amendment at least according to yale university law school dean robert post state ags such as maryland s brian frosh also rejected smith s request asserting that the committee had no right to intrude upon the law enforcement actions of the chief legal officer of a sovereign state without apparently realizing that he was in essence confirming the relationship between the state ags and environmental activists frosh also claimed that smith had no right to scrutinize privileged internal deliberations or communications with private organizations the first amendment scientific debate and fraud investigations government prosecutors and the other participants in the crusade against exxonmobil and the think tanks researchers scientists and policy makers in the climate change debate argue the first amendment does not protect the supposedly fraudulent conduct of those who deny that catastrophic climate change is occurring and that man is the chief culprit for this problem they point to the successful tobacco litigation that obtained large settlements from tobacco companies for lying about the health effects of cigarettes senator whitehouse for example argues that the government s victory in the tobacco fraud lawsuit justifies going after climate change deniers because the fossil fuel industry s support for an array of groups that propagate climate change denial is identical to the tobacco industry s pattern of denial of the dangers of its products there is a fatal flaw in this false analogy it fails to distinguish between proven facts and unproven theory when the tobacco lawsuits were filed they were backed by decades of tests observations research and medical experience showing that without question tobacco contains carcinogens that cause cancer and that nicotine is a highly addictive drug proponents of climate change litigation have no such conclusive data upon which to rely moreover the speech at issue is not commercial speech about the suitability or safety of a particular product such as cigarettes but speech about matters of public policy and scientific debate the assertion by whitehouse that man induced catastrophic climate change is an irrefutable fact cannot be sustained by any objective review of the evidence as has been discussed there are many problems with this theory from computer models that have over predicted warming to data sets that disagree on whether the earth is warming at all or whether temperatures have plateaued and it is a matter of great uncertainty and vigorous debate over how much the climate is influenced by man made events as opposed to natural occurrences such as sun flares thus the claim that exxonmobil and presumably others have committed fraud that justifies these investigations cannot meet the most fundament legal element necessary to prove fraud a false statement of a material fact a statement of opinion such as whether climate change does or does not exist or whether there are any steps that can be taken to modify or reduce its risk is simply not actionable as courts have recognized if it is plain that a speaker is expressing a subjective view an interpretation a theory conjecture or surmise the statement is not actionable as cei said in one of its briefs advocacy opinion and expression of policy view do not lose their character as such or their constitutional protection even should they later turn out to be incorrect or should they omit some contrary fact or consideration that a government official believes ought to have been noted the claim by virgin islands ag claude walker that a statement such as current scientific understanding provides limited guidance on the likelihood magnitude and timeframe of physical risks such as sea level rise extreme weather events temperature extremes and precipitation in relation to climate change is a fraudulent statement of fact lacks merit the other elements of a fraud case are 1 knowledge by the defendant that his statement is false 2 intent by the defendant to deceive the victim 3 justifiable reliance by the victim on the false statement and 4 injury to the victim as a result of the fraud since speculations about whether climate change is occurring and what can be done about it are not facts the other elements of a fraud case do not even come into play even if the existence of man induced catastrophic climate change were a material fact what evidence could possibly be produced about reliance by consumers on exxonmobil s reasonable statements about climate change as the eleventh circuit court of appeals recently pointed out in a case construing the federal wire fraud statute even a lie is not actionable fraud if the defendant did not intend to harm the victim by obtaining something through the fraud to which the defendant is not entitled consumers buy exxonmobil s fossil fuel products like gasoline for their automobiles boats lawnmowers and other machines with internal combustion engines their justifiable reliance is that the company produces a product that will run their machines efficiently without damaging their engines the claim by government prosecutors that the state of the weather or the global climate has a material bearing on consumers decisions to purchase exxonmobil products as opposed to the quality of the products and their price relative to that of competing offerings sold by other companies such as shell or bp is neither reasonable nor justified the same is true of investors climate change has nothing to do with and is of no relevance to whether exxonmobil is able to find and refine oil at a price that will return a profit on the investments made by stockholders in the company new york ag schneiderman recently claimed that climate change means that exxonmobil will have to leave enormous amounts of oil reserves in the ground thus exxonmobil may be overstating their assets by trillions of dollars according to schneiderman which could amount to massive securities fraud but as exxonmobil has said if the company s forecast of its oil reserves is wrong that s not fraud that s wrong that is why we adjust our outlook every year and that s why we issue the annual forecast publicly so people can know the basis of our forecasting according to alan jeffers a spokesman for exxonmobil the amount of the reserves of untapped oil still underground will not change based on whether climate change is actually occurring jeffers says that allegations that it secretly developed a definitive understanding of climate change before the rest of the world s scientists are preposterous the serious first amendment issues raised by the targeting of exxonmobil and the subpoena served on the competitive enterprise institute as well as the effort of state ags to obtain all communications with third party think tanks foundations universities researchers and scientists are matters of paramount concern as the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit said in 2003 compelled disclosure of political affiliations and activities can impose just as substantial a burden on first amendment rights as can direct regulation conclusion the state ags are targeting for investigation those whom they consider to be promoting heresy questioning the legitimacy of the unproven theory of man induced catastrophic climate change their charges of fraud do not meet even the most minimal legal standards applicable to such investigations and their public statements make it clear they are interested in achieving political changes in public policy through the courts rather than the legislative process where such changes should be debated and discussed and following such debate any potential changes can then be implemented through the democratic system rather than judicial fiat such an approach is particularly important when the economic consequences of such policy changes are as significant as those associated with all of the momentous and far reaching measures being proposed by those who believe that climate change is the single most significant threat facing the future of humanity the first amendment protects not just exxonmobil but also cei and numerous other organizations and individuals from being forced to disclose their internal communications internal work product research writings and other communications on a public policy issue as controversial as climate change subpoenas intended to retaliate against and chill the speech of those advocating a point of view with which these state ags disagree are a misuse of prosecutorial resources that offends the first amendment the vague nature of the fraud allegations made and the voluminous character of the subpoenas show that these ags seem to be engaged in a massive fishing expedition in fact a strong case can be made that the investigations are pretextual and undertaken in bad faith as the courts have said they will quash subpoenas that are not issued in good faith and that are intended as a fishing expedition what is going on here certainly seems to meet that standard is a senior legal fellow in the edwin meese iii center for legal and judicial studies at the heritage foundation is herbert and

it was another tough week for the crypto tokens as traded in a narrow band around 20 000the entire week the longest stretch that it has dipped under that level since the market was rocked by turmoil in july investors continue to debate the implications of rising borrowing rates for riskier assets after the fed chair s hawkish commentary bitcoin is down roughly 60 this year and some other tokens have lost even more other cryptocurrencies including polkadot and dogecoin also declined however ether was surging in anticipation of a groundbreaking software upgrade to its blockchain here s a weekly roundup of all the noteworthy stories from the crypto space users of instagram and facebook can now display their nfts on the platform according to a recent announcement from meta this comes after a meta update at the beginning of august that said they were extending the 100 nations in africa asia pacific the middle east and the americas that are a part of their instagram nft project adding to that the social media giant turned metaverse proponent announced on monday that users will be able to upload digital collectable assets by connecting their nft wallets to either facebook or

newsom the digital financial assets law also known as california s bitlicense is modelled after the 2015 implemented bitlicense law in new york if democratic governor gavin newsom signs it california s law would take effect in january 2025 while the newness of cryptocurrency is part of what makes investing exciting it also makes it riskier for consumers because cryptocurrency businesses are not adequately regulated and do not have to follow many of the same rules that apply to everyone else assembly member timothy grayson d concord the bill s sponsor said in a prior statement one of the

privacy both financial and personal is a key component of life in a free society unlike in totalitarian or authoritarian regimes individuals in free societies have a private sphere free of government involvement surveillance and control the united states constitution s bill of rights particularly the fourth fifth and ninth amendments together with structural federalism and separation of powers protections is designed to further that end by protecting individual rights the current financial regulatory framework is inconsistent with these principles in general individuals should have control over who has access to information about their personal and financial lives individuals should be free to lead their lives unmolested and unsurveilled by government unless there is a reasonable suspicion that they have committed a crime or conspired to commit a crime any information sharing regime must include serious safeguards to protect the privacy of individuals and businesses financial privacy is especially vital because it can be the difference between survival and systematic suppression of an opposition group in a country with an authoritarian government many businesses dissidents and human rights groups maintain accounts outside the countries where they are active for precisely this reason financial privacy can allow people to protect their life savings when a government tries to confiscate its citizens wealth whether for political ethnic religious or merely economic reasons businesses need to protect their private financial information intellectual property and trade secrets from competitors in order to remain profitable financial privacy is of deep and abiding importance to freedom and many governments have shown themselves willing to routinely abuse private financial information many government agencies in both the u s and other countries are currently involved in collecting and disseminating private individuals information for the purpose of conducting their national security law enforcement and tax administration functions the unique requirements for fulfilling each of these purposes dictate certain policy choices for designing an optimal financial privacy regime the current u s framework is overly complex and burdensome and its ad hoc nature has likely impeded efforts to combat terrorism enforce laws and collect taxes efforts to improve the existing framework must focus on protecting individuals privacy rights while improving law enforcement s ability to apprehend and prosecute criminals and terrorists reform efforts also need to focus on costs versus benefits the current framework particularly the anti money laundering aml rules is clearly not cost effective as demonstrated below the aml regime costs an estimated 4 8 billion to 8 billion annually yet this aml system results in fewer than 700 convictions annually a proportion of which are simply additional counts against persons charged with other predicate crimes thus each conviction costs approximately 7 million potentially much more this backgrounder recommends several major reforms for fixing the u s financial privacy framework such as eliminating burdensome reporting requirements raising certain reporting thresholds exempting crowdfunding from aml rules and instituting federal pre emption of state regulation of money transmission businesses in addition the senate should not ratify the protocol amending the multilateral convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters the current system complex costly overlapping and duplicative the list of national and international agencies and national laws and international agreements governing financial information exchange and reporting has grown preposterously long for instance there are more than 100 foreign financial intelligence units fius around the world a role filled in the united states by the treasury department s financial crimes enforcement network fincen fius typically exchange financial information with their international counterparts based on national legislation and regulations private entities are required to collect and report voluminous information under the bank secrecy act reporting provisions designed to enforce the aml laws and the know your customer kyc requirements over 90 countries participate in either the original or amended multilateral convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters the u s has bilateral income tax treaties protocols and tax information exchange agreements with approximately 70 countries in addition private entities must provide a wide variety of information to the internal revenue service irs with respect to both domestic and foreign operations in fiscal year fy 2015 more than 2 6 billion information returns were filed with the irs both u s and foreign financial institutions must report on the financial activities of their u s customers under both the foreign account tax compliance act fatca and the qualified intermediary rules in addition the terrorism related information sharing environment a center within the office of the director of national intelligence involves approximately 18 000 federal state local and tribal government agencies the federal bureau of investigation criminal justice information services division operates a national data exchange and other programs interpol maintains various information sharing databases that are made available to its 190 members the current system s mind numbing complexity and ad hoc nature impedes the effectiveness of governments efforts to combat terrorism enforce the laws and collect taxes and it imposes substantial costs on the private sector for instance the current framework requires financial firms to file millions of reports each year even though records show that there are only approximately 2 000 aml investigations per year similarly the wide discretion given to fincen to change reporting thresholds and requirements predisposes financial institutions to err on the side of filing too many reports rather than risk legal liability the current approach essentially focused on collecting as much information as possible has led to the creation of multiple expensive and overlapping national and international bureaucracies there is little doubt that the current system pays inadequate attention to the core values that underpin all free societies or to the cost effectiveness of ever increasing demands for more information reporting re evaluating uncritical information exchange the first business of government is to protect the life liberty and property of its citizens accordingly international information sharing directed at preventing terrorism crime and fraud is an important and appropriate function of government however all governments cannot be trusted to share the goals of protecting life liberty and property and upholding the rule of law so u s policymakers must be careful about deciding with whom to share information corruption and ideology make information sharing with some governments highly problematic shared information can be used to oppress political opponents to support terrorism to identify kidnapping targets to facilitate financial fraud to enable identity theft to further industrial espionage or for other nefarious purposes the ongoing abuse of interpol red notices for political purposes by authoritarian governments provides a stark lesson in the dangers of the uncritical reliance on institutions created to promote information sharing information sharing for law enforcement purposes should be limited to actions that a liberal democratic state would regard as criminal terrorism violent crime and fraud would clearly meet this test while speaking out against one s government peaceful political or labor organizing gambling homosexual behavior and tax evasion would not no liberal democratic government should share or be required to share information for the purposes of enforcing laws that criminalize behavior that is not illegal under the laws of the government from which the information is being requested this is sometimes known as the principle of dual criminality and it should be adhered to in any information sharing arrangement it is also true that many governments exploit or are complicit in exploiting information sharing arrangements for inappropriate commercial purposes such as industrial espionage or to further government confiscation or extortion therefore any information exchange regime must limit this risk and protect the commercial interests of participating countries any information sharing regime needs to include serious safeguards to protect the privacy of both individuals and businesses currently these safeguards are lax at best and the u s should take the lead internationally to strengthen protections rather than succumb to international bureaucracies efforts to weaken privacy rights a separate type of information sharing deals with cross country agreements to share tax information tax information sharing one reason that tax sharing agreements pose a unique set of challenges is that tax evasion is not a crime in many liberal democratic states instead tax evasion is often treated as a civil violation naturally the public benefit of preventing terrorist attacks or violent crime is greater than the benefit of preventing a civil violation such as tax evasion therefore the willingness to impose costs on the private sector and to violate the privacy interests of ordinary people should be less in the case of information sharing for tax purposes than for the purposes of preventing terrorism or crime moreover tax information sharing programs are quite often a veiled attempt to stifle tax competition from low tax jurisdictions tax competition is salutary and limits the degree to which governments can impose unwarranted taxation furthermore poorly constructed tax sharing agreements put americans private financial information at risk and the risk is highest for internationally active american businesses to safeguard citizens rights u s tax return information under current law may only be lawfully disclosed to a foreign government pursuant to a ratified treaty authorizing the information exchange the u s is currently party to a network of bilateral tax treaties and tax information exchange agreements and the multilateral convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters a treaty agreed to on january 25 1988 and entered into force in 1995 article 4 of the original convention states the parties shall exchange any information in particular as provided in this section that is foreseeably relevant to the assessment and collection of tax and the recovery and enforcement of tax claims however article 5 provides that this obligation must be fulfilled only upon request by a government for information referred to in article 4 which concerns particular persons or transactions emphasis added article 6 permits but does not require automatic exchange of information article 22 contains provisions designed to protect the privacy of the information exchanged by the contracting states separately countries around the world have entered into more than 500 bilateral tax information exchange agreements modeled on the organization for economic co operation and development s oecd s model agreement on exchange of information on tax matters this model agreement released in 2002 is a nonbinding instrument meant to serve as a standard of effective exchange of information for the purposes of the oecd s initiative on harmful tax practices article 5 of the model agreement makes it clear that the information must be provided only upon request and that automatic provision of the information is not required article 8 of the oecd model contains privacy protections recent sharing proposals endanger financial privacy the u s senate is currently considering the protocol amending the multilateral convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters which would impose a wide variety of new information reporting requirements on financial institutions to help foreign governments collect their taxes a second treaty worse than this protocol is the follow on oecd treaty known as the multilateral competent authority agreement on automatic exchange of financial account information this follow on treaty implements both the protocol and the 311 page oecd standard for automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters together the protocol the multilateral competent authority agreement and the oecd standard constitute the three main parts of a new automatic information exchange regime being promoted by the oecd and international tax bureaucrats if the u s ratifies the protocol and implements the new oecd standard washington would automatically and in bulk ship private financial and tax information including social security and other tax identification numbers to argentina china colombia indonesia kazakhstan nigeria russia and nearly 70 other countries in other words foreign governments that are hostile to the u s corrupt or have inadequate data safeguards would automatically have access to private financial and other information of some u s taxpayers and most foreigners with accounts in the u s this new regime would also add yet another layer to the voluminous compliance requirements imposed on financial institutions hitting small banks and broker dealers especially hard compliance burden for banks and financial institutions financial privacy necessarily deals with financial transaction data so many federal rules deal with firms transferring money these rules which often impose heavy compliance costs on companies are spread throughout several sections of the u s code but they generally apply to financial institutions as defined by title 31 u s code 5312 most of these regulations are aml and kyc rules and they are primarily enforced by fincen other than banks broadly defined securities dealers and insurance companies the u s code now identifies many non financial firms as financial institutions including government agencies casinos pawnbrokers jewelry shops travel agencies car dealers and real estate companies broker dealers must also comply with the financial industry regulatory authority rule 3310 which sets forth minimum standards for a firm s written aml compliance program title 18 of the u s code prohibits the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business and also prohibits the knowing transfer of funds derived from or intended for criminal activity title 18 considers a business unlicensed if it fails to comply with federal money transmitting business registration requirements or if it operates without a state license if one is required additionally title 31 of the u s code requires money transmitting businesses to register with the u s secretary of the treasury banks and other financial institutions are also required to comply with a complex set of tax information reporting requirements administered by the irs according to a search of the legal information institute s version of the u s code and the code of federal regulations cfr the term money laundering occurs 72 times in the code and 185 times in the cfr many of these rules have their genesis in the bank secrecy act bsa of 1970 an act originally aimed at deterring foreign banks from laundering criminal proceeds and helping people evade federal income taxes the bsa was little used until it was amended by the money laundering control act of 1986 an explicit component of the federal war on drugs and organized crime in the wake of 9 11 the usa patriot act levied new rules on an expanded list of financial institutions and also imposed stricter due diligence and aml requirements essentially the bsa aml rules ensure that firms cannot legally transfer any money without knowing who the customer is and having some idea of where the money came from the bsa gave banks an affirmative duty to report to the department of the treasury cash transactions of more than 10 000 and it criminalized the failure to report such transactions adjusted for inflation to 2015 dollars this amount represents more than 60 000 but the threshold has never been adjusted for inflation banks must electronically file a currency transaction report ctr for any deposit withdrawal exchange or other payment or transfer of more than 10 000 by through or to the bank financial institutions are also required to report multiple currency transactions conducted by or on behalf of one person that aggregate to more than 10 000 in any single day aside from the fact that fincen has the discretion to lower the 10 000 threshold the regulations go well beyond the basic 10 000 threshold ctrs banks for instance have a 5 000 threshold for filing suspicious activity reports sars other financial institutions such as casinos also have the 5 000 sar threshold and most money service businesses msbs have a 2 000 sar threshold additionally some states have extended aml rules and have given casinos a 3 000 multiple transaction log mtl threshold moreover all financial institutions regarded as msbs must obtain and record specific information for all transfers of at least 3 000 and all currency exchangers must track any exchange that exceeds 1 000 in either domestic or foreign currency federal regulators also require financial institutions to institute formal compliance programs for the bsa aml rules and regulators heavily micromanage this process for guidance the federal financial institutions examination council publishes a 442 page examination manual that outlines procedures and requirements for a bsa aml compliance program the manual includes an overview of for example an appropriate customer identification program cip as well as customer due diligence cdd policies procedures and processes section 326 of the usa patriot act requires each bank to have a written cip that is appropriate for its size and type of business and that includes certain minimum requirements the cip is mandated to enable banks to form a reasonable belief that they know the true identity of each customer effective cdd programs on the other hand are meant to enable banks to comply with regulatory requirements and to report suspicious activity additionally section 1073 of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act gave the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb certain regulatory responsibilities for remittance transfers specifically dodd frank amended the electronic fund transfer act to create a new comprehensive consumer protection regime for remittance transfers sent by consumers in the united states to individuals and businesses in foreign countries combined these rules impose large costs on financial institutions many of which have decided to stop offering certain services rather than deal with the additional compliance burden or risk being held liable for criminal activity cost and benefits of bsa aml rules the original goal of the bsa aml rules was to reduce predicate crimes such as illegal drug distribution rather than money laundering itself judged by this standard very little empirical evidence suggests that the rules have worked as designed in fact even though bsa aml rules have been expanded consistently throughout the past four decades it remains difficult to discern any net benefit of the overall bsa aml regulatory framework even though there is no clear evidence that the rules materially reduce crime the bsa aml bureaucracy began relentlessly expanding internationally primarily through the financial action task force fatf more than two decades ago one comprehensive study reports that even though the fatf proceeds as if these rules have produced only public benefits o date there is no substantial effort by any international organization including the international monetary fund to assess either the costs or benefits of this regulatory framework in fact bsa aml regulations have been sharply criticized as a costly ineffective approach to reducing crime the rules have also been criticized for being overly intrusive and elaborate and for distorting the classical constructions of criminal law and criminal procedure the available evidence even suggests that the bsa aml framework has forced financial firms to report so much information that it has made law enforcement more difficult because the information overload has reduced the reporting regime s effectiveness at uncovering crime the growth in the reporting volume to law enforcement shows where the information overload has taken place for instance the annual number of sars filed in the u s was only 52 000 in 1996 and had jumped to 689 414 by 2004 in 2013 u s depository institutions banks filed almost 1 million sars and separately msbs filed nearly 800 000 sars in 2014 sar filings totaled 1 7 million and 916 709 were filed in the first half of 2015 a pace of 1 8 million annually in 2001 roughly 13 million ctrs were filed with fincen as shown in table 1 fincen reported more than 15 million ctr filings in 2014 a considerably slower growth rate than for sars the total volume of bsa aml filings has reached enormous proportions for instance in 2015 the fincen director announced that the agency receives approximately 55 000 electronically filed bsa reports from more than 80 000 financial institutions and 500 000 individual foreign bank account holders each day aside from any possible benefits in crime reduction research suggests that compliance costs are high for financial companies with a disproportionate burden falling on smaller firms for instance federal reserve researchers report that compliance costs are especially burdensome for smaller banks where hiring even one additional employee can lower the return on assets by more than 20 basis points other research suggests that the increasing compliance burden in the banking industry is at least partly responsible for the trend toward consolidation and the disappearance of smaller banks though it is merely one example an american bankers association aba publication highlights a small bank that reports it has to dedicate more than 15 percent of its employees to compliance related tasks an aba survey also suggests that the cumulative cost associated with compliance has caused banks to offer fewer services and raise fees thus harming consumers for example almost 20 percent of the banks subject to the cfpb s new remittance rules plan to simply stop providing remittance services while 42 percent intend to raise fees to cover the additional compliance costs aside from these direct costs banks have likely endured the cost of losing law abiding customers who do not want to provide personal information though this cost is difficult to quantify there seems to be little attention paid by either fincen or congress to how high these compliance costs have become table 2 provides an estimate of these costs the estimates are primarily based on the office of management and budget omb office of information and regulatory analysis burden hour estimates for the information collection requirements the hours are then monetized using bureau of labor statistics information about compliance personnel salaries using these figures the total bsa aml costs are estimated to be between 4 8 billion and 8 billion annually it is important to note that this estimate is probably a significant underestimate of the actual burden for example the omb estimates that fincen s future commission merchants and introducing brokers customer identification requirements can be met in two minutes per customer an assumption which is at the least questionable the omb makes a similar estimate regarding the broker dealers customer identification program furthermore other government agencies notably the department of justice and the irs expend resources enforcing these laws although so far as the authors know these two agencies do not report the costs they incur from enforcing aml laws thus only fincen s budget is included in this backgrounder s cost estimates furthermore the cost of funds provided by the u s government to international organizations such as the fatf is not considered in the estimate to summarize the table 2 cost estimates are only with respect to bsa aml compliance costs they do not include costs relating to information reporting for tax purposes nor do they include compliance costs due to other banking or securities regulations tables 3 4 and 5 provide data related to money laundering investigations indictments and sentences from the fbi irs and the u s sentencing commission these government sources frequently provide inconsistent information about money laundering crimes but the overall crime statistics cast serious doubt on the efficiency of the bsa aml requirements the fbi reports a downward trend in money laundering investigations from 548 in 2007 to 303 in 2011 see table 3 there were only 37 indictments and 45 convictions in 2011 using fbi data those 45 convictions cost society between 107 million and 178 million per conviction an absurdly low return on the billions in costs incurred by the private sector the irs initiated between 1 300 and 1 600 money laundering investigations in fiscal years fys 2013 2014 and 2015 see table 4 in fy 2015 the irs investigations resulted in 691 people being sentenced even making the heroic assumption that all 691 money laundering sentences reported by the irs were prosecutions that would not have occurred but for the aml statutes and using the low end of the estimated costs of the aml regime these prosecutions have a cost of at least 7 million each the u s sentencing commission reports that 667 money laundering sentences were handed down in 2015 a decrease from 896 in 2006 see table 5 this figure is slightly less than the 691 reported by the irs however for 2014 the sentencing commission shows 885 sentences compared to the irs figure of 785 regardless these figures are reasonably close to each other and they indicate that the typical number of sentences for aml offenses is fairly low another mitigating factor is that many of these aml sentences were in addition to sentences for the underlying predicate crime separately in fy 2015 fincen issued 12 civil money penalties thus on the surface these cases seem like a clear misallocation of law enforcement resources it is difficult to believe that this regulatory framework is the most effective use of scarce law enforcement and private sector resources yet fincen has not been subject to any meaningful cost benefit analysis and federal and international bureaucracies keep adding additional costs and burdens it is long past the time to change this approach after having increasingly forced financial institutions into a quasi law enforcement role for more than four decades federal agencies should be able to easily point to direct net benefits the available evidence suggests however that the bsa aml regime has been a highly inefficient law enforcement tool at the very least a high degree of skepticism about further expansion of these and similar requirements is in order given the billions of dollars spent annually by the private sector on the existing elaborate and costly aml bureaucracy a serious data driven cost benefit analysis of the existing system is warranted based on the evidence publicly available the current regime is unlikely to withstand a rigorous analysis lastly the international monetary fund imf has found that the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships by western banks with developing country banks is having a macro economically significant adverse impact in much of the developing world and endangers financial stability this development limits international trade and access to credit financial intermediation is important to financial prosperity and economic development the imf staff finds that this development is largely due to the regulatory risk the risk of enforcement penalties and high compliance costs caused by the aml regulatory regime and tax transparency initiatives such as fatca and the fatf s black list bsa aml rules threaten fintech applications the effect that these rules have on emerging financial services technologies known as fintech should also be considered when assessing the cost and benefit of the bsa aml regulatory framework one major problem is that financial services firms entrepreneurs and even regulators are still learning how these new technologies can be used it is clear however that bsa aml rules have contributed to existing firms hesitancy to use certain technologies thus slowing down their implementation for example traditional banks have been reluctant to develop the blockchain technologies spawned by bitcoin and even to work with blockchain based companies in particular the pseudo anonymous nature of bitcoin transactions has been a challenge for complying with bsa aml laws even though bitcoin transactions are completed with an electronic address they do not include the name or any other direct information about the person sending or receiving bitcoins naturally pseudo anonymous transactions pose a challenge for complying with know your customer laws furthermore the treasury s recent request for public input on expanding access to credit through online marketplace lending shows that it is clearly contemplating greater regulation of online lenders a relatively new form of financial intermediary title iii of the jumpstart our business startups jobs act created an exemption from registration under the securities act for equity crowdfunding that allows entrepreneurs to raise capital using the internet in addition to broker dealers congress created a more lightly regulated category of intermediary called a funding portal on which entrepreneurs may list their offerings fincen has proposed a rule titled amendments to the definition of broker or dealer in securities treating these funding portals as broker dealers for aml purposes even though they are not broker dealers similar rules were proposed and then rejected by the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority rejecting such rules is the right approach because funding portals do not handle customer funds the jobs act prohibits funding portals from doing so however the banks and broker dealers that do handle customer funds must comply with bsa aml rules thus the proposed rules quite literally impose duplicative and overlapping requirements they require both the financial institution holding customer funds and the funding portal despite the fact that funding portals cannot hold customer funds to perform the same function for aml purposes with respect to the same customer funds it is inappropriate to require funding portals to comply with these rules because the ability of the funding portal to engage in or facilitate money laundering does not exist to any meaningful degree and the costs of complying with these rules are likely so high as to make funding portals uneconomical implementing such rules will result in a situation where the only intermediaries are broker dealers thus frustrating the intention of congress to establish a more lightly regulated intermediary class as with all financial services activities it is critical that personal and financial privacy and compliance costs remain key concerns as policymakers design new regulations for funding portals and all other fintech applications the principle of federalism potentially complicates these matters because each u s state has the ability to create its own set of regulations for fintech firms regarding the state federal relationship 31 u s code 5330 a 3 explicitly states that it does not supersede any requirement of state law relating to money transmitting businesses operating in such state congress should consider the possible benefits of pre empting state registration requirements for money transmission businesses because the technological changes of the past few decades ensure that any money transmitter regardless of the state in which it is domiciled can easily transfer funds around the entire globe a better means of international information sharing the primary goals of international information sharing should be to promote law enforcement combat terrorism and prevent and punish fraud in a manner consistent with the principles of a free society a better means of achieving these goals is to replace the current patchwork of international agreements with a well considered integrated international convention that ensures robust information sharing for the purposes of preventing terrorism crime and fraud but also provides enforceable legal protections for the financial and other privacy interests of member states citizens and the legitimate commercial interests of their businesses membership in this convention should be restricted to governments that 1 are democratic representative democracies with legitimate elections and protections for political minorities 2 respect free markets private property and the rule of law 3 can be expected to always use the information in a manner consistent with the security interests of the member states and 4 have in law and in practice adequate safeguards to prevent the information from being obtained by hostile parties or used for inappropriate commercial political or other purposes such an arrangement would facilitate law enforcement and anti terrorist aims by allowing more information to be exchanged safely and more expeditiously it would also provide for the first time enforceable legal protections for the rights of citizens of the member states regardless the senate should not ratify the protocol amending the multilateral convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters doing so would lead to substantially more transnational identity theft crime industrial espionage financial fraud and the suppression of political opponents and religious or ethnic minorities by authoritarian and corrupt governments ratifying the protocol would put americans private financial information at risk and the risk would be highest for american businesses involved in international commerce seven policy reforms congress should direct the department of justice in consultation with the irs and fincen to annually report the number of aml referrals prosecutions and convictions including those that were made without a simultaneous prosecution for a predicate crime and the number of occasions where bsa aml customer requirements lead to a criminal prosecution or conviction for a non money laundering crime to the extent possible the data should report retroactively for the previous 10 years congress should instruct both the government accountability office and fincen to undertake a rigorous data driven cost benefit analysis of the current bsa aml regime that examines the costs incurred by government financial institutions and others and compares them to the benefits of the regime the cost estimates should be based on a survey of firms that must comply with the current bsa aml framework congress should eliminate currency transaction reports ctrs altogether and streamline the reporting process so that suspicious activity reports sars are the only reporting mechanism alternatively if congress decides to maintain ctrs the ctr threshold should be adjusted for inflation from 10 000 to 60 000 the use of cash should not be criminalized and it makes little sense to continue collecting millions of reports on lawful transactions congress should also adjust the sar threshold to 60 000 so that financial institutions do not have to file reports on small transactions congress should provide that funding portals are exempt from bsa aml requirements since they are prohibited from holding customer funds and the financial institutions that do hold customer funds must undertake bsa aml compliance as a replacement for the current patchwork of existing arrangements the united states should draft and promote a well considered integrated international convention that ensures robust information sharing for the purposes of preventing terrorism crime and fraud but also provides enforceable legal protections for the financial and other privacy interests of member states citizens and the legitimate commercial interests of their businesses membership in this convention should be restricted to governments that fulfill the four requirements listed above they must 1 be democratic 2 respect markets private property and the rule of law 3 only use the information in a manner consistent with the security interests of the member states and 4 have safeguards to prevent the information from being obtained by hostile parties or used inappropriately congress should pre empt state regulation of money transmission businesses these businesses are engaging in interstate commerce and there should be one uniform regulatory regime for reducing compliance costs and avoiding duplicative regulations this is particularly true given the heavy level of federal regulation in this area the cfpb should be eliminated through repeal of title x of dodd frank title x of the dodd frank act created the cfpb an independent federal agency whose regulatory authority is neither well defined nor fixed the cfpb is imbued with unparalleled powers over virtually every consumer financial product and service and it could easily create rules that extend the bsa aml regime under the pretense of protecting consumers conclusion financial privacy is a key component of life in a free society and the u s system of government was designed to ensure individuals a private sphere free of government involvement surveillance and control the current u s financial regulatory framework has expanded so much that it now threatens this basic element of freedom for instance individuals who engage in cash transactions of more than a small amount trigger a general suspicion of criminal activity and financial institutions of all kinds including jewelry stores have to report such transactions regulations have imposed an enormous compliance burden on these firms and the companies have essentially been forced into a quasi law enforcement role the cost estimates provided in this backgrounder suggest that the current regulatory framework is unlikely to withstand a rigorous cost benefit analysis for instance the costs of the current u s bsa aml regime are estimated to be between 4 8 billion and 8 billion annually at least 7 million for each aml conviction nonetheless the bsa aml framework has expanded for the past few decades without any meaningful cost benefit analysis of these rules since the current framework appears grossly cost ineffective congress should require regulators to develop better information about the costs and benefits of the current regime internationally the u s has signed a treaty and is engaged in further talks that would allow hostile countries access to american citizens private financial information the u s should not ratify the protocol amending the multilateral convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters the primary goals of international information sharing should be to promote law enforcement according to the principles of a democratic society combat terrorism and prevent and punish crime and fraud the current patchwork of international agreements fails to accomplish these goals and the overly complex and burdensome financial regulatory framework has likely impeded efforts to meet these goals this backgrounder recommends seven reforms that would better protect individuals privacy rights and improve law enforcement s ability to apprehend and prosecute criminals and terrorists david r burton is senior fellow in economic

logistical shortfalls could force kiev and nato to change strategy mark t kimmitt warns in an op ed for the wsj sustaining the conflict in ukraine is becoming increasingly difficult for nato so kiev must think about negotiating with moscow retired us army brigadier general mark t kimmitt has said in an opinion piece for the wall street journal washington s latest military aid package to kiev last month included older and less advanced systems which may indicate that battlefield consumption rates have outpaced production to a point where excess inventories provided to ukraine are nearly exhausted kimmitt pointed out in his article on thursday dealing with dwindling stocks of leading edge weapon systems in nato countries would likely mean a prolonged conflict between ukraine and russia such a scenario could result in more pressure from supporting nations sustained inflation less heating gas and falling popular support in the west he wrote kimmitt who served as assistant secretary of state for political military affairs in 2008 09 suggested four ways to speed up the resolution of the conflict which has now been underway for six months the first option is to dig deeper into nato stockpiles and send arms to kiev that have so far been withheld by members due to their own national defense requirements the retired general suggested that s something eu countries may be willing to do as it s better to use these weapons in kherson than krakow he added the us and its european allies could also try ramping up production of the systems that are required by the zelensky government kimmitt said acknowledging that such a move would unlikely have an immediate effect on the situation on the ground the third option is to step up the conflict by providing ukraine with longer range systems such as atacm missiles f 16 jets and patriots and broaden the rules of engagement to attack targets in crimea and possibly russia he wrote however the retired general warned that such escalation would definitely face a response from moscow and create the risk of conflict spilling into europe the final available solution according to kimmitt is for ukraine to push for an interim diplomatic resolution without or with territorial concessions there is little incentive to negotiate at the moment but ukrainian president vladimir zelensky must recognize that diminishing resupplies would have a disastrous effect on his army not merely for battlefield operations but for the message of declining outside support it would send to the people of ukraine he insisted beginning the diplomatic resolution would be distasteful and perhaps seen as defeatist but as there is little chance of climbing out of the current morass it may be better to negotiate now than later the retired general said the two sides haven t sat down at the negotiating table since talks in istanbul in late march moscow which had initially been optimistic about the prospects for the peace process later accused kiev of backtracking on all the progress that had been achieved in turkey and said it had lost all trust in the ukrainian negotiators russian officials warned that moscow s demands would be more extensive if talks were to resume rt com
skyrocketing prices for electricity gas and grain are putting an existential burden on germany s many bakeries only large chains and successful artisan bakeries are likely to survive says one baker in bonn if you want to buy what many believe is the most delicious bread in the city of bonn you have to plan well ahead that s because the line in front of the max kugel bakery is long the prices are high too the cost of a wholewheat loaf has just gone up by 80 cents to 6 60 6 56 that s about 2 more than the competition charges but max kugel s customers in bonn s affluent südstadt district are buying his wares as if the ukraine war and its impact on electricity gas and grain prices never happened the 32 year old bakery owner is a little surprised i always expect a loss of sales when there are price increases but we don t see a decrease at all it was rather surprising that even during the hot summer months we still sold a lot of bread he told dw despite price increases baker max kugel is bucking the trend and still doing good business image oliver pieper dw the bakery boasts huge high consumption ovens that run on electricity and gas prices of flour and grain are shooting through the roof then there s the fierce competition with the many discounters and large bakery chains selling bread and rolls at much cheaper prices in germany of all places where bread is seen as much as a cultural asset as goethe football or mercedes benz it s hard to imagine traditional bakeries being forced to close their doors but many of them are already calling for a government bailout only the very big and the very small will manage to survive kugel predicts with 13 employees working the oven and the counter he views his bakery as a small business although kugel would certainly have what it takes to expand his concept which is embodied by his slogan we only do bread da wo s nur brot gibt written across each of the white paper bags used to package the loaves every day the bakery makes 10 types of bread without preservatives and premixes no cakes no croissants kugel s business model is to focus on the essentials this focus is the recipe for success for me he said kugel has 13 employees who make and sell organic bread in his bonn shop image oliver pieper dw growing up in his parents bakery as a young child kugel would play in his parents bakery where he would later complete his vocational training his life was mapped out right from the start at some point he would take over his parents bakery but then he embarked on what he called his road to bakery which took him to vancouver san francisco and london he decided to do things his own way in 2017 he took out a loan for 200 000 and invested in specialist equipment today five years later he sees his business as crisis proof it has a size that enables me to react well to market developments and that is a very reassuring feeling we are flexible we can decide to leave out one type of bread at short notice and increase the production of others a bit if i had five 10 or 20 stores right now i would have a problem i couldn t handle skyrocketing grain prices it s not that increased energy and grain prices aren t giving kugel a headache at the end of september the annual electricity bill will arrive in his mailbox with what is expected to be an exorbitant increase kugel s bakery can react quickly to any sudden shortage of a particular grain image oliver pieper dw the young entrepreneur had the foresight to raise his prices four weeks ago it was only the second time he had increased prices since since the company was founded there are also surcharges for rye wheat and spelt as well as sunflower and pumpkin seeds we aren t dependent on conventional flour which is often made from ukrainian grain we buy organic grain from germany but here farmers held back their grain and waited for the price to go up on the commodity markets and only then did they release the grain to the mills he said germany has around 10 000 bakeries with total sales worth almost 15 billion the bakery trade is one of the country s most important economic sectors in the land of bread lovers each household consumes an average of 56 kilograms 123 pounds of bread and baked goods every year according to the central bakers association but kugel shakes his head in disbelief when he hears calls for the state to come to the aid of the struggling industry we bakers are always at the forefront when it comes to complaining he said but it s others who have bigger problems throughout the covid pandemic bakeries remained open as they were classified as essential businesses restaurants had to close down and use up their financial reserves of course we have very high energy consumption there s no question about that but for me the bakers complaining is completely overblown what s so special about german bread to view this video please enable javascript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports html5 video renewable energy kugel is convinced that every baker who is now sliding into insolvency had problems before the price hikes and was doing things wrong even before the start of the russian war on ukraine it was possible he said to be less dependent on natural gas for example by installing a photovoltaic system on the roof or a heat pump in the basement or by using excess heat from the ovens to heat water in the bakery perhaps it is possible to glimpse the future of german bakeries in bonn s südstadt district max kugel s specialist bakery shows that affluent bread lovers are prepared to pay more for a high quality loaf but just two doors down a big bakery chain offers lower priced wares on this particular afternoon it s filled with students from a nearby high school in these tough

bloomberg liz truss is set to become uk prime minister this week with her plan to turbo charge the economy by slashing taxes already worrying investors amid double digit inflation the foreign secretary is the front runner to replace boris johnson and conservative party members are expected to name her as their leader on monday she would take office after declaring a willingness to run up the budget deficit just as the bank of england is raising interest rates and selling its own holdings of government bonds she also has indicated she will review the central bank s mandate markets have already signaled concern about a truss premiership as bond traders fret that a flood of gilts may be too much to absorb triggering higher debt servicing costs since july 7 when johnson decided to step aside borrowing costs on 10 year government bonds have risen faster than those of any of the other 22 major bond markets the pound has also trailed 132 of the world s 150 top currencies we have a number of concerns about the dependence on the kindness of strangers to fund the uk when the public finances are likely to deteriorate materially said mark capleton strategist at bank of america corp few leaders have taken charge of the uk with the economy in as dire a state the most comparable moment is the early 1970s when labour s harold wilson entered downing street after an oil shock and miner strike that left industry on a three day week should truss win she d inherit inflation at 10 1 and on track to breach 20 for the first time since 1974 according to goldman sachs group inc investors are betting interest rates rise to 4 75 by may threatening misery for mortgage borrowers more familiar with rates below 1 energy costs are set to absorb as much as a 10th of household spending pushing as many half of the uk s 28 million households into fuel poverty with the boe expecting a recession by the end of the year industry has also been told to prepare for orchestrated blackouts this winter and labor groups are talking about the first nationwide strike since 1926 truss s view is that cutting taxes and regulations will unleash the nation s productive potential and take advantage of the opportunities opened when britain left the european union her plan is to make the public sector more efficient and bring the public finances under control by raising the uk s average growth rate to 2 5 a level not consistently achieved since before the 2008 financial crisis that will fix the public finances by bringing debt as a share of gdp down in the longer term she s been deliberately vague about the details but in broad terms it has three prongs tackle the immediate cost of living crisis with support for households and business kick start growth with 30 billion of personal and business tax cuts lift the productive potential of the economy with supply side reforms the details though remain largely a mystery what bloomberg economics says staking out a libertarian position truss s plan to cut taxes will offer little support to those hardest hit by the deepening energy crisis while creating additional long term pressure on the public finances economists opposition politicians and even some in the ruling conservative party worry that her tax cuts will be inflationary and loosen fiscal restraints too much turning the market downturn into a crisis she has pledged no new taxes to pay for the giveaways and says she does not want to cut public spending either former bank of england deputy governor charlie bean who was also a member of the government s fiscal watchdog the office for budget responsibility believes launching a policy experiment in the middle of a crisis is unwise i could see investors starting to think the uk doesn t look such a good place to invest bean told bloomberg television you ll see a risk premium re emerging on gilts which is just starting to happen his fear that investors could lose faith in the uk is shared by nicholas macpherson the treasury s former permanent secretary who tweeted this week that a rising cost of borrowing and a falling pound is the treasury s worst nightmare plans to review the boe mandate are causing further unease the treasury handed the central bank authority over interest rates in 1997 but truss has suggested the government needs more directive powers if she follows through it could dent investor confidence in the institution taken individually none of truss s policy proposals are extraordinary her promise to reverse april s increase in national insurance and scrap next year s planned rise in corporation tax merely put tax policy back where it was at the start of 2020 the uk has reviewed the boe mandate before and canada does it regularly but in the context of the current energy and inflation shock and set against populist language about breaking from economic orthodoxy truss has people worried uk government finances are a source of worry said lauréline renaud chatelain a fixed income strategist at pictet wealth management the deficit is very likely to rise meaningfully going forward the treasury is facing extreme strains support for households may top 50 billion according to sanjay raja uk economist at deutsche bank others suggest more than 100 billion will be needed to save businesses from bankruptcy and offset the rise in household bills as rates and inflation rise the cost of servicing the national debt will jump to around 100 billion this year twice the sum spent on transport truss s real test will come as investors respond to the new prime minister s first remarks in the next few days as bean the former boe economist put it markets are the mechanism that punish bad policies

convert clinical trial data presented at ers demonstrates early success of aeriseal system in patients with advanced copd emphysema the reported data suggest that patients with collateral ventilation may be able to undergo successful treatment with zephyr endobronchial valves following closure of collateral air channels with the aeriseal system pulmonx corporation nasdaq lung pulmonx a global leader in minimally invasive treatments for severe lung disease announces the presentation of interim results from the convert study at the 2022 european respiratory society ers international conference data on the first 40 patients in the study demonstrated that treatment with the aeriseal system successfully converted the collateral ventilation cv status in 78 of patients who were subsequently treated with zephyr valves the aeriseal system is used to close collateral air channels in a target lung lobe of a patient with severe copd emphysema making the patient eligible to then undergo bronchoscopic lung volume reduction blvr with zephyr valves patients whose lungs have untreated collateral ventilation cv are currently ineligible for treatment with zephyr valves and have limited options once medical management alone does not control symptoms once the target lobe is converted from cv to cv patients can be treated with zephyr valves which has been shown to improve lung function quality of life and exercise capacity for patients with severe copd emphysema 1 the convert study uses the aeriseal system to close collateral air flow once the treated lobe tests negative for collateral ventilation cv zephyr valves are implanted to address hyperinflation of that target lobe to ease emphysema symptoms without major surgery successfully converted patients who received zephyr valves had clinically meaningful target lobe volume reduction tlvr with a mean reduction of greater than one 1 liter the convert trial is ongoing and full clinical outcomes of blvr with zephyr valves were not reported at this time however results recently published from a single center feasibility study at macquarie university hospital in australia showed that the aeriseal system successfully closed collateral air channels and allowed for successful clinical outcomes after treatment with zephyr valves 2 at 6 months aeriseal and zephyr valve treated cv patients experienced clinically meaningful improvements similar to improvements in cv patients treated with zephyr valves alone 2 improvements included lung function fev1 increase of 19 7 residual volume decrease of 16 2 quality of life sgrq score decrease of 15 1 points exercise capacity six minute walk distance increase of 77 2 meters there were no serious adverse reactions experienced by patients in the australian feasibility study 20 of patients in the convert study experienced an inflammatory response following aeriseal treatment all were transient medically managed and resolved the available data suggest that patients with collateral ventilation can undergo successful blvr with zephyr valves following closure of the fissure gap with the aeriseal system this is very promising news for patients with advanced copd we know that treatment with zephyr valves can provide long term improvements in lung function breathing and quality of life but for patients with collateral ventilation this minimally invasive treatment has not been available as an option explains dr michela bezzi department head and director interventional pulmonology asst spedali civili university hospital brescia italy having a technology like the aeriseal system to convert collateral ventilation positive patients to negative status means we can provide a treatment to patients who currently have very few options this work reflects our continued commitment to developing and testing new medical technologies to help patients with severe lung disease breathe easier and have better quality of life states glen french president and chief executive officer of pulmonx these early study results are encouraging and move us closer to the goal of helping severe emphysema patients who have collateral ventilation benefit from our proven zephyr valve treatment about the convert study convert is a prospective open label multi center single arm study being conducted at up to 20 investigational sites the study plans to enroll 140 subjects with severe emphysema and collateral ventilation in the target lobe this protocol is designed to evaluate the utility of the aeriseal system which uses a synthetic polymer foam to occlude close collateral air channels in a target lung lobe and convert the target lung lobe to having little to no collateral ventilation cv patients will then undergo bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with zephyr endobronchial valves zephyr valves are not effective if collateral ventilation cv is present but once the target lobe is converted from cv to cv patients can be treated with zephyr valves which has been shown to improve lung function quality of life and exercise capacity for patients with severe copd emphysema 1 see for more details on the convert study the aeriseal system is not approved by the fda or approved for commercial sale in the united states about zephyr valves the zephyr valve is a minimally invasive treatment option for severe copd emphysema zephyr valves are placed via bronchoscopy to block off a diseased portion of the lung to prevent air from getting trapped and reduce hyperinflation which allows the healthier lung tissue to expand and take in more air this results in patients being able to breathe easier be less short of breath and have an improvement in their quality of life 1 national and global treatment guidelines for copd include endobronchial valves like zephyr valves with the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease gold giving valves an evidence a rating more than 25 000 patients have been treated with the zephyr valve worldwide about pulmonx corporation pulmonx corporation nasdaq lung is a global leader in minimally invasive treatments for severe lung disease pulmonx s zephyr endobronchial valve

up and coming travel leader vacasa has lots of growth potential airbnb abnb 2 37 lists millions of vacation properties long term rentals and adjacent experiences and services on its platform and has become such a massive business that it has a 70 billion market cap even after this year s market plunge most investors can only wish they could have gotten in on such a disruptive industry leader early unfortunately of course nobody has a crystal ball that can predict the next big thing with accuracy but sometimes you can spot companies that show the signs vacasa vcsa 2 30 for example looks as though it has airbnb like potential to dominate its part of the travel business but it s still in a much earlier stage of growth here s a rundown of vacasa s business its growth opportunity and what investors should keep in mind before considering opening a position in it vacasa s market opportunity vacasa is a vacation rental management platform the company provides full service property management including bookings cleanings maintenance and more it leverages technology to make the management process as efficient as possible as well as to maximize yield for the owners of its managed properties in fact vacasa claims that its typical vacation homeowner can make 20 more by renting on its platform than through other professional property managers as of the latest information there were more than 35 000 homes in vacasa s universe it also has some adjacent businesses such as a real estate agent network to help people who want to buy vacation homes to rent out obviously a catalog of 35 000 vacation rental properties doesn t compare to the millions of listings on airbnb s platform but that s kind of the point vacasa is already the leader in full service property management but manages far less than 1 of the properties in its addressable market there are about 20 million vacation homes worldwide and over 5 million in the united states alone there simply is no national brand in vacation rental management and that s what vacasa is aiming to create there s a massive opportunity it is estimated that more than 200 billion will be spent on vacation rentals in 2022 and vacasa had 0 8 of this volume in 2021 plus vacation rentals are growing twice as fast as traditional hotel accommodations strong results and financial flexibility despite a general slowdown in consumer spending recently travel demand has remained quite strong in the second quarter vacasa s booking volume grew by 32 year over year and revenue exceeded the high end of management s guidance the company is on track to increase the number of homes it has under management by 30 in 2022 it s also worth noting that unlike many other high growth companies especially those that came public in the spac boom vacasa isn t far from profitability in fact it s expected to be close to breakeven on an adjusted ebitda basis for 2022 and earned positive net income in the second quarter so while vacasa received a ton of cash as part of its spac deal and still has over 319 million in the bank it isn t burning through its reserves could vacasa have more revenue potential than airbnb i alluded to this earlier but i want to emphasize one key difference between vacasa and airbnb vacasa is a full service property manager while airbnb is mainly a booking portal as a result vacasa gets paid far more for its services vacation rental management fees typically range from 25 to 50 of the rent airbnb only gets about 3 of its booking volume the point is that vacasa doesn t need to scale to the size of airbnb to generate as much revenue it could do that with roughly one tenth of airbnb s booking volume this is certainly an ambitious target but not an unattainable one finally it s also important to mention that vacasa isn t necessarily a competitor to airbnb quite the opposite actually vacasa markets its properties on airbnb in addition to other sites in a nutshell airbnb wants vacasa to succeed and bring more properties onto its platform vacasa s growth is a win win for both companies could vacasa be the next big travel stock to be sure vacasa isn t without risk there s a lot that will need to go right for it to make the leap from less than 1 of the market to becoming a true national or even global brand it also is worth keeping in mind that travel is a cyclical business and a recession or sharp slowdown in consumer spending on travel could derail vacasa s growth momentum at least temporarily vacasa falls into the speculative category when it comes to travel stocks as it s still in a relatively early growth stage however with a market cap of less than 2 5 of airbnb s and a capital light revenue heavy business model vacasa certainly has lots of potential if it can execute on its vision

today we ll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of g willi food international ltd nasdaq wilc as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today s value we will take advantage of the discounted cash flow dcf model for this purpose believe it or not it s not too difficult to follow as you ll see from our example companies can be valued in a lot of ways so we would point out that a dcf is not perfect for every situation if you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation take a look at the simply wall st analysis model see our latest analysis for g willi food international the model we have to calculate the value of g willi food international slightly differently to other stocks because it is a consumer retailing company in this approach dividends per share dps are used as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts unless a company pays out the majority of its fcf as a dividend this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock we use the gordon growth model which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained for a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company s gross domestic product gdp in this case we used the 5 year average of the 10 year government bond yield 1 9 the expected dividend per share is then discounted to today s value at a cost of equity of 5 9 relative to the current share price of us 16 9 the company appears about fair value at a 4 1 discount to where the stock price trades currently valuations are imprecise instruments though rather like a telescope move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy do keep this in mind advertisement advertisement value per share expected dividend per share discount rate perpetual growth rate 5 8 5 9 1 9 us 17 6 dcf the assumptions the calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions the first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company s future performance so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions the dcf also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company s future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a company s potential performance given that we are looking at g willi food international as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital wacc which accounts for debt in this calculation we ve used 5 9 which is based on a levered beta of 0 800 beta is a measure of a stock s volatility compared to the market as a whole we get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0 8 and 2 0 which is a reasonable range for a stable business looking ahead although the valuation of a company is important it ideally won t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company it s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a dcf model instead the best use for a dcf model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued for example changes in the company s cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation for g willi food international we ve compiled three essential items you should further research advertisement advertisement risks every company has

according to the hollywood reporter lip synch legends milli vanilli are slated to get their own biopic soon several attempts have been made to bring the duo s story to the big screen and it seems like one finally got through after several failed attempts to bring the story of the rise and scandalous fall of the 80s pop stars to the screen leonine together with star producers wiedemann berg dark the lives of others are currently shooting the feature which is expected to wrap in december elan ben ali and tijan njie and see above star as fabrice morvan and robert pilatus the top charting pop r b duo out of munich who became global stars in the 1980s scoring three no 1 hits in the u s but the duo had a dirty secret they were a fake band created by music producer frank farian pilatus and morvan never did their own singing instead lip syncing to the voices of two other artists at the height of their fame milli vanilli won big at the grammys but the truth soon emerged and the group came toppling to earth dropping from superstardom to become a punchline after a failed comeback attempt pilatus life spiraled out of control in 1998 he was found dead in a frankfurt hotel room of a suspected alcohol and prescription drug overdose when the world discovered that milli vanilli was a fake band the group became a laughing stock similar to elijah mccoy s name becoming synonymous with quality aka real mccoy milli vanilli s name came to represent fraudulence at the time an artist lip syncing was a cardinal sin to a public that expected authentic talent from its musical acts flash forward to today and the same standards have evaporated pretty much every pop artist is a corporate invention with a team of unsung talents propping up the illusion only a handful of pop stars write their own lyrics and the few that do use obvious autotune to conceal their shortcomings as singers and no one bats an eye suffice it to say milli vanilli might have been ahead of their time

logistical shortfalls could force kiev and nato to change strategy mark t kimmitt warns in an op ed for the wsj sustaining the conflict in ukraine is becoming increasingly difficult for nato so kiev must think about negotiating with moscow retired us army brigadier general mark t kimmitt has said in an opinion piece for the wall street journal washington s latest military aid package to kiev last month included older and less advanced systems which may indicate that battlefield consumption rates have outpaced production to a point where excess inventories provided to ukraine are nearly exhausted kimmitt pointed out in his article on thursday dealing with dwindling stocks of leading edge weapon systems in nato countries would likely mean a prolonged conflict between ukraine and russia such a scenario could result in more pressure from supporting nations sustained inflation less heating gas and falling popular support in the west he wrote kimmitt who served as assistant secretary of state for political military affairs in 2008 09 suggested four ways to speed up the resolution of the conflict which has now been underway for six months the first option is to dig deeper into nato stockpiles and send arms to kiev that have so far been withheld by members due to their own national defense requirements the retired general suggested that s something eu countries may be willing to do as it s better to use these weapons in kherson than krakow he added the us and its european allies could also try ramping up production of the systems that are required by the zelensky government kimmitt said acknowledging that such a move would unlikely have an immediate effect on the situation on the ground the third option is to step up the conflict by providing ukraine with longer range systems such as atacm missiles f 16 jets and patriots and broaden the rules of engagement to attack targets in crimea and possibly russia he wrote however the retired general warned that such escalation would definitely face a response from moscow and create the risk of conflict spilling into europe the final available solution according to kimmitt is for ukraine to push for an interim diplomatic resolution without or with territorial concessions there is little incentive to negotiate at the moment but ukrainian president vladimir zelensky must recognize that diminishing resupplies would have a disastrous effect on his army not merely for battlefield operations but for the message of declining outside support it would send to the people of ukraine he insisted beginning the diplomatic resolution would be distasteful and perhaps seen as defeatist but as there is little chance of climbing out of the current morass it may be better to negotiate now than later the retired general said the two sides haven t sat down at the negotiating table since talks in istanbul in late march moscow which had initially been optimistic about the prospects for the peace process later accused kiev of backtracking on all the progress that had been achieved in turkey and said it had lost all trust in the ukrainian negotiators russian officials warned that moscow s demands would be more extensive if talks were to resume rt com

series in northern ireland he jumped at the chance for one thing it was opportunity to spend time with his family here including his beloved grandmother in co antrim in a brand new series for bbc one northern ireland and bbc iplayer james son of chateau dwelling dick unearths terrific tales and hopes to cook up a storm as he travels the country on a tour of some of our most magnificent country houses and estates read more new programmes worth staying in for dominate bbc northern ireland s autumn line up his father dick best known for his channel 4 series escape to the chateau was born in burma in 1959 but three years later the family moved to northern ireland first living in bangor to be near grandparents in newtownards before later settling in ballyclare my granny and auntie have lived in northern ireland all this time while my father later moved away so i always go back to stay with them i lived in lisburn for a couple of years and went to primary school there so i had really good and fun times james told belfast live every year we go down to dublin for the rugby and before we go granny always makes us a big ulster fry to set us off on our way so yeah we try to meet up regularly as a family in northern ireland to see granny and be looked after northern ireland feels very much like home to me even though i m now living in cornwall there s just something about the irish coastline the giant s causeway and the guinness and whiskey of course the place has all the things that i love each of the three half hour episodes of strawbridge over the drawbridge sees professional chef james visit a different country house in northern ireland learn their histories and cook up a feast to impress the people that know these houses better than anyone the owners after meeting the people lucky enough to call these spectacular buildings home james is taken on a tour of their sumptuous interiors while learning about the colourful past of not only the buildings but their previous inhabitants james 38 also discovers what makes each estate tick today but it s not all play and no work he then has to take everything he s learned about each house s history and character and create a meal which reflects that each of the homes couples have a silver bell present at dinner but james will only hear them ring if they ve decided his meal is up to scratch image bbc ni james added i love the food in northern ireland too so being asked to make this programme was a no brainer really the great thing is that while it s about food food is nothing without the people who produce it and do all the hard work you ve got these country houses each with its own rich and varied history while the people living in them today are trying to preserve that heritage while also embracing sustainability so it s a very modern insight into what it s like to run big estates what struck me most during filming was the variety of exceptionally good cheeses charcuterie and even mind blowingly tasty seaweed on offer here there s certainly a pride in local food which northern ireland has in spades it is home to some of the best food in the uk by a long stretch in episode one james strawbridge visits ballywalter park in newtownards home of lord and lady dunleath brian and vibse arriving by air james receives a warm ballywalter welcome before hearing tales from the house s rich

in the unending battle against rabbits would a 17 hmr rifle be your best bet or should you opt for a 22 lr mark ripley finds out would a 17hmr rifle be your best bet or should you opt for a 22 hmr 17 hmr rifle or 22 lr the sound of the bullet whistling through the air for a split second before its impact was rather rewarding as another rabbit was tumbled downrange the last half a dozen bunnies at the far end of the green had become familiar with my tactics of walking alongside the high netting at the edge of the practice area to get to within 22 lr rimfire range and had taken to scarpering at the first sign of danger read more on rimfires for rabbit control here now however i was surprising them having set myself up on the clubhouse balcony some 200 yards away with the supremely accurate 17 hmr this was a tactic the bunnies hadn t bargained for and i was taking out good numbers each time they broke cover every 20 minutes or so another would feel the coast was clear and be brave enough to hop out on to the lush green grass of the golf course only to quickly fall victim to a well placed shot having previously owned a 17 hmr i was already familiar with how effective it could be but i hadn t got on with the rifle itself however this latest offering the tikka t1x was rekindling my love for the calibre with its flat shooting capabilities and tack driving accuracy i d armed myself with the tikka as i was keen to compare the most popular two rimfire calibres the 22 lr and the 17 hmr there s no doubt both have their pros and cons and there are fans of both calibres but with the increasing popularity of the 17 hmr i was keen to see if the humble 22 lr still deserved a place in the gun safe take a look at our list of the best gun safes cost of ammo the first obvious factor to consider came early on when visiting c h weston in brighton it was one of the few shops close by that had any hmr ammunition in stock at that time and on buying 100 rounds as well as some for the 22 lr the cost difference was immediately apparent the 17 hmr ammunition costs approximately three times that of the 22 lr where the 17 hmr does come out on top against the 22 lr in terms of ammunition though is with ricochet the 22 is renowned for bullets pinging off almost anything then to be heard zinging off to goodness knows where yet the 17 hmr has a much lower risk with the extremely fast and frangible bullets breaking up on almost anything they connect with incidentally this does mean you need to make sure you have a clear flight path for a bullet such as when shooting rabbits in the stubble or in foliage as another rabbit ventured on to the green i again settled behind the rifle and took a head shot at a tad over 120 yards with little consideration for the distance with the rifle zeroed at 100 yards the bullet will need very little allowance out to 150 yards or so read more on cartridges and calibres for pest control this is a different story for the 22 lr firing a bullet over twice as heavy the drop is a lot more pronounced and zeroed at 50 yards it will start to need some careful consideration once you get out to 75 or 80 yards the limit for subsonic ammunition is realistically about 100 yards for reliable accuracy here though is where the 22 lr has an ace up its sleeve you can also use high velocity ammunition in the 22 and stretch this out to more like the ranges the 17 hmr offers with good accuracy the trade off here is that like the hmr you will still get a bit of a crack as the bullet breaks the sound barrier the 22 lr subsonic ammunition is intentionally kept below the speed of sound to keep the shot as close as possible to silent which is that calibre s biggest advantage it s also often stated that the 17 hmr is useless in the wind and yes if you don t allow for it you will most likely miss especially as the ranges increase however this is also true of the 22 lr it s simply that usually you are shooting at distances of less than 70 yards where the wind has less time to have an effect on the bullet s flight path if you were using a 17 hmr at 22 lr ranges the odds are you probably wouldn t notice much difference drift on the day i zeroed the hmr and checked zero on my own 22 lr a now discontinued cz 452 american there was a crosswind of at least 10mph interestingly at 50 yards i had pretty much the same amount of horizontal drift with both rifles due to windage though this was only an observation at that time rather than a conclusive test it did make me wonder if it was much of a deciding factor between the two i m sure with some experience this could be allowed for let s not forget this is a tiny rimfire bullet shooting out to 150 yards or more and not a centrefire so you would expect it to get pushed around a bit in the wind it s a projectile not a laser beam after all other than the extra cost of ammunition and perhaps a little extra meat damage due to its explosive nature the only real drawback for me would be the noise this isn t likely to be an issue for the keeper looking for a point and shoot rifle to keep in the truck for rabbits squirrels corvids or the odd closer range fox on his rounds but for pest control in sensitive areas this might be a problem in the past i have done a few fox control jobs in urban areas shooting them in gardens and parks in such circumstances the use of a near silent 22 lr rifle is perfect with a sufficient backstop on several occasions i ve despatched foxes in the gardens of terraced houses by shooting down into the garden from an upstairs window at ranges of usually 20 or 30 yards and using a bag or two of sand as a pre baited backstop the neighbours have been none the wiser to the entire event there s also the argument that you can shoot more rabbits with a 22 lr because it s so quiet it doesn t scare off all the others which to a degree is true i ve often shot several rabbits from a group using a 22 lr and this would have been less likely with the 17 hmr i d recently done the rounds on the golf course and shot several decent bags by simply quietly moving from one area to the next discreetly assassinating one bunny after another as i went utmost stealth on a recent outing i d also paired my 22 lr with a thermal night scope and it proved almost too easy to walk out to them in the complete darkness accurately range them with its built in laser rangefinder and quietly eliminate them with carefully aimed shots using a little holdover on the further ones all this was achieved with the utmost stealth when comparing the two calibres there is no real winner with both having their place for certain jobs much like golf for that matter a golfer has a bag of clubs and each has the ability to propel a ball around the course yet each is better suited to one shot or another financially you can t separate rifles of either calibre that boils down to the brands you choose i prefer cz and tikka and both set you back around 700 to 750 or slightly more if you re a southpaw like me certainly the 17 hmr is a serious tool for everyday pest control but it can also be a grubby little round so accuracy and reliability can quickly disappear if the rifle isn t regularly cleaned the 22 lr on the other hand is very quiet cheap on ammunition and seems to run faultlessly even if it s completely neglected for months mine is i m ashamed to admit would i buy a 17 hmr again after using this one yes undoubtedly i d love to own another one would it replace my 22 lr no there are times when the 22 lr is the perfect tool for the job and no other calibre will do so it would seem that for now at least the trusty little 22 lr still has a place in every gun cabinet head to head manufacturer cz ceska zbrojovka model 457 american updated

in a meeting with pollster brett lloyd last week he indicated that a number of u s senate seats increasingly lean democratic after which house seats are far more in play than is normally the case in midterm elections where the white house occupant is rather unpopular it s something to think about particularly with the stock market top of mind conventional wisdom from the past week has been that hawkish comments from fed chairman powell in jackson hole have been the driver of the stock market s much commented on retreat readers would be wise to dismiss the wisdom as it s rooted in a misunderstanding of how markets work surprise is the source of big market moves this rates real thought as applied to powell s comments simply because there was nothing surprising about them it s long been known that the conventional thinker in powell believes the answer to what economists deem inflation is more intervention from the entity the fed that is empowered to keep inflation in check powell is conventional which means he s predictable he said nothing new in jackson hole which means we should look elsewhere for the sudden shift in the markets the guess here is that it s political for the longest time it was a known quantity that the republicans would enjoy big gains in the house come november and likely take the senate about what s been written about predicted republican gains it s not a bouquet being thrown the way of the gop as much as it s a comment about what markets seem to like history says they like inactivity in washington with good reason all legislation whether good or bad can have destabilizing qualities that investors must price conversely gridlock removes what happens in washington as a market threat the long predicted republican gains would exist as a check on government intervention except that the presumed electoral restraint on government isn t as sure of a thing as it once was see brett lloyd above if so imagine a nothing to lose president in biden working with democratic majorities or a democratic senate in concert with a republican controlled house won with the slimmest of margins it presumably changes the legislative landscape for it putting interventionist legislation in play markets are information personified and they relentlessly price possibilities the surprise isn t the fed but it would be a big surprise if an unpopular president actually gains a mid term mandate bringing it back to the fed it remains the case that what it does just isn t that important consider a recent opinion piece by the very excellent judy shelton she s a fed critic with good reason and the central bank is less of a place without her what s a monument to groupthink could have profited from shelton s contrarian ways at the same time shelton came off as less contrarian in her latest she contends that the fed could crush demand by raising interest rates to stratospheric levels but shelton knows that s reducing to absurd what is an impossibility not only is this most conventional of central banks not going to raise rates to stratospheric levels it also couldn t the fed can t decree credit expensive any more than the mayor of new york city can decree apartments cheap markets always and everywhere have their say and this is most crucially the case with credit figure that it s produced around the world at which point production is a magnet for the money that moves the production to its highest use market actors would rapidly and easily work around stratospheric rates which by their very description would signal an artificiality that markets are expert at correcting from there shelton writes that the fed s inflation fighting supposedly higher central bank rates dampen inflation could be erased through fiscal measures that expand spending power cash payments subsidies rebates student loan forgiveness except that shelton knows this isn t true she has long caucused with the supply side crowd which means she knows well that government can in no way increase demand it can t because government isn t some other as much as its spending power including its ability to forgive debt is a consequence of it having claims on the present and future production of the american people in other words government s ability to dole out spending power springs from the productive seeing their spending power reduced there s no increase in demand to speak of while government spending is a horrid tax and arguably the most economically crushing of taxes it s not inflationary there s no disagreeing with shelton that the goal should be to reduce the burden of government and that greater output should be the goal for certain if we shrink government allocation of precious resources we ll get more production or more supply to be clear about the supply it won t be deflationary any more than a lack of supply is inflationary supply and demand balance as shelton well knows which is why it didn t ring true her assertion that the inflation of the moment is largely driven by a lack of supply reduced supply is the same as reduced demand it all raises a basic question why is shelton being so restrained in her commentary she knows what inflation is it s a decline in the unit of measure used to facilitate exchange translated for those who need it inflation is currency devaluation which means the answer to inflation isn t more supply it s not less government spending it s just a stable dollar except that the dollar s exchange rate has never been part of the fed s policy portfolio shelton knows this too the fed just isn t that important not from a stock market perspective and not from an inflation perspective eventually this contrarian view will become mainstream

these stocks look like bargains no matter what direction stocks head next the stock market has been incredibly volatile lately stocks plunged deeply then rallied sharply only to start tumbling again in recent weeks because of that it s not clear if the market s next move is higher or lower while the current uncertainty can make it challenging to invest it s important to keep the long term view in mind the stock prices of high quality companies that can consistently grow their earnings tend to go up over the long term especially if you can buy shares at attractive valuations three high quality companies currently trading at cheap values are douglas dynamics plow 1 14 franco nevada fnv 1 39 and kinder morgan kmi 0 88 that makes them look like compelling value stocks to consider in these uncertain times record sales and just a modest stock rebound reuben gregg brewer douglas dynamics wall street can be fickle and short sighted during turbulent times which appears to be the case today with douglas dynamics the stock despite having bounced off its yearly lows is still down some 20 or so from its 2022 highs the industrial stock s yield is a generous 3 6 which is still well above the five year average yield of just under 3 douglas dynamics looks like it is still sitting in the bargain bin despite the stock s recent recovery the commercial work truck attachment company reported record sales in the second quarter with that figure increasing by 19 year over year while the company s gross profit margin was impacted by inflation it is working on that issue by raising the prices it charges for its plows and other services meanwhile management reports that lingering supply chain bottlenecks are starting to ease this is the most important thing ceo bob mccormick explained that demand signals remain strong in both segments today with a strong pre season sales period in attachments and ongoing robust backlog for solutions in other words douglas dynamics underlying business remains on solid ground even in the face of some near term headwinds although the company is facing some uncertainty today it looks like the long term risk to the business is minimal investors who think in decades and not days may want to do a deep dive here while wall street is still taking a glass half empty view of things this stock is a gold mine neha chamaria franco nevada franco nevada stock just hit 52 week lows gold prices are of course sinking they re at multiweek lows as of this writing and are being driven down by the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate increases to tame inflation as a company that derives more than half its revenue from gold falling gold prices don t bode well for franco nevada in fact the company also dabbles in silver iron ore and oil and gas unfortunately all of these commodities and fuels have come under selling pressure however i don t see a reason why franco nevada stock should languish in fact when a stock like this drops so much whether in a bull or bear market you d want to pay attention you see franco nevada may be a gold stock but it s a streaming and royalty company and not a miner that means the company buys gold at low prices from third party miners under contracts in return for upfront funding and then sells that gold at spot prices its purchase price in fact is often so low that franco nevada can earn big margins even if gold prices fall in its second quarter franco nevada generated record quarterly revenue and earned the highest margins ever yet the stock is currently trading significantly below its five average price to sales ratio thanks to its recent steep decline economists now believe a recession is imminent in the u s even if the economy falters a bit gold prices and with them gold stocks could get a lift among gold stocks though franco nevada should be a top choice as it has historically generated exceptional returns over long periods of time and has even increased dividends every year for the past 15 consecutive years a dirt cheap dividend stock matt dilallo kinder morgan kinder morgan generates relatively steady cash flow regardless of market conditions the natural gas pipeline giant is on pace to produce 4 7 billion of distributable cash flow this year or about 2 17 per share that s about 5 above its initial budget thanks to stronger than expected conditions in the energy market at the recent stock price of around 18 per share kinder morgan trades at about eight times its cash flow that s cheap for a company that generates a growing stream of steady cash flow in any market environment kinder morgan only uses about half its cash to support its dividend which currently yields over 6 due to its dirt cheap valuation that gives it a huge cushion to continue making dividend payments if market conditions head south it also leaves the company with plenty of excess cash to repay debt finance expansion projects and repurchase its dirt cheap stock the company focuses on investing for the long term it s expanding several natural gas pipelines building a renewable natural gas platform and constructing a few renewable fuel hubs these investments are helping position the company to capitalize on the long term energy transition to cleaner fuels they ll also help grow the company s cash flow in the coming years that should enable kinder morgan to continue increasing its dividend which it has done for the last five years kinder morgan is a steady company making it a solid investment regardless of market conditions it generates lots of cash giving it the funds to pay a hefty dividend and continue expanding which should create value for shareholders over the long term with its stock cheap right now it s a solid option for investors uncertain about the market s direction

scale and likely shifting the growth algorithm of the business higher in many investors eyes see intuit hedge fund trading activity on tipranks however zelnick also pointed at a couple of possible setbacks that could affect short term stock appreciation for one aggressive investments in growth initiatives are keeping intuit from improving its margin growth potential even for fy23 intuit does not have a confident margin growth expectation also the guidance provided by the company does not effectively account for the major economic downturn that is expected soon however going by history intuit has been resilient to downturns while intuit is not immune to an incrementally weaker macro environment forward guidance reaffirms our belief that product leadership stickiness and network effects across its leading edge ai expert platform are durable differentiators said zelnick maintaining a buy rating and lifting the price target to 560 from 525 marvell technology the last stock on

completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net
