living in a greener neighbourhood reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 16 per cent study shows experts looked at the affect of greener space on heart health for people in miami they found planting more trees led to reduced risks of cardiovascular disease more greenery results in the creation of clean air that s breathed in by the lungs you might be able to cut your risk of developing cardiovascular disease cvd by moving to a greener area a new study suggests over a five year study period researchers in miami found people living in a greener neighbourhood had a 16 per cent lower risk of developing cvd than people living in areas with hardly any green space as well as this planting more vegetation in a locality was associated with reductions in cvd risk over time the experts think greenness is not only conducive to cleaner air being breathed in but makes people less stressed and therefore less prone to developing cvd cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally taking an estimated 17 9 million lives each year cut your risk of developing cardiovascular disease by moving to a greener area a new study from researchers at the university of miami suggests higher levels of greenness were associated with lower rates of heart conditions and stroke over time both when an area maintained high greenness and when greenness increased said study author dr william aitken at the university of miami it was remarkable that these relationships appeared in just five years a relatively short amount of time for a positive environmental impact cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease cvd is a general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels it s usually associated with a build up of fatty deposits inside the arteries atherosclerosis and an increased risk of blood clots it can also be associated with damage to arteries in organs such as the brain heart kidneys and eyes cvd is one of the main causes of death and disability in the uk but it can often largely be prevented by leading a healthy lifestyle all heart diseases are cardiovascular diseases but not all cardiovascular diseases are heart disease advertisement dr aitken stressed the importance of local authorities to plant trees and shrubs to boost health tree planting and greening of neighbourhoods is associated with multiple benefits and offers a relatively low cost investment to enhance health and well being in many circumstances he said for the cost of one emergency room visit for a heart attack trees could be planted in a neighbourhood with 100 residents and potentially prevent ten heart diseases in this group for the study the authors looked at data from 243 558 us medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older who lived in the same area of miami during 2011 to 2016 medicare records were used to obtain the incidence of new cvd conditions during the five year study period including heart attack atrial fibrillation heart failure ischaemic heart disease hypertension and stroke transient ischaemic attack to assess an area s greenness satellite images were used to assess the amount of visible and invisible near infrared sunlight reflected from the earth s surface chlorophyll from plants typically absorbs visible light and reflects near infrared light so measuring both indicates the amount of vegetation the greenness of city blocks was then classified as low medium or high participants were categorised based on whether they lived in these low medium or high greenness blocks at the start of the study period in 2011 the process was repeated for those same residents and the greenness of their blocks in 2016 during that time period miami dade county parks conducted tree planting programmes to boost the amount of local greenery that meant there was the possibility that someone in a low greenness block in 2011 could be living in a high greenness block in 2016 the researchers analysed the odds of developing any new cvd and the number of new cvd conditions based on block level greenness cardiovascular disease cvd is a general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels cvd events include heart disease and stroke all heart diseases are cardiovascular diseases but not all cardiovascular diseases are heart disease stock image the analyses were adjusted for other factors that could increase the risk of cvd including age sex ethnicity income and how much walkability their local area had being able to walk more is of course good for cardiovascular health the researchers first compared heart health among those continually living in high versus low greenness areas during the five year study residents of high greenness blocks throughout the study had a 16 per cent lower odds of developing any new cardiovascular conditions compared to those in low greenness blocks among participants who developed a cvd condition during follow up those in high greenness areas developed 4 per cent fewer new diseases compared with those in low greenness blocks the researchers then compared heart health in participants whose neighbourhood became greener versus those who continued to live in areas with low vegetation pictured primrose hill park in north london at sunrise the experts think greenness is not only conducive to cleaner air being breathed in but makes people less stressed and therefore less prone to developing cvd when compared to residents of low greenness areas throughout the study those living in areas that increased their greenness from low in 2011 to high in 2016 had 15 per cent lower odds of developing new cvd conditions among participants who developed a cvd condition during follow up those whose neighbourhood became greener developed 9 per cent fewer new cvd conditions compared to residents of localities with continually low levels of greenness throughout the five years we suspect that multiple factors may account for these observations dr aitken said for instance people living in greener areas may do more outdoor exercise and might feel less stressed due to being surrounded by nature in addition vegetation could provide some protection from air and or noise pollution this is an area for further exploration advertisement the research is being presented at esc congress 2021 this weekend

box comments on glass lewis recommendation tweet box news alert inc nyse box today commented on a report published by glass lewis co glass lewis in connection with the election of the company s director nominees dana evan peter leav and aaron levie at its 2021 annual meeting of stockholders annual meeting to be held on september 9 2021 we strongly believe that glass lewis reached the wrong conclusion in its recent report notably glass lewis fails to acknowledge that significant changes have already been made and that the change agents are already on the board importantly the nation s leading proxy advisory firm institutional shareholder services iss recognizes the extent of the company s progress and that further board level change is not warranted in its august 23 2021 report which recommends box stockholders vote on the company s blue proxy card iss states1 since the 2020 settlement with the dissident and the formation of the operating committee the company appears to have made significant progress on the margin side over the past several quarters while the revenue metrics are taking longer to improve the company s assertion that there are green shoots appears fair particularly in the most recent quarters as evidenced by the improvements in net retention rate and large deal growth given the level of collaboration in the initial stages of the dissident s involvement it is unclear what incremental benefit the dissident s presence on the board would impart at this stage the nominees who joined the board as a result of the settlement appear credible experienced and engaged and they have expressed conviction in the company s strategy in fact recent change at box has been significant and powerful box has reshaped the board with seven new highly experienced directors added in the past three years and four added since 2019 including adding two 20 of the board in march of 2020 who were approved by starboard the operating committee was formed in connection with the march 2020 starboard settlement which includes both starboard approved directors due to its effectiveness the board proactively maintained the committee after the expiration of the starboard standstill agreement box is delivering improved operating and financial performance including operating margin improvement and reacceleration of revenue growth with sustained momentum across the business the company is executing a clear go forward strategy alongside a world class partner in kkr following the board s multi month comprehensive review of strategic options the board proactively enhanced corporate governance and compensation practices including separation of chair and ceo roles with starboard approved directors as chair of board and chairs of audit and compensation committees box is in the strongest financial position in its history and the improving operating and financial performance is reflected in the company s recent stock price performance driven by the performance of the company and the execution of our strategic plan box has generated tsr news alert of 115 and outperformed its saas peers since the starboard settlement in march 20202 in addition the company is one of the top ten performing software company stocks to date in 20213 momentum news alert is accelerating as evidenced by strong fiscal second quarter 2022 financial results as well as third quarter 2022 guidance and raised fiscal year 2022 guidance4 glass lewis statements regarding the kkr led transaction fail to take into account that box executed the transaction not only because it is in the best interests of all stockholders but because it gave starboard exactly what it and other stockholders wanted an exit at a premium the benefits of the transaction and self tender are significant the box board completed its strategic review process following starboard s demand to conduct the review the board was open minded in evaluating all options to maximize value initially focusing on a full sale of box while also considering no transaction at all kkr as a partner including the addition of john park to the board brings substantial operational strategic and financial expertise in enterprise software along with access to kkr s network to scale operations m a and growth the transaction allowed stockholders to choose to either sell stock at 25 75 or participate in additional upside potential the kkr led investment is an important endorsement of box s path forward and signals confidence in its belief of potential stock price appreciation beyond 27 per share which the company believes is a material factor in box s recent stock price performance between the tender offer and the repurchases box has already repurchased more than 300 million and continues to repurchase shares on a non dlutive basis5 based on box s board s interactions with mr feld the board believes that mr feld has pre judged the situation and would come into the boardroom unwilling to listen to any other ideas or perspectives which is not in the best interests of all our stockholders box has a world class board which includes executives with deep technology industry expertise diverse skillsets and proven track records driving disciplined growth profitability and stockholder value in addition to prior experience sitting on public boards the board brings a strong history of leadership in saas news alert and enterprise software skills critical to overseeing our operations each of the three box nominees dana evan nacd s 2019 director of the year peter leav ceo of mcafee and aaron levie the founder of box and pioneer of the content cloud industry has played an essential role in designing and overseeing box s strategy and we believe they have the expertise needed to continue to drive the company forward we are confident their skillsets outmatch starboard s slate in every critical area we strongly believe that replacing any of box s director candidates with any of starboard s nominees would deprive the company of skills and expertise required to advance box s strategy continue the company s momentum and drive stockholder value the box board has been unwavering in its commitment to act in the best interests of all stockholders the box board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote the blue proxy card for all of box s three highly qualified directors dana evan peter leav and aaron levie standing for election at the 2021 annual meeting box would like to remind stockholders that every vote is important no matter

new york wall street rallied to records on friday after the head of the federal reserve said it s still far from pulling interest rates off the record low that s helped markets soar even if it does begin dialing back its support for the economy later this year the s p 500 rose 39 37 or 0 9 percent to 4 509 37 to top its prior all time high set on wednesday part of a widespread rally that swept up everything from bonds to gold the dow jones industrial average climbed 242 68 points or 0 7 percent to 34 455 80 and the nasdaq composite gained 183 69 or 1 2 percent to 15 129 50 stocks have set record after record this year thanks in large part to the federal reserve s massive efforts to prop up the economy and financial markets but the gains had grown more tentative as the beginning of the end of the fed s assistance came into sight now that the unemployment rate has dropped and inflation has picked up in a speech that investors have had circled for weeks fed chairman jerome powell said that the economy has met one big milestone the central bank had set to slow the 120 billion in bond purchases it s making each month that could mean a paring back by the end of the year of the purchases which are meant to keep longer term interest rates low and to juice the economy but powell also cited past mistakes where policymakers made premature moves in the face of seemingly high inflation stressing again that today s high inflation looks to be only temporary he also made clear that a slowing of the fed s bond purchases doesn t mean a rise in short term rates is imminent that would require the job market and inflation to hurdle substantially more stringent tests we have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment powell said advertisement at the end of powell s speech many investors took it as a sign the fed will keep supporting the market with low interest rates which can act like steroids for stocks in the lingo of wall street it was dovish in tone rather than hawkish which would have advocated for a quicker rise in rates he not as much spoke it as he cooed it said ernesto ramos u s chief investment officer at bmo global asset management he was super dovish stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy made the biggest gains following the speech smaller companies were particularly strong with the small cap russell 2000 index up 2 9 percent more than triple the gain for the big stocks in the s p 500 they often do best when investors feel more optimistic about lower rates and a stronger economy markets are loving it ramos said but he also cautioned that the longer ultralow interest rate policy helps to prop up the markets the withdrawal may be worse once it s finally exhausted it strengthens our view that markets will continue to do well this year he said but when the accommodation is fully removed how bad of a hangover will it be just like a party the hangover is less bad if you leave earlier treasury yields were lower but only after some swings after sitting at 1 35 percent shortly before powell s speech the yield on the 10 year treasury sank as powell cited past instances where policymakers prematurely raised interest rates on worries about short term bursts in inflation saying such a mistake could be particularly harmful now advertisement yields later recovered a bit of their drops after powell said substantial further progress has been made on its inflation goals one of the two milestones needed for the fed to slow its bond purchases the other which focuses on employment has shown progress but powell did not say it had been fulfilled the yield on the 10 year treasury was at 1 30 percent late friday down from 1 34 percent late thursday of course powell also said that the delta variant of the coronavirus is complicating things though he still expects improvements to continue the faster spreading delta variant has already slowed some economic activity a report on friday showed that consumer spending in the country rose 0 3 percent in july from june a sharp slowdown from the prior month s 1 1 percent jump that s a big deal when consumer spending is the driving force of the u s economy and its growth slowed even though income growth for americans accelerated to 1 1 percent last month the report also showed that a gauge of year over year inflation preferred by the fed held steady at 3 6 percent in july slightly higher than economists expected the next date circled on investors calendars is in a week when the government reports how many people businesses hired in august a strong report could give the fed even more leeway to begin slowing its bond purchases advertisement producers of commodities made the stock market s biggest jumps as lower yields and a weakening dollar pushed up prices for oil gold and other raw materials occidental petroleum leaped 6 9 percent for the largest gain in the s p 500 and miner freeport mcmoran rose 5 9 percent on the losing end

i only saw the rolling stones four times but each time was a milestone concert together they reflect the long and winding road the band embarked upon in the early sixties the challenges faced and tragedies it weathered along the way and the achievements of what many consider the greatest rock band of all time notched into rock history advertisement throughout their near sixty year run one thing never changed charlie watts always sat behind the drum kit watts passed away this week at age 80 life was good in 1966 for a fifteen year old boy with tickets to the rolling stones at honolulu international center arena the hoopla surrounding the concert had been drummed up by local media for weeks there wasn t much else going on in the sleepy islands starting with a column inch announcement on the star bulletin s lifestyle page then jumping to a piece about a group of female teenyboppers denied when they attempted an overnight sleepover on the concrete in front of the hic ticket booths the show itself the only time i saw star crossed guitarist brian jones was a fast paced blur of greatest hits contained within a whirlwind of constant screaming i have a faded color polaroid of the group onstage taken after i left my seat and tried to get closer to the stage a burly pacific islander police officer tracked my approach and made clear that i shouldn t push my luck the star bulletin was abuzz the morning after with no less than an expanded front page photo of shell shocked front row fans unbelievably somebody taped that concert and thanks to the wonders of the internet you can hear it in its entirety here for posterity blended with stock footage is recorded the awesome talent and flair of charlie watts on drums advertisement december 1969 and the concert contrast could not have been starker the second time i saw the stones was at the ill fated free concert at the altamont speedway an experience i wrote about in a previous column the only thing i ll add at this juncture was that an ashen faced charlie watts kept drumming throughout the debacle my third time for the stones marked their reinvigorating return to form on the storied 1972 tour on june 8 at san francisco s winterland ballroom the group stormed through the best of the four concerts i attended after an uneasy period trying to fill brian jones s shoes guitar virtuoso mick taylor had come into his own as a stone his contributions preceding the tour on the albums sticky fingers and exile on main street are considerable what i remember about that night is that i got in line early and since it was general admission was able to get very close to the stage gone was the screaming mania of the sixties and the deathly pall of altamont i can fully corroborate rock critic robert christgau s quote about the tour that the mood of the shows was friendly with jagger undercutting his fabled demonism by playing the clown the village idiot the marionette the performance of the band was never better they opened with the celebratory and quite politically incorrect for our times brown sugar gimmie shelter rolled forth from its plaintive opening notes into a surging behemoth jagger enacted an extended light bondage scene to the strains of midnight rambler and they closed by dropping jumpin jack flash and street fighting man into the laps of the thralled pot intoxicated sell out crowd advertisement this clip from a texas stop captures the quality of the band at this time note watts drumming the powerhouse beat the perfectly timed cymbal crashes and driving fills that never stall the forward propulsion cut to 1989 seventeen years later i d attended hundreds of rock concerts during that interim but my interests had expanded from the original british invasion heroes to include all forms of heavy metal and hard rock i just never got back to see the rolling stones until the steel wheels tour a november 5 date announced for the oakland coliseum a bunch of my aging rock fan friends got together said why the hell not and bought a cluster of tickets before the show sold out we weren t that close and oakland security cops ensured that everyone remained in their seats still it was a great show quite an extravaganza with a gargantuan stage set and giant inflatable women burgeoning out to dwarf the band ronnie wood had come aboard after taylor s departure and it would be the last time bassist bill wyman whose pulsating skills combined with watt s drumming to complete one of the all time best rhythm sections in rock would tour with the band the stones were always big business but they were outsized business on the threshold of the nineties ticket receipts for the two coliseum shows totaled nearly 3 5 million advertisement this following clip captures what my friends and i witnessed from about forty rows back you don t see much of watts here but no bulls t he s back there age 49 holding down a killer beat rocking a groove for the ages won t say rip although of course we mean that rather say about a drummer i loved bye charlie author s note as this piece was submitted it was announced that the rolling stones upcoming no filter tour which kicks off on september 26 in st louis missouri would proceed as planned

listen to tracy briggs niagara s millionaire murderer podcast here niagara n d imagine the excitement leo and lottie verkuehlen must have felt that hot june day in 1915 the young couple parents to baby victor were just starting their life together leo 25 set out that day to do a little work on the property he had just purchased between niagara and shawnee n d leo was part of a large and hard working german family who had come from appleton wis to the tiny town of niagara to farm the rich soil of the red river valley but on june 26 1915 the soil leo dug near the foundation of his new home revealed something he could never have imagined six human skeletons all of whom had been brutally murdered advertisement anthropologists say if someone still has a bone from any of the murder victims it is highly probable that dna could be extracted that could help identify the victims istock special to the forum while the verkuehlens and the people of niagara population 157 were undoubtedly horrified by what was discovered that day sadly they probably weren t that surprised the previous owner of the home a man named eugene butler was known as an eccentric recluse he lived alone in the modest home on the prairie and he liked it that way he claimed all of the single women in town wanted to marry him and all of the men were out to get him he was often spotted racing on horseback through the countryside in the middle of the night sometimes screaming at the top of his lungs earning him the nickname the midnight rider but he got a different nickname following the grisly discovery of the buried skeletons in 1915 the great plains butcher who was eugene butler records show eugene butler was born in niagara county n y in december 1848 when he was 33 eugene and a handful of other men from the county decided to take the u s government up on its offer of free land on the frontier of dakota territory they headed west to grand forks county and named their homestead town niagara after their hometown in new york advertisement in the coming years butler amassed more acreage and became the wealthiest farmer in the area his estate and holdings worth an estimated 1 5 million in today s money but as his wealth grew his mental health faltered he was prone to hallucinations and paranoia he refused to have his photo taken for fear the camera would take away his soul and besides those midnight rides he was seldom seen in town and few dared to visit him at his home by all accounts he was a sick man sadly newspaper accounts long before the discovery of the bodies seemed to mock him for his unusual behavior his family back in new york became aware of his mental health problems and in 1904 had him committed to the north dakota state hospital in jamestown known by most then as the north dakota hospital for the insane butler was committed by family members to the north dakota state hospital in 1904 where he lived out the remainder of his life doctors there say he never mentioned the murders or exhibited homicidal tendencies this file photo was taken a few years after butler lived at the hospital the man on the bed is not butler photo courtesy of north dakota state university archives when butler was admitted to the hospital and authorities packed up his belongings they found more than 7 600 in cash checks and gold just laying around the house that would be like finding more than 215 000 today he also was in possession of sizable government bonds authorities later said he was the wealthiest person ever admitted to the state hospital advertisement butler was a man of small stature very gallant and fond of attending hospital dances he fell desperately in love with one of the lady physicians and her friends joked with her considerably about butler s ardent devotion dr a w guest in a 1915 newspaper story about murder suspect eugene butler who might not even remember he killed 6 people once at the hospital doctors report he only caused trouble at isolated times and showed no signs of homicidal tendencies they found he suffered hallucinations and he would ask his attendants if they heard people talking about him a couple of weeks after the discovery of the skeletons dr a w guest a physician at the hospital described butler now probably medicated as someone who hardly seemed likely to commit murder butler was a man of small stature very gallant and fond of attending hospital dances he fell desperately in love with one of the lady physicians and her friends joked with her considerably about butler s ardent devotion guest said his final years were uneventful he died of phlebitis in 1911 at the age of 62 his estate was split among his relatives in new york or sold the verkuehlen family purchased butler s property in the years following butler s death that s when they uncovered the nightmare of what happened before butler got medical attention several theories arose about the identities of the victims some thought they might have been visiting relatives of eugene butler s or possibly they were farmhands or housekeepers who worked for him istock special to the forum advertisement who were the victims the biggest mystery surrounding the six skeletons was their identities nobody in the vicinity reported anybody missing in the estimated years of the killings anywhere from about 1884 to 1904 in the earliest days of the investigation authorities weren t even sure of the ages or genders of the victims it appears butler took off the victim s clothes before he buried them as no clothing not even a button was found in the dirt he probably burned the clothes to make it harder to identify the victims with no clothing or personal belongings all investigators had to work with was the bones which led them to believe that the victims had all been killed the same way by a sharp object which put a hole in the left side of their skull niagara is on the western edge of grand forks county some residents like laurel nabben say it s become known for the tragedy if someone says niagara you mean that s where that guy buried all those dead people nabben told wday tv in 2016 some of the victims had their legs broken so as to better fit in the shallow grave in the crawlspace under the house it appeared that five of the victims had been killed and buried together at one time and a lone man was killed and buried separately at another time the coroner said that the man had a crooked nose but that is all they had to go on as authorities started coming up with theories at first they thought the skeletons were all young males possibly farmhands that worked and lived with butler this theory was given weight when a man in long prairie minn told authorities his brother went to work for a bachelor farmer in niagara and hadn t been heard from since later reports declared it was a family of five a husband wife and three children and one single man could the family have been butler s relatives from out east who came to check up on him not likely since all of his family members appeared to be accounted for would it be possible a family just happened upon butler s home asking for directions or shelter from a storm also not likely since he probably wouldn t have even let them in the house as the investigation progressed studying the bones and talking to neighbors authorities felt like they finally had an answer according to a july 2 newspaper article sheriff a f turner and coroner r mclean have made a thorough investigation and are reasonably certain that the persons killed include a negro the last servant to have been employed by butler and two former housekeepers and their children neighbors told law enforcement the few times butler spoke to them was to complain about his hired help and how they were trying to steal from him is that what led to the murders were these people really employees of butler s where did they come from did someone notice they were gone we might never know butler never spoke of the murdered people or admitted to killing anyone while institutionalized he might not have even remembered doing it advertisement but while authorities appeared to have figured out the approximate age and genders of the skeletons they never learned their names the home where eugene butler lived was torn down in 2016 this workshop stood where the house used to be mystery still surrounds the case as the people found buried on this land were never identified wday tv file photo could you help identify the victims despite the crimes happening more than 100 years ago it s not out of the question that the victims could still be identified using remains the probability is high we would be able to extract dna because the techniques are dramatically improved now anthropologist phoebe stubblefield said in a 2016 interview with wday tv stubblefield then an anthropology professor at the university of north dakota said even the smallest piece of bone could provide some answers dna will give us the same level of specificity which population they are descended from stubblefield said scientists say the bigger the bone like a skull or femur the more useful it would be advertisement you might be thinking ok let s test the bones easier said than done no one knows where the bones are or if they even still exist according to newspaper reports when news broke in june 1915 about the discovery of the skeletons more than 100 people went to the property and picked up a bone or two as a souvenir of the ghastly crime that was making national news meaning the bones are not in the possession of any law enforcement department so is it possible that someone reading this story or listening to this podcast might have had a relative who picked up one of those bones could it be packed away with his or her stuff in an attic or garage somewhere maybe the icing on the cake is someone will come forward and say i m missing a relative could this be my relative from the early 1900s that we know disappeared anthropologist phoebe stubblefield in 2016 of efforts to find and analyze bones from the butler murders if there is a story attached to that skull you just keep it especially the family members will maintain possession just keep passing it down and pass the story down stubblefield said the odds of finding an answer to the victims identities are the highest they ve been in decades with more people researching their ancestries and with larger dna databases of missing people a 2017 story published in time magazine and usa today said genealogy was the second most popular hobby in the u s just behind gardening in 2020 it was estimated that about 30 million people worldwide have taken dna tests more than half through family history sites like ancestry and 23andme opening up millions of possible ancestor or descendent matches the icing on the cake is someone will come forward and say i m missing a relative could this be my relative from the early 1900s that we know disappeared stubblefield said if you ve found a bone that you think might have been taken from the crime scene email tracy briggs forumcomm com for

oil has only done this twice in the past 20 years and it could forecast a 50 rally oil prices could be setting up for a major rally one strategist says though the energy sector has cooled off in recent months u s west texas intermediate crude s price chart just flashed a rare signal miller tabak s matt maley told cnbc s trading nation on wednesday crude oil has seen what s called a golden cross on its weekly chart the firm s chief market strategist said a golden cross occurs when an asset s shorter term moving average crosses above its longer term moving average and is broadly seen as a signal of further upside in oil s case that s only happened three times since the beginning of this century and each of those three times has been followed by a very strong further rally in crude oil anywhere from 20 50 maley said if oil continues to rally here energy stocks should continue to bounce as well and i think that s a group where i think people can do really well for the last third of the year investors should consider adding some downside protection to their portfolios as the market enters the seasonally difficult september december trading period bk asset management s boris schlossberg said in the same interview i d call this the terminator market it s always coming back it refuses to die schlossberg said but i think there is certainly some potential for danger here with bond yields creeping up as inflationary pressures persist the odds of a correction in high valuation stocks are also rising said schlossberg his firm s managing director of fx strategy i think the single best bet here for downside protection is to simply buy the 380 360 qqq put spread because that ll give you protection to the downside on nasdaq which is the most volatile of the indices he said that represents a bet that invesco s qqq etf which tracks the nasdaq will stay below 380 a share through the trade s november expiry for the trade to generate its maximum profit qqq would have to fall below 360 a share qqq was trading around 373 midday thursday if it works it s going to give you a very decent protection at least about 5 to the downside schlossberg said the higher those bond yields creep up the more likely the nasdaq is going to correct because the nasdaq is basically operating on the assumption of free money he said the moment that money becomes even a tiny bit more expensive valuations are going to start to contract so to me that s probably the single biggest catalyst to the downside as we go into the fall season source cnbc

quick fix to their housing troubles will be disappointed photo by peter j thompson national post files article content housing affordability is fast emerging as a major election issue and one that might just influence the outcome as the parties try to improve the country s unbridled growth in housing prices and rents canadians cannot be blamed for wondering how a land rich country has become so poor at developing land with more than 270 square kilometres of land for every 1 000 canadians canada is at least nine times as land rich per capita as the united states yet housing prices and rents

we have scoured through the housing platforms of the conservatives liberals and ndp the three leading contenders to see whose platform offers realistic and implementable solutions that could make a meaningful difference in approving housing market outcomes for middle and low income canadians article content we found the political platforms to be similar in their three pronged approach blame foreign homebuyers for our housing woes encourage first time homebuyers by offering rebates and subsidies and motivate the construction of new homes above levels we have observed in the recent past photo by gigi suhanic national post photo illustration the liberals and conservatives would like to ban foreigners from buying residential properties in canada for at least two years the ndp proposes a 20 per cent tax on foreign homebuyers but blaming foreign buyers for housing price escalation is to some extent scapegoating data on homebuyer nationality is not readily available but statistics canada in 2017 reported that even in the coveted housing markets of toronto and vancouver fewer than five per cent of the homes were owned by non residents of canada some of whom were canadian

content the unprecedented growth in housing prices across the country during the pandemic when international travel and the flow of capital were noticeably lower suggests the primary determinants of housing demand are domestic rather than foreign hence subjecting foreign buyers to a ban or additional taxes is unlikely to harm canadian housing markets so such measures are limited in their ability to offer meaningful relief at the same time measures to improve transparency by developing a registry of beneficial ownership is an urgently needed measure that enjoys unanimous support from the three leading parties first time homebuyers fthb often comprising younger cohorts who are a rapidly growing block of voters are the targeted beneficiaries of numerous initiatives that offer subsidies tax rebates and other concessions to help with home purchases for example the liberals have a rent to own initiative the conservatives plan to lengthen mortgage terms to seven to 10 years and the ndp proposes doubling the home buyer s tax credit to 1 500 some measures might not profoundly enhance affordability but other initiatives such as the liberals first home savings account to permit young canadians to save up to 40 000 tax free could make a significant difference for young homebuyers advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content such measures are designed to assist otherwise disadvantaged young homebuyers with limited access to equity or none at all but these initiatives will also boost demand and exert additional pressure on housing prices thus making matters difficult for those who would not benefit from them to a varying degree the three parties recognize the need to build new housing in canada the population adjusted housing construction rate has recently declined to 6 000 housing starts per million people from 12 000 in the early 1970s photo by james macdonald bloomberg files despite the drastic decline in new housing construction over the past five decades the measures to increase the rate of construction leave much to be desired the conservative platform promises a million new homes in three years which roughly translates into 80 000 additional dwellings each year above and beyond what is likely to be built if the status quo prevails the liberals promise to build preserve or repair 1 4 million homes in the next four years it claims the plan will deliver 30 per cent more homes than the conservatives plan will regrettably the liberal claim is political jugglery at best advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the liberals have squeezed 300 000 additional new homes into its platform by stretching the timeline to four years while the conservatives have a three year plan essentially the liberal and conservative platforms are promising about the same number of new homes the ndp promises 500 000 units of quality affordable housing in the next 10 years with half of that done within five years however it is not clear whether that number is on top of what would have been built under the status quo still the commitment to build affordable housing at the rate of 50 000 homes per year is an admirable distinction of the ndp platform we have found measures equally worth praising in the liberal and conservative platforms for example the conservatives promise to defer the capital gains tax if the proceeds from the sale of a rental property are reinvested in rental housing this will likely stimulate rental housing construction which nosedived after the implementation of the tax in the early 1970s the liberal plan to outlaw blind bidding where buyers bid against each other without knowing what others have bid is a welcome step to improve transparency the technology already exists to protect the identity of bidders while making the bid amounts transparent such a measure is likely to remove the asymmetry of information between buyers and sellers advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content recommended from editorial liberal housing platform includes foreign home buying freeze blind bidding ban how the conservatives plan to tame canada s housing dragon how federal parties plan to fix housing crisis after years of failed policies canadians piling into mortgages at fastest pace since 2007 missing from all the announcements are bold measures needed to improve shelter alternatives for those households who may no longer be able to afford market rents either because of their health or other circumstances the never exhausted waiting list for social housing in the biggest cities suggests that the stock of public housing or dwellings with rent geared to income needs to be increased many times over tinkering at the margins will not help those priced out of even the cheapest rental markets the housing initiatives outlined in the three platforms are modest in ambition average in imagination and limited in their ability to offer fast relief some measures will increase demand even further and the supply side initiatives are just too timid to make a meaningful impact in the next few years anyone hoping for a quick fix to their housing troubles will regrettably have

our industry we encounter challenges related to covid 19 including having to make a reserve for covid 19 inventory manufactured early in the pandemic due to limited knowledge about what products would best address the crisis our gross margin and losses during the year were negatively impacted by these reserves for our early covid 19 tests we do not anticipate any further significant r d effort or

in a speech that investors have had circled for weeks fed chair jerome h powell pictured in this file photo made clear that a slowing of the fed s bond purchases doesn t mean a rise in short term rates is imminent wall street rallied to records friday after the head of the federal reserve said it s still far from pulling interest rates off the record low that s helped markets soar even if it does begin dialing back its support for the economy this year the standard poor s 500 index rose 39 37 points or 0 9 to 4 509 37 that tops its prior all time high set wednesday part of a widespread rally that swept up everything from bonds to gold the dow jones industrial average climbed 242 68 points or 0 7 to 35 455 80 and the nasdaq composite gained 183 69 points or 1 2 to end at 15 129 50 for the record a previous version of this story said the dow jones industrial average climbed to 34 455 80 it closed at 35 455 80 stocks have set record after record this year thanks in large part to the federal reserve s massive efforts to prop up the economy and financial markets but the gains grew more tentative as the beginning of the end of the fed s assistance came into sight now that the unemployment rate has dropped and inflation has picked up advertisement in a speech that investors have had circled for weeks fed chair jerome h powell said that the economy has met one big milestone the central bank had set to slow the 120 billion in bond purchases it s making each month that could mean a paring back by the end of the year of the purchases which are meant to keep longer term interest rates low and to juice the economy but powell also cited past mistakes in which policymakers made premature moves in the face of seemingly high inflation stressing again that today s high inflation looks to be only temporary he also made clear that a slowing of the fed s bond purchases doesn t mean a rise in short term rates is imminent that would require the job market and inflation to pass substantially more stringent tests we have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment powell said many investors took powell s speech as a sign the fed will keep supporting the market with low interest rates which can act like steroids for stocks in the lingo of wall street it was dovish in tone rather than hawkish which would have advocated a quicker rise in rates he not as much spoke it as he cooed it said ernesto ramos u s chief investment officer at bmo global asset management he was super dovish stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy made the biggest gains after the speech smaller companies were particularly strong with the small cap russell 2000 index up 2 9 more than triple the gain for the big stocks in the s p 500 they often do best when investors feel more optimistic about lower rates and a stronger economy treasury yields were lower but only after some swings after sitting at 1 35 shortly before powell s speech the yield on the 10 year treasury sank as powell cited the past premature moves by policymakers on worries about short term bursts in inflation saying such a mistake could be particularly harmful now advertisement yields later recovered a bit of their drops after powell said substantial further progress has been made on the fed s inflation goals one of the two milestones needed for the central bank to slow its bond purchases the other which focuses on employment has shown progress but powell did not say it had been fulfilled the yield on the 10 year treasury was at 1 30 late friday down from 1 34 late thursday powell also said that the coronavirus delta variant is complicating things though he still expects improvements to continue the faster spreading delta variant has already slowed some economic activity a report friday showed that consumer spending in the country rose 0 3 in july from june a sharp slowdown from the prior month s 1 1 jump that s a big deal when consumer spending is the driving force of the u s economy and its growth slowed even though income growth for americans accelerated to 1 1 last month the report also showed that a gauge of year over year inflation preferred by the fed held steady at 3 6 in july slightly higher than economists expected the next date circled on investors calendars is in a week when the government reports how many people businesses hired in august a strong report could give the fed even more leeway to begin slowing its bond purchases producers of commodities made the stock market s biggest jumps as lower yields and a weakening dollar pushed up prices for oil gold and other raw materials advertisement occidental petroleum leaped 6 9 for the largest gain in the s p 500 and miner freeport mcmoran rose 5 9 on the losing end was peloton interactive which tumbled 8 5 it reported a loss for its latest quarter cut the price of its most popular product and disclosed that it s been subpoenaed by the justice

the city of chicago has filed separate lawsuits against grubhub and doordash alleging the third party delivery companies engaged in deceptive practices to prey on its affiliated restaurants the lawsuits filed today august 27 in cook county circuit court contain a multitude of allegations including that the companies use bait and switch tactics to fool customers into thinking they ll be paying lower fees compared to what they re ultimately charged the doordash lawsuit also alleges that the company used consumer tips to pay itself rather than its drivers there s also the question of the chicago fee the charge doordash added to compensate for the city s pandemic era fee cap the city says doordash tried to make it seem like the chicago fee was being administered by the city and even included a customer s tweet from january in the lawsuit one thing about chicago they gon tax your ass lmao one thing about chicago they gon tax your ass lmao taylor rooks stan account fatmackington january 2 2021 a doordash spokesperson says drivers get 100 percent of tips but had no comment on the chicago fee tipping was also the subject of a 2 5 million settlement after the washington d c attorney general investigated doordash in november 2020 at one point doordash was using tips to subsidized wages for drivers meaning employees wouldn t earn more than their locked in wages doordash has since ended this practice attorneys for the city listed many issues relevant to restaurant owners in the lawsuits including adding restaurants to the platform without the owner s knowledge or consent using telephone routing numbers to charge commission on phone calls that didn t result in orders and even creating fake restaurant websites to redirect customers to the delivery platform many owners have raised concerns that the city hasn t done enough to help them although the city did institute a 15 percent fee cap on third parties first enacted in november 2020 doordash and grubhub are suing san francisco over its decision to implement a permanent fee cap on third party delivery companies new york is now looking to enact the same policy these are the first lawsuits of their kind of america other municipalities have sued the companies honing in one a single issue for example massachusetts attorney general sued grubhub in july accusing it of violating a fee cap chicago s lawsuits are the first to combine a variety of issues in one filing city officials say a comprehensive lawsuit is more efficient on friday afternoon chicago s restaurants cheered the city s filings many of them including medici s on 57th street bianca s burgers parachute were mentioned in the lawsuit citing social media posts and media coverage of the alleged mistreatment one example came from taqueria la chaquita in lawndale with a doordash menu pulled on august 26 showing a selection of seafood tacos mariscos are great however the restaurant does not serve seafood this is is how restaurants have been feeling for longer than the last 18 months says scott weiner co owner of the fifty 50 restaurant group weiner whose company includes roots handmade pizza and utopian tailgate adds it feels a little to read and to hear that finally after a lengthy investigation that we re right they ve ruined us we ve been taken advantage of in january phil foss owner of el ideas a creative fine dining restaurant in douglass park shared his displeasure with third party delivery apps in an op ed with eater chicago writing the restaurant industry has been cannibalizing itself by joining delivery services like grubhub doordash and ubereats on friday foss said it s incredibly inspiring to feel like someone s listening to restaurants mayor lori lightfoot s office and the city are in the right to stand up to the bullying tactics of third party delivery services foss adds these predatory companies have cornered restaurants into accepting their exorbitant fees or to not realistically have a chance to compete at all steingold s the modern jewish deli next door to the music box in lakeview hasn t used either company for almost two years says owner aaron steingold instead he s found success with bike messenger service cut cats and tock the reservation and ordering portal co founded by alinea group s nick kokonas that was recently sold to squarespace i think the lawsuit is a long time coming and fully support it steingold says using these services with their unreasonably high commissions results in lower quality food and minimal to no profit margins for small restaurants grubhub vehemently rejected each of the city s allegations saying that the company is following the city s mandate to include a clear and itemized fee breakdown we are deeply disappointed by mayor lightfoot s decision to file this baseless lawsuit every single allegation is categorically wrong and we will aggressively defend our business practices we look forward to responding in court and are confident we will prevail doordash provided a similar statement this lawsuit is baseless it is a waste of taxpayer resources and chicagoans should be outraged doordash has stood with the city of chicago throughout the pandemic waiving fees for restaurants providing 500 000 in direct grants creating strong earning opportunities and delivering food and other necessities to communities in need this lawsuit will cost taxpayers and deliver nothing lightfoot is believed to be leading the charge on this lawsuit angry that she had been deceived sources say last year with covid 19 just starting to spread lightfoot conducted a news conference at city hall flanked by grubhub ceo matt maloney for an awkwardly rolled out announcement in which grubhub said it would give restaurants a break by deferring the collection of fees the mayor stressed how important delivery could be with indoor dining in jeopardy she described chicago based grubhub as a strong community partner an entity that cared about small businesses at a city meeting two months later a group of restaurant owners shared their horror stories in dealing with third party delivery companies and that s what helped trigger the city s investigation many restaurant owners who are active members in the illinois restaurant association participated in that city meeting last year association president and ceo sam toia provided this statement to eater the ira has long advocated in both the city of chicago and statewide that any third party delivering restaurants food or using their names logos and menus without consent is a serious issue for the industry we appreciate the city of chicago taking action to help restaurants protect their brands and businesses hopefully this step will lead to all parties coming together to find a permanent resolution with guardrails in place moving forward though both doordash and grubhub generate billions of dollars in revenue the two companies have struggled to turn a profit despite record sales throughout the pandemic resulting falling stock prices grubhub and doordash have poured money into advertising something that rivals including ubereats which the city isn t suing have also done heather bublick co owner of evanston based barbecue spot soul smoke says ubereats is the only big delivery platform that worked with her to keep fees relatively low soul smoke also has ghost kitchen locations in avondale and south loop and those locations primarily rely on delivery she says so every percentage helps despite the endorsement from bublick ubereats may not be off the hook as the city isn t finished with its investigation and more lawsuits could be filed the city s lawsuit against grubhub also referred to the company s supper for support campaign which used somber piano music in taking advantage of consumers concern for struggling local businesses with deceptive language that significantly misrepresented the true qualities and characteristics of these programs the lawsuit further alleges that grubhub s promotion came at expense of restaurants forcing them to cover the costs of any discounts offered to customers grubhub imposed two very significant requirements on all participating restaurants first grubhub required restaurants to absorb the full cost of the 10 discount second after reducing the restaurants proceeds by 10 for each order grubhub required restaurants to pay grubhub s commission on the full non discounted price of the food order grubhub didn t mention its communication with consumers but on friday the company said that restaurants that participated in the program knew about specifics and nothing was held back the city wants the companies to abide by existing policies and there isn t an exact sum listed in terms for damages sought the lawsuit asks for 2 000 to 10 000 for every offense or party harmed that total could add up the city also wants the companies disgorge any profits made due to any alleged violations upon receiving the filings and being served grubhub and doordash will have 30 days to respond before a court date is assigned reporter naomi waxman contributed to this report

new york wall street rallied to records on friday after the head of the federal reserve said it s still far from pulling interest rates off the record low that s helped markets soar even if it does begin dialing back its support for the economy later this year the s p 500 rose 39 37 or 0 9 percent to 4 509 37 to top its prior all time high set on wednesday part of a widespread rally that swept up everything from bonds to gold the dow jones industrial average climbed 242 68 points or 0 7 percent to 34 455 80 and the nasdaq composite gained 183 69 or 1 2 percent to 15 129 50 stocks have set record after record this year thanks in large part to the federal reserve s massive efforts to prop up the economy and financial markets but the gains had grown more tentative as the beginning of the end of the fed s assistance came into sight now that the unemployment rate has dropped and inflation has picked up in a speech that investors have had circled for weeks federal reserve chairman jerome powell said that the economy has met one big milestone the central bank had set to slow the 120 billion in bond purchases it s making each month that could mean a paring back by the end of the year of the purchases which are meant to keep longer term interest rates low and to juice the economy but powell also cited past mistakes where policy makers made premature moves in the face of seemingly high inflation stressing again that today s high inflation looks to be only temporary he also made clear that a slowing of the fed s bond purchases doesn t mean a rise in short term rates is imminent that would require the job market and inflation to hurdle substantially more stringent tests we have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment powell said at the end of powell s speech many investors took it as a sign the fed will keep supporting the market with low interest rates which can act like steroids for stocks in the lingo of wall street it was dovish in tone rather than hawkish which would have advocated for a quicker rise in rates he not as much spoke it as he cooed it said ernesto ramos u s chief investment officer at bmo global asset management he was super dovish stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy made the biggest gains following the speech smaller companies were particularly strong with the small cap russell 2000 index up 2 9 percent more than triple the gain for the big stocks in the s p 500 they often do best when investors feel more optimistic about lower rates and a stronger economy markets are loving it ramos said but he also cautioned that the longer ultralow interest rate policy helps to prop up the markets the withdrawal may be worse once it s finally exhausted it strengthens our view that markets will continue to do well this year he said but when the accommodation is fully removed how bad of a hangover will it be just like a party the hangover is less bad if you leave earlier treasury yields were lower but only after some swings after sitting at 1 35 percent shortly before powell s speech the yield on the 10 year treasury sank as powell cited past instances where policy makers prematurely raised interest rates on worries about short term bursts in inflation saying such a mistake could be particularly harmful now yields later recovered a bit of their drops after powell said substantial further progress has been made on its inflation goals one of the two milestones needed for the fed to slow its bond purchases the other which focuses on employment has shown progress but powell did not say it had been fulfilled the yield on the 10 year treasury was at 1 30 percent late friday down from 1 34 percent late thursday of course powell also said that the delta variant of the coronavirus is complicating things though he still expects improvements to continue the faster spreading delta variant has already slowed some economic activity a report on friday showed that consumer spending in the country rose 0 3 percent in july from june a sharp slowdown from the prior month s 1 1 percent jump that s a big deal when consumer spending is the driving force of the u s economy and its growth slowed even though income growth for americans accelerated to 1 1 percent last month the report also showed that a gauge of year over year inflation preferred by the fed held steady at 3 6 percent in july slightly higher than economists expected the next date circled on investors calendars is in a week when the government reports how many people businesses hired in august a strong report could give the fed even more leeway to begin slowing its bond purchases producers of commodities made the stock market s biggest jumps as lower yields and a weakening dollar pushed up prices for oil gold

housing in south snohomish county is a truly grim picture that s according to one expert who spoke during a wednesday night meeting organized by the verdant health commission around the questions of where we are with affordable housing where we need to be and the link between housing and health one after another presenters from south county cities and nonprofits told commissioners that prices are going up rents are going up too few housing units are being built the population is booming and incomes are stagnant all of this creates an urgent need for a plan since the state legislature gave hospital districts broad authority to engage in any activities that promote community health verdant commissioners are considering what they can do to participate in solving the housing crisis and thus contribute to community health verdant has approximately the same footprint as the edmonds school district and serves about 180 000 people in edmonds esperance woodway mountlake terrace brier lynnwood plus small pieces of bothell and unincorporated snohomish county the verdant health commission is the government overseeing south snohomish county s public hospital district no 2 in addition to receiving rent for what is now swedish edmonds the former stevens hospital that verdant leased to swedish health systems verdant owns some property in the hospital area including the krueger clinic and the former value village property on highway 99 that rent brings in about 11 million annually and verdant also receives about 2 4 million annually in tax dollars for operations and maintenance verdant operates a wellness center in lynnwood that offers a range of health related programs and also provides community grants for local health and wellness programs time after time at wednesday night s virtual meeting planners and experts emphasized the clarity of the research that shows permanent housing increases health children benefit when they have a home as do people with chronic disease and mental health issues society benefits overall the problem is how to provide enough housing that people can afford meeting attendees first heard from jess blanch of the enterprise community partners a nonprofit working on housing initiative nationwide verdant she said could consider a variety of initiatives for example she suggested creating respite housing for post hospital stays participating in a national coalition to promote prescriptions for housing building housing developments with a health element included or looking for publicly owned tax exempt land to develop for affordable housing the director of human services for snohomish county mary jane brell vujovic described the work of the housing affordability regional taskforce hart to create a five year plan to address the issue the challenge is huge south county will have a million plus people by 2040 and the cost of housing is rising much faster than incomes she said teachers nurses firefighters all struggle to afford housing here the two most expensive ways to house people are jail and emergency rooms she said and we do a lot of that city of edmonds associate planner brad shipley pointed out that a third of all edmonds residents are cost burdened meaning they have to spend more than 30 of their income on housing the city has a shortage of small units yet most households are just one or two people it s an aging population that wants to age in place like other cities edmonds is short of housing in the missing middle units that are not single family detached homes and not multi story apartments or condos townhouses and cottages are among the other options that most cities in this region admit to missing shipley reviewed the recommendations of the edmonds citizens housing committsion to the edmonds city council noting that those are still under review city of mountlake terrace seniro planner edith duttlinger echoed all those concerns adding that her city has 65 single family homes the city council did vote to allow cottage housing adus mixed use and townhomes and she expects more development when sound transit s link light rail station opens in 2024 this is a difficult issue she said there are no easy answers there are no cheap answers sometimes politics makes it all more difficult city of lynnwood senior planner kristen holdsworth described that city s five year housing action plan and recognized they have already activated much of the plan but still have much to do to accommodate a growing and increasingly diverse population all the experts concurred on one thing there isn t a choice between growth and no growth the choice is between planned growth and unplanned growth which is very expensive down the road shipley had a warning if the cities don t plan for growth the state will step in verdant commissioner deana knutsen was struck by the fact that often cities were not able to move forward even though they had all the research and had even done a great deal of planning at least two presenters mentioned the difficulty of making progress through some challenging political climates in their cities i m most concerned knutsen said about how we make people comfortable and it doesn t become a nimby not in my back yard problem commissioner fred langer said he is amazed at the scope of the problem this board is keenly aware that homelessness is a marker for health but the problem is so big i just hope we as a community are up to the task commission president bob knowles ended the meeting by saying there was a lot of review and there will be no next steps for verdant until they can review and engage the community by mauri shuler

elkton maryland church to norski john todd the illuminati and witchcraft talk from bible baptist church elkton md 1978 update on january 16 2014 the information on this page is very interesting however i do not think it is as nearly as valuable as knowing who is at the very head of the illumanati the jesuits and the papacy please check out my research on it on july 2 2010 i received by email a pdf file of yet another one of john todd s talks and converted the file to text with some editing to correct misspellings and typos the talk is not exactly the same as the one on my other web site it contains additional information that may interest you i first read john todd s message about the illuminati sometime in 1980 and it has been the key for me that has unlocked the true meaning of what i read and see in the news in my opinion without this information one is doomed to remain locked into the false left right paradigm with only a worm s eye view of true political reality jacob sailor s 1980 illustration showing satan s control of the political world jacob sailor s 1980 illustration showing satan s control of the political world from tape recorded lectures by john todd ex grand druid witch at bible baptist church elkton md usa fall 1978 there is no reason to have fear in your heart there is nothing to be afraid of when it comes to the devil he was defeated 2 000 years ago i learned what most witches don t know and that the gods they worship are demons they like to call them spirit guides and that there is only one god and his name is lucifer i was explained to that lucifer was a good god and not an evil god and that jesus was the imitator we were the religion of a political organisation called the illuminati the seal of the illuminati says this new order that began 1776 not the 4th of july but may 1st 1776 the creation day of the illuminati on the top of each pyramid you will see a capstone with an eye in it the capstone is the rothschild family or tribunal that rules the illuminati they were the creators of it the eye is lucifer their god and their voice the top block is the council of 13 called the grand druid council they only take orders from the rothschilds they re their private priesthood the council of 33 is directly under them that is the 33 highest masons in the world then the council of 500 some of the richest people in the world the golden dawn is the rothschilds private coven the aquarian art festival is the organisation that ties all the occult brotherhood together the national council of churches the satanic brotherhood of america scientology unity is the main platform for witches to be speakers at towards what they consider to be christian people the church of wicka is another denomination the process church of final judgement is a church which charles manson belonged to they believe in human sacrifice and they believe that the only answer to christianity is to bomb the churches and execute the christians the garnarian brotherhood is the traditional witchcraft in england the order of rosicrucians is a sacrifice order and the holy order of garter is another traditional english witchcraft group the trilateral council is the inner council of the council of foreign relations which is the american name for the illuminati they are not there without full knowledge and they are hand picked by david rockefeller the leader of the illuminati in the united states without the sphinx the mystery of the illuminati would have no power this is were all the power comes from the head of it is the rothschild family and the council of 500 under that the rockefellers duponts kennedys onasises and other families queen juliana is also on the council of 500 in the centre is its heart the bank of england the bank of france the federal reserve act a stockholder company owned by individuals much of the stock is owned by non americans many banks and famous corporations are owned or controlled by the illuminati housewives cannot shop without buying from a company that the illuminati owns it is impossible in 1966 phillip rothschild ordered one of his mistresses to write an 1100 page book that would describe to all witches how they would take control of the world through the illuminati it s called atlas shrugs she spent a third of the book describing how they would raise the oil prices and then later destroy the oil fields and then they would completely shut down the coal their sole purpose is to bankrupt their own companies and destroy their own companies until they destroyed the currency of the whole world and still be so financially strong they would withstand it the grand druids meet eight times a year on the witches sabbath at various locations in the world the grand druid council is nothing but glorified bankers they write million of dollars worth of cheques to people in political and religious fields every month even though i was part of setting up a world government i never took it seriously until we opened two letters in the first one was a chart that listed a plan for a world take over the other letter said we have found a man whom we believe to be the son of lucifer we believe that through his works and our backings he can become ruler of this world stop all wars and bring peace finally to this war stricken world we had found a person so fantastically powered that he could convince people he was their only salvation in christian terms demon possessed like nobody had ever seen jn 2 18 rev 13 the cornerstone of the whole floor of witchcraft is that you cannot mix a potion you cannot do a rite without a firm knowledge of astrology it is the base for all practices in witchcraft and one of its teachings is that you are born a set personality and there is nothing you can do to change from that set personality you don t leave witchcraft once you re in you re in the greatest wizard that that ever lived was king solomon as great as his writings were in our bible they were as great in the witchcraft bibles initiation rites how to conjure demons up everything even how to commit human sacrifices are writings that he created the star of david has just recently been called the star of david for thousands of years it was called the hexagram or the crest of solomon now when a witch wants to practice witchcraft she ll get in a pentagram that s the five pointed star in the circle their strongest form of protection then they will lay this six pointed star or hexagram which means to hex or to cast black magic or to put a spell on somebody they ll put it in a circle on the floor and this will cause the demons to appear at their instructions it is the most evil sign of witchcraft it s dangerous to have it the pentagram the pinnacle with the one point up means witchcraft two points up means demon worship or satanism a two points up five pointed star symbolises the goat head which is representative of the devil the ankh means that you despise virginity believe in fertility rites practice fertility rites and worship the sun god ra the egyptian name for lucifer the peace symbol is the broken cross if a christian wants to join witchcraft they would have to take a ceramic cross and turn it upside down and break the cross bars down symbolising their rejection of calvary this is said to bring you peace of mind while you practice witchcraft that s where it got the word peace symbol comes from they are in the process of a trial and error right now and they test things they tested what it would be like to be without fuel to heat homes they are going to see if they can t starve you absolutely shut all electricity off the timetable in the book atlas shrug ended with this when the lights of new york city go out for the last time we will have the world towards the end they are going to cut the cities off completely nothing will move for months they are in the process of destroying all stored food and farmland so that we will be without any food in the cities or in the country or anywhere except what is in the federal storehouses nothing is going to move at all if you live in a big city how are you going to get your food if they don t bring it to you everything will be paralysed nothing will move at the same time there will be riot and revolution in the whole world charles manson went to prison for a reason there is a mass army within every prison from coast to coast he has them united he has been gathering an army and the one thing that will hold their plan up is if they don t get the gun law passed they have been promised that all the guns will be confiscated before they make their move they have been set up just so they will kill one million people and i will leave it to you imagination who is scheduled to be killed this is just so that they can get the national guard called out the whole thing is if you can be independent of federal help their plan won t work you must be dependent on the federal government for every bite of food every warmth that you feel coming through your homes you must be dependent on them the communist party is run by illuminati not communists in 1776 albert pike the head of the illuminati also head of the masons at the time said that they needed to create a political party that would frighten the world and keep it fighting with each other until they could bring peace to the world and then karl marx showed up now if you go to the british museum you can find two cheques for several thousand pounds made out to karl marx signed by nathan rothschild i can go into how lenin and trotsky stayed at the krupp mansion in new york financed by rockefeller and krupp and schiffs how they put four million dollars worth of jacob schiff s gold to finance the revolution sailed from new york harbor where their ship was confiscated by the british government as it tried to run a blockade during ww1 and woodrow wilson called and ordered their release so america wouldn t go into the war and they were sent on their way involved organizations b nai b rith american civil liberties union the scottish rites the new york rites the jaycess the junior chamber of commerce the masonic lodges the knights of columbus the knights of philistivis and the oddfellows it s leaders use these organisations for their purposes that does not mean that the members of those organisations know what s going on the 33rd level masons consider jesus to be the impersonator and the true god is lucifer tarot cards every drawing means something and the demons control how they fall nothing in witchcraft is ever 100 accurate the illuminati will use israel to gain control of the world the only thing the illuminati fear is an independent person who can live eat sleep stay warm and defend themselves separate from federal help they have never been this organised is rock music an outgrowth of witchcraft you can t practice witchcraft without it most of the rock groups are members of a witchcraft church that s their religion and when they do a song they ll ask the witch coven or the temple to cast a spell over that song so that it will become a hit and sell when a witch casts a spell they order demons to do things when you buy an album it s you who gets a free surprise it s called a demon it goes along with the record much of the music is written in witch language by witches elton john has made the statement that he has never written or sung a song that was not in witch language beyond the yellow brick road is 100 witch language that s why many songs you don t understand that s why many people who listen to them don t understand until they get high on drugs and then all of a sudden the meanings start coming to them many songs have been written in witch language such as the whole album by carol king called tapestry the book of prophecy to witches is the double white album that the beatles produced containing the song helter skelter every song in it is prophesy oh let s see horse with no name one tin soldier i could list thousands of songs that were written this way they definitely have demonic influence behind them have you noticed the increase of rebellion in teenagers in your home it s your fault you let them listen to it it stirs up rebellion it s not the words in the song it s the music witches know it they hit certain chords on purpose the music is hypnotic it stirs up a war like nature in the young people it s the truth the supernatural is tied in with the music the most perfect description of lucifer that ever existed is in the 28th chapter of ezekiel in the king of tyrus it describes lucifer as being created with musical instruments imbedded in his body he thinks he s god and therefore he must have music because gods must have music see also isa 14 4 21 i look into a person s eyes when i talk to them i want to know who i m talking to and who i m not talking to when you lived in a supernatural world and you have dealt with demons it s no different when you spot them in a person who s professing to be a christian who isn t living the life a christian can t be possessed but when you can no longer crucify the flesh and it goes beyond just crucifying the flesh then it s time to cast out the demon through prayer and the blood and the name of jesus just tell the devil to get out we just have to say a prayer of rejection and we just take authority over them you are not a christian because you say you re born again you re a christian if you have the fruit of the spirit if it s not there you re going to grow up thorns and not apples i try to stay away from politics i was very politically minded when i was a witch i try to stay very christian minded and you can t do both books written by charles finney who was saved out of the masons and of the first man executed by the illuminati for betraying them captain morgan expose i don t believe that christians can have books written by witches in their libraries and get away with it many conservative political organisations find the illuminati in their journeys it s hard to fool around with politics and history and not to see the conspiracy but they look at this little thing over here and they see a war is happening or they look over here at this little political movement and they miss the whole picture because they look at it from the outside it s impossible to look at the illuminati from the outside unless you under stand its structure physical minds and computers can not come up with the conspiracy as powerful and as direct as workable that has hundreds of different little conspiracies off of it that do not know that it s all one big conspiracy it s impossible to do something like this without a supernatural direction the prince and power of the air they have lucifer leading them ezekiel the 28th verse11 when lucifer was created he was the complete sum of all beauty and wisdom god wasn t created but never had a created creature ever been created with such beauty and such wisdom and that was lucifer the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created he was created with musical instruments imbedded in his body he knows that to be a god he is going to have to have music you can t be a god without music so he has created his own music witches don t say witchcraft and they don t say witches they say practisers or something like this and they say the force they describe him as the force star wars is the biggest thing that witchcraft has ever done to spread its doctrine there s nothing that happens by accidents the devil s our accuser he stands before the throne of god constantly accusing us the covering angel before god s throne covered with jewels and when god s light shone through him it was like a prism it changed the colors to where they come out and colors are extremely important to the devil everything he does is in colors without them nothing happens fight him really heard and i guarantee you that he ll show up in your life he ll pay you a visit and say hi if you start fighting the devil and if he doesn t show up he ll send somebody to pay you a visit the devil can only interfere in a christian s life through several things if you fear him he can come in because you worshipped him if you own something that belongs to him jewelry books on the occult astrology and things that were actually created by the devil such as rock music without it witches don t function when witches do a book they do a spell over the manuscript and they command demons which are under their authority to enter every manuscript that comes off the press every copy of that book so when you buy that book you get a little free gift like when you open a little cracker jacks box and there s a little trinket in there well you get a free demon free of charge most of the rock groups do the same thing this is why records zoom to the charts you get free of charge your own private demon you are responsible for the articles in your home cause you are the head of the house maybe that s why your finances are messed up maybe that s why you and your kids are sick once in a while and you shouldn t be how much credit do i give the devil for sickness all of it lock stock and barrel there are seven principalities in the devil s kingdom there s satan and there s baalzebub his prince under that are the seven principalities and under the principalities are the powers and under the powers billions of demons the seven principalities are as follows rege which is the principality of the occult deuteronomy 18 when a woman is pregnant somebody will get a medallion and swing it over their hand and say let s see if you re going to have a girl or a boy that s called divination you might gain troubles from it by allowing it to happen the difference between witchcraft and sorcery is sorcery is the use of certain occult drugs timothy leary said in his book on lsd you re not hallucinating when you take acid acid is blocking the physical senses out so that you can see the supernatural world the next one is lazers sexual lust after lazers is bacchus the roman god of wine he s the principalities of addiction and he doesn t care what you feed him just as long as you are addicted to it food and caffeine alcohol cigarettes and drugs as when you ve got to have it and you use it as a solution to your problems i gotta have my cup of coffee next pan pan says what fools the mortals be pan is the principality of the mind this is the devil s favorite playground the soul the mind we run into pan more than in any other demon because of the demon of rejection that he is over this is the base for sexual problems drug problems and occult problems they pick this demon up when they re a child sometimes even before they re even born and they carry this thing that opens them up to other demons trying to feed and fulfill the demon that s driving them from within he s also over neuralgia depression suicide schizophrenia paranoia all the mental illnesses this is why people with rejection problems have deep depression they try and kill themselves they re nervous all the time the next one is set the principality of death he was the egyptian god of the underworld set is over all sicknesses there are 39 major illnesses and the occult credits him with 39 powers and it s interesting that it s believed tat christ took 39 stripes for our healing the seventh one does not have a name because witches don t use it they call it a christian principality it s called the principality of contentment you can feel the power the principality in the air of contentment describing lucifer i ve seen him sit down at tables at meals i ve seen him even have sexual relationships with women at higher witchcraft meetings he appeared about seven feet tall usually clothed in deep purple sometimes in red sometimes in gold purple and gold after i got saved he showed up as satan clothed in black and not just handsome but beautiful jet black hair snow white skin and the colour of his eyes instead of blue brown or whatever were a deep violet almost of deep purple and when you looked in them it was like looking down into the grand canyon it s just like a pit that s just bottomless this power and believe me if he appears to you you d know you were in his presence on to the physical kingdom the illuminati means the bearers of light call it the great conspiracy call it moriah which means the conquering wind call it the cfr it is still the illuminati it s official birthday is may 1st 1776 may 1st is the holiest day because it is beltane witches new years day and all things begin on beltane it s the day lucifer comes back from the underworld and dwells in the skies above according to the witches witches call themselves pagans because they believe in pre christian religion the structure are three pyramids each one bigger than the next on all of them the capstone the first pyramid is organization you ll find the masons here the grand lodges of the orient which is where the illuminati started the scottish rites the york rites the oddfellows the jayees any organisation that is secret that has an inner group besides the outer group as long as it is not directly occultism b nai b rith jewish laymen s org a very powerful illuminati organization they couldn t be doing what they are doing today without b nai b rith the civil liberties union also a new one created by the man that is actually the brain of the illuminati today isaac bonovitz the aquarian anti defamation league it s the anti defamation league to the occult which also attacks anyone who criticizes the jews or israel accusing them of anti semitism at the top of every pyramid you will find the world banking system it s a counsel of the 500 richest people in the world in existence for hundreds of years david rockefeller nelson rockefeller phillip and edward rothschild in fact all the rothschilds next is the council of 33 the 33 highest masons in the world after that is the council of 13 the grand druid council this is what i sat on after that there s a capstone the rothschild s tribunal edward phillip and richard are the ones that sitting up in the rothschilds tribunal now in it is the leader of the illuminati the all seeing eye lucifer the t v uses witchcraft symbols they put the symbols on their store names you probably shop with satan there isn t one oil company that you can buy your gasoline at today that s not owned 100 by illuminati stockholders a plan of world rule will never take effect if you re independent of that world rule you must function within them for every bit of food and every drop of gasoline the illuminati is scared of every private owned gun it s the only threat to them the beatles are classified in the occult world as the four major prophets their white double album is considered the book of revelation to witches that and atlas shrugs in it is a song called helter skelter it meant a time when the pit would be open and the demons would be set free and the world would get insane in a less than 24 hour period and they d be killing everybody their next door neighbors their kids their wife everything the world would just go completely mass insane overnight charles manson went to jail because in the seven years that he s been in he has organized from his jail cell every prison across the u s they re waiting for a time when the world will go completely insane and they ll flood out of the prisons and they firmly believe that they will take over this country when manson gets out and helter skelter starts in the first year one million u s citizens are marked for death nothing is going to move if this happens how soon would you die on your feet most cities would tell you within two weeks everybody would be starving that s all the food there is in their storehouses atlas shrugs was supposedly a novel written by one of phillip rothschild s girlfriends at his instructions it is a coded book for witches that tells how they are to gain control of the world in this book there is sort of a parable about new york city new york city is more or less the world when everything was shut down then the lights went out for good the dollar sign is a witchcraft symbol that means to control and to scourge it s 6 000 years old isaac bonovitz says that through this symbol we will now rule and control the world and the book ends in the book all the way through businessmen that belong to these organizations purposely bankrupt or destroy their businesses so there aren t any businesses and they drive the others out of business and all the way through they use the battle plan called the presence from below and the presence from above anybody that s studied communism knows the same plan that means the devil must destroy all the regulations and the banker do it this way and guess who s in the middle us curtis b dall board chairman of liberty lobby publisher of the spotlight excerpts from letters april and may 1979 being reasonable well informed on the powers which are at work to influence our domestic and foreign policies for their objectives having been with liberty lobby for over 19 years on capitol hill i am greatly shocked by the ineptitude and downright ignorance of many alleged christian leaders in this country in observing how they pick on john todd instead to steer him constructively in the religious field most of these preachers haven t the faintest idea of the contribution john todd has made to his fellow americans by revealing the secret power structure of the rothschild complex who look to lucifer for guidance the illuminati most any high school student can grasp the fact that the power of the occult or the witchcraft plus the power of evil the illuminati exert a most powerful influence upon our economic and political policies obviously his powerful enemies are leaving no stone unturned to silence him which regrettably might well be expected the majority of his ministers pastors priests have been heavily indoctrinated and are woefully uninformed misinformed or bribed todd created powerful unrelenting enemies when he defected from the royal family the grand druid council of 13 the enemies of john todd have marshaled all the powerful tools at their disposal to attack neutralize or destroy him in order to protect themselves and their image certainly not to advance christianity the usual technique employed by the enemy in retaliation in respect to somebody who has exposed some of their secret operations the religious area is the one in which they prefer to operate along with plenty of money artfully supplied to grease the wheels apparently they feel that todd must be thoroughly discredited silenced or even assassinated more articles on this site

by moneymetals welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason precious metals markets are rallying on some early friday remarks from jerome powell the federal reserve chairman is speaking at the jackson hole virtual gathering of central bankers friday and saturday and he started off by emphasizing the view that high inflation readings will come down soon there is still a question of whether anything has changed since the last fed policy meeting there fed officials had suggested they may soon begin tapering their asset purchases something that could give the fed s money masters an excuse to back down on tapering is the recent global surge in covid cases linked to the delta variant some countries including australia are back in full lockdown mode in the united states mask mandates are back in many of the more authoritarian jurisdictions and vaccine requirements are increasingly being imposed by businesses and local governments just a few weeks ago president joe biden had touted the vaccine as a ticket to freedom from mask mandates now his team of government health bureaucrats is telling everyone to wear masks calling for more contact tracing and warning that additional vaccine booster shots will be necessary the risk is that the virus keeps mutating to thwart every effort aimed at achieving herd immunity but optimists on wall street are pricing in a robust economic recovery to continue in spite of the threats from the virus and fed tapering it s unlikely the central bank will get very far into tapering if wall street decides to throw a tantrum the fed may also face pressure from the big spending biden administration to reverse course and ramp up its bond purchases given the political realities capitalist and commentator steve forbes argued in his latest what s ahead commentary that tapering will likely be short lived steve forbes now concerning tapering every month the fed has been buying 120 billion of government bonds and mortgages thanks to covid 19 stimulus bills passed by congress and money previously created by the federal reserve out of thin air the financial system today is awash in liquidity corporations hold trillions in cash banks are loaded with lendable funds consumer checking accounts are at record levels given all this the continuation of the scale of the fed s bond buying should be fueling far worse inflation than what we ve been experiencing this gets to the fact that the fed will not be in control of its destiny if congress passes president biden s humongous spending bills the central bank will face irresistible pressure to buy bonds to help finance this extravagance if investors are overestimating the fed s ability to rein in liquidity then they may be underestimating inflation risk and undervaluing precious metals gold and silver markets have lagged this year but are showing signs of gathering strength in recent days we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to

months while the price action has been frustrating for bulls it may ultimately be healthy for the long term bull market outlook the bigger the base the bigger the directional move that can follow an investor rush into gold and silver for protection from inflation negative real interest rates and systemic risks in financial markets remains to fully play out there have certainly been many great gold rushes and spectacular booms and busts throughout history one of the most famous gold manias occurred during the late 1890s in the klondike region of canada many prospectors made their way there through a grueling journey on foot from the alaska panhandle they risked everything for a chance to strike it rich a few did most didn t many lost everything including their lives in pursuit of hitting paydirt 2021 marks the 125th anniversary of the discovery that inspired gold fever in the yukon territory skookum jim mason his nephew dawson charlie kate carmack and her husband george carmack made the famous find word spread and the rush was on the following summer the klondike gold rush lasted just three short years but its legacy has been memorialized in special release one ounce gold coins from the royal canadian mint the 2021 klondike gold rush series panning for gold coins are struck in 99999 fine gold that s five nines making them the purest gold coins in the world the unique design is of a gold pan with a rich find of nuggets each single coin comes attractively packaged in a certified assay card holder it will make a fine addition to any collection without entailing a high collectible s premium when purchased from money metals exchange investors who want to participate in the next great gold rush or silver rush need not risk it all like earlier prospectors did they simply need to convert their depreciating currency and their at risk financial assets into physical bullion ideally before the next buying rush begins for now bullion market

the bulls scored a victory over the bears in this battleground stock what happened shares of support com sprt soared on friday in an apparent short squeeze by the close of trading the technical support company s stock price was up 33 7 after surging as much as 203 earlier in the day so what in march support com made public its intention to merge with greenidge generation holdings a vertically integrated power generation and bitcoin btc 1 55 mining company then in july greenidge generation announced its plans to build a new carbon neutral bitcoin mining operation in south carolina investors interest in the merger appears to have ramped up ahead of support com s special meeting of its stockholders on sep 10 a rally in bitcoin s price from its lows near 30 000 in july to roughly 49 000 today as well as calls for more sustainable mining operations from companies like tesla also likely contributed to investors excitement about the deal now what while these factors no doubt played a part in support com s gains other dynamics are also at play about 60 of support com s float is held short according to data analytics firm s3 partners but while many investors are betting against the company s success the surge in its share price has forced many short sellers to close out or reduce their positions in recent days to exit their positions short sellers must buy back the shares they shorted this forced buying on the part of the bears can help to accelerate a sharp rise in the price of a heavily shorted stock and support com certainly fits the bill however investors should note that short squeezes don t last forever and the upward price moves they bring about often reverse quickly we ve already seen evidence of this with support com ending the trading day down more than 55 from its highs on friday

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer spending slowed in july as a decline in motor vehicle purchases due to shortages offset a rise in outlays on services supporting views that economic growth will moderate in the third quarter amid a resurgence in covid 19 infections but the foundation for the recovery remains solid with the report from the commerce department on friday showing wages rising and americans further boosting savings inflation appears to have peaked which could preserve households purchasing power businesses are also restocking and exporting more goods suggesting a slowdown in growth this quarter could be temporary there are clear downside risks to spending if more events and trips are canceled and more products are delayed getting to shelves said sal guatieri a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto but it s a bit early to throw in the towel on the economic outlook given supportive wage and saving trends and a likely boost from business investment inventories and trade in the third quarter consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity increased 0 3 last month after advancing 1 1 in june last month s rise was in line with economists expectations demand is rotating back to services like travel and leisure but spending has been insufficient to compensate for the drop in goods purchases which are also being impacted by shortages goods spending fell 1 1 last month led by motor vehicles a global shortage of semiconductors is hampering auto production there were also decreases in spending on recreational goods as well as clothing and footwear still goods spending is 20 above its pre pandemic level spending on services rose 1 0 a broad increase led by food services and accommodations outlays on services last month were 1 above their february 2020 level healthcare transportation and recreation are yet to recoup their pandemic losses credit card data suggests spending on services like airfares and cruises as well as hotels and motels slowed in august amid soaring covid 19 cases driven by the delta variant fears about the virus knocked consumer sentiment to a more than 9 1 2 year low in august inflation continued to rise last month fanned by the unrelenting supply constraints and the economy s move toward normalcy after the upheaval caused by the pandemic but the pace of increase is slowing the personal consumption expenditures pce price index excluding the volatile food and energy components climbed 0 3 in july that was the smallest gain in five months and followed a 0 5 advance in june in the 12 months through july the so called core pce price index rose 3 6 after a similar increase in june the core pce price index is the federal reserve s preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2 target fed chair jerome powell in a speech to the jackson hole economic conference on friday defended his long held view that high inflation would be transitory powell said the economy continued to make progress towards the u s central bank s benchmarks for reducing its massive support but stopped short of signaling the timing for any policy shift powell s comments buoyed u s stocks with the and the nasdaq scaling record highs the dollar fell against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices rose income savings rise high inflation chipped away at consumer spending last month consumer spending adjusted for inflation dipped 0 1 the so called real consumer spending rose 0 5 in june real consumer spending is slightly above the second quarter average spending growth in the current quarter is still guaranteed to be far below the 11 6 annualized rate of the first half of the year but at least it is starting in positive territory said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap lon in jersey city the atlanta fed cut its third quarter gdp growth estimate to a 5 1 rate from a 5 7 pace the resurgence in covid 19 cases which is global could cause more supply disruptions the economy grew at a 6 6 pace in the second quarter which raised the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019 but the drag from slowing consumer spending this quarter is likely to be limited by a narrowing trade deficit and the replenishing of depleted inventories by businesses in another report on friday the commerce department said the goods trade deficit decreased 6 2 to 86 4 billion last month as imports fell and exports rose retail inventories gained 0 4 while stocks of goods at wholesalers increased 0 6 overall the economy remains supported by record corporate profits households accumulated at least 2 5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic growth is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter in part driven by inventory accumulation the saving rate increased to 9 6 last month from 8 8 in june as some of the money disbursed by the government under the child tax credit program to qualifying households was socked away personal income shot up 1 1 after gaining 0 2 in june wages also rose as companies compete for scarce workers increasing 1 0 in july income at the disposal of households

sotelo solis she her ella is the first latina and woman elected mayor of national city over the years you ve seen them rolling along highland avenue in national city lowriders that have incredibly detailed paint jobs glistening in the sun owners leaning over the open driver side window with angel baby playing on their speakers driving at a pace that honors the years of work to get their vehicles in competition and or cruising shape as clearly identifiable as the lowrider vehicles are lowriding culture is not just about the cars it is over 65 years of building a culture of belonging and individualizing a vehicle with an artistic and innovative eye dedicated community service to local neighborhoods and helping to meet basic needs while highlighting the pride in the chicano and mexican heritage today there are many diverse places around the world that celebrate the lowriding culture including japan germany and brazil advertisement as noted by alberto lópez pulido in his book san diego lowriders a history of cars and cruising the lowrider culture began after world war ii with a desire to change and transform stock automobiles that were coming off the assembly line and make them distinctively one s own through creative customization this customization was also born alongside the concept of chicano or chicana which describes mexican origin people from the late 1960s 1980s who were activists for civil rights and social justice the chicano movement was and still remains a fight for equal access to higher education housing health care and financial opportunities all improving the quality of life for chicanos and communities of color amid those challenges and out of a desire to demonstrate belonging the customization of these vehicles became synonymous with a focus on community improvement and a unique sense of style unfortunately in the 1980s cruising was very popular along highland avenue which adversely impacted local businesses and residents and created additional calls for service for public safety creating grounds for the city council at that time to enact a moratorium on cruising that still stands today in 2019 our city through community led efforts and in partnership with the national city police department held its first exclusive lowrider end of summer car show with a cruise along highland avenue it was permitted and well organized and was a positive experience for those who were displaying their works of art and for those families and community members who were in attendance safety respect and dignity were demonstrated toward the lowriders families public safety and the city as a whole it was beautiful unfortunately the covid 19 pandemic stalled the 2020 car show but then the united lowrider coalition and the city of national city lowrider ad hoc committee were born i believed it was essential to creatively connect our community as health concerns about covid 19 grew and the viewing of our local lowriders was one of those out of the box incentives to get people to the clinics the united lowrider coalition stood in solidarity when we raised the lgbtq progress flag at city hall for the first time in city history and it is now collecting toys to distribute during the holiday season it is now 2021 and we must reflect on policies that are on the books to see if and how they remain effective and relevant today as policymakers we cannot implement change or create new policies in a silo we must partner with our public safety community businesses and lowrider community to keep order and safety at the forefront for all involved we want to hear your perspectives on thursday sept 9 from 5 7 p m at our city s virtual lowrider forum via zoom you are essential to helping to guide our decisions we need your voice even as an honorary member of the unique ladies i m still new to the lowrider scene at my inaugural state of the city address in 2019 the most beautiful welcome gift was presented from a national city lowrider bike shop a lowrider bike with 100 spokes in each of the two white walled wheels detailed with purple pinstripes matching our city logo a velvet seat and chromed out handles and gears i felt that my community the community that helped raise me was welcoming me into a culture i saw over the years but wasn t familiar with it is with the open arms that i received this gift and that i welcome your thoughts on the future of this ordinance adelante we are strongertogether when all perspectives are heard

the bulls scored a victory over the bears in this battleground stock what happened shares of support com sprt soared on friday in an apparent short squeeze by the close of trading the technical support company s stock price was up 33 7 after surging as much as 203 earlier in the day so what in march support com made public its intention to merge with greenidge generation holdings a vertically integrated power generation and bitcoin btc 1 55 mining company then in july greenidge generation announced its plans to build a new carbon neutral bitcoin mining operation in south carolina investors interest in the merger appears to have ramped up ahead of support com s special meeting of its stockholders on sep 10 a rally in bitcoin s price from its lows near 30 000 in july to roughly 49 000 today as well as calls for more sustainable mining operations from companies like tesla also likely contributed to investors excitement about the deal now what while these factors no doubt played a part in support com s gains other dynamics are also at play about 60 of support com s float is held short according to data analytics firm s3 partners but while many investors are betting against the company s success the surge in its share price has forced many short sellers to close out or reduce their positions in recent days to exit their positions short sellers must buy back the shares they shorted this forced buying on the part of the bears can help to accelerate a sharp rise in the price of a heavily shorted stock and support com certainly fits the bill however investors should note that short squeezes don t last forever and the upward price moves they bring about often reverse quickly we ve already seen evidence of this with support com ending the trading day down more than 55 from its highs on friday

these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of august 9 2021 this video was recorded on aug 23 2021 chris hill it s monday aug 23 welcome to marketfoolery i m chris hill with me today mr jason moser good to see you jason moser good to see you hill we have a risk factor in the war on cash lest anyone think we do nothing but cheer lead one side in the war on cash we re going to talk about the other side today moser kicking in the visa hill but we re going to start with retail last week we got target s earnings report and some color from management on how back to school shopping is going today we found out what they have in store for the end of the year holidays target is planning to triple the number of disney shops within target locations this is the store within a store concept that they started in 2019 with disney i think about 25 locations they increased it a few at a time but now they are aiming for more than 160 by the end of the year and that is close to 10 of target s locations moser it is i think this is a very shrewd move i like it to me we re seeing this transformation of target from just a department store or a discount retail store to almost becoming like the new version of what a mall should be for this next generation the malls that you and i grew up with chris time will tell exactly how that scene shakes out but it almost seems like those malls are becoming like little towns i think we ve seen this with simon property group and whatnot a lot of these malls were talking about becoming destination centers and places where you either go for entertainment or even live perhaps they re building apartment complexes and whatnot if these new malls or these malls are becoming like the new little towns it seems like targets in stores like that are becoming the new version of a mall we have ulta with the relationship with target with apple with the relationship with target and disney seeing this expansion of this relationship it only makes sense and i think the timing is right because you re right they re coming off of a tremendous quarter they got their inventory levels back up they are well prepared for the back half of this year and to throw more disney stuff into the mix this to me is just an absolute no brainer and you couple that with the fact that target now has better than 100 million target circle rewards members there are going to be a lot of different things they can do with this obviously we know the attraction to disney and all of the different characters and properties that disney has that s not going to change in fact as time goes on it should only become a stronger competitive point for disney and ultimately for target to me this makes a whole heck of a lot of sense and i think the timing is right to frame them up for a pretty good holiday season i would think hill i like how you re framing this as target is basically like a smaller version of a mall it s a curated mall because you can also throw in the fact that a few years back they sold their pharmacy business to cvs and basically said to cvs you come in here and do this i don t know about the target closest to you but the target closest to me right when you walk in there s a starbucks cafe i get my coffee get caffeinated and go around are you like me curious to see what happens to toy prices this holiday season because between this story some of the colors we got out of hasbro and mattel out of their most recent earnings reports it seems like toys are going to be more expensive this year moser i think that s a fair assessment if you remember a few weeks back we were talking about hasbro s earnings report and they had noted in their call they were planning for prices to go up this holiday season and a lot of that really is because of freight and shipping costs they actually quantified it in their freight and shipping costs this time this year are about four times as great as they were a year ago that s a big bump in just a short period of time they ll be passing along price increases for the back half of the year that s the ideal time to do it because this really should in theory be a pretty robust holiday season given where we re coming from and so to me it only makes sense to be able to pass those prices along i suspect we will see that exactly how far they decide to take it is anyone s real guess but i do think that you re seeing disney and target it s not just disney and target partnering together it s also worth remembering that target is teaming up with fao schwarz since we re on the topic of toys target is teaming up with fao schwarz again this year they did it last year but this is boiling down ultimately to an exclusive i believe they said that 70 piece toy collection with fao schwarz it s going to have items from barbie and paw patrol which is clearly a big seller right now with the new movie and whatnot they re going to have a pop up shop inside of fao schwarz s flagship store in new york city to me it s very fascinating to see how all of these different retail concepts are coming together in figuring out ways to work together i m going to name drop here chris last week you may have heard i had an interview with the ceo on wednesday s industry focus with latch ceo luke schoenfelder it was a fun conversation if you missed it make sure to catch last wednesday s industry focus it really was a good interview but luke and i were talking about this competitive landscape today it s not just retail you see it in tech as well latch is focused on connecting buildings and the internet of things and stuff and whatnot i was talking to him about other competitors in the space like google or apple other companies that sell those types of devices and those types of software that manage them he mentioned a term that i think we ve mentioned before through the years on the show that coopetition it s not necessarily competition in its purest form but it s competitors coming together in competing but in a cooperative way they re figuring out a way for every one to benefit to basically let all those boats rise with the tide it s need to see that i know we talk all the time about competition and may the best man or woman win and whatnot but it is also worth remembering that this is a time where we re seeing a lot of success stories as we say with investing in most cases it s rarely if ever a zero sum game i mean you can pick a number of winners out there it s just in target s case that looking at target you re also seeing these other retail concepts that are going to be rising along with that tide whether it s disney whether it s apple whether it s fao schwarz whoever it may be you re seeing these concepts coming together to figure out ways for all of them to benefit to me that s just exciting to see particularly at this time when we re going into a holiday season that should be pretty robust hill our email address is we got a note from chadwick in florida who writes what do you all make of starboard value s open letter to box shareholders the back and forth responses and the possible shenanigans at box a little bit of background here this is box com the cloud storage company starboard value the activist firm that has about an 8 stake in box starboard value nominated four directors for the 10 person board that box has they made those nominations earlier this year saying that box hasn t capitalized on the work from home trend they re falling behind other cloud competitors i don t have any stake in this whatsoever but i will point out that at least from a stock perspective i see where starboard value is coming from because this stock is basically where it was when box went public in january of 2015 moser yeah you re right and i don t have a stake in this either looking at this from an outsider s perspective you mentioned the stake that starboard has in box it s worth noting they have a much larger stake than all of the insiders put together from what it looks like that s something worth just keeping in mind this is a business in box that went public i think it was january of 2015 the ceo and co founder i believe aaron levie is still at the helm there these can be really tricky because sometimes you feel like wow the gall of a fund manager thinking that they know this business better than the people running it come on eight times out of 10 that s probably the safe assumption fund managers at the end of the day are really just trying to make some money on the other hand it may be that they do have some insight through past experiences or suggestions that might help the business improve in the case of box it remains to be seen but to your point i would argue that oftentimes the stock price isn t a good indicator of success in the near term particularly with businesses like these that are still unprofitable and still relatively unproven this is also a company that s been public since like i said january 2015 i think in this case we re well past the point where the stock price might not necessarily be a good indicator i think in this case the stock price is a good indicator and when you dig a little bit deeper you certainly see the numbers bear that out it s a company where growth is slowing down if you just look at the compounded annual growth rate of revenue over the last five years is 19 3 three years it s 14 3 and just one year 11 9 this is still a relatively small business it looks like starboard there s some questions there in regard to capital allocation on the box side and furthermore capital raises that the company performed that they may not have needed to perform or at least perform in the way that they did it s really difficult to say what ultimately comes of all of this i think in this case though for me i ve always been a little bit skeptical of box just based on the general market and the numbers that the company s always lobbed up it is obviously a big market opportunity in cloud storage and distribution but it s also a very competitive one to me it feels like maybe box might want to put the ego aside for a minute and maybe listen to what starboard has to say because right now what they re doing just clearly isn t working hill this morning institutional shareholder services which is a proxy advisory firm came out and they backed box they recommended that shareholders vote for box s slate of directors i m not saying that seals the deal for box but that certainly points to probably a better outcome in the short term but this whole thing if nothing else i feel like starboard value has just put box management on notice and that the clock is ticking because a year from now if the stock is still in the mid 20s i don t know that things are going to go management s way moser yeah you have to ask yourself why is starboard doing this i don t think starboard is doing this because they truly want to see box just grow into this 25 year success story i think starboard is doing this because they have an endgame i think they want to make some money from this investment they ve been in this for a little while they re not making any money from it they re trying to figure out a way to create some value that s the job there are two different perspectives at play here it s one thing for management at box to say that they are taking the long view and building this company for long term success but you do have to show the signs for that with a business that s been around this long in the public markets 2015 it s been a little while like i said still unprofitable it s barely cash flow positive back out stock based compensation it s really not a very impressive picture there either on the cash flow side it feels like this business should be further along than it is right now but clearly there are two different agendas here i don t begrudge either for me personally i tend to default i want to know what the company should do on its own hey listen starboard if you re not making any money if you don t like this maybe the thesis has changed what do we say when that happens sell go put your money somewhere else there s nothing stopping them from doing that i would imagine if this continues the way it s going then we probably will see starboard just cut bait and move on to greener pastures hill one of the big sporting events this weekend is wwe summerslam in las vegas tens of thousands of people attend at allegiant stadium which as some may know is a cashless stadium that s great until the system goes down which is what happened during summerslam tsys which is the third party payment system basically the bones of what makes that cashless stadium run experienced a nationwide outage and so no sales could happen alcohol sales were not happening at the summerslam god knows how many hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars were lost in revenue what do you think when you look at this story because setting aside what that must have been like for the people attending i look at this and i think i still believe in the war on cash but maybe it makes sense to still have cash available as a backup moser even better keep in the back of your mind you may have to pull a cosmo kramer and start sneaking those cafe lattes into the events you can t rely on being able to buy it there i read this a buddy of mine hayden at georgia sent me this link as well and we were talking about it we ve talked about this a long time he s a lawyer and we ve talked about the idea of going cashless there s some legal ramifications there s language on actual cash that says this is legal tenders so an argument could be made that if you re a merchant you need to accept it now i don t know how that will all shake out but i will say i personally think that no matter what line of work you are in to me you always need to accept cash now some people may think well wait a minute what are you saying you got to take cash listen i love the war on cash and we re investing in that but if you re a business you need to give yourself the biggest market opportunity you possibly can if you re working some type of retail concept or an event where people are coming in and buying food and beverage you just need to accept cash you need to give yourself the most opportunity if you cut off cash even when everything is working just fine to me you re limiting yourself you re not giving yourself the biggest market opportunity but to me no 1 it demonstrates the spaghetti junction that the payments industry is because this isn t just tsys this was tsys which is total systems that was acquired by global payments back in 2019 so really this is a global payments issue but then it s also a shift4 issue because shift4 is a partner with tsys and global payments in helping all of this stuff work you start seeing how this payments industry it s very difficult to fully connect all the dots and understand everyone s role there so it is tricky i feel like over time this is a space that is going to have to consolidate it s going to shake out some of the smaller weaker competitors just because that s simply going to have to happen but it can be very difficult to fully understand who is doing what and at the end of the day if you want to go cashless and just require on using technology you re going to need to develop some type of redundancy like in the cloud business some backup system so that when the inevitable happens because it s not like this might happen again it s going to happen again it s just going to be a matter of how you handle it i can remember back in the day growing up when i d be working a job whether it was in the golf business or whatever if a system went down and someone were to pay with a credit card you know what we did we just took the card and we wrote down the number the name and the expiration date and then we ran it through the system later when the systems were back up now maybe you re taking a chance there that some cards will be declined but that s better than just refusing sales and giving everything away so i feel like this probably could ve been handled a little bit differently a lot of lessons to learn there but the bottom line i will always believe this i think you just have to accept cash even if no one uses it you ve just got to have that option because there s going to be a point in time where it s going to come in handy unless we go to just a fully cashless economy which i don t see happening then you got to make sure you just give yourself the biggest market to work with hill gather around children we ll tell you about when we used to use pen and paper to write credit card numbers down moser do they even teach handwriting in school anymore i don t think so hill i don t think so at least i don t know moser my daughters have really good penmanship but i think that s just because they practice on their own all of their work is done they re a junior and sophomore in high school everything is on their laptop so it s not quite the same as it was growing up hill the grade school years are in the rearview mirror thankfully so i m not sure jason moser always great talking to you thanks for being here moser thank you hill as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear that s going to do it for this edition of marketfoolery the show is mixed by dan boyd i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow

joined us to talk about behavioral finances and biases that could be sabotaging your money everyone to the time machine this is motley fool answers i m alison southwick and i am joined today by robert brokamp personal finance expert here at the motley fool hi bro how re you doing robert brokamp great alison how are you southwick i m good we have a great show today because today we re going to talk about why you should care about a company s corporate culture when you invest morgan housel is going to join us to talk about five biases that are making you bad with money and bro is also going to answer your questions about how to break up with your mutual fund all that and more on this week s episode of motley fool answers the new york times took amazon to the woodshed over their corporate culture recently in an article we ve been used to seeing articles that tell you how awful it is to work in an amazon warehouse fulfilling orders and getting books and putting them in boxes but this recent article talked about how being incorporated in amazon is actually soul crushing and brutal all that was in the new york times for example working all hours crying at your desk don t even think about having kids it was competitive to a fault lord of the flies because i saw it in florida brokamp no food southwick no free food they even talked about that i was just like come on i thought you were a tech company so i assume everyone at the fool read this article because not only do we care about amazon as investors we also care about corporate culture what did you think about the article brokamp my first reaction whenever i see an article like this it s based a lot on anecdotes right southwick they interviewed over 100 people brokamp right southwick former amazon brokamp right in amazon i don t know how many employees but it s in the tens of thousands the point is i think for any company you could find 100 people who have some sad tales to tell now as you hinted at though amazon has already been in the news over the years for working conditions so i think that s part of why it was easier for people to believe some of this stuff my first thought was a little skeptical in terms of how pervasive all this stuff is but i didn t think that to a certain degree i m a little concerned that people will take this lesson from amazon and it was with steve jobs as well is that for it to be a really successful company to take over the world you have to be a little cutthroat you have to be brutal steve jobs had that reputation for being brutally honest with people and according to a new york times article that amazon you are encouraged to rip apart people s opinions now if you ve read some of the responses of amazon employees current and former a lot of them saying that s all a bunch of bull might have happened here and there but not everywhere but to me one of the concerns i would have is that people take this lesson if you want to be a great company you actually have to act like this southwick right it s interesting to see some of the responses in the comments to people just being like look it s work suck it up brokamp that s right southwick right brokamp that s right one of my favorite lines was when some amazon employee or executive pointed toward microsoft and said we don t want to run a country club because they have all that nice stuff that you hear about at google and those companies and i am to say there s a part of me that agrees with that i mean the motley fool bleeds its culture and we have lots of perks too and every once in a while i think we as a company need to provide that but it comes from a good place so to speak and that is many of our investors here believe that the culture of a company is reflected on how successful the company becomes and thus the stock price if you make a good workplace for high performing people you re going to have low turnover they re going to be willing to work hard for you maybe even for less pay but because of the company environment the flexibility something like that is worth it they stick with you and turnover at a company can be deadly because every time someone leaves and you have to hire someone you have to train them up again and things like that which is another point that made me question a little bit about the new york times article if it s that bad to work at amazon why aren t the very smartest people avoiding them and going to google and facebook and microsoft why would you choose amazon if it s that bad southwick yeah when i was reading the article and i was in the middle article i was like boy i wonder if i should keep investing in amazon and then should buy stuff as i was reading the article i knew that there were two boxes from amazon sitting on my front stoop while i was reading it brokamp it is exactly what my wife said when i told her about this like it makes me not want to buy from them anymore southwick yeah do you really think you re not going to buy from amazon brokamp basically my bottom line is i want to see more about whether this happens or not but would that affect if this stuff turns out to be more true than not with that affect whether i buy from amazon i think it would southwick yeah i just want to say to anyone who works at amazon if you re listening i really appreciate the work you do i really love amazon prime so thanks brokamp yeah southwick if you are going through hell thank you for going through hell so i can get stuff delivered in two days that makes me sound like such a bad person today we have morgan housel joining us morgan housel yes southwick hey thanks for coming he is the senior analyst for motley fool one with an expertise in behavioral finance thanks for joining us today housel thanks for having me southwick so what are we talking about when we talk about behavioral finance because it sounds like a college course that i maybe would have audited housel it does but i think it s really important i think for decades and decades almost essentially finance was taught as purely a math based subject you learned the formulas and you plug your data into the formulas and it gives you an answer and that s finance i think there s a big appreciation in the last 10 or 20 years that finance is much closer to something like psychology or sociology where what really matters where you can really set yourself apart is by understanding and knowing and mastering your own mind most of that is just acknowledging and understanding the behavioral biases that everyone falls for just little tricks that your mind plays on yourself that steers people in the wrong direction in finance and investing southwick i m so glad you did that because that was a great segue into talking about the five biases that we re going to talk about today brokamp how convenient southwick it s almost like we planned this housel almost we actually did it though it just happened southwick i don t know let s just pick five biases actually there s like many biases out there that impact us when we re investing but you are here to talk about five today for our listeners to consider when it comes to managing their money the first one is the dunning kruger effect brokamp i hope this has to do with nightmare on elm street housel it does what the dunning kruger effect is is when you are so unknowledgeable in such a novice at something that you don t know how bad you are southwick the unknown unknowns housel the unknown unknowns this is really just something that obviously afflicts people who are just starting out in investing and whatnot there s just really fascinating study done about 10 years ago where there s a group of finance professors that asked a group of investors how do you perform as an investor what returns do you earn they asked them and then they looked at their brokerage statements and saw how they actually performed and the worst investors people who earned the worst returns by far were the worst up telling them what they thought their actual returns were so these people were so bad at investing that they didn t even have the skills or the knowledge to go and calculate how bad they were doing they were so bad and they didn t know how bad they were southwick but they were still happy housel but we see this a lot i think with new investors that they don t know enough to know how bad they are and they need someone to hold them reveal the curtain and show them how poorly they re doing southwick because it is easy to forget especially in the market that we ve been in it s easy to forget that well i don t need to compare myself to the benchmark of the s p look how awesome i m doing then when i compare myself to the s p then it s just ugly housel that was really true i think in the late 90s when a lot of people were earning what looked like high returns look i earned 15 20 of my money but that wasn t a year when the s p gained 35 they think they were doing really well they were doing really well but when you pull back the curtain and gain a little more knowledge about how well they should ve been doing it was a disaster southwick all right next one we re going to talk about is the frequency illusion housel we were actually just talking earlier about we thought there was a baby boom here at the motley fool southwick one of us thought there was a baby brokamp maybe the one who was having a baby housel then we brought up that no there s probably actually not it s just because maybe one of us was paying more attention to it that s exactly what the frequency illusion is is that it seems like things happen more often once you start paying attention to it but they re not i think a good example of this in investing is after the 2008 market crash there was so much commentary about today s volatile market stock market so volatile for years after that but the three years after the market crash in 2008 was below average volatility it s just we were paying more attention to it because we were aware it s from 2008 we see this a lot with shark attacks in the news once there was one then we started reporting on them shark attack here and shark attack there southwick but right now it s like grizzly bear attacks housel but if you look at the data southwick it s in the news all the time grizzly bear attacks housel for a lot of that though if you look at the data it s not that there s more occurrences it s just that we start paying attention to it more often southwick also there s a grizzly bear in my backyard i don t know why housel right and a shark in your pool southwick right i don t know how it got there brokamp let s get both of them together and see what happens southwick but i guess surprisingly it s always been there and i m now noticing it because it s in the news the next one we have is the curse of knowledge housel yeah southwick i want to guess that it s the opposite of the dunning kruger effect it may not housel no it pretty much is when you have people like stockbrokers financial advisors or college professors who don t understand that average lay people think differently than them and can t understand the language and jargon that they use southwick it sounds elitist housel it kind of is yeah the effect of it is you have stockbrokers that will sit down with their clients and start throwing around all kinds of lingo that might seem basic to the stockbroker but the client has no idea what he s talking about and they re too afraid to ask where we also see it a lot is with economic professors who a lot of their theories in their models are based on this idea that all consumers will act rationally and are perfectly informed that s the basis that s the foundation of their theories when in reality that s total nonsense because most people don t have the kind of math and economical thinking and experience that college professors do it just leads a lot of people astray because you have these finance professors and stockbrokers who say this is how you should be acting in theory when the world works totally differently in practice southwick right brokamp that s part of the whole thing about biases really the other word for it is mistakes right housel i prefer but it sounds better southwick it sounds brokamp both around mistakes and that was part of the root of behavioral finance to begin with is that there was this assumption for a long time that people who are rational have made the right decisions whereas actually it turns out we re mostly emotional most money decisions have to do with emotions and feelings in my opinion more than intellectual rational decisions that s the basis of all of the stuff southwick we make the decisions with our emotions then we spend all this time trying to rationalize they make it sound like it was actually a logical choice brokamp they re trying to get the brain into it afterwards southwick after your god made the call all right the next one is called extreme discounting housel right that s when you want a small reward today over a larger reward in the future southwick this sounds like the kids in the marshmallows study housel you know i hate the marshmallow test southwick you hate the marshmallow test housel i hate the marshmallow test southwick okay so this is the one where they put some kids in a room and they said you can have one marshmallow now but i m going to leave and come back and if you don t eat that marshmallow i ll give you two marshmallows housel right brokamp yeah and then they track those kids for decades and the ones who were able to resist were smarter better looking and more successful that kind of stuff southwick but morgan hates this study housel i hate it for a couple of reasons for one it s cited in every single psychology book southwick which must be how i know it housel i feel like everyone who writes about it they re like oh i found this crazy test and it s 9 000 times horrendous in the last year that s the first reason no 2 there s actually some evidence that it never really happened as people explained it there were several different versions of the marshmallow test and some journalists blended them together to make it a cool story but if you go back and read the original literature it s not really as it actually happened it s similar but it s not as clean and simple we re going off track here is that ok southwick we re not going off track housel the third reason i hate the marshmallow test brokamp you don t get a marshmallow housel this doesn t get talked about a lot but the kids who actually did well in the marshmallow test it wasn t because they had more self control it s because they distracted themselves it wasn t because they sat there and looked at the marshmallow and said i m not going to eat that because i want another one the kids who were able to put it off are the kids who were so add that they put them in this room and then they started playing with their shoes and singing a song and banging on the walls that s why they didn t eat the marshmallow because they were distracted not because they had patience brokamp the lesson is being add that is the secret housel that s what s funny about it being distracted is probably the opposite of patience or close to it southwick that s true i m not going to try out the marshmallow study ever again housel i appreciate that southwick morgan says it s bunked rick engdahl all fluff housel i appreciate that brokamp thank you rick the producer southwick rick from the control room with the zinger tonight s show is completely different folks extreme discounting housel it s wanting a small reward today over a bigger reward tomorrow some discounting is rational but i think you have extreme discounting in investing where people who have 30 years before retirement are constantly focused and investing for returns of the next quarter or the next year it s just this extreme focus on the short term when your goals are long term you see almost all money managers are graded by the quarter how did you perform last quarter when most investors are investing for the next few years or decades there s this funny story from larry fink he s the ceo of blackrock he was having lunch with the president of one of the largest endowment funds in the world the endowment funds said our goals are generational we re investing for the next generation and our grandkids generation and larry fink said that s great how do you measure your performance in the quarterly that s extreme discounting and it s pervasive across investors amateur or professional brokamp but fund managers are forced to do it they shouldn t agree it s because the investors are focusing on the quarter as a fund manager if you have a bad year money is going to go out the door housel you re fired money is the core eventually you re going to be fired brokamp even though they know they should be focusing long term therefore because of the biases of the shareholders housel right it s our problem brokamp it is true in the end folks it s all your fault housel all extreme discounting is just intense focus on the short run when your goals are way longer down the road southwick which at the motley fool as long term investors our goals are way down the road at least three to five years housel right brokamp actually we re having a discussion earlier today with some colleagues about how if you worked in richmond and you want to get a job with philip morris and same with some of the other companies you had to smoke like you had to fit into the culture there we thought about that short term view of things i m going to smoke today to have this job i m going to pay for it 20 30 years down the road but i want that job now housel but it s like if i smoke i ll have this job in 20 years but you won t because you re smoking and you re going to die brokamp that s right it s an early retirement folks southwick the last one we re going to talk about is the bias bias did you make this one up housel yes i couldn t think of a better name for it but i think the bias when i started writing about bias i noticed that there were a lot of people who effectively said that s cool but this doesn t apply to me i think that s what the bias is thinking when you re reading out behavioral psychology behavioral finance and all the mistakes people make you think it s something that applies to someone else and not yourself i think almost everyone thinks this they read about extreme discounting and frequency illusion they think that s something that other people will fall for but i would never fall for that i m a long term thinker i will never do that but almost everyone does daniel kahneman who won the nobel prize in economics for his work in behavioral finance said something along the lines i m paraphrasing he said something like when i m doing this research i realize that i m writing about myself because of these mistakes that hurt other people the only difference between kahneman and these people is that he s aware of it and he understands what s going on but everyone is making the same mistakes southwick is awareness the first step housel it s the first step southwick acknowledging you have a problem is the first step too housel that s right there definitely is an extent to if you re aware of these and you think about them you come up with a plan that you can make yourself a better thinker and help yourself versus where you were before but i think a lot of these are natural biases that have been engrained through evolution that i don t think virtually anyone is going to completely cure themselves but that s where if you re aware of them you can set up your portfolio instead of your expectations to work around them but you re never going to get rid of them southwick got to hack yourself brokamp in that vein which bias do you find yourself falling for most often housel i think probably bias is bias brokamp you think you re better than everyone else housel yeah but i think everyone does no one wants to admit i m totally flawed and i m a bad thinker and i can t control my emotions because i think if people thought that about themselves they d have a hard time making it through the day most people just to make it through the day have to think i m making good decisions that s how you can wake up in the morning and look at yourself in the mirror and say i m making good decisions but a lot of people don t southwick existential eggs of morgan housel brokamp i m going to make a bad decision southwick one after another brokamp i ve done enough with money as much as alison will know compare money to diet health and exercise and i m often grabbing something i m about to eat it and i know i shouldn t i know it s not going to help me accomplish my goal of losing weight or staying in better shape or avoiding having three heart attacks like my dad but i watch it in slow motion coming toward my mouth and i know i m making that decision but i do it anyway housel i know a lot of very smart financial advisors who are some of the smartest investors that i know that give great advice and every time i hear them talk or write something i m like this guide knows his own but then you become friends with them you learn about their personal life their personal financial situation is a disaster that s all it s really easy to think you re doing everything right and to be able to talk about how to do things right but actually putting it into practice is harder than it looks southwick before we go morgan what s your best piece of advice for our listeners for their next steps when it comes to mastering their biases is there maybe a book they can read or what do you think would be most helpful for our people housel daniel kahneman s book thinking fast and slow is the combination of his life s work is just an amazing book is a dense read it s not bedtime reading it s just an amazing look at the human mind and how we trick ourselves called thinking fast and slow brokamp interesting thing about him is he has a financial advisor despite all he knows he doesn t manage at least all his own money that s a good thing too if you get a trusted professional who can stop you when you want to make some of these big mistakes it s probably helpful too housel funny story about his financial advisor too he s done very well he won the nobel prize he gets paid a lot for speaking daniel kahneman has done well for himself financially few years ago he went to a financial advisor and he said i don t need to become richer i just want to live out my days in comfort but i don t need to make any more money and his advisors said i can t work with you he has had to find a new one he uses that as an example of financial advisors not understanding the human element of risk taking kahneman said i don t have the psychology to handle a lot of market risk and i don t need the money to begin with so just keep me steady the financial advisors said that s not what we do southwick yeah i m here to make you money housel right so he found someone else after that southwick morgan you had a running column in the wall street journal which means that your face was what they call they made you a little dot picture housel you know what s crazy about that they do those by hand southwick that is crazy housel the journal started doing this 120 years ago and then they just kept the tradition they not only kept the pictures but kept the original way of doing it which is a guy in the back with a pen and just dot dot dot it takes some 10 hours per picture to do it brokamp were you happy with the results housel not really southwick i ve seen it it doesn t look like you it looks like you with 20 30 pounds housel that s what people say southwick it s like chubby you brokamp you ve been fatified southwick you ve been fatified but i would still take financial advice from you if that makes you housel makes me feel better southwick if that makes you feel better you maybe didn t look as handsome as you are but you still got the brains in there well morgan thank you for joining us this has been a lot of fun housel thanks for having me southwick we re going to have you back housel all right southwick we re going to talk more housel great i work upstairs so it s no problem southwick wonderful housel good southwick thanks we have received a ton of mail from you guys which is awesome here s where i feel bad because it s going to take us a while to get through all the letters but we re going to do our darnedest the first question this week comes to us from boris he writes in my ira accounts i have funds from vanguard amana royce t rowe price baron hennessy it is a bit of a mess some funds i have kept for 15 20 years others are relatively new additions i was wondering if you can provide some suggestions and tips on deciding when to sell a fund i normally look at performance compared to other funds in the portfolio but it s hard to compare across different sectors i try to use the morningstar rating but each fund seems to have a handful of those as well do i look at the overall ratings brokamp great question boris morningstar is my go to source for information about mutual funds you can go to morningstar com you put a quote for the mutual fund and then you hit the performance tab the important thing about evaluating the performance of a mutual fund is you have to compare it to similar funds these extreme examples you would never compare a bond fund to an s p 500 index fund you want to be comparing international funds to international funds small cap funds to small cap funds on that performance page if you scroll down you will see category rank the lower the number the better so if you see that your fund is in the category rank of 10 that means it is in the top 10 of those funds for that category you want to look at a longer term period at least five years 10 years but actually studies show the number one predictor of future fund performance are expenses so i would look first at expenses you want below average expenses then look at performance southwick below average is brokamp below average while it depends on the type of fund it is morningstar will also on the expenses give a fee level it will say low below average average high to do that then performance management tenure you want someone who s been managing the fund for at least five years the morningstar star rating morningstar acknowledges that that is a backward looking analysis that is not necessarily predictive it has some predictive characteristics a little bit but for the most part ignore the stars that just tells you what it did not necessarily what it s going to do southwick all right cool this is when we segue into sam s question sam writes i ve invested in mutual funds but thanks to your advice i ve been thinking about transferring to lower cost index funds that s my yay i m putting in the yay the problem is that i get wet feet about paying thousands of dollars in income taxes for selling and rebuying such a large portion of my holdings do you have any soothing thoughts to help me take the plunge brokamp well it s a great question it s a bit of a dilemma it depends on the tax bite because let s say you have 10 000 in a fund you sell it because of taxes you have to pay a 1 000 so you re left with 9 000 you re really asking should i have just kept 10 000 in the old investments or i m going to be better off putting 9 000 now that i pay tax into this new one you have to basically think how long will it take for that smaller investment in my new investment to overtake the other one it really depends on the degree to which your current investment stinks compared to an index fund if you have a fund that is high cost underperformed its benchmark by 2 or 3 a year i would say do it for sure i mean if it s a long term holding you re going to hold for five 10 15 20 years you re going to be better off in the end if you have a fund that is only marginally worse than a index fund if it s still below average costs which many actively managed funds are it may not be as compelling the other thing to keep in mind is you don t have to do it all at once chances are you bought the mutual fund over different periods you actually let s say you got into mutual fund through five different purchases you ve put in 2 000 in point and 2 000 another point and 2 000 another point you actually can choose which of those portions to sell one might have a huge capital gain which would cause lots of taxes the other one maybe it s just the marginal capital gain it wouldn t cost you so much in taxes you can tell the fund company i just want to sell those shares you don t have to do it all at once you can identify the shares but you have to contact the mutual fund company on how to do that because each company has a little bit of their own way of letting them know otherwise there is a default when you tell them to sell and they re going to choose the shares that you sold them and they may not be the best ones to sell from a tax perspective southwick wonderful thanks bro brokamp my pleasure southwick those were great answers all right boris and sam hopefully that was helpful that s going to actually do it for today brokamp it is southwick that is all we have got for you the show is edited by rick engdahl with the music composed and performed by dayana yochim our email is answers fool com i want to thank everyone who went to itunes and gave us a review brokamp we love you southwick we love you thank you for robert brokamp i m alison southwick fool on

these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of august 9 2021 this video was recorded on aug 23 2021 chris hill it s monday aug 23 welcome to marketfoolery i m chris hill with me today mr jason moser good to see you jason moser good to see you hill we have a risk factor in the war on cash lest anyone think we do nothing but cheer lead one side in the war on cash we re going to talk about the other side today moser kicking in the visa hill but we re going to start with retail last week we got target s earnings report and some color from management on how back to school shopping is going today we found out what they have in store for the end of the year holidays target is planning to triple the number of disney shops within target locations this is the store within a store concept that they started in 2019 with disney i think about 25 locations they increased it a few at a time but now they are aiming for more than 160 by the end of the year and that is close to 10 of target s locations moser it is i think this is a very shrewd move i like it to me we re seeing this transformation of target from just a department store or a discount retail store to almost becoming like the new version of what a mall should be for this next generation the malls that you and i grew up with chris time will tell exactly how that scene shakes out but it almost seems like those malls are becoming like little towns i think we ve seen this with simon property group and whatnot a lot of these malls were talking about becoming destination centers and places where you either go for entertainment or even live perhaps they re building apartment complexes and whatnot if these new malls or these malls are becoming like the new little towns it seems like targets in stores like that are becoming the new version of a mall we have ulta with the relationship with target with apple with the relationship with target and disney seeing this expansion of this relationship it only makes sense and i think the timing is right because you re right they re coming off of a tremendous quarter they got their inventory levels back up they are well prepared for the back half of this year and to throw more disney stuff into the mix this to me is just an absolute no brainer and you couple that with the fact that target now has better than 100 million target circle rewards members there are going to be a lot of different things they can do with this obviously we know the attraction to disney and all of the different characters and properties that disney has that s not going to change in fact as time goes on it should only become a stronger competitive point for disney and ultimately for target to me this makes a whole heck of a lot of sense and i think the timing is right to frame them up for a pretty good holiday season i would think hill i like how you re framing this as target is basically like a smaller version of a mall it s a curated mall because you can also throw in the fact that a few years back they sold their pharmacy business to cvs and basically said to cvs you come in here and do this i don t know about the target closest to you but the target closest to me right when you walk in there s a starbucks cafe i get my coffee get caffeinated and go around are you like me curious to see what happens to toy prices this holiday season because between this story some of the colors we got out of hasbro and mattel out of their most recent earnings reports it seems like toys are going to be more expensive this year moser i think that s a fair assessment if you remember a few weeks back we were talking about hasbro s earnings report and they had noted in their call they were planning for prices to go up this holiday season and a lot of that really is because of freight and shipping costs they actually quantified it in their freight and shipping costs this time this year are about four times as great as they were a year ago that s a big bump in just a short period of time they ll be passing along price increases for the back half of the year that s the ideal time to do it because this really should in theory be a pretty robust holiday season given where we re coming from and so to me it only makes sense to be able to pass those prices along i suspect we will see that exactly how far they decide to take it is anyone s real guess but i do think that you re seeing disney and target it s not just disney and target partnering together it s also worth remembering that target is teaming up with fao schwarz since we re on the topic of toys target is teaming up with fao schwarz again this year they did it last year but this is boiling down ultimately to an exclusive i believe they said that 70 piece toy collection with fao schwarz it s going to have items from barbie and paw patrol which is clearly a big seller right now with the new movie and whatnot they re going to have a pop up shop inside of fao schwarz s flagship store in new york city to me it s very fascinating to see how all of these different retail concepts are coming together in figuring out ways to work together i m going to name drop here chris last week you may have heard i had an interview with the ceo on wednesday s industry focus with latch ceo luke schoenfelder it was a fun conversation if you missed it make sure to catch last wednesday s industry focus it really was a good interview but luke and i were talking about this competitive landscape today it s not just retail you see it in tech as well latch is focused on connecting buildings and the internet of things and stuff and whatnot i was talking to him about other competitors in the space like google or apple other companies that sell those types of devices and those types of software that manage them he mentioned a term that i think we ve mentioned before through the years on the show that coopetition it s not necessarily competition in its purest form but it s competitors coming together in competing but in a cooperative way they re figuring out a way for every one to benefit to basically let all those boats rise with the tide it s need to see that i know we talk all the time about competition and may the best man or woman win and whatnot but it is also worth remembering that this is a time where we re seeing a lot of success stories as we say with investing in most cases it s rarely if ever a zero sum game i mean you can pick a number of winners out there it s just in target s case that looking at target you re also seeing these other retail concepts that are going to be rising along with that tide whether it s disney whether it s apple whether it s fao schwarz whoever it may be you re seeing these concepts coming together to figure out ways for all of them to benefit to me that s just exciting to see particularly at this time when we re going into a holiday season that should be pretty robust hill our email address is we got a note from chadwick in florida who writes what do you all make of starboard value s open letter to box shareholders the back and forth responses and the possible shenanigans at box a little bit of background here this is box com the cloud storage company starboard value the activist firm that has about an 8 stake in box starboard value nominated four directors for the 10 person board that box has they made those nominations earlier this year saying that box hasn t capitalized on the work from home trend they re falling behind other cloud competitors i don t have any stake in this whatsoever but i will point out that at least from a stock perspective i see where starboard value is coming from because this stock is basically where it was when box went public in january of 2015 moser yeah you re right and i don t have a stake in this either looking at this from an outsider s perspective you mentioned the stake that starboard has in box it s worth noting they have a much larger stake than all of the insiders put together from what it looks like that s something worth just keeping in mind this is a business in box that went public i think it was january of 2015 the ceo and co founder i believe aaron levie is still at the helm there these can be really tricky because sometimes you feel like wow the gall of a fund manager thinking that they know this business better than the people running it come on eight times out of 10 that s probably the safe assumption fund managers at the end of the day are really just trying to make some money on the other hand it may be that they do have some insight through past experiences or suggestions that might help the business improve in the case of box it remains to be seen but to your point i would argue that oftentimes the stock price isn t a good indicator of success in the near term particularly with businesses like these that are still unprofitable and still relatively unproven this is also a company that s been public since like i said january 2015 i think in this case we re well past the point where the stock price might not necessarily be a good indicator i think in this case the stock price is a good indicator and when you dig a little bit deeper you certainly see the numbers bear that out it s a company where growth is slowing down if you just look at the compounded annual growth rate of revenue over the last five years is 19 3 three years it s 14 3 and just one year 11 9 this is still a relatively small business it looks like starboard there s some questions there in regard to capital allocation on the box side and furthermore capital raises that the company performed that they may not have needed to perform or at least perform in the way that they did it s really difficult to say what ultimately comes of all of this i think in this case though for me i ve always been a little bit skeptical of box just based on the general market and the numbers that the company s always lobbed up it is obviously a big market opportunity in cloud storage and distribution but it s also a very competitive one to me it feels like maybe box might want to put the ego aside for a minute and maybe listen to what starboard has to say because right now what they re doing just clearly isn t working hill this morning institutional shareholder services which is a proxy advisory firm came out and they backed box they recommended that shareholders vote for box s slate of directors i m not saying that seals the deal for box but that certainly points to probably a better outcome in the short term but this whole thing if nothing else i feel like starboard value has just put box management on notice and that the clock is ticking because a year from now if the stock is still in the mid 20s i don t know that things are going to go management s way moser yeah you have to ask yourself why is starboard doing this i don t think starboard is doing this because they truly want to see box just grow into this 25 year success story i think starboard is doing this because they have an endgame i think they want to make some money from this investment they ve been in this for a little while they re not making any money from it they re trying to figure out a way to create some value that s the job there are two different perspectives at play here it s one thing for management at box to say that they are taking the long view and building this company for long term success but you do have to show the signs for that with a business that s been around this long in the public markets 2015 it s been a little while like i said still unprofitable it s barely cash flow positive back out stock based compensation it s really not a very impressive picture there either on the cash flow side it feels like this business should be further along than it is right now but clearly there are two different agendas here i don t begrudge either for me personally i tend to default i want to know what the company should do on its own hey listen starboard if you re not making any money if you don t like this maybe the thesis has changed what do we say when that happens sell go put your money somewhere else there s nothing stopping them from doing that i would imagine if this continues the way it s going then we probably will see starboard just cut bait and move on to greener pastures hill one of the big sporting events this weekend is wwe summerslam in las vegas tens of thousands of people attend at allegiant stadium which as some may know is a cashless stadium that s great until the system goes down which is what happened during summerslam tsys which is the third party payment system basically the bones of what makes that cashless stadium run experienced a nationwide outage and so no sales could happen alcohol sales were not happening at the summerslam god knows how many hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars were lost in revenue what do you think when you look at this story because setting aside what that must have been like for the people attending i look at this and i think i still believe in the war on cash but maybe it makes sense to still have cash available as a backup moser even better keep in the back of your mind you may have to pull a cosmo kramer and start sneaking those cafe lattes into the events you can t rely on being able to buy it there i read this a buddy of mine hayden at georgia sent me this link as well and we were talking about it we ve talked about this a long time he s a lawyer and we ve talked about the idea of going cashless there s some legal ramifications there s language on actual cash that says this is legal tenders so an argument could be made that if you re a merchant you need to accept it now i don t know how that will all shake out but i will say i personally think that no matter what line of work you are in to me you always need to accept cash now some people may think well wait a minute what are you saying you got to take cash listen i love the war on cash and we re investing in that but if you re a business you need to give yourself the biggest market opportunity you possibly can if you re working some type of retail concept or an event where people are coming in and buying food and beverage you just need to accept cash you need to give yourself the most opportunity if you cut off cash even when everything is working just fine to me you re limiting yourself you re not giving yourself the biggest market opportunity but to me no 1 it demonstrates the spaghetti junction that the payments industry is because this isn t just tsys this was tsys which is total systems that was acquired by global payments back in 2019 so really this is a global payments issue but then it s also a shift4 issue because shift4 is a partner with tsys and global payments in helping all of this stuff work you start seeing how this payments industry it s very difficult to fully connect all the dots and understand everyone s role there so it is tricky i feel like over time this is a space that is going to have to consolidate it s going to shake out some of the smaller weaker competitors just because that s simply going to have to happen but it can be very difficult to fully understand who is doing what and at the end of the day if you want to go cashless and just require on using technology you re going to need to develop some type of redundancy like in the cloud business some backup system so that when the inevitable happens because it s not like this might happen again it s going to happen again it s just going to be a matter of how you handle it i can remember back in the day growing up when i d be working a job whether it was in the golf business or whatever if a system went down and someone were to pay with a credit card you know what we did we just took the card and we wrote down the number the name and the expiration date and then we ran it through the system later when the systems were back up now maybe you re taking a chance there that some cards will be declined but that s better than just refusing sales and giving everything away so i feel like this probably could ve been handled a little bit differently a lot of lessons to learn there but the bottom line i will always believe this i think you just have to accept cash even if no one uses it you ve just got to have that option because there s going to be a point in time where it s going to come in handy unless we go to just a fully cashless economy which i don t see happening then you got to make sure you just give yourself the biggest market to work with hill gather around children we ll tell you about when we used to use pen and paper to write credit card numbers down moser do they even teach handwriting in school anymore i don t think so hill i don t think so at least i don t know moser my daughters have really good penmanship but i think that s just because they practice on their own all of their work is done they re a junior and sophomore in high school everything is on their laptop so it s not quite the same as it was growing up hill the grade school years are in the rearview mirror thankfully so i m not sure jason moser always great talking to you thanks for being here moser thank you hill as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear that s going to do it for this edition of marketfoolery the show is

the u s economy grew at a robust 6 6 annual rate last quarter slightly faster than previously estimated the government said thursday in a report that pointed to a sustained consumer led rebound from the pandemic recession but worries are growing that the delta variant of the coronavirus is beginning to cause a slowdown the report from the commerce department estimated that the nation s gross domestic product its total output of goods and services accelerated slightly in the april june quarter from the 6 5 it had initially reported last month the economy s expansion last quarter followed a solid 6 3 annual growth rate in the january march period in recent weeks many economists have been downgrading their estimates of gdp growth for this quarter and for 2021 as a whole as the now dominant delta variant has sent confirmed covid 19 cases rising throughout the country new reported cases are now topping 150 000 a day the highest level since late january as a consequence real time tracking of consumer activities notably for airline travel and restaurant dining has weakened in recent weeks the government s upgraded estimate for growth in the april june quarter fell somewhat shy of expectations some economists had predicted a 7 annual rate or more they based that view on a belief that consumer spending had accelerated even faster than the sizzling 11 8 rate first reported thursday s revised estimate for consumer spending which drives about 70 of economic activity was upgraded by 0 1 percentage point to 11 9 the slight rise in the government s estimate for april june growth reflected in part stronger business investment which grew at a solid 9 3 rate and export sales which were up at a 6 6 rate after falling in the first quarter offsetting that strength was a bigger drag from cutbacks in businesses inventory restocking and weaker home building which fell at an 11 5 annual rate this sector has been hurt by surging prices for materials and a shortage of construction workers goldman sachs has cut its forecast for annual growth in the current july september quarter from 9 to 5 5 citing the effects of the delta variant likewise wells fargo economists have downgraded their third quarter gdp forecast from an 8 8 annual rate to 6 8 also because of the surge in covid cases some forecasters have also reduced their outlook for the full year thought by smaller amounts in anticipation that the economy could re accelerate in the final three months of 2021 if covid cases ease as vaccines are increasingly administered but uncertainty remains the real question is how well spending will hold up against the current delta wave said leslie preston senior economist at td economics some high frequency indicators are pointing to a loss in momentum in spending as consumer caution creeps in mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said he had downgraded his forecast for annual gdp growth this quarter from 8 4 to 6 5 but he predicted that gdp will expand at a strong 6 4 annual rate in the final three months of the year that would leave growth for the full year at a brisk 6 1 which would be the fastest calendar year expansion since a 7 2 gain in 1984 last year the economy shrank 3 4 as the pandemic triggered recession wiped out tens of millions of jobs at the same time zandi cautioned that covid remains in his mind the most serious economic risk the economy is linked at the hip to the pandemic he said so long as the pandemic is raging that will drive a lot of what happens in the economy the uncertainty surrounding covid is complicating the work of the federal reserve the fed is caught between the risks posed by covid which would normally call for continued economic support from the central bank and rising inflation which creates pressure on the fed to consider dialing back its ultra low interest rate policies the gdp report thursday showed prices rising at a 6 5 annual rate in the second quarter the fastest such pace since a 6 8 quarterly increase in 1981 when the fed was fighting high inflation by raising interest rates to historic highs financial markets will be listening closely when fed chair jerome powell gives a high profile speech friday morning as part of an annual conference of central bankers the conference sponsored by the federal reserve bank of kansas city and normally held in jackson hole wyoming will instead be a virtual only event for a second straight year because of rising covid cases in wyoming in its gdp report thursday the government said that purchases of durable goods which include vehicles appliances furniture and electronic gear among other longer lasting items rose at an 11 3 rate in the second quarter that was a strong figure though well below the 50 jump in the first quarter when consumers went on a pent up buying spree as the economy increasingly reopened in the revised data consumer spending on services air travel restaurant meals entertainment events and the like grew at an 11 3 annual rate below the initial estimate of 12 but well above the 3 9 growth rate in the first quarter the increase in services spending in the second quarter reflected a shift away from the goods purchases that many people had made while hunkered down at home to spending on services from haircuts to sporting events to vacation trips credit associated press ap photo
