the scale of the western response to russia s invasion of ukraine has been as surprising as the invasion itself in the span of a few days a highly integrated capitalist economy was wrenched out of the networks of financial globalization with unprecedented speed and comprehensiveness two and a half weeks after russia launched its horrific war the country is isolated its economic linkages with the outside world growing more attenuated by the day the initial focus of western sanctions on the assets and financial transactions of key russian businessmen and companies didn t come as a particular surprise some of the same targets had already been sanctioned in the wake of russia s first incursion into ukraine in 2014 as the political pressure to punish russia mounted the us uk and eu announced the ejection of russian banks from swift the global interbank messaging system by prohibiting correspondent banking relationships with banks in new york the west ultimately pushed russia out of the global dollar based clearing and settlement system exclusion from the global payment system was a major step up in the escalation but western leaders were still on familiar territory iranian banks were excluded from swift in 2012 and correspondent banking relationships were severed in 2019 and crucially the us and eu had made sure to exempt all transactions related to energy russian gas and oil could continue to flow it s the subsequent measures put in place in the sunday after the invasion that have constituted the real geoeconomic break the freezing of russian s foreign reserve assets held abroad and the outright ban on transactions with the russian central bank in emerging markets foreign reserve assets are used by central banks to prevent runs on their currencies by committing to prop up their value in so called open market operations when markets opened on monday after the invasion the west had deprived russia of the half of the 630 billion war chest of foreign exchange earnings that its central bank held at institutions abroad the ruble has since fallen to record lows against the dollar an exodus of western firms commenced and has yet to cease finally last tuesday the us announced an import ban on russian oil the short term consequences for russian civilians are clear a dramatic decline in purchasing power massively higher unemployment shortages of key goods such as food medicine cars and household appliances and then what as the deputy director of the cia david cohen architect of the sanctions against iran and russia as undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence noted in 2019 if the goal is regime change the logic of coercive sanctions does not hold up indeed the experiment with severe sanctions and trade measures enacted against iran has not led to any lasting behavioral change let alone to changes in government cornell historian nicholas mulder s recent history of sanctions the economic weapon makes the case on a grander scale mulder shows that sanctions tend to have little to do with deterrence or compellence in their totality they constitute a form of siege of attritional warfare against one s enemy particularly its civilian population in the case of iran the humanitarian consequences of prolonged us sanctions have been degrading economic growth has languished incomes have stagnated and food prices have risen as a result food insecurity and malnutrition especially among children and women have risen rendering a large part of the population more prone to chronic disease an estimate by the centre for economic and policy research suggests that the reimposition of sanctions by the trump administration alone has resulted in up to forty thousand excess deaths in 2017 and 2018 more startling than even the speed or the unity of the western response however was that they were imposed while the war was in full swing and not ex ante as is usually the case this is why they are inseparable from the incompetent butchery on the ground it should not come as a too big a shock that putin s escalatory response was to increase the alertness level of russia s nuclear arsenal the central bank freezes have irked him more than the announcement of european weapon deliveries to ukraine the financial war is a genuine war and its stakes are immense over the course of a week targeted financial sanctions escalated into measures that if not lifted in the near future are almost certain to condemn russia s quasi autarkic economy to sharp and lasting stagnation no matter their intent or longevity these sanctions will change the country forever in the great transformation karl polanyi attributed the relative peace in europe in the century preceding the first world war to the implacable workings of haute finance which muted geopolitical rivalries by aligning national interests with its peace interest peace and trade he wrote had become linked by way of monetary integration perhaps it was this belief that informed some of the complacencies that preceded the invasion since the late 20th century globalization has been celebrated in even more emphatic terms commentators both inane tom friedman and his golden arches theory and sophisticated paul krugman have long proffered an argument that economic integration would diminish the conditions for interstate hostilities in reality it is hard to view the past decades of financial globalization as anything other than a prelude to the current conflict more than any armed conflict the current international monetary system has laid bare the folly of this romantic liberal portrait of globalization the sanctions against russia are the clearest manifestation yet of a distinct undercurrent of financial globalization that has become more pronounced in recent in years geopolitical coercion through the central banking system over the past decade there have been a number of instances in which this form of financial compulsion what one might call monetary warfare has been used to devastating effect of course this method of coercion is not new but the extreme step of the central bank freeze suggests that we are in a new phase of monetary combat not even nazi germany was fully exiled from the international monetary system relations between the bank of england and the reichsbank persisted well into the 1940s while the bank of international settlements allowed the german central bank access to its clearing and settlement facilities throughout the entirety of the war one infamous case in 1939 involved the clearing of looted czecho slovakian central bank gold via the bis in cooperation with the bank of england the nature of central bank reserves is quasi sacrosanct but already in 2015 we could see the contours of the new monetary warfare during the latter part of the european debt crisis the socialist government of an insolvent greece faced up against the troika of institutions representing the country s creditors the imf the eurogroup the council of european finance ministers and the european central bank ecb at the peak of the crisis the ecb paused the emergency liquidity assistance ela to greece s central bank in turn forcing their banks to shut down and limit cash withdrawals this move described by greece s finance minister yanis varoufakis as financial terrorism was a cynical attempt to sway voters ahead of an all important referendum on a memorandum presented by the creditors while the ecb s power is limited to its monetary jurisdiction the reach of the us federal reserve is global this is due to the existence of vast offshore pools of dollar liabilities in moments of crisis when investors across the globe seek the safety of the world s key currency and create a shortage of dollar denominated assets central banks rely on dollar reserves to backstop their financial system in the absence of large fortress balance sheets this makes them dependent on so called dollar swap lines from the fed these swap lines are a form of good will and good will can be withheld during the convulsions brought about by the covid 19 crisis many countries clamored for dollar liquidity to prevent their financial system collapsing but the only beneficiaries of these arrangements were allies of the united states the most blatant example of this type of coercion occurred just months before the russian invasion after the remaining us forces withdrew from afghanistan the taliban swooped in to fill the vacuum and took control of the country s institutions including the central bank which held an estimated 7 billion in reserves in the united states the biden administration promptly froze and confiscated the reserves and in a cynical move distributed half to the families of victims of the september 11 attacks afghanistan the poorest country in asia now finds itself in a devastating famine that could results in millions of deaths champions of globalization have always argued that integration into the global trading and financial system is a victory in and of itself but what these examples suggest is that the west s ability to coerce states has only increased as a function of their integration this dynamic was legible to vladimir putin when as russia became a central node the global economy it became more vulnerable and he took steps to mitigate its vulnerability the rapid growth of china and other developing economies generated the demand that supercharged russia s export sector in the two decades after putin first became president in 1999 oil gas aluminum nickel palladium wheat and corn as in all developing economies the state made sure to accumulate a portion of the foreign exchange earnings of russian firms in the public coffers this occurred alongside an austere balancing of the budget the country s political and technocratic elite learned a cruel lesson after the 1998 financial crisis when the ruble collapsed and russia defaulted on its debt these are the origins of what would eventually become the war chest and the fortress balance sheet the evolution of global finance in this period may have also accelerated this process of accumulation in his compelling new book price wars rupert russell argues that the emergence of the over the counter derivatives market and the creation of commodity index funds sent commodity markets into overdrive with prices largely detaching themselves from the dynamics of supply and demand the transformation of oil and gas into volatile asset classes benefitted russia greatly its propensity for violent conflict increased as a function of windfall gains from high oil prices which were channeled into both the reserve buffer and defense the invasion of georgia in 2008 and ukraine in 2014 were preceded by extended rallies in the price of oil so was this latest conflict further underwriting putin s ambitions was the worsening trend of both european and american hydrocarbon dependence germany and italy in particular depend on russian gas for domestic heating and their manufacturing industries though it is the world s largest oil and gas producer the united states imports heavy russian crude required for its offshore refineries even if a deal with iran can be found there is no obvious substitute for this type of oil because crude oil from the gulf states is lighter this dependence is compounded by the key role that gas prices play for political favorability ratings adding pressure to the democrats already poor prospects in the upcoming midterm elections biden s surprising announcement on tuesday that the us and uk would cease russian oil imports comes at a potentially high political and economic cost for europe the cost is likely too high to accept but as globalization underwrote putin s militarism and his increasingly hostile posture toward russia s neighbors it simultaneously rendered the country s economy fatally reliant on the net demand from other countries such as germany and china on imports of crucial goods such as machinery transportation equipment pharmaceutical and electronics mostly from europe on access to the global dollar system to finance and conduct trade this is one way to construe the deceptively simple insight of henry farrell and abraham l newman s theory of weaponized interdependence the logic of financial globalization that generated russia s trade surplus and gave putin room to maneuver also provided the economic and financial weaponry that was turned against him this vulnerability is reflected in putin s strategic economic logic in the period since 2014 the russian central bank has successfully sought to de dollarize a substantial portion of its reserves and outstanding dollar liabilities throughout the economy have been reduced these moves were informed by western dominance of the global payment infrastructure via swift and the dollar interbank system in a very meaningful way russia had prepared for the current conflict but it was also guided by a belief in the sanctity of foreign reserves held at the world s central banks if such a sanctity ever existed it has been obliterated overnight what will be the international impact of the russian crisis the status of key currencies like the dollar is an open question one argument submits that if the reserves held at foreign central banks cannot be considered money in any meaningful sense if at the touch of a button they cannot be used as a means of exchange or store of value the moneyness of the dollar itself might be jeopardized the dollar is a pillar of financial globalization as we know it that trade is largely invoiced in dollars and the global wholesale money market in which dollar liabilities are generated offshore relies on a steady flow of dollar assets this is precisely what makes its demise unlikely the financial system is not based on the short term whim of investors but on robust and long term institutional realities an open capital account highly liberalized and integrated financial markets and deep liquid markets in benchmark assets like us treasuries china still imposes capital controls while europe despite recent steps in the right direction doesn t yet have a proper euro safe asset and though the global financial plumbing seems to be weathering the crisis quite well so far the removal of russian petrodollars might in fact lead to the opposite outcome a shortage of dollar assets in a time in which risk averse investors are already rushing into them further entrenching the greenback s status the threat of financial war and the perceived need for geopolitical alignment with the west as the precondition to avoid financial exile might indeed render other currencies more attractive relative to the dollar but it is hard to see how anything is going to change on a systemic level nothing so far indicates that the war has undermined the dollar and with it the ability of the us to turn into a basket case the economy of any state that dissents from whatever is left of the elusive rules based international order politically however the long term consequences are harder to discern an unravelling of the existing economic and financial interdependencies is unlikely these are not the last days of globalization even if in the medium term it seems to have plateaued but doux commerce the notion that money talks walks and wants peace is well and truly buried nowhere is the failure of the rosy vision of globalization s civilizing force more in evidence than in europe particularly in germany while the exact implications of the war are still unclear for most countries germany s very peculiar place in the global economy and the degree to which its institutions and politics reflect that peculiarity merit attention nowhere has the notion that the forces of economic integration would turn countries like russia into responsible stakeholders in the global system had more purchase on policy thus the premise of german security and defense policy over the past three decades was that aid and diplomacy were sufficient to meet its obligations both as a member of a multilateral security alliance like nato and as the de facto leader of a european union keen to establish itself as a geopolitical authority a so called culture of restraint informed by germany s calamitous past evolved into outright neglect during the long tenure of angela merkel germany never made good on its pledge to invest at least 2 percent of its gdp into its moribund army the speech by chancellor olaf scholz on the sunday after the invasion calling for a one time 100 billion euro off balance sheet defense fund and a renewed commitment to the 2 percent target therefore startled observers many of whom believed the country s elite could not be budged from its decades old policy consensus on the face of it this is a dramatic break in german politics but germany s shirking of its defense duties was always part of the larger failure to lift the levels of public and private net investment throughout the germany economy during a period when german borrowing costs were at a historical low the main culprit was the much maligned fiscal policy consensus which was committed to the questionable view that sound public finances require strict fiscal rules that balance the budget and choke off demand when it becomes excessive this commitment was in fact written into law both at the german level in the form of what s called the debt brake and at the european level the stability and growth pact much needed productive investment languished in germany and throughout europe invariably the expansion of germany s renewable sector fell short and its dependence on russian gas only increased as investment into key infrastructures like heat pumps never took off at the appropriate scale this continued dependence on the free flow of russian hydrocarbons explains the seeming absence of any clear geopolitical calculation evident in the central bank sanctions the inability to avoid exemptions for energy transactions motivates a stronger response elsewhere any talk about the european block s strategic autonomy rings hollow without a commitment to changing the fiscal rules that have prevented major investment into energy and defense on tuesday it was reported that a proposal to create large joint fund for this purpose by issuing joint euro denominated debt may be presented after the eu s leaders hold an informal summit in versailles on march 10 this would come only a year after the 2 trillion emergency package also backed by joint liabilities that was agreed upon as a response to the pandemic if created the new fund could have potentially extraordinary consequences even for the status of the euro relative to the dollar but one remembers only too well the many eu summits in years past that resulted in absolutely nothing jean monnet one of europe s founding fathers famously remarked that europe will be forged in crises and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises after a decade and a half of crisis and de novo institution building in the euro area it is not clear what kind of europe is being forged and whether it can face the challenge it is currently presented with all crises reveal the structure of the systems through which they propagate so too has the financial war thrown into sharp relief the shortcomings of the european project a project heavily premised on a positive vision of globalization it is now more likely that german and eu security energy and fiscal policy will chart a different course but the underlying political and institutional headwinds have not ceased nor should therefore the effort to build coalitions and an intellectual consensus to overcome those obstacles it is still an open question to what extent european politics will change in the larger scheme of things it is not clear why we should care if it does or not both the minutiae of european fiscal policy and the possible rejigging of the global financial plumbing seem of secondary importance compared to the severe global impacts of the financial sanctions on the real economy surging commodity prices will hit developing countries hardest and widespread inflation might prompt an even harsher cycle of global monetary policy tightening that might induce widespread recession and unemployment perhaps the most acute consequence is the shortage of agricultural products ukraine and russia supply a third of the world s wheat and are major exporters of barley corn and sunflower oil the two countries account for 85 percent of egypt s 45 percent of yemen s and 50 percent of lebanon s wheat imports all countries that are already reeling from food shortages social unrest and recent currency devaluations that have reduced the purchasing power of ordinary citizens and increased the share of their income they pay for food the impending food crisis is not just due to the war itself despite the fact that the sanctions exempt agricultural products they have rendered doing business with russian firms anathema among the many companies extracting themselves from the russian economy are the international shipping giants who are already refusing to send shipping containers further disrupting the flow of wheat and other goods to africa and the middle east this is one of the ways the monetary war is leading to a drastic sharpening of the political economic environmental polycrisis that reared its numerous heads in the wake of the pandemic but for now those who will bear the brunt are ordinary ukrainians and russians ukrainians face protracted and brutal violence and possible russian subjugation while russia s strenuously gained advantage as a privileged raw materials exporter looks to have been wrecked on the shoals of putin s nationalist irredentist ambitions and unlike it did in the period after the 1998 crisis chinese demand will not be able to cushion the effects the crisis indefinitely as the ruble continues to find new cliffs to fall off citizens will suffer while their now openly despotic leader remains firmly in place to echo something putin himself once admitted about communism russia has been led into a blind alley far away from the mainstream of globalization

even with an increase in prices there will be shortages meat costs will increase by 30 the war in ukraine the galloping increases it has prompted in fuel costs spell food supply emergency not just for portugal but portugal will come off particularly badly expresso has blown the whistle on this spiralling crisis admitting the situation the worst it says in living memory has been further exacerbated by drought arable farmers meat producers dairy farmers bakers poultry farmers and all the industries within the food sector have never seen or experienced anything like the issues stacked up against them one of the major obstacles is thatwith these now limited prices are skyrocketing making every process more complicated withworse where will the next consignment come from says expresso the cost of just basic everyday products will increase by 20 to 30 within the next few days making them inaccessible to thousands of low income families isabel jonet the long term president of banco alimentar contra a fome food bank against hunger told the paper eduardo oliveira e sousa president of cap the portuguese agriculture confederation concurs we are in a situation of food emergency that i have never seen before with the increase in adds expresso even so warns oliveira e sousa and this will lead to speculation and new price increases he added the stocks of some products like flour for making pastas are so low that in one or two months we may have to bring in rationingcorn is the major component in animal feed as jaime piçarra secretary general of the portuguese association of animal feed industries told expresso just in the last week it goes without saying these increases will reflect in prices to the consumer pork is the meat most consumed by portuguese it is likely to increase more than 30 in price in the next few days david neves of the portuguese swine production federation it was david neves who explained the sector only has enough animal feed until april after that we won t have anything to feed the animals with which means people would have to go without meat if urgent measures aren t taken we will see the return of hunger to portugal he warned of course the vegetarians and vegans reading this story will see hugely positive aspects to a meat shortage but even their lifestyle choices will be impacted by the rising costs of raw materials fuel and food production when it comes to milk it s not even possible to estimate how much prices will rise when diesel has already just increased by 0 15 cents and is due to rise another 0 20 cents feed is more expensive the situation is becoming dramatic carlos neves of the association of portuguese milk producers adds again thousands of consumers may think this won t affect me the market for oat almond soy etc milk is booming but it too will be affected by all these increased costs particularly when it comes to transportation the tragedy is that in portugal a little country with an enormous heart as so many ukrainians have been discovering in these recent horrible days these are not people who would even think of buying oat milk it is a great deal more expensive than normal milk they survive on the cheapest of staples bread vegetables meat mainly pork chicken rice potatoes they will have to do enormous gymnastics to survive said isabel jobnet meaning financial juggling not the other kind they simply won t have the margins to be able to survive there will be children going to school without breakfast and to bed without dinner she said and into this perfect storm of imperfections comes a new factor a significant influx of desperate refugees with young growing children who need proper nutrition this is a powderkeg said ms jonet apart from the increase in demand we will be getting from portuguese families the social support system could collapse isabel jonet has been working in food banks since 1994 she is not a sensationalist she really does know what she is talking about expresso s article has seen the government quick to respond there is to date no reason to anticipate a possible shortage of food said a statement from the ministry of agriculture whose minister maria do ceu antunes may well not be continuing into the next executive and who has never been seen as a good choice at the best of times the statement continued that the ministry together with other governmental areas is carrying out permanent monitoring and follow up regarding national food supply to this end it met last 28 february with the monitoring and evaluation group for goods supply conditions in the agri food and retail sectors due to market dynamics and no risks of a breakdown in supply have been reported a new meeting with this group is scheduled for march 21 regarding concerns over cereals for animal feed imported from ukraine there are other alternative sources for these raw materials south america and north america with which operators are already in contact said the statement there are also ongoing operations and contacts with new suppliers such as south africa cereals destined for human consumption such as bread wheat are mainly imported from france and this circuit is stable and consolidated with regard to edible fats the supply has been assured with emphasis being placed on the availability of national olive oil whose current season has seen record production as for remaining food products the ministry of agriculture stresses that there is no pressure with regard to their availability either through national production or within the framework of the european single market the ministry says that both nationally and at european level groups are already in place to monitor the food supply situation between member states and associations representing production industry and marketing in order to assess and resolve any constraints in supply chains later today the standing committee on plants animals food and feed paff meets to this end and a council of agriculture and fisheries ministers of the european union is also scheduled for 21 march as is a meeting of the expert group on the european food security crisis preparedness and response

march marks the fourth consecutive month that shopify inc tsx shop nyse shop has declined on the tsx at writing shopify stock trades for 718 64 per share down by 18 since its february 28 levels its valuation now translates to a 66 42 decline from its all time high valuation in november 2021 the question is will shopify stock crash and burn or is it an undervalued stock with strong long term potential today i will take a closer look at what is happening with the battered and bruised tsx tech company to help you make a more informed investment decision regarding shopify stock what is happening after its most recent decline shopify has become the worst performing stock in the first few months of 2022 shopify s market capitalization has dropped down to 90 50 billion it is a surprising development considering the strong demand for its services and the crucial role it plays for the e commerce industry march 3 2022 saw shopify announce a partnership with apptricity this is a texas based inventory management company and the partnership is slated to offer shopify users better usability with its comprehensive platform shopify s users can integrate shopify storefront with apptricity s enterprise inventory management application solution offered by apptricity s omni the news is positive and it logically cannot be a reason to trigger a sell off frenzy in shopify stock with no major shopify specific news that could hint at any negative sentiment the ongoing decline could be attributed to the broader tech sector sell off the global financial market looks increasingly volatile since russia invaded ukraine on february 24 2022 uncertain environments like this typically trigger a sell off in growth stocks for several years canadian tech stocks have been some of the strongest growth stocks phenomenal growth and devastating decline shopify became one of the most attractive stocks on the tsx when it debuted on the stock market roughly seven years ago between its debut on may 22 2015 and its all time high on november 19 2021 shopify stock posted 6 024 in capital gains the rapid growth was exaggerated due to the onset of covid 19 and the new normal the world is slowly moving into a post pandemic era and that development was bound to slow down shopify stock s growth rate however there are no indications of problems for the company s operational expenses the tech meltdown that began in december has continued to erase most of shopify s gains on the stock market russia s invasion of ukraine rising inflation rates and the pace of tightening monetary policies have made the situation more uncertain for stock market investors an environment like this makes investors wary of investing in growth stocks they are likelier to veer toward safe haven assets as a hedge against uncertainty foolish takeaway as more investors continue to run away from high risk assets during this time shopify stock could decline further in the coming weeks regardless these short to medium term factors are unlikely to impact shopify s long term outlook the company expects its revenue growth rate to slow down in 2022 but its top line growth might still beat analyst expectations the demand for e commerce services is not going anywhere anytime soon it might be better to purchase shopify shares at these discounted rates and hold them long term
some essential history putin s 2007 munich speech the 2014 maidan coup d etat and it truly was the most blatant coup in history zelenskyy and munich 2022 huge military buildup biowarfare in addition the us pentagon had no less than eight perhaps as many as 30 top secret bioweapons research labs across ukraine testing dna of some 4 000 military volunteer s confirming that components of biological weapons were being developed in ukraine in close proximity to russian territory whatever prompted the action by russia on february 24 2022 had to have been far more serious than cnn or other controlled western media are telling us about the author f william engdahl is strategic risk consultant and lecturer he holds a degree in politics from princeton university and is a best selling author on oil and geopolitics exclusively for the online magazine new eastern outlook the decision by the russian president to order military action in neighboring ukraine beginning february 24 2022 has shocked many myself included the question at this point almost two weeks into military action by russian and other forces inside ukraine is what pushed russia into what western media portrays as unilateral unwarranted war of aggression a public threat by ukrainian president and comedian volodymyr zelenskyy on february 19 during meetings with top level nato officials and others in the annual munich security conference provides a largely ignored clue to moscow actions in addition more recent reports of numerous us pentagon bioweapons labs across ukraine add to the background threats did moscow believe russia faced a literal do or die reality the current conflict in ukraine has its seeds in the 1990s and the us backed collapse of the soviet union during high level two plus four treaty talks pertaining to germany s reunification in 1990 talks between us secretary of state james baker iii and then soviet leader mikhail gorbachev along with france the uk and the west german government over unification of germany baker gave a verbal promise that nato would not move one inch to the east to threaten former soviet territories in return for the ussr allowing german reunification within nato recently putin cited the 1990 baker agreement to justify russian demands that nato and washington give binding legal assurances that ukraine would never be admitted into the nato alliance washington until now has categorically refused to do so at the 2007 annual munich security conference as the bush cheney administration had announced plans to install us missile defense systems in poland romania and the czech republic to guard against rogue states such as north korea or iran russia s putin delivered a scathing critique of the us lies and violation of their 1990 assurances on nato furthermore both ukraine and georgia were candidates to join nato following us led color revolutions in both countries in 2003 4 putin rightly argued the us missiles were aimed at russia not north korea or iran in his 2007 munich remarks putin told his western audience it turns out that nato has put its frontline forces on our borders and we continue to strictly fulfil the treaty obligations and do not react to these actions at all i think it is obvious that nato expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the alliance itself or with ensuring security in europe on the contrary and what happened to the assurances our western partners made after the dissolution of the warsaw pact where are those declarations today no one even remembers them putin added but i will allow myself to remind this audience what was said i would like to quote the speech of nato general secretary mr woerner in brussels on 17 may 1990 he said at the time that the fact that we are ready not to place a nato army outside of german territory gives the soviet union a firm security guarantee where are these guarantees that was 15 years ago by november 2013 an economically corrupt and floundering ukraine under elected and also very corrupt russia had agreed to cut the price of russian gas to ukraine by 30 and to buy 15 billion of ukraine bonds to ease the kiev financial crisis at that point on 21 november arseniy yatsenyuk the man selected by washington s victoria nuland and kiev ambassador geoffrey pyatt together with then vice president joe biden launched what were called maidan square protests against the yanukovych regime backed by us ngos yatsenyuk became prime minister in a hand picked us run regime hand picked by nuland and biden among others later in december 2014 in an interview with a russian newspaper george friedman of stratfor a private firm consulting to the pentagon and cia among others said of the us led february 2014 kiev regime change russia calls the events that took place at the beginning of this year a coup d etat organized by the united states he was boastful in the interview that kiev coup regime proceeded after february 22 2014 to wage a war of extermination and ethnic cleansing of russian speakers in eastern ukraine led to a large degree by a private army of literal neo nazis from right sector the same ones who ran security in the maidan square and launched a reign of terror against russian speaking ukrainians battalions were formed of neo nazi mercenaries the azov soldiers even sport open ss runes as its logo in 2016 the office of the un high commissioner for human rights ohchr accused the azov battalion officially upgraded to a regiment in january 2015 of committing war crimes such as mass looting unlawful detention and torture today nuland is biden s under secretary of state for political affairs responsible for ukraine and russian affairs she is well aware of who the azov battalion are on february 19 in munich ukrainian president zelenskyy made his threat to deploy nuclear weapons on ukrainian territory he expressed this as his unilateral revocation of the 1994 budapest memorandum although ukraine was not a signatory of the agreement two days later on the evening of february 21 putin made his speech recognizing the sovereign independence of the donetsk and lugansk people s republics he explicitly referenced zelenskyy s munich nuclear weapons pledge this is not empty bravado putin stressed in his speech on march 6 moscow state news agency ria novosti quoted a senior russian svr foreign intelligence source with details on a secret ukraine project reportedly with vital covert western support it was there judging by the available information that work was underway both on the manufacture of a dirty bomb and on the separation of plutonium ria novosti quotes the source the primary bomb research facility was located at the national scientific center kharkov institute of physics and technology as of this writing reports of fierce fighting underway between russian forces and neo nazi ukrainian azov fighters who reportedly are planning to blow up the research reactor site and blame it on russia the battle for control of the large zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is also apparently part of the attempt to conceal the illegal ukraine bomb project it now begins to become more clear that putin had serious reason to react at the ukraine nuclear threat a ukrainian nuclear missile within six minutes of moscow would present existential danger whether ukraine were in nato or not there was more ukrainian press reported a year ago about new western built de facto nato naval bases in ochakov and berdyansk as modern infrastructure facilities capable of receiving ships of all types the media boasted and if we combine with georgia and turkey the russian federation will be blocked ukrainian military experts boasted once russian soldiers moved to secure the evidence the us embassy in kiev deleted previous mention of the sites from its website and ukrainians reportedly moved to destroy the lab evidence ukrainian labs in kharkiv and elsewhere were operating in cooperation with the united states stocks of such weapons were being secretly stored in direct violation of international conventions a full month before the russian military action on 24 february in ukraine independent biowarfare researcher dilyana gaytandzhieva obtained documents detailing according to the leaked documents all volunteer deaths should be reported within 24 h in ukraine and 48 h in georgia she details the human experiments which include testing for antibodies against some 14 pathogens including crimean congo hemorrhagic fever borrelia species lyme disease and others according to the documents the labs in ukraine and georgia are part of a pentagon 2 5 billion defense threat reduction agency dtra biological engagement program which includes research on bio agents deadly viruses and antibiotic resistant bacteria on march 6 in a statement to the official ria novosti in moscow major general igor konashenkov spokesman for the russian ministry of defense stated they had received documents he noted in the course of a special military operation the facts of an emergency cleansing by the kiev regime of traces of a military biological program being implemented in ukraine funded by the us department of defense were uncovered added to this evidence of nuclear and bioweapon wmd placements inside ukraine in recent years the west nato member countries have been pouring billions of dollars of military equipment including anti tank weapons and explosives into ukraine while zelenskyy rumored by opposition to be in hiding in the us embassy in warsaw a war that rapidly could go nuclear or beyond the question is whether this years long provocation by washington and nato of russian national security via ukraine is aimed at destroying the viability of russia as a sovereign nation and military power is it a calculated move to use sanctions against russia to cause global collapse and energy crises food shortages and worse all to advance the davos 2030 great reset agenda blame it on the evil putin and russia while blackrock and the financial powers reorganize the world it is too early to tell but
how to invest in an isa a simple four step guide to profiting from stock markets around the world cash isas are three times more popular than their stocks and shares equivalents stocks and shares isas offer the opportunity to protect or grow their wealth we explain who should consider getting one and how to go about it cash isas are by far the nation s favourite type of individual savings account over three times more savers pay into one every year than the number of people paying into stocks and shares isas but while cash isas are a great introduction to tax free saving they only get you so far to stand any chance of protecting or growing wealth savers must consider stocks and shares isas too best foot forward to stand any chance of protecting or growing their wealth savers must consider stocks and shares isas the two have similarities as with cash isas all returns made inside a stocks and shares isa are tax free money can be put it or taken out easily and a maximum of 20 000 can be saved in one every tax year the key difference is that while money in a cash isa is held in a savings account earning interest money in a stocks and shares isa is invested in shares funds or investment trusts and earns investment returns rather than interest although shifting from cash to stocks and shares can be rewarding it takes a change in mindset cash isa savers enjoy the comfort of knowing precisely what is in their account from day to day it is determined by what they put in and the interest rate they are earning in contrast the value of a stocks and shares isa fluctuates from hour to hour this volatility means there is no point in investing in one if you think you might need to withdraw your funds within five years if that volatility and the possibility that you could lose more than you gain makes you uncomfortable then stick with cash which isa is right for me the options for savers and investors 1 pick the perfect isa provider for you first you need to decide which stocks and shares isa provider to go for there are many each catering to a different type of investor some offer ready made portfolios with these you simply decide how much risk you are comfortable with and how many years you have to invest and the isa provider will recommend a portfolio to fit this profile the more risk the higher chance of stellar returns but also of losing money if the stock market takes a turn for the worse they can be ideal if you re just starting out and don t want to make too many decisions other isa providers allow you to choose your own investments this can be a good option if you are interested in investing and want to build your own portfolio of funds pick a provider that will suit your needs not just now but also over the next few years as your investing progresses this is money s guide to finding the best and cheapest stocks and shares isa 2 check how much you will be paying in fees it is vital to keep a lid on charges which come in an array of forms you will pay fees to the investment platform through which you hold your isa as well as charges to hold particular funds these are in addition to other costs for example for buying and selling funds and shares compare fees on different platforms before you pick one as structures vary some charge a flat fee regardless of how much you hold in an isa others charge a percentage of the sum you hold which one is right for you will depend on how much you invest also compare how platforms rank for customer service if you need help or something goes wrong you want to know your provider will be on hand with support and answers 3 start slowly with small sums if you fill your stocks and shares isa with a range of investments from all over the world and in a variety of business sectors you are less exposed if the fortunes of one country or one type of investment go belly up if you are ready to dip your toe into the water but not to jump in head first you could consider investing a small sum every month that way you don t risk putting a large lump sum into the stock market just before a downturn you ll be investing through the good times and the bad furthermore you can always put money into both a cash and a stocks and shares isa in the same tax year however you cannot put money into more than one of each type of isa and the total cannot be greater than 20 000 most stocks and shares isa providers have a list of their recommended funds whilst this is no guarantee of future performance it can provide some reassurance for new investors 4 build an isa around trusts and funds with thousands of funds investment trusts and stocks to choose from it can be hard to know where to start if you need a steer most stocks and shares isa providers have a best buy list of their recommended funds there is no guarantee these will perform better than others but they do offer the reassurance that experts have trawled over them in hours of due diligence four ideas for your isa here are a few ideas that may suit both those who are just starting out as well as the more seasoned isa investor fidelity index world working out which sectors and regions are likely to perform well is hard even when the economy is motoring along smoothly but in this era of uncertainty it s tougher than usual so rather than picking between them why not buy the lot a global tracker fund allows you to invest in thousands of companies all around the globe they are also low cost so you minimise the risk of your returns being eaten up by fees fidelity index world fund is one for just 0 12 per cent a year you get access to a small slice of thousands of companies your returns essentially mirror the average performance of stock markets all across the world beware that with global tracker funds you may have a bigger exposure to big us tech companies than you realise city of london past performance is never a guarantee of future returns nonetheless there is something reassuring about putting money in an investment company that has been around for more than a century investment trust city of london was launched in 1891 and has raised its annual dividend every year since 1966 it invests in large uk companies and pays a chunky annual dividend income with a 57 year record of raising payouts vanguard lifestrategy some investors want to reduce risk with a fund holding assets other than shares vanguard s lifestrategy funds offer a mix of bonds and shares under one bonnet bonds are a more defensive asset than equities providing a regular income and less price volatility in its five funds equity exposure ranges from 20 to 100 per cent you pick the ratio of shares to bonds to suit your appetite for risk f c investment trust like city of london f c has been around since time immemorial 1868 it s the oldest investment trust listed on the uk stock market its name doesn t give much away but it is a global fund managed by bmpo global asset management although more than half of its assets are in the us it has key holdings in all major markets diversification lies at its core it will never shoot the lights out compared to some racier funds or trusts when it comes to performance however it can be a super foundation stone for any isa investment portfolio

a member of the u s national committee on u s china relations speaking at a defence conference in ottawa provided her views on beijing s motivations and outlook for its relations with russia china s threats against taiwan are not being overlooked amid the war in ukraine given their similarities to how russia prepared for its invasion in this context a member of the u s national committee on u s china relations speaking at a defence conference in ottawa provided her views on beijing s motivations and outlook for its relations with russia cynthia watson dean of faculty and academic affairs with the washington d c based national war college said she believes the biggest takeaway for beijing from the russian attack is that there can be a great deal of international cooperation under u s leadership to stop actions that go against the rules based international order and the chinese communist party ccp has to weigh those factors when considering acting against taiwan cynthia watson dean of faculty and academic affairs with the national war college in washington d c participates virtually at the ottawa conference on security and defence 2022 on march 11 2022 screenshot via the epoch times taiwan remains the last issue from the chinese civil war that many people within the party believe the party absolutely cannot back down on because if they were to do so it would show the vulnerability of the party watson told an audience of primarily military personnel during a session titled understanding china on march 11 at the ottawa conference on security and defence 2022 however she sees the possibility that there is a timeline that xi jinping believes he must fulfill and it being a relatively short one for the reunification of taiwan with the mainland the fact that there are voices in taiwan more aggressively calling for the island nation to wholly reject unification probably is one of the things that is most alarming and potentially setting aggressive timeline into effect she added asked what risk beijing might face if the world turned against chinese manufacturing should it invade taiwan similar to the global sanctions imposed against russia watson pointed to the 1989 tiananmen square incident which resulted in international sanctions the business community came back to china just 18 months later and began providing technology and investment she said noting that it s actually after 1989 that we see some of the greatest growth in china fuelled by outside investment and fuelled by outside technology and the movement of capital to china she added that she believes beijing is counting on the same sort of short term memory if the world were to turn on them on taiwan but reiterated her view that the party doesn t believe it has a choice on taiwan however she said questions abound regarding what timeline xi has in mind for taiwan and it s a matter of reading the tea leaves given the impenetrable nature of understanding ccp decision making

will particularly help with lethal form of cancer caused by the body s kras gene sotorasib is proven to shrink tumours in half of non smoker lung cancer patients thousands more nhs patients with a deadly type of lung cancer are to benefit from a drug hailed as the biggest treatment breakthrough in decades sotorasib is a daily tablet that has been proved to shrink tumours in half of patients with advanced lung cancers not caused by smoking this type which affects one in eight lung cancer sufferers is caused by a mutation in a gene known as kras it is a particularly lethal form of cancer for which current treatments are effective in only about ten per cent of sufferers in a healthy body the kras gene controls proteins that play a part in normal cell growth but mutated kras genes allow the proteins to instruct cells to grow out of control causing a cancer that is notoriously hard to treat thousands more nhs patients with a deadly type of lung cancer are to benefit from a drug hailed as the biggest treatment breakthrough in decades stock photo such is the mutated gene s cancer causing power that medics have labelled it cancer s death star the same mutation can also be found in some cases of pancreatic and bowel cancer raising hopes that sotorasib will be able to help many more patients in the future previously sotorasib was available only nhs patients as part of a limited trial but now anyone who needs it expected to be at least 600 more people a year are set to benefit after the nhs negotiated a discount with us drug maker amgen this drug is one of the most exciting breakthroughs in lung cancer in 20 years says professor charles swanton an expert in genetics and lung cancer at the crick institute in london and it will improve survival for patients with limited options nearly half of those on it see their tumours shrink compared to less than ten per cent with some drug treatments lung cancer is britain s third most common form of the disease with an estimated 48 000 new cases every year weird science rare eye colouring that signals danger a copper coloured ring in the eyes is a warning sign of a rare genetic condition wilson s disease affects one in 30 000 people and means the body is unable to remove excess copper which is found in trace amounts in a wide range of foods while the metal is necessary in small quantities to make red blood cells form collagen and keep the immune system healthy wilson s disease causes it to build up to toxic levels in the liver brain and eyes sufferers can develop a golden brown copper ring around the edge of the iris the coloured centre of the eye while it does not damage the eyes it can lead to liver problems and even death if left untreated advertisement smoking or a recent history of smoking is by far the biggest cause but the disease can still strike those who may never have touched a cigarette in the 1980s scientists first identified that a significant proportion of these cases were caused by a mutant form of the kras gene but solving the puzzle of how to combat that defect has taken decades of intensive research sotorasib also know by the brand name lumykras works by blocking the action of the proteins that trigger cancerous cell growth this helps to stop or at least slow its spread currently the drug is being offered only to patients who have exhausted all other treatment options and where the cancer has spread elsewhere in their body but the hope is that sotorasib may in future be used at an earlier stage potentially boosting long term survival rates dr noor tariq a specialist at the clatterbridge cancer centre in liverpool says results so far have been amazing the next question is will it work even better if used earlier on in the treatment process that s being looked at in trials now and we are excited to see what they show nicky peel 53 from brecon in powys was one of the first lung cancer patients in the uk to be given sotorasib she was diagnosed with the disease in 2017 after spending months waking up feeling like i couldn t breathe it was such a terrible shock you never think it is going to happen to you she says i was told my life expectancy at that point was about 12 to 18 months nicky an it manager underwent gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by treatment with a drug to turbo charge her immune system to fight the cancer cells but in january 2018 scans showed that the cancer had spread to her spine and hips while the lung tumours had kept growing she then asked her oncologist at the nhs velindre cancer centre in cardiff if she could be put on sotorasib your amazing body it had long been suspected that men had thicker skin than women but men probably just didn t care now it s been proved to be 25 per cent thicker and the difference is testosterone the male sex hormone which increases the growth of skin tissue as well as muscle and hair women have testosterone but in much smaller amounts men s skin also contains more collagen than women s which gives it a tighter appearance but men s skin is also far more oily than that of women as they produce twice as much sebum the oil that makes skin greasy advertisement i d read online that the drug was having good results in american patients with my type of cancer says nicky her consultant applied for funding on compassionate grounds and nicky began taking the drug in december last year initially just half the recommended eight tablets a day in case of liver damage one of its recognised side effects a few weeks later when her liver tests came back clear she was switched to the full dose i was hoping it would just stabilise my cancer but when i had my first scan in january it showed the tumours on my lung had shrunk by about a third says nicky i couldn t believe it it was too good to be true none of my previous treatments managed to shrink the tumours and apart from some slight bone and muscle pain i was free of side effects nicky admits she has no idea if the drug will continue keeping her cancer at bay but she adds it is giving me more precious time to spend with the family and is allowing me to live my life in full not just to survive i want to be able to have a good quality of life and sotorasib is helping me do that

your worst nightmares can too says anne hathaway she tells cole moreton how along with the hit films happy marriage and oscar win she also had an army of haters anne hathaway anne hathaway lives in a gorgeous apartment overlooking new york s central park with her husband producer and jewellery designer adam shulman and their two children which i catch a glimpse of during our zoom chat i should have turned the camera to a blank wall she half jokes then adds more seriously i count myself as very fortunate because i was not born into this i hope that helps me have a perspective on it and appreciate it anne 39 was born in brooklyn new york raised in new jersey and has been a hollywood star since the age of 17 she made her name in movies such as the princess diaries won an oscar in 2013 for les misérables and is now about to appear with jared leto in a stunning new apple tv series called wecrashed in a neat example of art imitating life she plays a real life woman who seems to live a similar kind of manhattan life not too far from anne s apartment and who also has a husband called adam the adam thing is kind of weird but our place is a rental they bought theirs wecrashed is based on the true story of charismatic adam neumann an israeli born entrepreneur who persuaded investors to put billions into his office space sharing start up wework before seeing it all come crashing down it s hard to believe it all happened says anne but it did i guess that s what makes it a great story anne bloodied but unbowed in her new series wecrashed neumann sells a vision of happy millennials sharing workspace playing ping pong drinking free beer and falling in love time and again he boasts that wework is bigger than it is to attract major investors all until the stock market rumbles the truth while he s doing this he s living like a rock star and blowing millions anne is superb as his wife and ally rebekah paltrow neumann a cousin of gwyneth who brings style yoga and a breathtaking ambition to do nothing short of raise the consciousness of the human race i ve thought a lot about it and i believe despite the results rebekah had good intentions and meant every word she said i just don t know that it s possible to save the world and make a s ton of money doing it i hope they ve been able to learn and grow from this the neumanns were forced out of wework in 2019 when an attempt to go public failed and over 2 000 employees lost their jobs the couple were paid a fortune to leave and some people are understandably still furious with them we don t judge them that wasn t the point but we don t let them off either anne says when asked if the series was too soft on the neumanns and it s true wecrashed is a complex drama that doesn t shy away from the harm they caused i m intrigued by the whole idea of fake it till you make it of saying something that you intend to be true which if it works out nobody questions it s only when it doesn t work out that we examine it has she ever faked it herself when i auditioned for brokeback mountain the last question the director ang lee asked me was can you ride a horse i said yes and i couldn t she smiles i thought to myself i have a few weeks to learn that s not very long is it ha no but i am very determined took it very seriously worked very hard and learned how to ride well enough to do the film but when i said that to get the part was it true it was not did i see a path where it could be true yes i did what s the line when does that become a con it s a good point one of many she raises during our time together sorry hold on someone just came home can you give me one second i agree and when she returns she says it was jack i just wanted to give him a kiss before nap time jack is two and his big brother jonathan is almost six anne with her husband adam shulman as she sits i ask her about the words on the cushion that were revealed when she got up that read 100 that b h oh ha that was a birthday gift i m glad my friends see me that way something else that keeps being revealed when the sleeves of her breton style top push back is a small tattoo on her wrist i ask about the meaning she smiles my husband has a matching one she holds up her left wrist to show what looks like a w that becomes an m when it s upside down is she aware that it s both letters yes she laughs and it means many things the couple met through friends in 2008 and married in california four years later he s the guy for me she says i do my best to be the woman for him and he makes me feel all the time that i am actually we do our best for each other i m lucky and i know it luck is something she acknowledges a few times in our interview one of the luckiest breaks i had was being born into a family where acting wasn t feared but respected and valued says anne whose mother is also an actress though at the same time they saw first hand that it s not necessarily the most mentally healthy career for children she explains about her parents support of her early interest in acting i mean what exactly is a mentally healthy career for children so they enrolled her in drama classes and kept her from pursuing professional roles until she found an agent herself with their blessing at the age of 14 she quickly booked a national commercial for the magazine better homes gardens it s worth mentioning i didn t book anything for a year and a half after that she says with a laugh i m intrigued by the whole idea of fake it until you make it it was just a few more years until her big break starring in the princess diaries mentioning it now still makes her smile that movie is one of the greatest gifts of my life and always will be it s really something to think how loved it is after all these years it makes people feel comfort it makes people feel safe it makes people laugh and they keep discovering it even now and i was so cared for by garry marshall marshall was the film s director who took her under his wing he watched out for me and was so lovely and made me feel like i had worth i never experienced anything a 17 year old shouldn t experience nor was i ever put in a position that a 17 year old shouldn t be put in that shouldn t make you lucky and it shouldn t need to be said but it was and it does over the next decade anne enjoyed both commercial success and critical acclaim starring in blockbusters such as the devil wears prada brokeback mountain and the christopher nolan batman franchise as well as being oscar nominated for her work in the 2008 jonathan demme directed film rachel getting married however the peak of her career so far was of course winning an oscar for her role as fantine in les misérables in 2013 it s such a rare thing to experience so many unlikely things had to come together for that to happen and with a part that was so personally significant because my mother also played fantine once too it s wild the topic of winning an oscar should be a light subject but in anne s case it just isn t in 2013 she experienced a vicious wave of bad press extreme by anyone s standards i gently ask her about this time starting with the first thing she said when she won winning an oscar for her role in les misérables 2013 it came true she says with a wistful smile remembering the opening line of her speech yeah people still tear at that one it was a strange moment such an achievement but also it would have been lovely if it could have been less complicated i felt like it was the only thing i could say that held the whole experience most people interpreted one half of that phrase accurately and the other half dreams aren t the only things that can come true hence those carefully chosen words said at the podium it was my way of acknowledging both realities the high and the low the best i could at the time without directly talking about it because i was counting on there being a time when the negative part was in the rear view so i ve kept working and trying and growing just kept on doing what i love and working on myself and that s led me here and it seems to be true the past decade has seen her become a mother work again with christopher nolan in the sci fi epic interstellar star in both the commercial hits the intern opposite robert de niro as well as alongside cate blanchett and sandra bullock in ocean s eight working with those legends showed me just how much more i have to learn i was deliriously happy to be there she also gave an award winning performance in a one woman show called grounded in 2015 at the public theatre such a cool experience but so damn lonely a longtime champion of equality and human rights she is currently realising a lifelong dream of becoming a un women goodwill ambassador a post which began in 2016 so is she in a new place i think so yeah let s go with that i am she certainly appears to be she seems relaxed and surrounded by her family happy with her lot what a relief to know first hand that you can grow that s huge it takes work and it s not like that ever stops but how fortunate to be in a place where you believe because there can be a way through painful things it s not lost on me the gift

i saw this earlier today and it spoke to me i found the political cartoon at this link the artist yeva hart who is ukrainian can be found at this link i want to start by highlighting three things then i ll put the read more tag in and get to the more update sort of stuff below the jump the first is this long detailed interview of stephen kotkin kotkin is one of the most prominent historians of russia as well as a specialist in and biographer of stalin he was interviewed by david remnick at the new yorker i want to highlight this portion of kotkin s remarks remnick s questions are in bold this is the thing about authoritarian regimes they re terrible at everything they can t feed their people they can t provide security for their people they can t educate their people but they only have to be good at one thing to survive if they can deny political alternatives if they can force all opposition into exile or prison they can survive no matter how incompetent or corrupt or terrible they are you know in the russian case navalny was arrested this is alexey navalny putin s most vivid political rival who was poisoned by the f s b and is now in prison yes he was imprisoned in the run up to the invasion of ukraine in retrospect it could well be that this was a preparation for the invasion the way that ahmad shah massoud for example was blown up in northern afghanistan right before the twin towers came down you have the denial of alternatives the suppression of any opposition arrest exile and then you can prosper as an élite not with economic growth but just with theft and in russia wealth comes right up out of the ground the problem for authoritarian regimes is not economic growth the problem is how to pay the patronage for their élites how to keep the élites loyal especially the security services and the upper levels of the officer corps if money just gushes out of the ground in the form of hydrocarbons or diamonds or other minerals the oppressors can emancipate themselves from the oppressed the oppressors can say we don t need you we don t need your taxes we don t need you to vote we don t rely on you for anything because we have oil and gas palladium and titanium they can have zero economic growth and still live very high on the hog there s never a social contract in an authoritarian regime whereby the people say o k we ll take economic growth and a higher standard of living and we ll give up our freedom to you there is no contract the regime doesn t provide the economic growth and it doesn t say oh you know we re in violation of our promise we promised economic growth in exchange for freedom so we re going to resign now because we didn t fulfill the contract what accounts for the popularity of an authoritarian regime like putin s they have stories to tell and as you know stories are always more powerful than secret police yes they have secret police and regular police too and yes they re serious people and they re terrible in what they re doing to those who are protesting the war putting them in solitary confinement this is a serious regime not to be taken lightly but they have stories stories about russian greatness about the revival of russian greatness about enemies at home and enemies abroad who are trying to hold russia down and they might be jews or george soros or the i m f and nato they might be all sorts of enemies that you just pull right off the shelf like a book we think of censorship as suppression of information but censorship is also the active promotion of certain kinds of stories that will resonate with the people the aspiration to be a great power the aspiration to carry out a special mission in the world the fear and suspicion that outsiders are trying to get them or bring them down those are stories that work in russia they re not for everybody you know many russians who don t buy into that and know better but the putin version is powerful and they promote it every chance they get kotkin s description above is about putin s regime in russia but step back a bit and think about that description in general then think about the states in the us that have either a complete gop trifecta at the state level control of the governorship and majorities if not super majorities in both chambers of the state legislature and states where the gop has a super majority in the state legislature giving them veto override power over their democratic governors and thereby effective control of their states despite the democratic governors sounds familiar doesn t it especially when this one party control has gone on for so long that they ve also managed to capture the state district appellate and supreme courts if the shoe fits much much more at the link above so do click across as it is well worth your time the second item i want to draw your attention to is this twitter thread apparently there have been three more letters from an alleged fsb insider while the tweet thread author believes he s validated that this is the same guy as the author of the first letter i posted about last week and that belingcat s christo grozev validated as legit just keep in mind that this could all be a combination of truth disinformation misinformation and agitprop i ll be adding on to this thread as i receive further details but we can get started this info has been cross verified from multiple sources fsbletters theracecardriver igor sushko igorsushko march 11 2022 here s the link to sushko s site where he has translations of all the letters released so far the third thing i want to highlight once again is that the ukrainians must be able to hold to the north west and east of kyiv russia keeps throwing more military power west and east of kyiv in a bid to possibly surround and penetrate the city the map shows the approximate russian red and ukrainian blue positions and axes of attack in the battle of kyiv as of march 12 2022 pic twitter com skdpzpo4mm the kyiv independent kyivindependent march 12 2022 there s two different reasons for this kyiv is the geostrategic center of gravity in putin s whole reinvasion and war on ukraine as i ve written if he can take it then he will immediately bring in quislings like yanukovych install them in place of the legitimate ukrainian national kyiven oblast and kyiven municipal authorities to sign official looking but bogus documents capitulating to all of putin s demands kyiv is also the conceptual or contextual center of gravity in putin s informational warfare campaign against ukraine even if he took all of eastern and southern ukraine and a chunk of northwestern ukraine but kyiv holds he can t claim victory and the reason for this is that the alternative history and mythology that he has embraced that he has promoted that he wrote that long boring essay on last year places kyiv at the center of his bullshit narrative about the origins of russia as well as for his own mythology that he is somehow a 21st century version of vladimir the great the leader of the kyiven rus who founded what would eventually become ukraine as long as kyiv holds he will be unable to claim the geostrategic and the conceptual center of gravity that is the objective of his war on ukraine so whatever the costs the ukrainian defenses in the towns villages suburbs and bedroom communities to the north east and west

higher especially in government controlled areas the past week has seen numerous attempts to move civilians out of surrounded or occupied areas through green corridors all over the country the towns and villages around kyiv being no exception but as in many other parts of the country russian forces have selectively violated these corridors either firing on the evacuees with indirect fire weapons

research and decided that the oaks was the best fit for her mom the place was always spotless clean she said they were so good with the residents williams visited her mom at the oaks a few times a week they d play scrabble or dominoes and watch little house on the prairie or the price is right on sundays williams brought her mom back to her home in battle creek and did her hair sometimes they d

jack anderson pastor of the church of god of prophecy in battle creek the church hammons faithfully attended before her dementia diagnosis she was always involved asking about our children and how we were doing when the pandemic brought williams weekly visits to a halt in march 2020 she said she never worried about how the staff was caring for her mom williams was able to visit through the window she would use her cellphone to call the landline in her mom s room they would talk from opposite sides of the glass of course when winter came that was a bit impossible she said but when the temperature was enough where i could go even for a few minutes i would do that the pandemic was hard on her mom williams said because dementia made it difficult for hammons to understand why she needed a mask from williams perspective the staff did what it could to prevent coronavirus infection but once covid 19 got into the facility it was an uphill battle for a time williams and her husband weighed whether it would be better to move hammons into their home in any nursing home when something like that goes through there s nowhere to run and nowhere to hide she said you re kind of like a

her through the window it was really cold williams said i didn t know if she would pass away later in the day or how long and so i told my husband she seems at peace and so we went home less than 15

new york cnn business walgreens and other retailers have swapped out the clear fridge and freezer doors at thousands of stores instead adding opaque doors with ipad like screens showing what s inside some customers really really aren t into it the screens which were developed by the startup cooler screens use a system of motion sensors and cameras to display what s inside the doors as well as product information prices deals and most appealing to brands paid advertisements the tech provides stores with an additional revenue stream and a way to modernize the shopping experience but for customers who just want to peek into the freezer and grab their ice cream walgreens wba risks angering them by solving a problem that shoppers didn t know existed the company wants to engage more people with advertising but the reaction so far is annoyance and confusion cooler screens fridge doors shown at a walgreens in bridgeview il on february 7th 2022 courtesy henry b why would walgreens do this one befuddled shopper who encountered the screens posted on tiktok who on god s green earth thought this was a good idea the digital cooler screens at walgreens made me watch an ad before it allowed me to know which door held the frozen pizzas said someone on twitter another echoed walgreens nobody needs tv screen replacing doors in your cooler aisles stop retailers are eager to add new experiences to their physical stores but many consumers aren t eager to change their habits and they certainly aren t used to watching freezer display ads people really appreciate their routines they re not always seeking excitement said julio sevilla an associate professor of marketing at the university of georgia who studies consumer behavior digital screens he said can add uncertainty and physical barriers to a simple and literally transparent process reaching into a glass fridge sevilla doesn t believe consumers are looking for novelty when they visit a grocery store we all love to get into a supermarket and know exactly what we re getting i know also exactly where things are for this type of utilitarian related setting people like their certainty and simplicity big name stores still walgreens wba and cooler screens are pushing forward walgreens wba began testing the screens in 2018 and has since expanded the pilot to a couple thousand locations nationwide several other major retailers are launching their own tests with cooler screens including kroger kr cvs cvs getgo convenience stores and chevron cvx gas stations i hope that we will one day be able to expand across all parts of the store said cooler screens co founder and ceo arsen avakian in an interview with cnn business currently the startup has about 10 000 screens in stores which are viewed by approximately 90 million consumers monthly according to the company avakian said the company aims to bring its digital displays to a broad range of retailers including those in beauty consumer electronics and home improvement a walgreens spokesperson said in an email that walgreens is committed to exploring digital innovation in effort to deliver new and different experiences for our customers the spokesperson said the screens add value because they give customers relevant product information to help them decide what to buy and that walgreens is evaluating the pilot to decide whether to expand further moment of truth though not all of walgreens customers are fans cooler screens concept has attracted prominent brands like coke ko pepsi pep nestle nsrgf kraft heinz khc and monster mnst it s raised more than 100 million from backers including microsoft msft and verizon vz cooler screens ceo avakian said he developed the concept after watching in store customers whip out their phones to find product information and reviews traditionally in store advertising has been limited to options like signs promotions and prominent placement on shelves but cooler screens targeted digital ads deliver at the moment of truth avakian said right as consumers decide which product to pull out of the fridge brands can place ads spread over multiple freezers ones that display products nutritional labels or ads triggered by weather or time of day an ice cream company might want to run ads when it s hot outside while a coffee brand could hit the morning rush the setup aims to help stores add high margin advertising revenue to offset their core low margin retail business companies pay cooler screens to run screen ads and retailers get a cut there s a big movement in retail right now to create what s called a retail media network which taps into all the ways brands can interact with that retailer digitally said chris walton a former vice president at target who runs the retail blog omni talk this wasn t a problem cooler screens says 90 of consumers it has surveyed prefer its digital screens to traditional fridges and that the displays provide sales lifts for stores walgreens did not comment on that but beyond the confused social media posts the tech has also attracted misinformation and conspiracy theories politifact last month debunked a viral facebook video that claimed walgreens refrigerators are scanning shoppers hands and foreheads for the mark of the beast avakian insists the tech is identity blind and protects consumers privacy the freezers have front facing sensors used to anonymously track shoppers interacting with the platform while internally facing cameras track product inventory some customers have expressed frustration with the experience people aren t sure whether to tap the screens or talk to them the items on display don t always match up with what s inside because products are out of stock henry brewer who recently encountered one of the digital screens at a walgreens in chicago said the technology felt very in your face and intrusive we see advertisements literally everywhere and now i have to go see it on the cooler he said it doesn t just seem necessary and i think it s a turnoff to the consumer when this wasn t a problem to avakian it s simply an expected growing pain cooler screens plans to educate customers about the digital displays and launch features like voice recognition so shoppers can ask about prices or item locations this is the future of retail and shopping avakian said
otunba michael olasubomi balogun the founder of first city monument bank fcmb in this interview on the occasion of his 88th birthday talks about the many facets of his life aspirations and fulfilment from an initial training as a lawyer and a parliamentary draftsman the octogenarian evolved to be a man of many firsts first nigerian to single handedly set up a stockbroking firm and establish a merchant bank femi adekoya writes when you started out as a young entrepreneur many years ago you had some ambitions have your businesses exceeded your expectations it makes me humble as i have always said god is my guide and consummate supporter i started out as a stockbroker and with due appreciation to my god i was the first nigerian to single handedly set up a stockbroking firm just as i was also the first nigerian to set up a merchant bank i call it the grace of god let me tell you one thing a very well known nigerian who runs a financial institution in fact a conglomerate once came to me and said sir you hardly speak for one or two minutes without referring to your god and i smiled and said you have said it all let me tell you a secret all the businesses i have established the good lord had suggested to me and i have always been a pioneer i trained as a lawyer subsequently the government of the then western region trained me in the british parliament to be a parliamentary draftsman when ultimately the government of nigeria in fact the leader of the central bank decided to set up a development bank and brought in the world bank as their partner i was just in my place when a very good friend gamaliel onosode may his soul rest in peace came to my house i was then living in glover road ikoyi and said mike there s this development bank being set up by the government and the world bank i am sure they will need a legal draftsman to be drafting agreements given your background and the fact that you seem to be multifaceted in your different interests i think this could be a situation that will open your eyes to so many things he asked me to apply for that job and i did when we were called for an interview there were about 25 lawyers i didn t know what it was all about but being a lawyer and draftsman something just occurred to me i had a boss in the federal ministry of justice he called me and said i pray you get the job you re going for because it will catapult you beyond your expectations to heights that you do not expect i said sir it s just a bank but he said no it s a development bank and they have all sorts of branches so many lawyers came for that interview and out of 25 i was picked and for the life of me i didn t know anybody on the panel the chairman who is now my mentor chief chris ogunbanjo so impressed about my performance that he telephoned a neighbour of his mr t k seiko a lawyer said that your lagos friend the lagos boy subomi is very brilliant he was easily the best of the lawyers and we are going to recommend him so in my early 30s i got another big job in a financial institution the nigerian industrial development bank nidb the institution was multifaceted and among many other things they were also interested in what was happening in the capital market capital issues and stockbroking it was a small subsidiary of the firm and because of my divine gift of multi tasking and being inquisitive i got there and i was made a lawyer and secretary but i started trying to see what else i could be involved in and the stock exchange excited me not long after that the nibd decided to send me to the world bank in washington and also to wall street in new york and i felt it was an opening there i met distinguished lawyers who were heading stockbroking firms i met investment bankers who were there when i returned from my training i went to my bosses and said we should have an investment bank as our subsidiary to be raising money and doing other things it took them some time to accept i didn t know what their reason was maybe they thought i was ambitious but god has his ways of opening doors for me suddenly i was invited with another candidate a chartered accountant and the first nigerian woman to be trained as a chartered accountant the late mrs olutoyin olakunri and our bosses told us that both of you would be doing something about icon securities this was a secondary job for me because i was sitting comfortably as the chief legal adviser and company secretary it was advised that toyin being an accountant should first take the shot a few months later when i was given my own chance i arrived in the office one day and toyin who was very close to me walked in and said subomi i am resigning i said why she said i would be telling you she had hardly left when my telephone rang and my boss silas daniel who was the group managing director said subomi would come and see me i went and he said to me sit down mrs olakunri is leaving us and you have to take that position as the head of the stockbroking subsidiary somehow fortune smiled on me again these are part of the reasons i always refer to my god one day i called my wife and said i want to resign we have just built my first prestigious house in victoria island which is now founder s place a big branch of fcmb i said i must resign so i went to a friend s office and asked can you type me this letter it was my letter of resignation i went to the office very early and straight to my boss secretary and asked is oga in she said yes he s in i said let me see him the secretary said he s too busy i called the secretary by her first name bisi i want to see my boss this morning when she saw my mood she was a bit scared so she went in to inform my boss and emerged to say you can go in sir i went in and i said to my boss you made use of me to do this and do that but you wouldn t want me to head the subsidiary business what you have not done for me i am sure my god will do it i threw my resignation letter on his table and that was the end of my career in nidb i decided to set up a stockbroking firm what was interesting was that my family and i have an altar or chapel for domestic prayers one evening my wife said you didn t hear what your son said and i said no my wife said he wanted you to set up your own company and i looked around and said oh yea of little faith how can a nine year old boy have an idea of me setting up a company i went into the boy s bedroom he was already covering himself i said to him babajide what did you tell your mummy he said daddy i pity you why don t you set up your own bank i went back to my altar and prayed i said oh my god please show me the way as i prayed i started singing a chorus in yoruba which says oh my god show me the way don t let me get into a wrong thing show me the way of what i will do well which many christians sing in churches especially in my part of nigeria that was the simple prayer and when i thought i ve had enough i rose up somehow the tune of another song came into my mind you cannot fail you cannot fail because of jesus you cannot fail i was amazed so i went straight to my study next to my bedroom i didn t say a word to my wife i was the lawyer that drafted the memorandum and article of association of the company where they just refused me to head so i took it adapted it deleted icon and made all the subsequent amendments the following morning i told my wife i am going to set up a company type this for me my wife had started as a confidential secretary she was worried she said you have a good job she even told my mother but my mother said let s keep praying for him did you ever consider setting up a law firm as a lawyer not at all i didn t think of setting up a law firm and i never practised my path was ordered by god into what he wanted to do so all i need is to continue thanking my god you had a friend who went into politics and eventually became vice president you also mixed with people in government why were you not also attracted to politics no i think i was being divinely propelled i was close to baba awolowo and to many people in government including the attorney general who opposed my licence because he said so in their council meeting if you give that man licence an election is coming he s going to support awolowo i have written all these in my book god knows the best every year in commemoration of your birthday you always have a project to tell god thank you this year what is that iconic project you want to give to humanity yes that s true first of all i want to thank my god for sparing my life but please forgive me i like to do my things quietly the good lord will continue to spare our lives i have not finished with what god has directed me to do for my neighbours i am here to serve my god and my neighbours out of the blues about two years ago the university of ibadan decided to name their conference centre and hotel in my name i have even forgotten what i did there i think i am subdued by the overwhelming manifestation of god s love and all i want to be doing is praising and thanking my god for letting me do what i have been doing and one of the things i am always afraid of is when i talk too much they would say he is always calling god as if that god belongs to him alone but i have my reasons my whole life is a manifestation of exceeding love and i have dedicated myself to serving him for the rest of my life i pray to god he is not inviting me yet when you established the bank were there challenges that made you feel would i succeed in this and if there were how were you able to navigate the thorns hmm i have a childish habit any time i want to do something i would write it down and put it inside the bible in my altar i would be asking god just as i said when i wanted to start everything my god shows me the way don t let me make wrong choices i would just throw myself into the arms of my maker and tell him to help me my whole life is a wonder to me and i am saying it again i only had a degree in law but the ideas are just coming when you talk of fcmb i was the first to conceive the idea of a group structure we had what i call a financial supermarket i had a stockbroking company a capital issues company and then we set up the bank itself and after that i had an asset management company pension management etc all the companies i call them first city group and recently we changed the name to fcmb group to be honest with you i admit that i am not the one doing all this the ideas just come to me and i don t understand so i am spending the rest of my life just thanking my god and doing anything that the good lord will guide me to do as regards challenges i will say no one is greater than god once you embrace your god whatever challenges you have would be subsumed in the divine achievements for example as i said earlier on when we wanted a licence someone said don t give it to him he is a friend of awolowo but i prefer talking about what god has done for me rather than telling the challenges and at 88 i am not tired i am still wearing suits like you young men because i believe the good lord still has a lot of work to give me to do so i have dedicated my life to serving him as a pioneer in this industry given what the economy is like now what do you think can be done i try not to talk about what somebody is doing right or wrong rather i spend my quality time praying for this country i tell you something whenever i kneel down to pray i first of all thank my god then i thank him for what he s done for my wife my family my children the fcmb group then to my neighbours and then ask god to bless nigeria that s the routine i go through every day i don t dabble into that because ultimately god does what he wants to do in fact when i was young i remember i wrote a paper which i gave to general ibrahim babangida about whether to devalue the naira or not i did it because it was like i received a vision today i can only pray that it shall be well with the country because it belongs to all of us do you see fintech companies as a threat to commercial banks every bank is expanding into different businesses quite a lot of banks have diversified into pension funds management and technology has been a critical instrument in our case the capital market and normal banking will meet if you are trying to raise money from the capital market we have a company that handles that if you want to buy shares from the stock exchange we have a firm for it and if you want to go into real banking even mortgages even as we speak i read that our bank is trying to help people who want to get their own homes so we are doing everything that was why i said i conceived the idea of group structure and with a due sense of modesty i think i would be one of the people who first started the idea of group i called it first city group there are a lot of avenues a bank or a financial institution can go into and i am encouraging the younger bankers not just to limit their activities to core banking but to go into different aspects of financial services truth is that what i would call financial assistance to communities is very wide which may include what is today expressed as financial inclusion where technology has become the vehicle fintech companies are merely complimenting what the traditional institutions had first started fcmb recently i read in the newspapers for instance is asking people to come take money to build their own houses we re getting strong into pensions we re asking for assets to be managed for us we re trying to be financial advisers that was the idea i had i call it a financial supermarket any ingenious banker would not just stay in mundane banking for instance if you go on the streets of lagos you will see some locals selling dollars some institutions have institutionalised this and added it to their banking let me emphasise this there s no end to what you can do with financial services not just banking alone there is hardly nothing that is not within the financial services today which we generally call banking i started as a capital market man and i still recall people calling me colossus the grandmaster because i dabbled into many things i was always seen in the market the one thing i am thankful to god for is that he has always made me a multifaceted businessman young ceos should go beyond mundane banking they should extend their tentacles buy into other companies by acquiring their shares

lost near a remote stretch of highway about 80 miles west of st louis once stood a world renowned snake breeding facility renick reptiles where ben renick built his empire of serpents ben renick video welcome to the basement of renick reptiles we keep particular pythons blood pythons white lip pythons green anacondas sam renick ben had his first snake at a very young age and that become somewhat of a passion for him became a hobby to build into business and he was he was very good at what he did at the time of the murder sam and ben renick were living in separate houses with their families on a 70 acre spread sam renick we lived out there together and raised our kids out there together the we went fishing on the weekends and you know we were close ben and lynlee first met when they were teenagers they reconnected in 2011 says local attorney katherine berger katherine berger attorney they hit it off right away and their relationship got pretty serious pretty quickly i think they moved in together within the first year of dating lynlee had a son from a previous relationship sam says ben became a second father to the child in 2014 ben and lynlee decided to tie the knot sam renick they had a beautiful wedding it was beautiful a small family event it was very special ben and lynlee renick ben renick facebook soon they had a baby of their own a growing family to go with their booming snake breeding business katherine berger lynlee found ben s passion interesting she would work day and night helping ben with the snakes handling them cleaning them sorting them in 2016 they opened a second business ascensia spa in columbia missouri a longtime dream of lynlee who once worked as a massage therapist sam renick i know that when she started her spa business it s just something that she had always wanted to do that she you know that empowered her quite a bit by 2017 ben renick s snake business was wildly successful he was shipping his snakes around the world from the uk to japan and was travelling to reptile conventions across the united states ben renick was a young up and coming rock star in the reptile world said dāv kaufman ben renick facebook he was so successful ben realized that if he sold a portion of renick reptiles he could make some real money sam renick ben had planned on selling the majority of his ball python collection for from my understanding it was about a 1 2 million things were gonna be very good for my brother and and lynlee the couple had received their first payment of at least 200 000 but then ben was murdered peter van sant when you heard that he was dead what did you think might have happened to him dāv kaufman so the first question that i asked was how many snakes were missing a facility like ben s it unfortunately attracts a lotta bad people bad people that see these snakes not as these beautiful amazing creatures that they are but see them as dollar signs to understand the world of snakes that ben lived and worked in 48 hours spoke with ben s friend dāv kaufman who introduced 48 hours correspondent peter van sant to a reticulated python a snake ben was known for throughout the world because of how he bred them in captivity dāv kaufman holding snake ben loved these snakes because how can ya not love these laughs snakes i mean really when it comes down to it they re big they re beautiful they re personable dāv kaufman she s gonna go right over your shoulder and try to go on the cage behind you laughs let s see if i m right no she s gonna wrap around ya peter van sant it s my new scarf dāv kaufman there you go kaufman is also a snake breeder and a documentary film maker who also travels the world tracking rare and exotic reptiles for his youtube channel if you are afraid of snakes then everything you think you know about snakes is wrong said dāv kaufman who introduced 48 hours correspondent peter van sant to a reticulated python cbs news peter van sant with snake wrapped around him this is a first it is a remarkable sensation dāv kaufman it is investigators looked into the theory that ben s murder may have been a robbery gone bad but ruled it out no snakes were missing dave colbert says it made sense to look more carefully at those closest to ben dave colbert we definitely didn t want to exclude anybody from being a possible suspect i didn t know if sam was involved didn t know if lynlee was involved the day after his brother s murder sam renick was brought in for questioning sam renick i uh i don t know where to start missouri state highway patrol investigator ok and they also brought in lynlee missouri state highway patrol investigator do you have any questions for us lynlee renick what happened missouri state highway patrol investigator we don t know yet lynlee renick what i mean what do i do missouri state highway patrol investigator lean on your friends and family but soon enough those same friends and family would have reason to question everything they thought they knew about lynlee renick sam renick the lynlee that we knew back then was very sweet kind however there was there were other sides of her that we didn t know who wanted ben dead with law enforcement discovering that ben renick had not been killed by a snake and quickly ruling out the possibility of a robbery gone bad sam renick had one major question sam renick who would ve wanted ben dead a missouri state highway patrol detective had the same question when he spoke with ben s wife lynlee in the days after ben renick s murder police questioned his wife lynlee evidence missouri state highway patrol investigator could you see anybody you know being upset with ben to the point to where that may happen lynlee renick no both lynlee and sam were cooperative in their initial interviews missouri state highway patrol investigator are you willing to submit to a shotgun or not shotgun a gunshot residue sam renick yeah anything you want you got sam says he understood why police would first focus on them and he told investigators he could never imagine lynlee being involved sam renick i didn t think that lynlee would have been capable of murder like that lynlee also agreed to a gunshot residue test but in her one on one interview with a detective lynlee made a startling claim saying that sam might have had a motive to kill his brother missouri state highway patrol investigator was there any family issues lynlee renick um like between sam and ben yeah at issue lynlee said was ben s plan to possibly sell the property where they all lived she claimed sam was upset about it ben had inherited the property after another tragedy on the renick family farm just five years earlier the suicide of ben and sam s father frank renick sam renick ben found him he came and got me and we went there together and it was a tough day frank renick shot himself in 2012 after being implicated in a multimillion dollar ponzi scheme involving fraudulent stock certificates sam renick there s a lot of people that lost a lot of money you know due to my father sam and ben renick san was questioned and was ruled out as a suspect after cooperating fully with investigators sam renick facebook unaware that lynlee was implicating him sam wondered whether ben had been killed in an act of revenge against their father sam renick we were concerned however that you know someone could have been upset enough to have waited and done something like this but that theory never took off and sam who had tested negative for gun residue on his hands was ruled out after cooperating fully with investigators sam renick i provided them you know everything i had my cell phone the shirt off my back my alibi as to where i was when the murder happened i i gave a polygraph as highway patrol detectives continued their investigation the reptile community stepped up to help ben s wife and children they held an online auction of donated snakes raising more than 40 000 peter van sant you guys banded together and you got thousands of dollars to lynlee to help her during this time of crisis dāv kaufman tens of thousands yea we raised tens of thousands of dollars to help lynlee and the kids peter van sant because you felt she was a victim dāv kaufman that s correct but that supposed victim had a startling confession when lynlee spoke with detectives again just 11 days after ben s murder missouri state highway patrol investigator so have you been talkin to anyone or did you have a relationship lynlee renick aric missouri state highway patrol investigator how often did you guys hook up lynlee renick like maybe once or twice a month lynlee admitted she had been unfaithful missouri state highway patrol investigator it was just just sex lynlee renick yeah missouri state highway patrol investigator did he think the same way lynlee renick yeah detectives checked that man s alibi and cleared him of any suspicion investigators then interviewed ashley shaw one of lynlee s employees and a close friend who she had confided in which may have been a mistake ashley shaw i mean i m sure that you know she was having um an affair missouri state highway patrol investigator uh huh ashley shaw a couple affairs actually ashley shaw the manager at ascensia spa said that lynlee had also been seeing another man named brandon blackwell who she had met on a dating website she said lynlee was hooking up with brandon before ben s murder ashley shaw i know brandon was like really a short time before that along with lynlee s affairs investigators had discovered facebook messages between ben and lynlee they revealed that ben had found out the spa was losing money and that lynlee had lied to him about it ben sent a message to lynlee just hours before he was murdered ben s facebook message to lynlee no more lying no more keeping things from me no more not paying people and thinking it s okay to pay later four months after ben s murder lynlee was in front of cops again and agreed to take a polygraph exam missouri state highway patrol investigator ok how do you think you did lynlee lynlee renick i think i did well not exactly lynlee s polygraph test was a dismal failure missouri state highway patrol investigator so the results of the polygraph show that you failed the test when i asked you did you shoot that man you failed the test lynlee renick i can t explain why i just failed that but i didn t kill ben but investigators suspected she did and may have had help from yet another man in her life his name is michael humphrey an old ex boyfriend and ex con fresh out of prison on drug possession charges who she texted and called numerous times including on the day her husband was murdered lynlee renick was questioned by investigators six times she admitted being unfaithful to ben with at least two other men messages between the couple show that ben was suspicious the relationship was struggling evidence lynlee renick he was coming in for massages officer yeah but the thing is that that right there is very suspicious lynlee renick cries it appeared lynlee was close to breaking but she continued to deny any involvement dozens of times lynlee renick i don t have anything to do with this missouri state highway patrol investigator there is so much circumstantial evidence against you in this case it s mind boggling but lynlee s gunshot residue test had come back negative with no witnesses no murder weapon found or direct evidence linking her to ben s murder she left that interrogation room a free woman lynlee renick i need to go get my children missouri state highway patrol investigator i ll walk you out the investigation went cold for nearly three years until unexpectedly someone came forward with everything missouri highway patrol investigators were looking for a jailhouse tip the boas are long gone the pythons packed up and the snakes are in new homes the reptilian paradise turned crime scene now a vacant frozen field eight fatal shots unanswered sam renick i wasn t sure what to think unaware that investigators suspected lynlee ben renick s brother sam was left more than a little uneasy sam renick it was very very tough knowing that someone was out there that had essentially gotten away with murder i was concerned for my own safety and without an arrest serpent lovers were also left rattled dāv kaufman so when the case went cold we would all contact each other asking if anybody had any information on what was going on it was frustrating it was frustrating to have all this time pass and not have a culprit in custody all dāv kaufman knew for sure dāv kaufman humans do things other than what you expect snakes do not and the most unexpected behavior came from the human closest to ben renick his widow lynlee sam renick we wanted to be as understanding as possible however in time when she refused to talk to us or allow the kids or even receive my brother s belongings we knew something was wrong you know the lynlee that we knew back then was very sweet kind she was outgoing however there was there were other sides of her that we didn t know said sam renick ben renick facebook in fact just weeks after ben s murder with her spa business failing lynlee had sold the family property closed up shop and left town in a hurry beth mayberry so like one day she was there and the next day just left and then never came back today beth mayberry works at that same location but back then she was just one more true crime buff in columbia missouri riveted to a case without a conclusion peter van sant how much is this renick case talked about around here among beth mayberry it s a lot it s a lot peter van sant and what do people say what do they think beth mayberry crazy it s crazy and people did start to wonder maybe lynlee did it maybe she had someone do this it did become a question a question without an answer until january 2020 when cops followed up on a jailhouse tip missouri state highway patrol investigator we re investigators with highway patrol i m here because you used to be dating lynlee brandon blackwell that s correct dave mckenna outta nowhere comes what investigators would think is a godsend journalist dave mckenna was following the case for defector media that was about to change fast for investigators missouri state highway patrol investigator your dad gave me a call today and said that you wanted to talk to us brandon blackwell yeah dave mckenna journalist just lays out the whole story and it is very detailed it was brandon blackwell the man lynlee met online the lover she was hooking up with the very week ben was murdered dave mckenna her husband is freshly dead body is still warm and she s found another warm body only a year and a half after ben was killed blackwell and lynlee had a child together but lynlee alleged blackwell had become threatening and they had broken up lynlee got an order of protection and he was then charged with violating that order and stalking her charges he denies he was jammed up in jail and looking to make a deal brandon blackwell my main concern is getting outta that cell missouri state highway patrol investigator now you re coming to us when you re in a pickle so brandon blackwell right blackwell s tale began weeks before ben renick was shot dead when he says lynlee and spa employee ashley shaw whipped up a toxic shake for ben brandon blackwell he was given a protein drink one night that was laced full of enormous amounts of narcotics and somehow lived through it but the plan was for that to be the last day of his life ashley shaw told investigators she felt sorry for lynlee renick and wanted to help her they plotted to kill ben pictured by giving him a poisonous protein shake laced with 15 percocet pills ben was very sick but survived he had no idea he was poisoned ben renick facebook a poison potion served to a husband by his wife brandon says lynlee confessed that and much more to him brandon blackwell my information is out of the horse s mouth missouri state highway patrol investigator ok so when pills failed to kill brandon says lynlee turned to one time boyfriend michael humphrey brandon blackwell they drove to the farm he had gloves he had a firearm the plan was for him to do it they get there he hands her the gun and says he doesn t feel comfortable doing it s something she s gotta take care of she walks in with a gun and just shoots him a bunch of times and according to blackwell lynlee s spa employee ashley shaw was once again involved dave mckenna brandon blackwell told the police that ashley was in on it intimately from the start of the planning almost three years after ben renick s murder lynlee renick and her ex boyfriend michael humphrey were arrested for ben s murder montgomery county sheriff s office the cold case was blown wide open on january 16 2020 cops made their moves lynlee renick and michael humphrey were arrested charged with the murder of ben renick loved ones and friends never saw it coming peter van sant what was that moment like for you dāv kaufman disbelief i thought they got the wrong person sam renick it took us years to find out that lynlee was lying and that she was living a double life sociopath if you look that up lynlee s picture ll be sitting right there with it but what motive could lynlee have to murder the man she had built so much with some say it was as cold blooded as a cobra money sam renick lynlee stood to gain millions from the death of my brother between the life insurance the sale of the snakes and the family farm that she would inherit it was significant still investigators needed someone to flip they arrested ashley and fast let her know exactly what her future reality might look like missouri state highway patrol investigator to ashley shaw during questioning now is the time you re either on team lynlee or you re on team missouri and team lynlee s going to jail they re going to prison for first degree murder in exchange for leniency ashley turned on her one time boss starting with the toxic ingredients in lynlee s venomous smoothie ashley would say that lynlee told her ben had abused her in exchange for leniency ashley shaw turned on her one time boss evidence ashley shaw she asked if i could get any um thing any prescription pills or anything in the amount that could um help her kill him and so i got her um perc it was percocet i m pretty sure and there was um i think 15 of them according to ashley after the shooting lynlee claimed michael humphrey was the triggerman but she says a few days later lynlee changed her story ashley now claimed that lynlee confessed to being the killer ashley shaw and she said oh no once we got there i i was fine to do it and so he handed me the gun and i did it missouri state highway patrol investigator after the murder she ever seem remorseful ashley shaw never missouri state highway patrol investigator she ever seem sorry ashley shaw never no but as it headed to trial lynlee s legal team insists that michael humphrey was the real shooter and they argue the state s case isn t based on truth but on the fearful coerced testimony of ashley shaw tim hesemann defense attorney you re either on team lynlee or you re on team missouri and team lynlee is going to jail peter van sant how would that impact somebody a woman like ashley shaw do you think tim hesemann well if ashley shaw ever wants to leave that interview room for the rest of her life or for the indefinite future she s going to change her story katherine berger defense attorney it was only after that threat that she changed her story and implicated lynlee renick who pulled the trigger lynlee renick i don t know what happened with him i don t know sam renick it took a lot of time to just process you know the lies that we were given by lynlee in late 2021 sam renick was bracing himself for the trials of his brother s alleged killers sam renick my biggest concern was keeping my composure during the whole time first up lynlee s old boyfriend michael humphrey the prosecution said lynlee fired the gun and that humphrey was in on the plan dave mckenna prosecutor said he was in on the plotting he provided the weapon he helped knock off her husband but that murder weapon had not been recovered humphrey s defense argued that humphrey had been lured to the snake farm by lynlee who claimed she wanted protection when asking ben for a divorce lynlee had then surprised him and pulled out a gun and shot her husband dave mckenna they painted him as kind of a fawning suitor of this pretty blond petite snake salesman the jury didn t believe humphrey s story of being an innocent spectator after deliberating for just five hours jurors convicted him of first degree murder sam renick lynlee is a manipulator and i truly believe that he was manipulated into where he is right now then facing life behind bars michael humphrey changed his story lynlee s trial attorneys tim hesemann and katherine berger peter van sant he decides to flip why does he do that katherine berger he s convicted of first degree murder after a jury trial he agrees to cooperate with the state in the hopes that he might be able to parole out eventually humphrey now admits that he provided the gun that lynlee used to shoot her husband katherine berger and he tells them where they can find it which is in his girlfriend s mother s attic with the murder weapon in hand jurors in lynlee s upcoming trial would have to answer one unresolved question who pulled the trigger kelly king prosecutor the defendant lynlee renick shot her husband ben eight times killing him we re going to come back and ask that you to find her guilty ben and lynlee renick sam renick facebook the prosecution painted lynlee as cold blooded as one of her husband s snakes a killer who shot ben and then went about her daily routine as if nothing had happened kelly king she goes to the school picks up her two children and drives them back to the place where she knows she is going to find their father s dead body because she killed him tim hesemann lynlee is being deceptive to ben the defense counters by saying that while lynlee lied and cheated on ben that doesn t make her a killer tim hesemann she is not planning a murder she s planning a divorce they pointed the finger at the man already convicted of murdering ben renick tim hesemann michael humphrey took it upon himself acting completely independently took ben s life himself but but lynlee s employee and confidant ashley shaw now the prosecution s star witness swears michael humphrey and lynlee were full partners in crime ashley shaw michael was going to come to the spa and they were going to go together to her her house his business to kill him at home or at at work shaw says after the murder lynlee returned to the spa not for a massage but to wash away her sins kevin zoellner prosecutor so lynlee goes back there and she tells you to do what ashley shaw to give her a shower and she asked me to scrub her body and her hands really well then ashley tells the jurors what lynlee told her about what really happened at renick reptiles the day ben was killed ashley shaw she said that michael got too nervous or didn t want to do it and so he handed her the gun and she actually killed him she said that she put the gun to his back and shot him several times but the defense claims ashley shaw just like michael humphrey made up this story in order to avoid life in prison tim hesmann how are you able to be so calm when you re being questioned about murders that you evidently claim to be so involved in how is that ashley ashley shaw i don t know tim hesemann there are so many aspects of ashley shaw s story that

would settle on something considerably less judge crane punishment for murder in the second degree at 13 years punishment for armed criminal action at three years thirteen plus three years for ben renick s life jurors never said why they chose such a seemingly light punishment but six weeks later sam would tell the court that the sentence itself was an injustice sam renick i beg the common person to watch the trial again and ask themselves if my brother s life was worth only 16 years sixteen years is why i m here today he would recount that hideous day that changed everything sam renick the web of devastation travels far and spared no one sam renick she put the children through this experience here i am covered in my brother s blood attempting to comfort the children despite them

2022 for years bitcoin buffs who were questioned by skeptics about the value of the cryptocurrency would respond by saying just wait wait until inflation hits and people look to park their savings in a stable digital asset that won t lose its value wait until war breaks out and authoritarians start seizing assets and imposing capital controls on their citizens wait until big banks and tech companies start censoring dissidents for their political views then you ll see why we need a stateless decentralized anonymous digital currency more than most cryptocurrencies bitcoin was seen by many of its libertarian leaning fans as a kind of doomsday insurance a form of digital gold that would be a source of stability as the world grew more chaotic and unpredictable well chaos is here in the united states inflation is rising at the fastest pace in decades and the vix the so called fear index used by wall street to measure expected volatility in the stock market has risen more than 80 this year last month canada s government responded to the threat of a protest convoy of anti vaccine truckers by threatening to freeze their bank accounts drawing calls for a type of money that isn t subject to government seizures russia s invasion of ukraine was met with brutal sanctions that have tanked the ruble and devastated the russian economy and many u s companies have pulled out of russia making it nearly impossible for its citizens to access their bank accounts use credit cards or even post on social media in other words this is a perfect storm of economic and geopolitical events that should theoretically be great for bitcoin but bitcoin hasn t boomed in fact even as wall street analysts contemplate the possibility of nuclear armageddon crypto prices have fallen steadily bitcoin prices are down 10 in the past month and ether the second most popular crypto coin is down roughly 15 day to day usage of cryptocurrencies isn t picking up the way you d expect either bitcoin trading volume rose after russia invaded ukraine but it has remained relatively flat since suggesting that people aren t rushing to trade their rubles and hryvnia ukraine s currency for digital currencies russian oligarchs don t appear to be using crypto to evade sanctions en masse either despite initial fears that they might granted crypto has not been totally absent from these events in canada some truckers raised money through crypto donations while others had their crypto wallets seized as part of the crackdown and ukraine s government has reportedly raised nearly 100 million in crypto donations and it s still too early to say with certainty that crypto won t be useful in later stages of the russian conflict but bitcoin doesn t seem to be playing a central role in our global unraveling so far which raises the obvious question why not one possibility is that crypto is still too confusing and too difficult for normal people to use especially during a war internet access is spotty in many parts of ukraine and reports have suggested that even the country s elites are struggling to convert their assets into crypto another possibility popular among skeptics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that bitcoin is still too volatile to be useful as a hedge against economic and political instability the bitcoin and crypto communities have been selling a false narrative all these years that bitcoin is supposed to be a safe haven from the traditional financial markets said jimmy nguyen president of the bitcoin association a cryptocurrency trade group his group promotes a bitcoin spinoff bitcoin sv that sees itself as a more useful version of the cryptocurrency bitcoin is doomed nguyen argues because it can be slow and expensive to process transactions making it less useful for paying for things and so a lot of bitcoin supporters have had to come up with this argument that it s meant to be a reserve asset he said kevin werbach a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania floated a different theory bitcoin s earliest and most vocal adopters he said tended to be libertarians who saw cryptocurrency as a kind of insurance policy against hyperinflation and government corruption but the more recent price swings in the crypto markets attracted a surge of speculators who viewed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mainly as investments and cared less about their political implications there s a tremendous amount of rhetoric around bitcoin in particular that suggests that it s predominantly a means of escaping from the government issued fiat currency system he said and yet most of the activity according to basically every rigorous study that s been done is predominantly people speculating another possible explanation for bitcoin s underperformance which was floated by joe weisenthal at bloomberg is that chaos cuts both ways and that the same events that could be seen as good for bitcoin in the short term inflation sanctions geopolitical conflict could also be bad for bitcoin over the long term since they could draw the attention of regulators to whatever extent the canadian trucker story would be seen as bullish for bitcoin because it got people thinking about ways of making payments without regulated entities it s also bearish for bitcoin because it caught the attention of state actors who wanted to push back against such payments he wrote there are other explanations out there too sam bankman fried chief executive of crypto exchange ftx said on twitter that while he thought bitcoin would do better in a less stable political and economic environment he guessed that the discrepancy was partially related to the media s negative coverage of crypto headlines have been largely negative independent of actual content the last month in a reaction to statements from the industry which i think has posed significant headwinds he wrote but perhaps the most interesting view of crypto s usefulness during unstable times comes straight from ukraine s government on tuesday i posed a question about crypto to alex bornyakov ukraine s deputy minister of digital transformation since the russian invasion bornyakov and his team led by the country s digital minister mykhailo fedorov have been working around the clock to coordinate crypto donations for ukraine s army tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin ether and other cryptocurrencies have been sent to these addresses and the money has been used to buy military supplies including bulletproof vests and night vision goggles bornyakov who was speaking from an undisclosed location in ukraine on a video conference hosted by artificial intelligence company collective said that one advantage of using crypto to raise money was how quickly the funds could be disbursed in a situation like this where the national bank is not fully operating crypto is helping to perform fast transfers to make it very quick and get results almost immediately he said but bornyakov seemed wary of overstating crypto s importance to the ukrainian cause i don t think crypto is playing a major part bornyakov said but its role is essential in this conflict in terms of helping our army
the great mid 20th century american statesman dean acheson titled his memoir present at the creation the story of his role developing the institutions of a new international order after the cataclysm of world war ii the challenge today is not remotely comparable we are largely protecting the status quo from revanchist powers rather than writing on a blank slate yet the twin threat from russia and china requires new thinking especially in meeting national needs not necessarily addressed by the free market alone we must focus on maintaining a first class military winning the high tech race with china and reducing our vulnerabilities in the event of a war that disrupts supply chains and our access to key strategic materials and goods we need to restore the defense industrial base which has atrophied considerably we can t build enough missiles to replenish our stocks quickly enough in a conflict we can t build new submarines on schedule or maintain the ones we have in general the navy doesn t have enough capacity to repair its ships in peacetime let alone at war air force depots too are lacking all of this will require major new investment a model of the potential synergy of government and private industry in such areas is how elon musk s spacex has revitalized the u s space program for years nasa had come to rely humiliatingly and dangerously and expensively on russian rockets to get to space then it opened a competition for private companies to build spacecraft musk came out ahead and has shaken nasa out of its decades long bureaucratic mediocrity we need massive support for research and development the predicate for technological advancement robert atkinson of the information technology innovation foundation who has thought deeply about new strategies to make the u s more competitive notes that 60 years ago we led the world in government investment in r d but have become a laggard since then advertisement we need to deploy public policy to secure the supply chain for strategically important goods the pandemic put a focus on pharmaceuticals an emphasis lately for understandable reasons has been semi conductors an indispensable component of a modern economy even though the u s created the industry and still leads in chip design our share of global semiconductor manufacturing has fallen substantially from nearly 40 30 years ago to 12 now more importantly the u s doesn t manufacture the most advanced semiconductors with taiwan and south korea accounting for all of this production taiwan is obviously directly in the crosshairs of china and any supply from south korea could be disrupted if there s a war in asia u s companies aren t making their decisions about where to undertake manufacturing in the context of a level playing field foreign countries don t hesitate to provide government support to the fabrication of semiconductors on their soil beijing of course is a prime offender the chips creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors act that just passed the house spends 52 billion to support domestic production of chips and research and development surely some of these funds will be misallocated or prove unnecessary and the broader house bill includes extraneous spending but the legislation is directionally a welcome step away from unilateral disarmament it is much the same story with rare earths the 17 metals used in the manufacture of magnets essential to weapons and electric cars among other products the u s created the industry but china has leapt ahead since to place ourselves at the mercy of an adversary in such an important and sensitive area is insane and china knows the leverage it has it briefly blocked exports of rare earths to japan a decade ago and has issued similar warnings to the u s all of this has to be grappled with as we figure out how best to cope with a newly threatening geostrategic environment history is written backwards dean acheson wrote but lived forwards rich lowry is a syndicated columnist he is on twitter richlowry send questions comments to the editors

there are a host of republicans writing to biden that he should send planes to ukraine these people in washington are always quick to spill the blood of other people s children not their own i find it appalling that you do not hear a single world that zelensky should compromise on anything his refusal to let the two provinces be independent which was promised them in the minsk agreement back in 2014 is unnecessarily putting his entire country at risk for some antiquated theory of imperialism it was the ussr that drew the borders of ukraine it was not an independent country in itself until modern times instead zelensky is trying to drag the entire world into world war iii and make no mistake about it do that and you will find that china is partners with russia there is no doubt that russia should go ahead and nationalize all the foreign companies that left russia over this ukraine issue even warren buffet started dumping apple stock never in all my career have i watched corporations make such stupid decisions there is no such thing as temporarily closing businesses biden has destroyed the world economy with sanctions and confiscated the assets of private russians there will be no return because there is no way that russia can now yield to the demand of the west so they will never return and the assets left behind might as well be nationalized for the world economy as we have known it has been destroyed once biden removed russia from swift which refused to do so when asked by obama during 2014 and crimea that was the first blow to the world economy swift has undermined the entire world showing that it is no longer about supporting global commerce but it is just now a political tool china now has no choice but to move ahead on its own replacement hence that was the first blow to ending the global economy the second was biden confiscating the personal assets of russians rather than keeping this between governments this has created a waterfall crisis whereas the global economy as we once knew it has come to an end you cannot do business with the united states for they can invade a country never be sanctioned but if anyone else does what they do it becomes war whoever is making these sorts of decisions clearly has no sense of integrity history or international relations biden will be remembered as the man that began the decline and fall of the american empire

ukraine is a massive producer of wheat and there are fears that a protracted war could lead to a shortage of the crop used to make bread the nfu wrote to the scottish government calling for a moratorium on support scheme rules that take land out of food production it warned that the aftershocks of russia s invasion of ukraine would be felt well beyond the conflict concerns over future supplies have seen wheat prices rise significantly in the past week to help improve the resilience of food supplies nfu scotland said more land in scotland should be made available for domestic food production it said a moratorium on current scottish support scheme rules that take land out of production could temporarily release an area of land equivalent to 25 000 rugby pitches to grow cereals crops such as peas and beans or grass and forage for livestock but the nfus s intervention has led to a counter call by the food policy and environment charity nourish scotland not to ease rules around ecological focus areas he insisted there was no shortage of wheat with much of the current supply used for alcohol production or animal feed we are writing to you in the context of the shocking ongoing acts of aggression against ukraine and the resulting impact upon global food production this is clearly a tragic situation and all of us stand in solidarity and support for the people of ukraine said pete ritchie director of nourish scotland to mairi gougeon the rural affairs secretary the nfus is calling for the temporary suspension of greening rules specifically around ecological focus areas so that more land can be made available for crop production he said their argument is flawed for several reasons firstly there is no shortage of wheat with stocks at 37 of annual usage despite poor harvests in north america last year secondly we know that almost 80 of our cereal harvest in scotland is used for alcohol production or animal feed thirdly we know that tackling the climate and nature emergency is the only way to ensure long term food security the poor harvest in north america last year was caused by drought while this was counterbalanced by good harvests in india and australia as the climate becomes more chaotic the risk of multiple harvest failures in different parts of the world increases he added the real lesson of this crisis is that we must look at the resilience of our food and farming systems more than ever we must shift towards environmentally friendly farming practices efas were introduced to create wildlife habitats by encouraging the establishment of food sources such as insects and mice for birds like barn owls and kestrels farmers receive government subsidies for supporting efas mr ritchie told the herald lots of the efa options like under sowing and catch crops can actually increase food production in the long run as well as improving the soil field margins also provide a home for the bugs which eat the bugs which eat the crops so also help with sustainable food production a scottish government spokesman said this government is clear in its commitment to supporting farmers and crofters to produce more of our food more sustainably but we also acknowledge the need for change and to make sure that farming plays its part in cutting emissions mitigating climate change and restoring and enhancing nature and biodiversity as the impacts of russia s invasion of ukraine are being felt we understand some are advocating a temporary shift away from environmental measures towards food production he added we would welcome the opportunity to discuss with stakeholders about how we start to provide more food for people and livestock from our arable production while also delivering more benefit for biodiversity and nature the spokesman acknowledge any changes to greening this year affect farmers and crofters subsidy payments

the former employer of rey rivera is pushing back on his portrayal in netflix s popular unsolved mysteries reboot which raised questions about his involvement in rivera s 2006 death porter stansberry who has not spoken publicly about the case since the first days of rivera s disappearance told the baltimore sun that he was shocked and hurt by the show s insinuations the reason i ve never commented about rey s death publicly first and foremost is because i never thought there was any mystery about why or how he died stansberry who runs an investment newsletter business said in a phone interview in the unsolved mysteries episode mystery on the rooftop netflix examines the mysterious death of rey rivera who once called winter park home here he is pictured with his wife allison rivera rivera 32 was missing for a week before his body was found in a room at the base of the belvedere hotel having apparently crashed through the roof after a fall the episode hit netflix on july 1 and people interviewed for the show including rivera s brother rivera s wife and the retired baltimore homicide detective who worked the case in its first weeks said stansberry refused to cooperate with police and instructed his employees not to talk to detectives the episode never accuses stansberry of foul play but viewers were clearly pointed to stansberry as a shadowy figure who existed off screen and might know more than he was saying it s completely untrue stansberry said of the claims i did everything i could to help he said including meeting with a detective in late june 2006 he had every opportunity to say this rivera s widow allison told the sun regarding stansberry previously not commenting they haven t spoken since june 2006 she said the fact is truly a mystery there s just no answers but a second friend brad hoppmann who said he knew rey rivera since childhood and remained close with him up until his death also believes the story has been twisted this is a real conversation the world can have about mental illness and help people get help when they need it hoppmann said and it turned into a murder mystery where they re accusing people of being involved netflix did not respond to repeated messages sent to its public relations department and the producers did not respond to messages sent through its website rivera went missing on may 16 2006 and a guest at his north baltimore home said he darted out and never returned three then co workers discovered a hole in a sub roof of the belvedere hotel in mid town and rivera s battered and decomposing body was found inside in unsolved mysteries episode mystery on the rooftop netflix examines the mysterious death of rey rivera top right who was once a water polo star at winter park high school in florida he is pictured here with his brother angel rivera top left his mother maria rivera bottom left his sister bottom center and his father the mystery of his death was covered in the media at the time and was the subject of a 2018 book an unexplained death the true story of a body at the belvedere by local author mikita brottman the show presents questions about how rivera could have accessed the building s roof while his family members say he was not suicidal and did not have any known mental illness his cellphone and glasses were found on the roof relatively undamaged which a retired homicide detective who worked the case said appeared staged to him an engraved money clip he carried was never located rivera also left behind a note which contains strange comments including references to freemasons and stanley kubrick i stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets it says though police said the circumstances pointed to a likely suicide the medical examiner s office ruled the death undetermined saying there was not enough information to render a conclusion about whether it was a homicide suicide or accident rivera s case was featured as the first episode of the new season of unsolved mysteries and reached no 1 trending on netflix leading to discussion and speculation on social media stansberry said he has received death threats and his family has been harassed online he said he s even been questioned by friends and potential business partners it s horrific stansberry said you can t even imagine what it s like to tell people i had nothing to do with my friend s death stansberry and rivera went to high school together in california and were water polo teammates rivera an aspiring screenwriter had moved from los angeles with his wife to take what stansberry says was an entry level position at his company writing a financial newsletter called the rebound report when rivera went missing stansberry said he hired a private investigator offered a reward and personally helped look for rivera once the body was found stansberry said this week we were all sad and shocked by the fact that rey killed himself but once we saw all the facts and his financial pressures it wasn t much of a mystery in the show retired baltimore homicide detective michael baier and rivera s wife say that after rivera s body was found stansberry refused to return calls from investigators and put a gag order on employees to keep them from talking it s completely a lie stansberry said it s not a matter of opinion it s a lie he said only that employees were told to refer media inquiries to a spokesperson he said he personally spoke with a detective on june 23 2006 which was after baier was reassigned and when another detective marvin sydnor had the case sydnor did not return a call seeking comment tuesday but stansberry s attorney charles curlett said he had spoken with him recently allison rivera said tuesday that her information about stansberry not cooperating came from baier stansberry says the show is wrong that rivera worked for him at the time of his death and that rivera had left the job six months earlier on his own accord he resigned voluntarily no ill will he said he didn t want to write in the newsletter world anymore but didn t have a solid next move lined up stansberry said at the time stansberry s company was being sued by the securities and exchange commission for selling fraudulent stock tips to investors in 2002 before rivera joined the company after a trial in 2005 u s district judge marvin garbis ruled in 2007 that stansberry s conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud making statements that he knew to be false and issued a 1 5 million fine stansberry said there s no connection to those proceedings and rivera of particular interest in rivera s case is who placed a phone call to him that apparently precipitated him leaving his home allison rivera has said the call came from the switchboard of agora publishing and the specific caller could not be determined agora a global publishing company headquartered in baltimore has several subsidiary companies including stanberry s and at the time all calls routed through a main switchboard a police spokeswoman on tuesday said the call came from an owned subsidiary company of agora publishing but declined to provide additional details saying it was an open investigation stansberry asserts that while the call might have come from someone at agora he says rivera was doing freelance work for another agora subsidiary after leaving stanberry s firm it could not have come from his company every person in our company who had worked with rey was on the eastern shore at the time that call was made having a corporate retreat in st michael s stansberry said no one in my company was in town when rey disappeared the idea we were calling him from our switchboard is ridiculous stansberry said rivera had also asked him previously if he was in leadership of the freemasons which stansberry said he thought was a joke he said when rivera s family and friends were searching for him rivera s wife told him that the saturday before he went missing rivera was morose and would not get out of bed she told me she was very worried about his mental state at the time he disappeared stansberry said i m not the only friend rey approached and said things that were very odd allison rivera has said that her husband was in good spirits though anxious about work she said tuesday that she couldn t recall if she had such a conversation with stansberry hoppmann rey rivera s childhood friend said not long before his death rey repeatedly asked him about being a member of the freemasons and discussing the film eyes wide shut hoppmann who also worked for stansberry at one time but says they are not close said the week before his death rivera asked to be able to visit his top floor apartment in jersey city alone rivera had a key to the place but then returned it he was acting really really weird hoppmann said brottman the author of the 2018 book about rivera s death and a resident of the belvedere said the netflix show interviewed her for hours and that she told them the roof was easily accessed and not a difficult task to reach as the show asserted in her book she explores the various theories and concludes that rivera likely had a mental break and jumped from the roof i think if they d included my interviews it would have closed down a lot of speculation because it would have been obvious that a lot of avenues and angles had already been explored at length brottman wrote on reddit stansberry said the case is being sensationalized i think what s really sad about this is that there are people in hollywood who will do anything to craft a story to get attention even when it comes to destroying someone s reputation and trying to sensationalize the tragedy of a death of a 32 year old man stansberry said

people wait in a long line to enter a pharmacy in kyiv on march 9 2022 photo for the washington post by heidi levine kyiv ukraine the temperature was below freezing and the pharmacy line was way out the door but tetyana dagadaeva could not be deterred for days she and her 11 year old son oleksiy had been urgently searching for the insulin he needs to survive with his supply at home dwindling they soon would have no choice but to flee the country to keep him alive after two hours in the biting wind the wooden door swung open and a woman in a lab coat shouted out the message dagadaeva had prayed she wouldn t hear again they were out of stock my son s life depends on this she said somberly as she stepped away from the line her tears welled up as war continues to rage across ukraine it is disrupting the flow of crucial drugs and medical supplies when curfews are lifted each morning residents of cities nationwide rush to queue at pharmacies in hopes they ll find what they need on telegram groups volunteers help contact pharmacies for those who are unable to line up themselves but with pharmacy workers already stretched thin databases of available drugs are not always up to date some ukrainians like dagadaeva are struggling to find subsidized supplies including insulin at an affordable price they cannot afford to purchase small amounts out of pocket we need to scream about it not just talk she said her voice breaking the situation is really bad on a recent morning when tetyana rutkis 70 arrived at the pharmacy she runs in central kyiv she found no one waiting outside when the war started she said the lines stretched all the way to the park now there are fewer people because there are no medicines with no new shipments arriving from warehouses outside of kyiv word has gotten around that rutkis has to keep telling customers no no she doesn t have the antibiotics this patient needs no the blood pressure medication another asked for has already run out no her last box of insulin is long gone it always hurts having to say to the sick i can t help you she said when she handed out her last stock of insulin she said she felt powerless it s upsetting she added her voice trailing off it s painful three times now she has visited a branch of her pharmacy linked to a children s clinic that closed early in the war clearing their shelves and dumping piles of medications into plastic bags she ferries to her shop across town many of the medications are child size doses but that just means she has to tell adults to take more some customers fearing stocks will run out have bought up crucial medicines such as antibiotics leaving those who need them urgently in limbo i m worried about everything rutkis said every medicine can be critical you can t be selective about it at another pharmacy in a major hospital in downtown kyiv natasha bolishyk 48 has transformed a small couch in her office into her bed in normal times the pharmacy was open around the clock now with roads blocked outside of the capital most of her colleagues have fled or cannot come in to work her husband and son are serving in the territorial defense forces so for 10 days she has not returned home keeping the operation running for patients in need although a new supply was recently delivered calming medicines and blood pressure drugs which are in much higher than usual demand sold out almost instantly i try not to think about it because i have no idea how long i ll have to work like this she said it could be a long run a hospital employee in line recounted that she had been looking for aspirin for three days and her sister recently needed augmentin a common antibiotic that should be readily available she said but they couldn t find it anywhere and had to have someone ferry it across the country from the western city of lviv many ukrainian health workers remain in the country said carla melki the emergency coordinator for doctors without borders in the southern port city of odessa but supplies of insulin cancer drugs and materials required for dialysis are running low in some places and fighting has made delivering medications to front line cities increasingly difficult this is a problem of the last kilometers where you need to bring your supply in the open conflict area melki said we know where the needs are it s how to reach them sasha volkov the deputy head of the international committee of the red cross in mariupol recounted widespread shortages of food and medicines in the besieged city in an audio message shared on twitter all the shops and were looted five to four days ago he said people report varying needs in medicine especially for diabetes and cancer patients but there is no way to find it anymore in the city melki said aid and health workers in odessa which russia has not yet attacked are preparing for the worst scenario as russian forces make their way through southern ukraine doctors without borders brought in medical supplies last week to be ready in case the city becomes isolated the icrc has sent nearly three tons of insulin to odessa enough for 6 500 people for six months as well as enough insulin to dnipro for 9 000 people for three months the ukrainian ministry of health said in a statement this month that the government had delivered more than 440 tons of medicines and medical supplies worth more than 6 5 million since the start of the war medicines were sent to the central eastern and southern regions of ukraine for distribution among health care facilities serving people in areas most affected by the fighting despite efforts to keep crucial drugs in stock civilians in cities including kyiv are struggling to find what they need oksana avramenko 53 bundled up in a maroon coat and green hat stood in line for hours looking for a medication she needs to treat her breast cancer just before the war began last month tumors were removed from both of her breasts but when fighting broke out the lab handling her post surgical test results closed down and her chemotherapy was delayed now she is struggling to find the prescriptions nearby alyona ocheretnaya 58 waited in hopes the pharmacy would have a steroid inhaler she needs to keep her asthma under control for the past week she has been unable to resupply forcing her to cut her dose in half as an asthmatic i need a higher dose because of the stress she said after waiting in line for nearly two hours even with her shelves emptying fast rutkis still walks several miles to and from work in winter weather each day to dole out whatever drugs she can to those in need even if the russians enter kyiv she said i ll work and do whatever i can in order to help and these are not just lofty words she added it s something that comes from my soul bolishyk the pharmacist at a hospital in downtown kyiv said she hopes it won t come to that point the war will end soon not the supply bolishyk said i want to believe that with help from a freelance journalist working for the washington post in ukraine dagadaeva connected to an independent volunteer helping civilians navigate wartime pharmacy access and secured doses of insulin for her son that should soon be delivered to kyiv for now that means they can stay at home in the capital but when that supply starts to run out the difficult search to find more will begin anew o

revolutions in eastern europe and the ussr three decades ago gave hope to those societies that democracy and capitalism will lead to better life for a lot of people this did not happen â and their justified frustration now feeds reactionary anti democratic forces in countries like hungary poland russia or germany argues american researcher kristen ghodsee taking stock of shock social consequences of the 1989 revolutions a recent book ghodsee co wrote with mitchell alexander orenstein gives a comprehensive 30 year review of how the societies of 27 post socialist countries survived transition to market economy even three decades after the so called â shock therapyâ the transition continues to be a factor in eastern europeâ s political and social landscape argue ghodsee and orenstein â in the sheer magnitude of its impact on individual lives it can be compared to the other major events of the last century in europe the first world war the russian revolution the great depression the second world war and perhaps the 2019 coronavirus pandemic â using economic demographic polling data and ethnographic research the book traces a complex and ambiguous landscape although many in the region today can enjoy freedoms opportunities and standards of living unavailable to previous generations this is by no means true for all even after recovering from the deep economic recession of the 1990s these societies remained traumatised by the transition as evidenced by drops in life expectancy rise in alcoholism and dramatic rates of emigration â the social impacts of transition were severe despite frequent attempts to deny this â conclude ghodsee and orenstein in an interview with lrt lt ghodsee who is a professor of russian and east european studies at the university of pennsylvania discusses why disappointment with capitalism gives rise to right wing movements even in nominally successful post socialist countries what is at stake in eastern europeâ s memory wars and why women had better sex under socialism kristen ghodsee author photo youâ ve been working quite a while in eastern europe mostly in bulgaria how do people there relate to their history of socialism and of the transition to market economy i happen to be old enough that i was in eastern europe in the summer of 1990 i was actually in the gdr right after the berlin wall fell before it ceased to exist and i travelled extensively through the region iâ ve watched for the last 30 years as the narrative has developed and changed obviously in the immediate aftermath of 1989 and 1991 in the former soviet union there was this real happiness and euphoria around democracy and capitalism and the end of these oppressive states with centrally planned economies shortages travel restrictions and secret police there was a real sense of hope â that there would be this thing called â the peace dividendâ that the world would be a more equitable and peaceful place and that didnâ t happen i also think that there was a concomitant feeling that life for ordinary people in most of these former socialist countries would improve substantially and these hopes met with reality a very unfortunate reality throughout the 1990s and so i think thereâ s a lot of amnesia around the transition partially because it was so painful partially because there really hasnâ t been any systematic regional analysis of the last 30 years i would argue that this book was really the first attempt to do an interdisciplinary analysis of 27 countries over the last 30 years the transition was really good for some people and it was really bad for a lot of others â and it remains bad for a lot of people the problem with the narrative is that the winners get to tell the story and the losers their voices are just lost what we see is a complicated story the transition was really good for some people and it was really bad for a lot of others â and it remains bad for a lot of people the problem with the narrative is that the winners get to tell the story and the losers their voices are just lost and to the extent that we hear the losers we hear them at the polls in hungary and poland in places where there are more right wing governments coming into power theyâ re often discredited as backward or nostalgic uneducated rural voters there are all sorts of ways in which these voices are marginalised because theyâ re basically speaking to the fact that the last 30 years of democracy and capitalism didnâ t turn out quite the way that people in 1989 or 1991 thought they would which promises in particular would you say were frustrated and undelivered i would say that first of all the promise of democracy there was a hope about the future that you wouldnâ t just have the creation of oligarchs â in some countries they never really even pretended to have a democracy other countries really did build democracy but if you read ivan krastev and stephen holmesâ s book the light that failed they argue that you could elect governments in eastern europe that still had to do whatever western governments or the ebrd the world bank or the imf told them to do they were told to implement these reforms or implement certain kinds of austerity measures or implement a flat tax or whatever the berlin wall ap that wasnâ t really democracy you had elections and then the leaders that you elected had to do what the west said no matter what so there was a disconnect between the discourse of democracy self determination and independence and the reality of doing what the west told you to do i think thatâ s a big problem people were very disappointed and they expressed that anger very early on the other real issue is the economic one weâ ve seen an incredible amount of income inequality arise in that region partially as a result of the capture of many of the formerly state owned resources by a new class of oligarchs we see an increasing percentage of national wealth going to the top one percent we found in our book that at the peak year of poverty which was in 1998 there were 191 million people in the former socialist world living on less than 5 5 dollars a day which was the world bank poverty rate for eastern europe at the time thatâ s almost half of the region in poverty much more than there had been before the transition and so if you think of it in those terms both capitalism and democracy failed to deliver on their promises a lot of people were angry and disillusioned and i think that a lot of the frustration that you see in the region today is not only about the way that the transition has been carried out but also a reaction to the dominant narrative of economists and liberal elites insisting that the transition in fact has been successful thereâ s this constant insistence that weâ re way better off than we were before that itâ s not even worth talking about the past weâ re going to blow up all these monuments and change all these street names and pretend like that didnâ t happen i think that a lot of people are just really frustrated by that weâ re going to blow up all these monuments and change all these street names and pretend like that didnâ t happen i think that a lot of people are just really frustrated by that are there any significant variations across the region say between former soviet republics warsaw pact countries in eastern europe former yugoslavia it really depends on which indicators youâ re looking at the economy demography public opinion everyday life experiences itâ s very different for different regions the one thing that i will say is that there are some interesting regional patterns from a demographic point of view we see a massive population decline demographers call it the â demographic death spiral â where countries are haemorrhaging people either because of high death rates low fertility rates or massive out migration â in the worst case a combination of all three and lithuania i think has got the second fastest shrinking population in the world the demographic problem is just not the same in russia and in central asia itâ s horrible in places like latvia lithuania bulgaria and romania thereâ s massive haemorrhaging of population in croatia slovenia too the migration crisis has hit harder those countries that are closer and more integrated into europe than it has hit countries further away we also see a big difference between vodka drinking cultures and wine drinking cultures particularly when we look at the male mortality crisis it tends to be concentrated in what we call the vodka belt russia ukraine and because of their high male mortality it also has a depressive effect on fertility whereas in central asia theyâ re actually having a baby boom because they donâ t drink and tend for cultural reasons to have lots of children we also see a big difference between vodka drinking cultures and wine drinking cultures particularly when we look at the male mortality crisis it tends to be concentrated in what we call the vodka belt moreover obviously some countries have natural resources other countries do not some countries are more economically developed like the visegrad countries poland hungary czechia slovakia slovenia had a bigger industrial base theyâ ve really done well economically but theyâ re still facing a massive population decline they are still haemorrhaging young people theyâ re still haemorrhaging doctors and nurses young people still want to make their lives in the west rather than staying at home in your book you look at economic indicators gdp growth â which seem to show a picture of growth and development â but on the other hand even â successfulâ countries are haemorrhaging their populations so whatâ s the story there what is hidden behind the gdp inequality is whatâ s hidden there itâ s very clear i have the statistic here in 1990 6 14 percent of lithuanian wealth before taxes and transfers went to the top one percent by 2015 that figure is 10 18 thatâ s a pretty large gap one tenth of national wealth goes to one percent of the population and thatâ s really visible in a small country and so gdp per capita hides income inequality and to the extent that people look at gdp per capita as an indicator of economic success theyâ re ignoring the fact that a lot of people have to this day a worse standard of living than they did prior to 1989 or 1991 thatâ s a huge story that we donâ t hear and i think itâ s important to highlight this inequality i mean lithuania is not as bad as russia or romania in terms of inequality but itâ s also a lot worse than albania or slovakia itâ s in the middle of the pack and people feel inequality very differently the berlin wall ap sure a lot of people are better off than they were before 1989 or 1991 thereâ s no doubt about that especially if you were a young person who left lithuania in the 1990s and made a life for yourself in england or the united states or germany your life is just way better than your parentsâ or grandparentsâ i donâ t think thereâ s any question about that but for all those people living in the villages in eastern lithuania where some of this massive depopulation is happening â their lives arenâ t better off and they really feel it and at the end of the day they vote so i think itâ s essential to not only look at the economic indicators â demographic indicators also tell you a story which is that if i were a young person i wouldnâ t want to live in lithuania or bulgaria iâ d have a better life in the west and i think that tells you that this is not an ideal democratic capitalist society because if it was people would want to stay and have babies and not only young people feel the pressure to leave i lived in serbia belgrade for a month last november some of my colleagues there female professors around my age they too are feeling pressure to migrate they see their friends do it their children are now going off to university and they feel like okay now i can move to germany or the uk because they donâ t need me here anymore and so this pressure is ubiquitous in these societies â if youâ re anybody you get out thatâ s not a healthy society thatâ s not a sustainable society in the long run if anybody who has intelligence and initiative and drive feels like their opportunities are better in another country than in their own country â i think thatâ s a real problem and that is a reflection of the disappointments of the last 30 years do you think the recent backsliding of democracy in poland and hungary are also linked to this botched transition absolutely unequivocally and in former east germany the alternative fã¼r deutschland party actually uses the slogan â vollende die wendeâ complete the change part of their campaign strategy has been to stir up peopleâ s anger about the reunification and the loss of east german culture afd party s campaign poster in germany saying the east is rising 2019 ap definitely thereâ s anger and frustration in places like poland and hungary which by the way are countries that did well in the transition economically data shows that they were some of the most successful countries but theyâ re facing this backlash precisely because people were promised a certain bill of goods and they didnâ t get it in 1990 helmut kohl who was the chancellor of germany at the time told east germans â and implicitly he told eastern europeans â no one will be worse off than before but it will be much better for many and it wasnâ t true many people were better off but the vast majority of people were worse off in our book we basically say that if you look at all 27 countries over the last 30 years about a third of the population did really well and about two thirds of the population did poorly meaning that they either have the exact same standard of living or worse than they did in 1989 or 1991 west german chancellor helmut kohl and east german premier hans modrow by the berlin wall in 1989 ap why do people who feel left behind then go and vote for the far right or nationalists because there are no leftist parties in eastern europe or theyâ re very few to people in eastern europe communism or socialism or any kind of leftist redistributive politics is totally anathema so to the extent that there are redistributive politics itâ s taking the form of nationalism if you look at the platform of the law and justice party in poland or orban policies in hungary they both have interesting redistributive socialist aspects but theyâ re wrapped in the language of nationalism so i just think that in eastern europe redistribution is more palatable if itâ s done under the banner of the far right rather than the left let alone far left but is that constructive will the nationalists really deliver no of course not they never do they always use the language of populism to shore up the economic and political interests of the elites thatâ s just the way it works there may be some good policies look at poland what is called the family 500 which is a redistribution programme to give money to polish women who have children itâ s not that different from what they did under socialism at the same time theyâ ve banned abortion and women have to stay home it is a very conservative policy but it turns out that itâ s very popular especially in rural areas so the nationalists donâ t completely abdicate responsibility â some of the policies that they propose they actually do it and we have some evidence for instance that child poverty in poland has in fact been reduced by this so theyâ re not completely disingenuous but given the abortion politics for the most part you canâ t really trust these far right parties because their agenda is different from what they say it is a protest against a verdict of the polish constitutional tribunal ap youâ ve also written about eastern europeâ s relation with the holocaust and how sometimes the history of soviet occupation is used to whitewash our own complicity in the holocaust first of all my work on this is very specific to bulgaria the bulgarian government which was allied with nazi germany deported the thracian and macedonian jews and thereâ s an unwillingness to acknowledge the complicity of the bulgarian state and the bulgarian elite in the holocaust in the immediate aftermath of the communist coup dâ etat â or revolution depending on who you are talking to â many of these elites were shot on february 2 1945 by a kangaroo court by the way these existed in many countries in eastern europe in the case of bulgaria subsequent monuments to the victims of communism have used the word â innocentâ implying that these people were not responsible for anything that they were innocent victims of communist terror now i am not at all suggesting that there werenâ t real victims of communist terror in bulgaria however when you include the name of somebody like petar gabrovski who was the minister of interior and signed the actual orders for the deportation of jews to the death camps when you consider him an â innocent victim â you are seriously undermining your moral authority of using the category â victims of communismâ and there are multiple examples of people either directly or indirectly complicit in the holocaust who then become rehabilitated as â victims of communismâ and i think this happens in a lot of eastern european countries where there are real fascists who were fighting either allied directly or indirectly with the nazis who were then killed or purged by anti fascist forces and are now being rehabilitated as heroes of anti communist resistance although they are really problematic for their anti semitic or fascist past part of that i think is the use in europe of the twin totalitarianisms discourse trying to create an equivalency between nazism and what is sometimes called communism sometimes more specifically stalinism i think this debate has died down a little bit now but certainly after the global financial crisis in 2008 2009 it was a big point of discussion museum of occupations and freedom fights in vilnius bns nuotr and it has real world implications for instance in a place like bulgaria or romania where peopleâ s grandparents who were literally fascists and had their property expropriated by the communist state their children and grandchildren get it restituted once their reputations are rehabilitated as victims of communism by the way this was a big problem in east berlin german journalist daniela dahn has written extensively about how families of former nazi party members went in and took property back from east germans that had been nationalised in 1949 the germans basically say that the east german government was not a legal state and so they had no ability to transfer property rights to anybody else and so the contract under which the property was taken away from a nazi and given to an eastern family was invalid there are many people in eastern europe today who have every economic interest in making sure that their families are seen as victims of communism and communist expropriation rather than dealing with the complicated fact that some of their grandparents may have been in cahoots with the nazis or domestic fascist forces i know that this is a very difficult conversation to have in places like lithuania but pretending that itâ s not true is historically problematic and inaccurate there are many people in eastern europe today who have every economic interest in making sure that their families are seen as victims of communism and communist expropriation rather than dealing with the complicated fact that some of their grandparents may have been in cahoots with the nazis or domestic fascist forces and the best way to have this conversation is to actually look at what contemporary factors are playing into these dominant historical narratives and try to depoliticise them controlling the discourse about complicity or not complicity in something that happened 75 years ago is relevant to political and economic arrangements today and thatâ s why i think this is such a difficult conversation in eastern europe another important strand of your work is about womenâ s rights one of your books is called intriguingly why women have better sex under socialism what is your main argument my thesis is basically that socialist countries got some things right they got a lot of things wrong iâ m not trying to whitewash it iâ m very clear that i recognise the secret police the travel restrictions the shortages censorship and things that were wrong with these societies but there were some things that they got right and one of the things that they got right i think was the promotion of gender equality womenâ s equality very specifically and the support for the family people had babies in soviet lithuania it does tell you something about the world when there were people having babies â and then people stopped having babies why especially given that as we know abortion was legal on demand in the soviet union before and after the stalinist era and that many soviet women had four or five abortions in their lifetime so itâ s not like it was in romania where there was no birth control or access to reproductive freedoms after 1966 in lithuania there were plenty of opportunities to terminate a pregnancy if you wanted to and yet people still had babies kristen ghodsee author photo so that tells you that there was something about that society that made people feel comfortable enough that made them care enough about the future that they were ready to bring children into the world and so my argument is simply that we shouldnâ t discount some of the policies that were put into place that supported women as workers and mothers and which supported families it could be as simple as well everything else in life sucked so the only thing we could do was have sex and hang out with our friends and family in dacha and drink vodka fine you could say that this might be part of what was going on and now everybodyâ s hustling we all want to go on vacation to ibiza or are working three jobs nobody has time for kids and itâ s better because we have more stuff now than we did before i realise that in a place like lithuania this is very controversial but itâ s occasionally worth looking back and saying we could get rid of the bad and keep some of the good stuff that made people feel like they had more stable lives â so that they would not want to leave the country the first opportunity they get what was it that made you want to have a family and raise children why did it change and i think a lot of it has to do with a deterioration in womenâ s rights and support for the family which rights in particular have deteriorated most profoundly the one thing i do want to say because i know that everybody in eastern europe always says this there was a double burden women worked and they still had responsibility for the home they had to clean cook take care of the kids so women worked a lot and thatâ s not necessarily ideal however there was an expectation that women would make real contributions to society as well as being mothers and that they werenâ t primarily useful for their sexuality look at a place like ukraine where you had a really high percentage of women that were very educated in the sciences and mathematics and what are ukrainian women doing today theyâ re renting their wombs out to western families to make babies and thatâ s on top of the mail order bride stuff i reviewed a great book called soviet signoras by martina cvajner about eastern european women in italy who worked as carers for elderly people often these women ukrainian or romanian who are working in italy are better educated than the people theyâ re looking after you have a situation in which the right of women to be intellectual workers to contribute to society in a non sexual or non caregiving way has evaporated because of the economic situation and because privatisation and new liberalisation has reduced the social safety net â you donâ t have the same level of job protection paid maternity leaves child allowances so i just think that there are all sorts of ways in which when we think about womenâ s rights and opportunities there were many opportunities that women had before and i really want to emphasise that iâ m not saying this was some perfect world â only that there were policies that we could take we could think about ways of organising our society so that we emphasise womenâ s rights and also care and respect for the family whatever form the family takes

according to dr alex schnell working with octopuses is difficult because of their emotional swings they might be outgoing and social one day and then refuse to leave their den the next according to a cephalopod behavioral ecologist clever animals octopuses are clever sophisticated organisms that can alter the color and texture of their skin disguise themselves utilize tools and fit into small areas in 2020 the oscar winning documentary my octopus teacher depicting a filmmaker s friendship with an octopus brought their complicated existence into the public eye while the common octopus octopus vulgaris may have won hearts it is also at the center of plans by nueva pescanova a spanish fishing firm to build the world s first commercial octopus farm in the canary islands next year growing demand for octopus although there is a growing demand for octopus meat the number of octopuses collected in the wild quadrupled between 1980 and 2014 industrial octopus cultivation has remained elusive companies and scientists have been working for decades to overcome the various issues it provides including keeping hatchlings alive calculating tank temperatures and finding the correct diet from spain and mexico to japan and hawaii the aim is to raise a fast growing easy to reproduce animal that sells for a high price with a factory that it promises would eventually produce 3 000 tons of octopus flesh per year nueva pescanova looks to be on the verge of winning this race according to the corporation the farm will not only meet the rising demand for octopus flesh but it will also reduce strain on wild populations yearly harvest each year more than 350 000 tonnes of octopus are harvested in china japan and mexico and natural populations are thought to be quickly dwindling according to a nueva pescanova spokeswoman farming octopuses is vital to preserve a species of high environmental and human significance criticisms critics argue that raising these complex animals would result in a tremendous deal of misery and mirror the harmful effects of factory farming on land last year the united kingdom declared octopuses to be sentient entities when maintained in close quarters with others octopuses normally solitary animals can become violent dr becca franks an environmental studies research scientist at new york university said captive octopuses have been known to devour their arms and are famous escape artists implying they don t appreciate being held in tanks also read scientists discover strange breeding behavior of deep sea octopus moms ethical concern they require stimulation according to schnell schnell was part of a team of experts who analyzed more than 300 scientific publications on consciousness in invertebrates including octopuses for a study published by the london school of economics in 2021 while cows pigs and other farmed animals are conscious schnell says we know more about their welfare requirements she claims that there are no behavioral proxies for gauging octopus welfare establishing one would be difficult because of the large variations in their behavior from day to day schnell is especially concerned about how the octopuses will be slaughtered there is no credible humane killing procedure that could be implemented on a huge scale economically she stated clubbing severing their brains and asphyxiation in a net are all techniques used to kill octopuses found in the wild carlos rosas a biologist working with nueva pescanova at mexico s national autonomous university argues that welfare concerns are a distortion he explained that they re attempting to provide the finest habitat for the animals because they want to flourish rosas utilizes tubes boulders and artificial grasses in tanks to replicate more natural circumstances at his small scale demonstration farm in yucatán he claims that his octopuses never escape rosas said it s uncertain whether these conditions could be duplicated at the industrial scale suggested by nueva pescanova he thinks octopus farming may provide economic prospects in mexico aquaculture is an option for impoverished people who live on the coastlines and agrees with nueva pescanova that it can help relieve pressure on wild populations benefits of farming farming s ability to combat overfishing on the other hand is contested according to a 2019 study aquaculture does nothing to mitigate the adverse effects of wild fishing and may even increase seafood demand according to schnell the only approach to relieve pressure on wild stocks is raising prices and promoting octopus flesh as a delicacy the farms may still need wild caught fish to feed the octopuses putting even more strain on the oceans the industry needs to explain raising carnivores since it makes no sense from a sustainability standpoint jennifer jacquet associate professor of environmental studies at new york university said related article female octopus avoids harassment by
