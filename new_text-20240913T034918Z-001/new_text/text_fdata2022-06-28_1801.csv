it is unlikely that view has changed if anything a regime that thrives off propaganda will be even more desperate to avoid any scenario that adds to the impression that russia is a rogue creditor or has been weakened by sanctions witness the kremlin s attempts to dismiss the default as a sham artificially engineered by the us and hostile western powers anton siluanov the finance minister has called the situation a farce it has also made a last ditch bid to service us40 billion of outstanding sovereign debt with roubles a move that creditors have already ruled out the idea that america is pulling the strings when it comes to russia s financial clout will infuriate putin but it is a timely reminder of who the real superpower in this battle is so yes a debt default is in some ways symbolic but hugely so because it underlines russia s dramatic decline from a country celebrated for its fortress economy to an economic and political basket case but it s much more than that even siluanov knows that the ramifications potentially spread much wider this is all about russia s access to international financial markets and anything that dents its reputation however manufactured it may be with foreign lenders will make it harder for the kremlin to borrow from them by affecting the country s debt ratings it doesn t just make it more difficult to access financing it becomes more costly to borrow too and because it was the us treasury that forced russia into default it will be washington that dictates when negotiations with its foreign creditors can begin this means moscow could effectively be shut out of the global financial system for years possibly even decades ash predicts loading the idea that america is pulling the strings when it comes to russia s financial clout will infuriate putin but there is no doubt that it is a timely reminder of who the real superpower is in this battle russia s president has claimed that sanctions are a double edged sword that are more painful for the west than russia as moscow starts to squeeze energy supplies pushing europe s economy into a prolonged stagnationary era it is of course the unavoidable truth that western consumers are suffering the price of the war in ukraine as energy bills petrol costs and food prices all keep being forced up raising fears of a looming recession this has tested western resolve something that host olaf scholz admitted at a meeting of g7 leaders on sunday in the bavarian alps all the g7 states were worried about the crises we currently face germany s chancellor said loading boris johnson also warned of fatigue among populations and politicians but reiterated the need to maintain consensus and scholz said he was convinced the group would send a very clear signal of unity and decisive action reports that the g7 is closer to reaching an agreement on a proposed price cap on russian oil and gas are reassuring putin like any autocratic leader gains great strength from any sign of weakness in his enemies ukraine s allies must stay the course and keep turning the screws with joe biden and us treasury secretary janet yellen leading the way britain france and italy reportedly backing a cap and berlin expected to follow suit shortly the west may soon have a potent new weapon at its disposal the theory is that a buyers cartel would force down the value of the kremlin s most lucrative export by only allowing russian oil and gas to be sold and stored at below a certain price whereas a full boycott has pushed prices up a plan to allow china and india access to cheaper russian energy is also a smart move because previously the kremlin had been trying to circumvent sanctions by selling its crude and gas to more sympathetic nations loading the kremlin is wrong to claim the war has changed nothing the default however engineered is in itself proof that sanctions are well and truly working

wall street capped a wobbly day of trading with a mixed finish monday giving back some of the market s gains after a rare winning week the standard poor s 500 index fell 0 3 after shifting between small gains and losses throughout the day the dow jones industrial average slipped 0 2 and the nasdaq composite gave up 0 7 shares in small companies rose and more stocks rose than fell on the new york stock exchange advertisement declines in technology communications retail and travel related companies weighed on the market those losses checked gains in energy and other sectors the market s uneven finish comes after stocks closed out last week with solid gains and the s p 500 posted its best day in two years friday stocks rallied last week as pressure from rising treasury yields let up somewhat and investors speculated the federal reserve may not have to raise interest rates as aggressively as earlier thought as it fights to control inflation treasury yields rose again monday the rebound in stocks last week was largely seen as a reaction to a wave of selling that some market strategists say was perhaps overdone leaving the market ripe for a rebound advertisement there s quite a bit of noise going on as we get to quarter s end said tom hainlin national investment strategist at u s bank wealth management so it really wasn t surprising for us to see a bounce last week on the other hand hainlin said we would view that as not necessarily an indication that fundamentally things have gotten better business companies vow to help employees access abortion after roe vs wade is overturned from banks to tech firms to hollywood studios corporate executives vowed friday to do what they could to help their employees continue to access abortion after the supreme court threw out 49 years of precedent the s p 500 fell 11 63 points to 3 900 11 the dow dropped 62 42 points to 31 438 26 and the nasdaq slid 83 07 points to 11 524 55 advertisement smaller company stocks bucked the broader market s decline the russell 2000 rose 6 01 points or 0 3 to 1 771 74 european markets also ended mixed asian markets closed higher overnight technology and communication stocks were among the biggest drags on the market microsoft fell 1 and electronic arts slid 3 5 several big retailers and travel related companies also fell amazon and carnival each fell 2 8 advertisement those losses checked gains elsewhere in the market including energy stocks which rose as the price of u s crude oil climbed 1 8 exxon mobil rose 2 5 robinhood markets jumped 14 after a published report suggesting that cryptocurrency exchange ftx is considering buying the popular trading app company in may ftx chief executive sam bankman fried bought a 7 6 stake in robinhood according to a filing with u s regulators robinhood shot to fame for its easy to use trading app which brought a new generation of investors to the stock market perhaps most famously with the meme stock frenzy that sent gamestop soaring early last year crypto has become a major part of its business advertisement treasury yields rose the yield on the 10 year treasury note which helps set mortgage rates rose to 3 20 from 3 12 late friday the market rally last week was welcome relief in the midst of a deep slump for wall street as investors worry about the path of inflation and whether rising interest rates will temper the effects on businesses and consumers or push the economy into a recession the federal reserve and other central banks have been aggressively raising interest rates in a sharp turnaround from maintaining ultra low rates during the covid 19 pandemic that helped support the economy it s a delicate balance for the fed which hopes to cool off the economy but not so much that it actually contracts higher interest rates though also hurt prices for investors and have prompted much of the year s sell off advertisement investors have favorably viewed recent reports showing weak consumer sentiment and economic growth because that raises the possibility that the fed will ease off its plan for aggressive rate increases as economic growth slows wall street will have a few more reports this week that could provide more insight into inflation economic growth and the fed s path ahead on tuesday the conference board will release its consumer confidence report for june spending and confidence held up well through most of the post pandemic recovery even as inflation rose but record high gas prices and an overall tighter squeeze from inflation have been eating away at wallets and prompting many to shift or cut back spending advertisement one reason for inflation s tighter squeeze was russia s invasion of ukraine in february that sent energy prices soaring u s crude oil prices are up more than 40 for the year prices for wheat and corn have also surged conferring by video link with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky group of 7 leaders were finalizing a deal to seek a price cap on russian oil raise tariffs on russian goods and impose other new sanctions russia may have also defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time since the 1917 bolshevik revolution further

an analyst upgrades the company in the belief that it s basically a sleeper stock what happened now this is how to start a week off right if you re a stock on monday shares of vermilion energy vet 2 36 were a hot item on the market rising to a nearly 12 gain across the trading day that was in sharp contrast to the slumping stock exchange bellwether the s p 500 index an analyst s recommendation upgrade on the canadian energy company s stock was the big reason for the pop so what in the estimation of scotiabank s bns 1 47 jason bouvier vermilion is now a sector outperform i e buy up from the former recommendation of sector perform hold bouvier s price target on the stock is 36 canadian dollars 28 the analyst s adjustment is due to recent developments in european gas prices which have soared in recent weeks largely because of the war in ukraine bouvier feels that vermilion s share price has largely moved in concert with peer oil and gas companies on the back of a general decline in oil prices the west texas intermediate crude price for example is presently just under 110 per barrel down from a peak of over 122 earlier this month however bouvier points out that roughly 40 to 45 of vermilion s cash flow comes from european gas now what the demand for european gas should rise if anything the longer the war drags on and affects supply to the rest of the continent vermilion is a bit of a sleeper play on this dynamic then so investors were wise to pounce on the shares after the publication of bouvier s new note
attempts to prevent moscow from paying its foreign debt may undermine the western financial system western media is reporting that russia is facing a default on its foreign debt for the first time since 1918 moscow was forced to make interest payments on bonds in rubles after washington blocked dollar payments what is russia s reaction to default claims moscow has rejected the assertions and has accused washington of trying to engineer an artificial default explaining that the country is willing and able to service its foreign debt the transition to ruble payments does not imply a debt default finance minister anton siluanov has stressed how does moscow plan to service its foreign debt under a new payment mechanism which was recently announced and signed into law by president vladimir putin moscow considers its obligations completed if they are fulfilled in rubles in an amount equivalent to the value of obligations in foreign currency at the exchange rate on the day the funds are transferred to the central depository nsd through which they will be paid to creditors why is russia making bond payments in rubles in may the us ended a bond payment waiver that had allowed moscow to service its debt in dollars the russian finance ministry subsequently said that in order to defend its reputation as a reliable borrower russia would service its eurobond obligations in the national currency the ruble if it were unable to pay in foreign currency what does being in default mean for a country countries in default cannot borrow money cheaply through international financial institutions because they are considered a risk how does that impact russia there is no reason for moscow to issue bonds the country runs a low debt of around 16 of gdp because it traditionally doesn t rely heavily on borrowing in comparison most western countries run debts close or well over to 100 of their gdp how much damage does a default do to the country s economy in terms of the western financial system it doesn t matter sanctions make it impossible for russia to trade as it used to most western companies have pulled out and borrowing money from western financial institutions is not possible this makes russia s credit rating in the west meaningless how does this impact russia s remaining trade partners in terms of china india and other major partners it has no negative effect russia s trade with its brics partners has grown by almost 40 in the first quarter of 2022 from the 164 billion reached last year russia s trade partners have been eager to replace western businesses in russia what are moscow s alternatives to borrowing in western institutions financial institutions such as the brics new development bank ndb which was established by the member states brazil russia india china and south africa with the aim of financing infrastructure and development projects in emerging nations could be a good option for russia what s the potential fallout the west denies that a possible russian default could have the kind of impact on global financial markets and institutions that came from an earlier default on domestic debt in 1998 back then russia s default on ruble bonds pushed the us government to step in and get banks to bail out a major american hedge fund whose collapse it was feared could have shaken the wider financial system however investment analysts acknowledge that holders of russian bonds could take serious losses as a result of western actions and file lawsuits against the us government which prevented russia s dollar payments moscow points out that attempts to push russia into default only undermines the reputation of the western financial system for more stories on economy finance visit rt s business section rt com

various financial services in switzerland europe the middle east africa the americas and asia pacific the company offers private banking and wealth management solutions including advisory investment financial planning succession planning and trust services and financing and lending and multi shore platform solutions credit suisse has a history of business dealings with russian oligarchs or ultra high net worth business leaders possessing significant political influence for example an article published by financial times on february 7 2022 entitled credit suisse securitizes yacht loans to oligarchs and tycoons cited a recent investor presentation for a synthetic securitization deal in which credit suisse sold off 80 million worth of risk related to a 2 billion portfolio of loans backed by assets owned by certain of the bank s ultra high net worth clients the securitization deal which disclosed that in 2017 and 2018 credit suisse experienced 12 defaults on yacht and aircraft loans a third of which were related to u s sanctions against russian oligarchs press reports at the time indicated that russian billionaires oleg deripaska arkady rotenberg and boris rotenberg had to terminate private jet leases with credit suisse in those years beginning in or around october 2021 russia commenced a major military build up near the russo ukrainian border in apparent preparation for an invasion of ukraine although the russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to invade or attack ukraine the u s later released intelligence of russian invasion plans including satellite photographs showing russian troops and equipment near the russo ukrainian border in november 2021 as russia s military buildup on the russo ukrainian border continued the company entered the securitization deal just months later on february 24 2022 russian military forces invaded ukraine in the immediate aftermath of the invasion western governments including among others the u s canada and the european union imposed significant sanctions on russia the sanctions included inter alia measures targeting russia s ultrawealthy oligarchs by denying them access to the global financial system and by in some cases authorizing the seizure of certain of their high value assets located outside of russia barely a week after the commencement of the russian invasion and the retaliatory sanctions imposed by western nations news outlets reported that credit suisse had requested non participating investors who received information about the company s loan portfolio to destroy and permanently erase any confidential information that credit suisse provided to them regarding the securitization deal the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i credit suisse had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting ii credit suisse s practice of lending money to russian oligarchs subject to u s and international sanctions created a significant risk of violating rules pertaining to those sanctions and future sanctions iii the foregoing conduct subjected the company to an increased risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and or enforcement actions iv the securitization deal concerned loans that credit suisse made to russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the u s v the purpose of the securitization deal was to offload the risks associated with these loans and mitigate the impact on credit suisse of sanctions likely to be implemented by western nations in response to russia s invasion of ukraine vi credit suisse s request that non participating investors destroy documents related to the securitization deal was intended to conceal the company s noncompliance with u s and international sanctions in its lending practices vii the foregoing once revealed was likely to subject the company to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm and viii as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on march 28 2022 the u s house of representatives committee on oversight and reform sent credit suisse a letter asking the company to turn over information and documents about a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets owned by clients potentially including sanctioned russian individuals in the letter house oversight chair carolyn maloney and rep stephen lynch chair of the subcommittee on national security questioned credit suisse s request that hedge funds and other non participating investors destroy documents related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank s clients given the timing of this request and its subject matter the house democrats wrote credit suisse s action

precautions are required and followed in the place that you re going and then the third is what are you planning to do once you re there she said are you planning to visit a lot of attractions and go to indoor bars that s very different from you re going somewhere where you re planning to lie on the beach all day and not interact with anyone else that s very different those are very different levels of risk vaccination is the most significant safety factor for travel since unvaccinated travelers are more likely to become ill and transmit covid 19 to others wen said and it s also important to consider what you would do if you end up testing positive away from home while us bound travelers no longer have to present a negative covid 19 test to get home from international destinations the cdc still advises testing before boarding flights back to the states and not traveling if you are sick of course if people have symptoms or exposure while traveling they need to get tested and if they

by mark nestmann last week on a day the dow jones index fell more than 700 points i ran into an old friend at a monthly dinner meeting i regularly attend i m screwed he told me my money manager has me almost fully invested in stocks and they ve lost almost a quarter of their value in just the last few weeks the week before that i was speaking with a client who had placed nearly all his net worth into a cryptocurrency protocol called anchor which offered interest rates as high as 20 but its value had fallen 99 9 in the previous few weeks if i want a decent quality of life going forward i ll probably need to work until i die he told me these anecdotes are hardly definitive but they illustrate examples of a far larger phenomenon what we re calling the everything meltdown whether it s stocks cryptocurrencies or bonds many stores of value or sources of income investors have relied upon in recent years have shown themselves to be highly vulnerable to downturns the price collapse in many investments is most frequently blamed on the federal reserve s newly found hawkishness in raising interest rates to fight what we believe could be the worst inflation in american history led by chairman jerome powell the fed s open market committee fomc raised its benchmark federal funds rate by 0 75 last wednesday it was the largest rate hike since 1994 and comes on top of a 0 5 interest rate increase last month the fomc announcement also indicated that another 0 75 increase could be coming in july still even with the may and june rate hikes the fed funds rate range is still only 1 5 1 75 and the consumer price index measuring america s official inflation rate is increasing at a blazingly fast 8 6 annual rate according to the most recent announcement from uncle sam prices rose 1 in may alone a 12 annualized rate real interest rates i e interest rates minus inflation now stand at around 7 what s more if inflation was measured the same way today as it was in 1980 inflation would be running at a 17 annual clip with real interest rates at a staggering 15 the fed has been widely criticized for not increasing interest rates much more quickly than it did indeed just a year ago it was calling inflation transitory and there s another phenomenon at work here it s one that the fed doesn t like to talk about although it s acutely aware of this issue unfortunately for the fed and the rest of us the american economy has become addicted to near zero interest rates both public and private debt as a percentage of gdp have climbed to record levels entire business models are dependent on ultra low rates including more than 600 zombie corporations that remain in existence only because they can borrow enormous amounts of money for next to nothing a now defunct family office called archegos capital management provides a great example of this strategy between 2012 and 2021 archegos converted roughly 600 million to more than 10 billion profits this large simply aren t possible without massive borrowing and banks lined up to lend money to bill hwang the founder of archegos effectively archegos was employing 10 1 leverage in its portfolio but things began to unravel in early 2021 prices of a few stocks in hwang s portfolio began to decline when the company couldn t meet margin calls from its lenders the banks owning the shares archegos controlled began to liquidate them each bank was apparently unaware of the loans other banks had extended to the firm that made the sell off especially chaotic goldman sachs morgan stanley and deutsche bank dumped billions of dollars of archegos controlled shares in doing so they triggered a massive margin call liquidation in which the first sellers emerge relatively unscathed and those who sell later bear most of the losses nomura japan s largest investment bank lost at least 2 billion credit suisse reported a 4 7 billion loss archegos lenders may ultimately absorb 10 billion or more in combined losses keep in mind that archegos is just one family office there are at least 10 000 other family offices operating globally controlling assets worth 6 trillion and potentially much more we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us economist andrea cecci gave a good summary of the implications of the archegos investment model the archegos case represents on a small scale how the entire economic world functions borrowed money created out of thin air or colossal pulverized debts entrusted to algorithmic models managed by very powerful computers that carry out thousands of transactions per second on complicated schemes but of such size as to guarantee the multiplication of volumes thanks to the ponzi effect of the continuous new injection of credit debit into the system by central and commercial banks from all over the world in unison the result of this ponzi effect is a global financial system with multiple points of vulnerability one in which the collapse of a relatively small family office with just a few billion dollars of capital threatened the solvency of at least eight major banks at the moment we re only in the earliest stages of a financial downturn unemployment remains low and consumer spending is at near record highs but what will happen when a few dozen more archegos type operations collapse potentially taking down with them the banks that lent them billions of dollars or when zombie corporations begin meeting their well deserved demise in droves at that point we believe the fed will capitulate on inflation pundits call it the fed put essentially it s the reality that the fed will always intervene in the markets if prices fall beyond a predetermined point we ve seen proof of the fed put repeatedly in the last 35 years most recently in the early days of the covid pandemic every time banks hedge funds or other well connected wall street institutions are seriously threatened by some sort of economic calamity the fed steps in to save them therefore even with real interest rates at 7 or 15 depending on how you measure inflation we don t take the fed seriously at all when it talks of tamping down inflation when push comes to shove it will push down interest rates use quantitative easing to buy trillions more of dodgy debt to add to its balance sheet and take other emergency measures to prop up the markets the problem though is these measures are inherently inflationary thus we believe that far from ending we re only in the beginning stages of what we foresee as a hyperinflationary economic collapse the question we get a lot from clients is how can i best prepare for this scenario and while we re the first to admit we can t predict the future we can take some comfort in owning significant quantities of an asset with a 5 000 year track record of holding its value in economic turmoil we re speaking of course of gold while the gold price hasn t been untouched by the market turmoil in recent months it s held its value far better than other assets for instance since the beginning of the year gold has actually gained about 1 compared to a loss of 23 for the s p 500 long term treasury bonds have fared even worse they re down 24 for the year meanwhile bitcoin is down 55 so far in 2022 and it s not hard to see why in times of crisis both individuals and institutions buy gold and there s a new incentive for doing so the realization that accounts denominated in the world s reserve currency the us dollar can be frozen anytime that s a 284 billion lesson that russia learned in the early days of its invasion of ukraine for instance in 2021 global central banks purchased a net 455 tons of gold nearly double the 2020 total and they re on target to buy even more in 2022 the last time inflation approached the levels we re seeing today in the united states in 1978 1980 gold prices rose from 161 10 per ounce to 594 90 per ounce briefly peaking at nearly 850 per ounce in early 1980 and this was at a time when inflation measurements were much more honest than they are today and real interest rates much higher how high will gold prices go in this round of inflation we don t know but we re glad we own a generous amount of it

believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful supplement to net income loss from continuing operations as an indicator of operating performance we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that is useful both to management and investors when evaluating our performance and comparing our performance with that of our competitors we also use adjusted ebitda for planning purposes and to evaluate our financial performance because adjusted ebitda excludes certain incremental expenses or non cash items such as stock based compensation charges that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure and therefore a reconciliation between net loss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda has been provided in the financial results adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to income from operations or net loss from continuing operations as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of cash flows in each case as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity in addition adjusted ebitda does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows we do not intend the presentation of these non gaap measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap these non gaap measures should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap following is the reconciliation of our consolidated net loss to adjusted ebitda three months ended march 31 in thousands 2022 2021 net loss 2 324 6 802 add

wall street ends mixed after a day of wavering up and down declines in technology communications retail and travel related companies weighed on the market associated press wall street capped a wobbly day of trading with a mixed finish monday giving back some of the market s gains after a rare winning week the standard poor s 500 index fell 0 3 after shifting between small gains and losses throughout the day the dow jones industrial average slipped 0 2 and the nasdaq composite gave up 0 7 shares in small companies rose and more stocks rose than fell on the new york stock exchange declines in technology communications retail and travel related companies weighed on the market those losses checked gains in energy and other sectors advertisement advertisement the market s uneven finish comes after stocks closed out last week with solid gains and the s p 500 posted its best day in two years friday stocks rallied last week as pressure from rising treasury yields let up somewhat and investors speculated the federal reserve may not have to raise interest rates as aggressively as earlier thought as it fights to control inflation treasury yields rose again monday the rebound in stocks last week was largely seen as a reaction to a wave of selling that some market strategists say was perhaps overdone leaving the market ripe for a rebound there s quite a bit of noise going on as we get to quarter s end said tom hainlin national investment strategist at u s bank wealth management so it really wasn t surprising for us to see a bounce last week on the other hand hainlin said we would view that as not necessarily an indication that fundamentally things have gotten better advertisement advertisement the s p 500 fell 11 63 points to 3 900 11 the dow dropped 62 42 points to 31 438 26 and the nasdaq slid 83 07 points to 11 524 55 smaller company stocks bucked the broader market s decline the russell 2000 rose 6 01 points or 0 3 to 1 771 74 european markets also ended mixed asian markets closed higher overnight technology and communication stocks were among the biggest drags on the market microsoft fell 1 and electronic arts slid 3 5 several big retailers and travel related companies also fell amazon and carnival each fell 2 8 those losses checked gains elsewhere in the market including energy stocks which rose as the price of u s crude oil climbed 1 8 exxon mobil rose 2 5 advertisement advertisement robinhood markets jumped 14 after a published report suggesting that cryptocurrency exchange ftx is considering buying the popular trading app company in may ftx chief executive sam bankman fried bought a 7 6 stake in robinhood according to a filing with u s regulators robinhood shot to fame for its easy to use trading app which brought a new generation of investors to the stock market perhaps most famously with the meme stock frenzy that sent gamestop soaring early last year crypto has become a major part of its business treasury yields rose the yield on the 10 year treasury note which helps set mortgage rates rose to 3 20 from 3 12 late friday the market rally last week was welcome relief in the midst of a deep slump for wall street as investors worry about the path of inflation and whether rising interest rates will temper the effects on businesses and consumers or push the economy into a recession advertisement advertisement the federal reserve and other central banks have been aggressively raising interest rates in a sharp turnaround from maintaining ultra low rates during the covid 19 pandemic that helped support the economy it s a delicate balance for the fed which hopes to cool off the economy but not so much that it actually contracts higher interest rates though also hurt prices for investors and have prompted much of the year s sell off investors have favorably viewed recent reports showing weak consumer sentiment and economic growth because that raises the possibility that the fed will ease off its plan for aggressive rate increases as economic growth slows wall street will have a few more reports this week that could provide more insight into inflation economic growth and the fed s path ahead on

various financial services in switzerland europe the middle east africa the americas and asia pacific the company offers private banking and wealth management solutions including advisory investment financial planning succession planning and trust services and financing and lending and multi shore platform solutions credit suisse has a history of business dealings with russian oligarchs or ultra high net worth business leaders possessing significant political influence for example an article published by financial times on february 7 2022 entitled credit suisse securitizes yacht loans to oligarchs and tycoons cited a recent investor presentation for a synthetic securitization deal in which credit suisse sold off 80 million worth of risk related to a 2 billion portfolio of loans backed by assets owned by certain of the bank s ultra high net worth clients the securitization deal which disclosed that in 2017 and 2018 credit suisse experienced 12 defaults on yacht and aircraft loans a third of which were related to u s sanctions against russian oligarchs press reports at the time indicated that russian billionaires oleg deripaska arkady rotenberg and boris rotenberg had to terminate private jet leases with credit suisse in those years beginning in or around october 2021 russia commenced a major military build up near the russo ukrainian border in apparent preparation for an invasion of ukraine although the russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to invade or attack ukraine the u s later released intelligence of russian invasion plans including satellite photographs showing russian troops and equipment near the russo ukrainian border in november 2021 as russia s military buildup on the russo ukrainian border continued the company entered the securitization deal just months later on february 24 2022 russian military forces invaded ukraine in the immediate aftermath of the invasion western governments including among others the u s canada and the european union imposed significant sanctions on russia the sanctions included inter alia measures targeting russia s ultrawealthy oligarchs by denying them access to the global financial system and by in some cases authorizing the seizure of certain of their high value assets located outside of russia barely a week after the commencement of the russian invasion and the retaliatory sanctions imposed by western nations news outlets reported that credit suisse had requested non participating investors who received information about the company s loan portfolio to destroy and

credit suisse had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting ii credit suisse s practice of lending money to russian oligarchs subject to u s and international sanctions created a significant risk of violating rules pertaining to those sanctions and future sanctions iii the foregoing conduct subjected the company to an increased risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and or enforcement actions iv the securitization deal concerned loans that credit suisse made to russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the u s v the purpose of the securitization deal was to offload the risks associated with these loans and mitigate the impact on credit suisse of sanctions likely to be implemented by western nations in response to russia s invasion of ukraine vi credit suisse s request that non participating investors destroy documents related to the securitization deal was intended to conceal the company s noncompliance with u s and international sanctions in its lending practices vii the foregoing once revealed was likely to subject the company to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm and viii as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on march 28 2022 the u s house of representatives committee on oversight and reform sent credit suisse a letter asking the company to turn over information and documents about a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets owned by clients potentially including sanctioned russian individuals in

investors destroy documents related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank s clients given the timing of this request and its subject matter the house democrats wrote credit suisse s action raises significant concerns that it may be concealing information about whether participants in the deal may be evading sanctions imposed by the west after russia s invasion of ukraine on this news

narong sutinkham istock via getty images finding a sustainable 8 dividend yield is not easy in todayÃ¢ s market you usually have to take on incredible risk that the cash payout will be cut this year or next to match the same rate as 40 year record yoy cpi gains currently whatÃ¢ s even harder to find is a growing semiconductor company that manufactures 100 of its goods in america well i have a pick that will give investors both of these rare setups nve corp nasdaq nvec is a company i have mentioned in the past with my latest full length presentation in october here its unique spintronic based sensors and couplers are put together in a small building in minnesota and shipped to the rest of the world the enterprise owns most of the basic patents on data memory storage using electron spin vs the standard electron charge inventions of the past this technology is more durable with fewer errors reading and writing while data remains constant even if a device is not plugged in or charged with energy all of these advantages are turning their bread and butter sensors into the top of the line inventions for medical devices and robotics management at first hoarded cash for a decade as the business expanded then nve decided in 2015 to send out large dividend checks supported by operating earnings and this cash stash so hereÃ¢ s the deal for investors that didnÃ¢ t exist in 2021Ã¢ business has been good for the company in 2021 22 as oems have shifted to buying nvec products because the supply chain for competing semiconductors and sensors is jammed up and unpredictable revenues earnings are climbing smartly and a new product line was introduced in 2021 taken together the operating future is bright for this company holding almost no liabilities and running some of the highest profit margins returns on capital of any publicly traded business in the u s when the tech wreck smoke clears in the coming months many will look back at all the bargains they missed the bottom line is new investors are getting a wonderful 8 dividend check every year on any nvec purchase price under 50 the technology crash of 2021 22 has pulled down nveÃ¢ s quote throwing the baby out with the bath water intelligent long term investors especially passive income minded ones should be overjoyed such an opportunity exists honestly i do not expect that this buy entry level will last for procrastinators assuming the immediate direction is not straight down for equities in general on wall street dividend story the company held a hoard of 55 million in cash at the end of march including short term investments and municipal bonds an amazingly low 3 million in total liabilities is also part of the successful operating equation against todayÃ¢ s 48 stock quote 11 in cash equal to 228 million in equity market capitalization itÃ¢ s hard to turn away from the investment proposition offered by the marketplace right now regardless of dividends nve achieved a record tying 3 00 eps in fiscal 2022 ending in march vs the present 4 00 dividend payout so you might ask yourself is the high dividend yield really sustainable when you dig deeper the answer is clearly yes what are the business trends the best summary of growth in underlying operations is taken from the q4 earnings press release on may 4th here total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 15 to 6 72 million from 5 86 million for the prior year quarter the increase was due to a 12 increase in product sales and a 104 increase in contract research and development revenue net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 22 to 3 82 million or 0 79 per diluted share compared to 3 13 million or 0 65 per share for the prior year quarter for fiscal 2022 total revenue increased 26 to 27 0 million from 21 4 million for the prior fiscal year the increase was due to a 26 increase in product sales and a 36 increase in contract research and development revenue net income increased 24 to 14 5 million or 3 00 per diluted share compared to 11 7 million or 2 42 per share for fiscal 2021 rising eps from either operating growth and or aggressive stock buybacks under 50 exchanging cash for undervalued ownership interests could easily push income Ã¢ perÃ¢ share well above the dividend payout rate later in calendar 2022 or early 2023 at a minimum stagnant income rates and the major cash position should support the dividend for another 11 years theoretically without the need to change operations or borrow funds overall i rate the dividend payout as one of the most secure in the smaller cap equity space on wall street the current 8 3 cash distribution yield is the best Ã¢ relativeÃ¢ position ever for nve investors since it began paying a dividend on the 1 year and 5 year

record earnings per share into march 2022 of 3 00 means the earnings yield available for new investors is the strongest in over a decade reviewing accounting statements of the last two quarters i am forecasting current business trends should support eps of 3 20 to 3 50 over the next 12 months depending on how the economy survives rising interest rates and oem demand fluctuates as a consequence of

substantial improvement since early may my read of the technical trading setup is nvec would like to move higher in price once the tech sell off fades stockcharts com final thoughts when you hunt around the stock market nve is truly a one of a kind investment vehicle in june 2022 you are getting a secure well above average 8 dividend yield but you are also buying a company with actual potential for outsized growth in the underlying business this one two punch is quite rare to find and now available to anyone reading this story hopefully you feel enlightened and motivated to do more research into the investment proposition nvec was dropped out of the russell 3000 index after the close last friday which likely explains recent price weakness and the huge spike in trading volume on friday for bulls price rising above the 50 day moving average is step one to begin a new uptrend what are the main risks to your nvec investment capital with little change in upper management the long time cfo retired last year or the board of directors year to year and consistent operating results over time i am not overly concerned about labor wage hikes with 50 total employees shipping costs or commodity input prices in fact robust growth last year in a variety of metrics should dispel usual company specific worries around macro cost issues however i feel the biggest risk to operating growth is order flow could weaken in a steep recession scenario globally spiking inflation and interest rates alongside their consumer business spending and investment valuation repercussions are real fears to contemplate the next important risk is a new invention or far cheaper product alternatives may one day appear vs nve products as far as i can tell such is not a present danger but bears close watch finally a continuing stock market tech crash would likely pull down the share quote just like the late 2021 and first half 2022 experience management appears confident the end of the pandemic will not hurt relationships or sales to the new customer base picked up during 2021 22 s semiconductor industry turmoil in fact happy customers may increase order totals and spread the word to others if the economy staves off deep recession other positives are the company pays no interest expense on debt and has a low fixed cost setup for manufacturing i can easily argue exaggerated inflation levels will quickly funnel to nve s bottom line as better profitability vs competitors forced to raise selling prices to cover increasing costs at faster overall rates pulling all the possible pros and cons together risk reward analysis heavily favors owning shares i think a price below 45 will be difficult to maintain unless we get a serious worldwide recession the stock quote is already discounting a minor recession in my view potential upside can be argued as unlimited if company sales remain in an uptrend but for argumentÃ¢ s sake i will put best case scenario upside at 80 in 12 18 months a tad above last yearÃ¢ s peak price using average ev to ebitda and revenue ratios the last decade or a normalized realistic dividend yield vs alternatives total return upside of 75 is possible over the next year vs worst case downside of 10 to me this setup is quite positive i own a minor nvec stake in my portfolio thanks for reading please consider this article a first step in your due diligence

municipals were lightly traded and little changed monday while u s treasury yields rose and equities ended in the red with the muni triple a yield curve unchanged out long and ust seeing small losses ratios dipped below 100 on the 30 year muni ust ratios were at 69 in five years 87 in 10 years and 98 in 30 according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the five at 70 the 10 at 87 and the 30 at 98 at a 4 p m read although we had a small rally we should still should understand the fact that we are still not at the bottom but we are almost there said jason wong vice president of municipals at amerivet securities with mounting concerns of a recession and the rally in treasuries in the last two weeks we could see munis follow suit as investors are starting to see buying opportunities average daily municipal securities rulemaking board trade volume rose 8 last week from the week prior and was 44 higher than the one year average average daily fixed rate bond trading was up 10 from the week ended june 17 said pat luby a senior municipal strategist at creditsights he notedthat the pace of institutional bid wanteds slowed down last week with the average daily total par amount down 26 from the prior week they were still 45 higher than the one year daily average per bloomberg data he noted the outperformance of munis undermined the relative value of tax exempts versus corporates said luby based on the bval benchmark yield curves for investors subject to the 21 federal corporate income tax tax exempt munis are still offering a modest advantage at the long end of the double and single a yield curves he noted if this week s higher quality new issues are priced at a concession to the benchmark curves he said yields could be competitive with comparably rated corporates which should attract incremental demand from credit investors seeking to add muni risk to their portfolios the calendar is larger to end the quarter at about 8 billion while 30 day visible supply sits at 13 47 billion yield levels on the front end of the curve now hover near 13 year highs noted morgan stanley investment strategists matthew gastall and daryl helsing in a report the higher yields are offering investors much higher taxable equivalent yields some callable five year moral obligations of states currently trade with highest bracket taxable equivalent yields of nearly 6 while certain high quality dedicated tax structures are presently offering 10 year yield kicks that touch teys of almost 9 for the high tax residents of their respective sovereigns they said yield levels they noted may keep rising while volatility persists but they think it continues to be an advantageous period for buy and hold investors of individual municipal bonds to gradually but selectively add exposure to our market maintaining such a long term perspective may prove itself to be beneficial now that recession risks loom municipal supply may soon decline and after the fed recently stressed that it is strongly committed to fighting inflation gastall and helsing wrote rather than succumbing to tunnel vision we feel it s important to consider the entire investment equation and maintain a long term focus individual investors currently enjoy the right of way to add some exposure before the summer due to municipal relative value ratios to usts bearish spring seasonals healthy public finance credit conditions and higher nominal interest rates they said munis outperformed this month s early ust weakness but healthy supply and laggard fund outflows recently helped the asset class to underperform interest rate movements yet again they said ten year triple a rated munis they said are currently offering nearly 90 of the yield of 10 year usts in spite of offering the federal tax exemption the long term average for this relationship is a lower 84 they noted investor interest and primary market activity often accelerate in the spring which frequently converges with lower reinvestment demand due to the absence of mid year year end coupon and maturity payments they said a bearish investment setting and elevated ratios often represent a buy signal particularly when strong revenue collections and the passage of healthy stimulus packages have helped to bolster many municipal credit profiles throughout the last two years according to gastall and helsing short end muni yields are now near their highest levels since 2008 not only are nominal rates of return higher but price volatility may be relatively limited for bonds whose maturities are set to be redeemed in the near future they said moving forward they noted that municipal prices may exhibit resiliency if economic recession risks increase new issue supply declines this summer and if the

since the creation of the us federal reserve over a century ago every major financial market collapse has been deliberately triggered for political motives by the central bank the situation is no different today as clearly the us fed is acting with its interest rate weapon to crash what is the greatest speculative financial bubble in human history a bubble it created global crash events always begin on the periphery such as with the 1931 austrian creditanstalt or the lehman bros failure in september 2008 the june 15 decision by the fed to impose the largest single rate hike in almost 30 years as financial markets are already in a meltdown now guarantees a global depression and worse the extent of the cheap credit bubble that the fed the ecb and bank of japan have engineered with buying up of bonds and maintaining unprecedented near zero or even negative interest rates for now 14 years is beyond imagination financial media cover it over with daily nonsense reporting while the world economy is being readied not for so called stagflation or recession what is coming now in the coming months barring a dramatic policy reversal is the worst economic depression in history to date thank you globalization and davos globalization the political pressures behind globalization and the creation of the world trade organization out of the bretton woods gatt trade rules with the 1994 marrakesh agreement ensured that the advanced industrial manufacturing of the west most especially the usa could flee offshore outsource to create production in extreme low wage countries no country offered more benefit in the late 1990s than china china joined who in 2001 and from then on the capital flows into china manufacture from the west have been staggering so too has been the buildup of china dollar debt now that global world financial structure based on record debt is all beginning to come apart when washington deliberately allowed the september 2008 lehman bros financial collapse the chinese leadership responded with panic and commissioned unprecedented credit to local governments to build infrastructure some of it was partly useful such as a network of high speed railways some of it was plainly wasteful such as construction of empty ghost cities for the rest of the world the unprecedented china demand for construction steel coal oil copper and such was welcome as fears of a global depression receded but the actions by the us fed and ecb after 2008 and of their respective governments did nothing to address the systemic financial abuse of the world s major private banks on wall street and europe as well as hong kong the august 1971 nixon decision to decouple the us dollar the world reserve currency from gold opened the floodgates to global money flows ever more permissive laws favoring uncontrolled financial speculation in the us and abroad were imposed at every turn from clinton s repeal of glass steagall at the behest of wall street in november 1999 that allowed creation of mega banks so large that the government declared them too big to fail that was a hoax but the population believed it and bailed them out with hundreds of billions in taxpayer money since the crisis of 2008 the fed and other major global central banks have created unprecedented credit so called helicopter money to bailout the major financial institutions the health of the real economy was not a goal in the case of the fed bank of japan ecb and bank of england a combined 25 trillion was injected into the banking system via quantitative easing purchase of bonds as well as dodgy assets like mortgage backed securities over the past 14 years quantitative madness here is where it began to go really bad the largest wall street banks such as jp morganchase wells fargo citigroup or in london hsbc or barclays lent billions to their major corporate clients the borrowers in turn used the liquidity not to invest in new manufacturing or mining technology but rather to inflate the value of their company stocks so called stock buy backs termed maximizing shareholder value blackrock fidelity banks and other investors loved the free ride from the onset of fed easing in 2008 to july 2020 some 5 trillions had been invested in such stock buybacks creating the greatest stock market rally in history everything became financialized in the process corporations paid out 3 8 trillion in dividends in the period from 2010 to 2019 companies like tesla which had never earned a profit became more valuable than ford and gm combined cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin reached market cap valuation over 1 trillion by late 2021 with fed money flowing freely banks and investment funds invested in high risk high profit areas like junk bonds or emerging market debt in places like turkey indonesia or yes china the post 2008 era of quantitative easing and zero fed interest rates led to absurd us government debt expansion since january 2020 the fed bank of england european central bank and bank of japan have injected a combined 9 trillion in near zero rate credit into the world banking system since a fed policy change in september 2019 it enabled washington to increase public debt by a staggering 10 trillion in less than 3 years then the fed again covertly bailed out wall street by buying 120 billion per month of us treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities creating a huge bond bubble a reckless biden administration began doling out trillions in so called stimulus money to combat needless lockdowns of the economy us federal debt went from a manageable 35 of gdp in 1980 to more than 129 of gdp today only the fed quantitative easing buying of trillions of us government and mortgage debt and the near zero rates made that possible now the fed has begun to unwind that and withdraw liquidity from the economy with qt or tightening plus rate hikes this is deliberate it is not about a stumbling fed mis judging inflation energy drives the collapse sadly the fed and other central bankers lie raising interest rates is not to cure inflation it is to force a global reset in control over the world s assets it s wealth whether real estate farmland commodity production industry even water the fed knows very well that inflation is only beginning to rip across the global economy what is unique is that now green energy mandates across the industrial world are driving this inflation crisis for the first time something deliberately ignored by washington or brussels or berlin the global shortages of fertilizers soaring prices of natural gas and grain supply losses from global draught or exploding costs of fertilizers and fuel or the war in ukraine guarantee that at latest this september october harvest time we will undergo a global additional food and energy price explosion those shortages all are a result of deliberate policies moreover far worse inflation is certain due to the pathological insistence of the world s leading industrial economies led by the biden administration s anti hydrocarbon agenda that agenda is typified by the astonishing nonsense of the us energy secretary stating buy e autos instead as the answer to exploding gasoline prices similarly the european union has decided to phase out russian oil and gas with no viable substitute as its leading economy germany moves to shut its last nuclear reactor and close more coal plants germany and other eu economies as a result will see power blackouts this winter and natural gas prices will continue to soar in the second week of june in germany gas prices rose another 60 alone both the green controlled german government and the green agenda fit for 55 by the eu commission continue to push unreliable and costly wind and solar at the expense of far cheaper and reliable hydrocarbons insuring an unprecedented energy led inflation fed has pulled the plug with the 0 75 fed rate hike largest in almost 30 years and promise of more to come the us central bank has now guaranteed a collapse of not merely the us debt bubble but also much of the post 2008 global debt of 303 trillion rising interest rates after almost 15 years mean collapsing bond values bonds not stocks are the heart of the global financial system us mortgage rates have now doubled in just 5 months to above 6 and home sales were already plunging before the latest rate hike us corporations took on record debt owing to the years of ultra low rates some 70 of that debt is rated just above junk status that corporate non financial debt totaled 9 trillion in 2006 today it exceeds 18 trillion now a large number of those marginal companies will not be able to rollover the old debt with new and bankruptcies will follow in coming months the cosmetics giant revlon just declared bankruptcy the highly speculative unregulated crypto market led by bitcoin is collapsing as investors realize there is no bailout there last november the crypto world had a 3 trillion valuation today it is less than half and with more collapse underway even before the latest fed rate hike the stock value of the us megabanks had lost some 300 billion now with stock market further panic selling guaranteed as a global economic collapse grows those banks are pre programmed for a new severe bank crisis over the coming months as us economist doug noland recently noted today there s a massive periphery loaded with subprime junk bonds leveraged loans buy now pay later auto credit card housing and solar securitizations franchise loans private credit crypto credit defi and on and on a massive infrastructure has evolved over this long cycle to spur consumption for tens of millions while financing thousands of uneconomic enterprises the periphery has become systemic like never before and things have started to break the federal government will now find its interest cost of carrying a record 30 trillion in federal debt far more costly unlike the 1930s great depression when federal debt was near nothing today the government especially since the biden budget measures is at the limits the us is becoming a third world economy if the fed no longer buys trillions of us debt who will china japan not likely deleveraging the bubble with the fed now imposing a quantitative tightening withdrawing tens of billions in bonds and other assets monthly as well as raising key interest rates financial markets have begun a deleveraging it will likely be jerky as key players like blackrock and fidelity seek to control the meltdown for their purposes but the direction is clear by late last year investors had borrowed almost 1 trillion in margin debt to buy stocks that was in a rising market now the opposite holds and margin borrowers are forced to give more collateral or sell their stocks to avoid default that feeds the coming meltdown with collapse of both stocks and bonds in coming months go the private retirement savings of tens of millions of americans in programs like 401 k credit card auto loans and other consumer debt in the usa has ballooned in the past decade to a record 4 3 trillion at end of 2021 now interest rates on that debt especially credit card will jump from an already high 16 defaults on those credit loans will skyrocket outside the us what we will see now as the swiss national bank bank of england and even ecb are forced to follow the fed raising rates is the global snowballing of defaults bankruptcies amid a soaring inflation which the central bank interest rates have no power to control about 27 of global nonfinancial corporate debt is held by chinese companies estimated at 23 trillion another 32 trillion corporate debt is held by us and eu companies now china is in the midst of its worst economic crisis since 30 years and little sign of recovery with the usa china s largest customer going into an economic depression china s crisis can only worsen that will not be good for the world economy italy with a national debt of 3 2 trillion has a debt to gdp of 150 only ecb negative interest rates have kept that from exploding in a new banking crisis now that explosion is pre programmed despite soothing words from lagarde of the ecb japan with a 260 debt level is the worst of all industrial nations and is in a trap of zero rates with more than 7 5 trillion public debt the yen is now falling seriously and destabilizing all of asia the heart of the world financial system contrary to popular belief is not stock markets it is bond markets government corporate and agency bonds this bond market has been losing value as inflation has soared and interest rates have risen since 2021 in the usa and eu globally this comprises some 250 trillion in asset value a sum that with every fed interest rise loses more value the last time we had such a major reverse in bond values was forty years ago in the paul volcker era with 20 interest rates to squeeze out inflation as bond prices fall the value of bank capital falls the most exposed to such a loss of value are major french banks along with deutsche bank in the eu along with the largest japanese banks us banks like jp morganchase are believed to be only slightly less exposed to a major bond crash much of their risk is hidden in off balance sheet derivatives and such however unlike in 2008 today central banks can t rerun another decade of zero interest rates and qe this time as insiders like ex bank of england head mark carney noted three years ago the crisis will be used to force the world to accept a new central bank digital currency a world where all money will be centrally issued and controlled this is also what davos wef people mean by their great reset it will not be good a global planned financial tsunami has just begun f william engdahl is

calculations according to cnn medical analyst dr leana wen we re in a phase in the pandemic where people need to make their own decisions based on their medical circumstances as well as their risk tolerance when it comes to contracting covid 19 according to cnn medical analyst dr leana wen there are other factors to weigh in addition to transmission rates according to wen another is what precautions are required and followed in the place that you re going and then the third is what are you planning to do once you re there she said are you planning to visit a lot of attractions and go to indoor bars that s very different from you re going somewhere where you re planning to lie on the beach all day and not interact with anyone else that s very different those are very different levels of risk vaccination is the most significant safety factor for travel since unvaccinated travelers are more likely to become ill and transmit covid 19 to others wen said and it s also important to consider what you would do if you end up testing positive away from home while us bound travelers no longer have to present a negative covid 19 test to get home from international destinations the cdc still advises testing before boarding flights back to the states and not traveling if you are sick of course if people have symptoms or exposure while traveling they need to get tested and if they

adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies we use adjusted ebitda as a financial metric to measure the financial performance of the business because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of its fundamental business activities for this reason we believe adjusted ebitda will also be useful to others including its stockholders as a valuable financial metric we present adjusted ebitda because we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful

when evaluating our performance and comparing our performance with that of our competitors we also use adjusted ebitda for planning purposes and to evaluate our financial performance because adjusted ebitda excludes certain incremental expenses or non cash items such as stock based compensation charges that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure and therefore a reconciliation between net loss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda has been provided in the financial results

the big japan short is back for traders betting against the boj bloomberg in tokyo s financial circles the trade is known as the widow maker and while it has done nothing but saddle young cocksure investors from london to new york with crippling losses over the past two decades ergo the name they re lining up once again to take a shot the bet is simple that the bank of japan under growing pressure to stabilize the yen as it sinks to a 24 year low will have to abandon its 0 25 cap on benchmark bond yields and let them soar just as they already have in the us canada europe and across much of the developing world the stakes are high a surge in rates in japan home to millions of savers who invest in bonds around the world would reverberate quickly across financial markets yields nearly everywhere would dart higher still analysts say pushing up borrowing costs for companies consumers and governments and heaping stress on a global economy that s already begun to sputter under the weight of soaring energy prices and snarled supply chains what s more on a broader level a loosening of the boj yield cap would signal something much bigger an end to the global era of ultra low interest rates japan was the first to usher in this period back in the 1990s years before any other country and today it s the lone holdout clinging desperately to a policy that its central bank chief haruhiko kuroda says is needed to bolster an economy that s been mired in a funk for decades japan is looking increasingly out of line with the global environment said arjun vij a portfolio manager at jpmorgan asset management in hong kong the boj will have to adjust the current policy framework at some point he added as the tumbling yen and rising import costs squeeze businesses and consumers vij said he s betting against japanese government bonds known as jgbs so too are schroders plc bluebay asset management and graticule asset management asia japan is the one market that s telling us to go short said kellie wood a fixed income money manager at schroders which oversees about 1 trillion bluebay chief investment officer mark dowding recently called the boj s so called yield curve control untenable while adam levinson s graticule said in a may investor letter that japan was one of its top markets for shorting global rates a graticule spokesman declined to comment further market strain as the wagers pile up they re starting to put strain on the more than 1 quadrillion yen 7 4 trillion japanese bond market futures were brought to the brink of a trading halt on june 15 as 10 year securities slumped the most since 2013 while 10 year yen interest rate swaps popular with international funds have blown past the central bank s 0 25 line in the sand one of the clearest signs yet that traders are convinced that japanese authorities will be forced to capitulate in the cash market overseas investors sold 4 8 trillion yen of japanese bonds in the week through june 17 the biggest weekly outflow in data going back to 2001 read more foreigners bail out of japan bonds at record pace on boj policy there s a second camp that s betting against japan through the currency market they borrow the yen and sell it hoping to drive it down in the process and then buy bonds overseas to pocket the yield differential because a boj policy shift would likely cause the yen to surge in the immediate aftermath they also short jgbs to hedge their near term risk this is according to edouard de langlade founder of macro hedge fund edl capital the real trade in japan holding firm in spite of all the market pressures kuroda has held firm insisting at the central bank s most recent gathering that it s too early to cut back on monetary easing with japan s economy still sputtering inflation while breaking above the central bank s 2 target for the first time since 2015 in april remains far from entrenched amid tepid wage growth he s said as the boj looks to move past its years long effort to ward off deflation he s also tried to brush aside suggestions that the central bank s yield cap is under threat boosting bond purchases to historic levels to defend it we can maintain our yield curve control even if yields rise abroad by buying as many bonds as needed kuroda said earlier this month the central bank has already accumulated around half of the government s long term debt in the process the outgoing boj governor is setting the stage for further monetary policy divergence with the federal reserve and other central banks around the world historic pain betting against the boj has confounded some of the biggest names in global finance in recent decades greenlight capital s david einhorn back in 2009 said japan s debt burden would lead to a government default while hayman capital management s kyle bass just a few months later predicted the collapse of the jgb market a decade and a half earlier david roche of financial consulting firm independent strategy forecast a surge in japanese yields that never came to pass it s called the widow maker trade for a reason and i have no intention of joining the ranks of such traders said crossbridge capital chief investment officer manish singh i wouldn t bet against the japan central bank printer he said adding they can print and print until shorts retreat while market watchers say the boj would probably adjust its yield cap before doing away with it outright the implications for global bond markets would nonetheless be profound higher domestic yields would encourage japanese households and institutions to sell their overseas assets and bring their investments back onshore that could impact everything from us corporate yields to demand for emerging market debt their holdings also include over 1 trillion of treasuries the largest stash of us government debt outside america rising borrowing costs would weigh on growth just as central bankers around the world are seeking to walk a fine line between tamping down inflation and avoiding a recession in the near term the move could unleash a wave of volatility much like australia s decision to scrap its curve control efforts last year or switzerland s move to abolish its currency cap without warning in 2015 while the boj ditching its yield cap isn t his base case the knock on effects of such a move would be felt the world over according to calvin yeoh a singapore based portfolio manager at blue edge advisors pte the global linkages between rates almost guarantees a negative shock to rates markets outside of japan yeoh said for a quicktake explainer on the yen s plunge click here as the yen continues its descent touching a 24 year low of 136 per dollar earlier this month traders are increasingly speculating what level will force the boj into action not withstanding kuroda s tough talk there s already been signs that policy makers are getting anxious the currency s plunge is amplifying already soaring food and energy prices and with national elections around the corner prime minister fumio kishida has boosted fuel subsidies to limit the pain likely aware that it needed to talk up the yen a little to give the government some help the boj made a rare reference to foreign exchange risks in its most recent policy decision kuroda has also toned down his insistence that the weakening yen is generally a positive for the japanese economy given the boost to it gives to exporter earnings famed economist nouriel roubini said last week that a tumble past 140 per dollar a level less than 4 away would likely be enough to trigger a policy shift schroders s wood meanwhile is waiting and watching ready to ratchet up her bets if there was any indication that they would be moving away from yield curve control we would certainly be adding to the shorts she said 2022 bloomberg l p

russia has defaulted on foreign debt for the first time since the bolshevik revolution more than a century ago further alienating the country from the global financial system amid its war in ukraine explainer what s the impact of a russian debt default by ken sweet kelvin chan and stan choeap business writersthe associated presslondon london ap russia has defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time since the bolshevik revolution more than a century ago further alienating the country from the global financial system following sanctions imposed over its war in ukraine moscow owed 100 million in interest on one bond priced in dollars and one priced in euros which was originally due may 27 a 30 day grace period expired sunday on monday the rating agency company moody s declared the country in default last month the u s treasury department ended russia s ability to pay its billions in debt back to international investors through american banks in response the russian finance ministry said it would pay dollar denominated debts in rubles and offer the opportunity for subsequent conversion into the original currency before moody s declaration it was largely believed that russia was in default for all practical purposes russia is in default said jay s auslander a sovereign debt lawyer at the firm of wilk auslander in new york the 30 day grace period has expired bondholders do not have their money russia says it has the money to pay its debts but western sanctions created artificial obstacles by freezing its foreign currency reserves held abroad kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters monday that there are no grounds to call this situation a default saying russia has paid but it could not be processed because of sanctions the other side argues that this happened because of sanctions but sanctions were fully in your control auslander said all of this was under your control because all you had to do was not invade ukraine here are key things to know about a russian default ___ how much does russia owe about 40 billion in foreign currency bonds about half of that sold to foreigner buyers before the start of the war russia had around 640 billion in foreign currency and gold reserves much of which was held overseas and is now frozen russia has not defaulted on its international debts since the bolshevik revolution when the russian empire collapsed and the soviet union was created russia defaulted on its domestic debts in the late 1990s but was able to recover from that default with the help of international aid russia has effectively been in default for months in the eyes of bond investors said liam peach an economist specializing in emerging european markets at capital economics insurance contracts that cover russian debt have priced a 80 likelihood of default for weeks and rating agencies like standard poor s and moody s have placed the country s debt deep into junk territory ___ how do you know if a country is in default rating agencies are typically the entities that will declare default in western financial markets which happened on monday a court also can decide the issue bondholders who have credit default swaps contracts that act like insurance policies against default can ask a committee of financial firm representatives to decide whether a failure to pay debt should trigger a payout which still isn t a formal declaration of default the credit derivatives determinations committees an industry group of banks and investment funds would likely flag a credit event peach said auslander agreed that the panel will declare russia in default in due time it ruled june 7 that russia had failed to pay required additional interest after making a payment on a bond after the april 4 due date but the committee put off taking further action due to uncertainty over how sanctions might affect any settlement ___ what can investors do the formal way to declare default is if 25 or more of bondholders say they didn t get their money once that happens provisions say all russia s other foreign bonds are also in default and bondholders could then seek a court judgment to enforce payment in normal circumstances investors and the defaulting government typically negotiate a settlement in which bondholders are given new bonds that are worth less but that at least give them some partial compensation but sanctions bar dealings with russia s finance ministry and no one knows when the war will end or how much defaulted bonds could wind up being worth in this case declaring default and suing might not be the wisest choice auslander said it s not possible to negotiate with russia and there are so many unknowns so creditors may decide to hang tight for now investors who wanted out of russian debt have probably already headed for the exits leaving those who may have bought bonds at knocked down prices in hopes of profiting from a settlement in the long run and they might want to keep a low profile for a while to avoid being associated with the war once a country defaults it can be cut off from bond market borrowing until the default is sorted out and investors regain confidence in the government s ability and willingness to pay but russia has already been cut off from western capital markets so any return to borrowing is a long way off anyway the kremlin can still borrow rubles at home where it mostly relies on russian banks to buy its bonds ___ what would be the impact of russia s default western sanctions over the war have sent foreign companies fleeing from russia and interrupted the country s trade and financial ties with the rest of the world default would be one more symptom of that isolation and disruption a default would not affect the russian economy right now because the country has not borrowed internationally in years amid sanctions and is making lots of money from exporting commodities like oil and natural gas said chris weafer a veteran russian economy analyst at consulting firm macro advisory but longer term when the war has resolved and russia tries to rebuild its economy this is where the legacy of default will be a problem it s a bit like if an individual or if a company gets a bad credit score it takes years to get over that he said investment analysts are cautiously reckoning that a russia default would not have the kind of impact on global financial markets and institutions that came from an earlier default in 1998 back then russia s default on domestic ruble bonds led the u s government to step in and get banks to bail out long term capital management a large u s hedge fund whose collapse it was feared could have shaken the wider financial and banking system holders of the bonds for instance funds that invest in emerging market bonds could take serious losses russia however played only a small role in emerging market bond indexes limiting the losses to fund investors the spillovers to the rest of the world should be limited peach said but a russian default could have a ripple effect by adding pressure on global debt markets and making investors more risk averse and less willing to advance money which very well could lead to further defaults in other emerging markets weafer said ___ sweet and choe reported from new york ap reporter aya batrawy contributed from dubai united arab

attempts to prevent moscow from paying its foreign debt may undermine the western financial system western media is reporting that russia is facing a default on its foreign debt for the first time since 1918 moscow was forced to make interest payments on bonds in rubles after washington blocked dollar payments what is russia s reaction to default claims moscow has rejected the assertions and has accused washington of trying to engineer an artificial default explaining that the country is willing and able to service its foreign debt the transition to ruble payments does not imply a debt default finance minister anton siluanov has stressed how does moscow plan to service its foreign debt under a new payment mechanism which was recently announced and signed into law by president vladimir putin moscow considers its obligations completed if they are fulfilled in rubles in an amount equivalent to the value of obligations in foreign currency at the exchange rate on the day the funds are transferred to the central depository nsd through which they will be paid to creditors why is russia making bond payments in rubles in may the us ended a bond payment waiver that had allowed moscow to service its debt in dollars the russian finance ministry subsequently said that in order to defend its reputation as a reliable borrower russia would service its eurobond obligations in the national currency the ruble if it were unable to pay in foreign currency what does being in default mean for a country countries in default cannot borrow money cheaply through international financial institutions because they are considered a risk how does that impact russia there is no reason for moscow to issue bonds the country runs a low debt of around 16 of gdp because it traditionally doesn t rely heavily on borrowing in comparison most western countries run debts close or well over to 100 of their gdp how much damage does a default do to the country s economy in terms of the western financial system it doesn t matter sanctions make it impossible for russia to trade as it used to most western companies have pulled out and borrowing money from western financial institutions is not possible this makes russia s credit rating in the west meaningless how does this impact russia s remaining trade partners in terms of china india and other major partners it has no negative effect russia s trade with its brics partners has grown by almost 40 in the first quarter of 2022 from the 164 billion reached last year russia s trade partners have been eager to replace western businesses in russia what are moscow s alternatives to borrowing in western institutions financial institutions such as the brics new development bank ndb which was established by the member states brazil russia india china and south africa with the aim of financing infrastructure and development projects in emerging nations could be a good option for russia what s the potential fallout the west denies that a possible russian default could have the kind of impact on global financial markets and institutions that came from an earlier default on domestic debt in 1998 back then russia s default on ruble bonds pushed the us government to step in and get banks to bail out a major american hedge fund whose collapse it was feared could have shaken the wider financial system however investment analysts acknowledge that holders of russian bonds could take serious losses as a result of western actions and file lawsuits against the us government which prevented russia s dollar payments moscow points out that attempts to push russia into default only undermines the reputation of the western financial system for more stories on economy finance visit rt s business section rt com

deliveries outlook as a result while the year started out with 1 5 million to 1 6 million units as the bogey for 2022 deliveries with a stretch goal of 1 7 million now the whisper bogey is closer to 1 4 million for the year given the china issues coupled by global supply chain issues he wrote in a report to clients ives added that the elephant in the room for tesla and the broader market is with dark economic storm clouds on the horizon however he remains confident about tesla s overall demand picture staying firm austin berlin factories launch the ev maker opened its austin texas factory in

battery shortages and supply disruptions from china musk also said that tesla has struggled to ramp up production in austin of model y suvs that use its new 4680 cells and structurally integrated battery pack it has instead had to pivot to using older 2170 cells to keep pushing out cars meanwhile bloomberg reported tuesday tesla laid off hundreds of autopilot employees the report said 200 of

two years after argentina emerged from its latest default a debt crisis in brewing once again this time the immediate trouble is in the local bond market where creditors have become reluctant to roll over maturing government bonds with spending still high and the leftist government under pressure from the imf to stop hitting up the central bank for cheap loans to cover its budget deficit there s a growing sense in buenos aires that officials are running out of financing options and that a local bond restructuring is becoming all but inevitable part of the problem is rooted in the fact that the value of the vast bulk of the bonds is linked to inflation the lone security that crisis scarred investors have found appealing so the explosion in inflation rather than providing a big dose of debt relief as it has for governments across the globe this year is actually further straining fiscal coffers consumer prices are soaring at an annual pace of more than 60 percent here this year the fastest rate this century and one of the highest in the world a government bond auction scheduled for tuesday will provide a look at just how acute the crunch has become the government is looking to sell some 250 billion pesos us 2 billion of inflation linked notes and other securities demand has sagged at recent auctions and yields on the notes have soared above 12 percent in secondary market trading providing an all in rate of more than 70 percent at current inflation rates at the same time demand for dollars is surging sinking the parallel peso to record lows almost daily in a clear sign that investors are redeeming their bonds and whisking the cash offshore all of this is catching the attention of argentina s foreign bondholders too the government has no major payments due on those bonds for years but still investors are getting anxious pushing down the price on benchmark securities to just 23 cents on the dollar at that price they yield 21 percent making the country one of almost two dozen emerging market nations that has now sunk deep into distressed territory a level that signals investors are starting to brace for the possibility of default this is old hat by now for argentine creditors the country has defaulted on its foreign bonds three times this century most recently in a 2020 restructuring deal that gave investors just over 50 cents on the dollar the path forward for argentina to accumulate enough international reserves to make the principal payments on its overseas debt in the coming years looks increasingly narrow said jared lou a portfolio manager at william blair investment management in new york the restructuring last time around was flawed as it offered debt relief and low coupons without any reforms and here is where we are today the government is taking steps to defuse the local debt time bomb on june 22 the economy ministry exchanged more than half of its 600 billion pesos us 4 8 billion in local obligations due at the end of the month in a swap that drastically reduced pressure for tuesday s key rollover but even though the government exchanged more than expected most of the participation came from public institutions it s far from certain that private creditors will be as enthusiastic the sell off in local debt had been building as argentines prepared to make june tax payments and accelerated after comments from the opposition casting doubt on the debt s sustainability a senior economy ministry official said argentina is planning new measures in the coming days to stabilise the local market according to the person who asked not to be identified discussing the matter economy minister martÃ­n guzmÃ¡n has said repeatedly that the government will never stop paying its local debt but it could be difficult given the targets laid out in the nation s us 44 billion loan programme with the international monetary fund the programme limits argentina s monetary emission to one percent of gross domestic product this year cutting off a key source of central bank financing to pay the local debt amid all the recent market volatility efforts to strengthen the peso debt market remain critical alongside steadfast implementation of fiscal targets imf managing director kristalina georgieva said last week argentina has been slow to hike interest rates in an economy still struggling to leave its pandemic induced doldrums growth slowed in the first three months of this year from the previous quarter as the agriculture sector contracted and exports dropped the central bank raised its key interest rate three percentage points to 52 percent earlier this month to prod investors into buying local securities still it may not be enough to avoid a debt crisis before presidential elections in october 2023 as investors demand increasingly shorter dated paper according to ramiro blazquez the head of strategy for broker banctrust co in buenos aires shorter and shorter maturities could build into a debt crisis before the elections blazquez said to avoid that scenario the government will likely resort to a combination of arm twisting and moderate rate hikes to ensure decent rollover rates but success is by no means guaranteed tuesday s sale will mostly consist of inflation linked and discount treasury notes due later this year argentina is also selling dollar linked bonds maturing in 2023 and 2024 as long as the prices are reasonable and the treasury issues short dated instruments most of what needs to be rolled over should be rolled over said carolina gialdi head of international markets sales and trading at max capital in buenos aires but investors are showing a preference for higher liquidity so they may not get to 100 percent by scott squires bloomberg
