the us central bank is leading us to the greatest financial disaster in the history of the world but most people don t even imagine how devastating will be the future that awaits us in a recent article the financial expert and founder of matterhorn asset management and gold switzerland egon von greyerz has described how the federal reserve has cursed the united states of america by debasing the value of our currency the downfall of our republic has started exactly 50 years ago when central bankers and nixon decided to turn all real assets including gold into worthless paper creating the perfect setup for an irreversible financial catastrophe that decision came at a cost that nixon probably wasn t anticipating since 1971 after hundreds of trillions of artificial dollars started to be injected into the economy and financial markets the dollar has seen its value collapse by 98 percent many other leaders throughout history have done what nixon did and if he d known this before he would have realized that no currency has ever survived to this sort of monetary policy when will they ever learn apparently the answer is never history can only teach lessons for those who are willing to listen the story repeats itself because our leaders insist to make the same mistakes under these policies every single currency throughout history has been debased until it has reached zero value as von greyerz outlines the fact that since the 1960s the us government has increased the federal debt by the trillions every year is a clear sign of chronic disease and that something is terminally broken in our system the big problem is that as opposed to other countries who faced a similar decay because of the size of the us economy and the reserve currency status of the dollar the consequences are remarkably deeper and much more threatening we are now witnessing the growth of the most splendid financial bubble ever recorded but at this point it is not just central banks blowing bubbles the whole world has become a bubble as the derivatives bubble explodes or rather implodes in the next few years more and more money will be printed by central banks in a futile attempt to save the financial system what they fail to realize is that the more they add money into the system the bigger the imbalances get against this backdrop it becomes impossible to fight the growth of asset bubbles and inflation we re faded to a never ending cycle of debt booms and busts according to von greyerz our current monetary system will collapse at some point between 2025 and 2030 marking the end of a major economic era when a hyperinflationary central bank endgame starts which will be followed by a depressionary implosion the deterioration will happen very quickly investors won t have time to run for the exits and american workers will see their life savings gone with the wind that s why wealth protection should be a top priority for anyone living in these troubled times in several of our previous videos we have been reporting the warnings of several economists market watchers financial analysts and veteran investors who have been telling us that we re in the middle of the biggest financial bubble in all history and it s time to learn with history that such speculative bubbles always pop there is no exception every speculative bubble mania regardless of its alleged uniqueness ends up bursting investors try to convince themselves that it s different this time but no bubble has ever reached a permanently high plateau and then remained on the plateau for years and what is our central bank doing right now it is adding more fuel to a range of already overly inflated bubbles including housing stocks and bonds the situation has gotten so out of hand that according to updated estimates the us government spends 875 million every hour in 2021 and up until now a staggering number of 1 7 billion were spent between central banks and the us government to prevent a stock market crash and an economic disaster but things are getting increasingly unsustainable and one single systemic failure can lead to the simultaneous explosion of all asset bubbles it s time to face the truth this time will not be different and central banks are about to trigger an apocalyptic endgame that will mark the end of an era we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us
what surprised texas retiree kathy hardman most was not that she got covid 19 five months after being fully vaccinated and it was not even that she qualified to receive an increasingly popular yet still largely unfamiliar experimental treatment that had been prescribed to some of the most powerful people in the country what shocked the 66 year old grandmother of four was that the monoclonal antibody infusion therapy estimated to decrease chances of hospitalization by up to 70 was available to her at her hometown hospital in mount pleasant a community of 15 000 in rural northeast texas it s amazing to me that we have this available to us in little old titus county hardman said on friday less than 24 hours after she was diagnosed and got her infusion at titus regional medical center the infusions are in fact more available and accessible to texans than ever before with ever loosening restrictions on who may qualify more people hearing about them and an increasing number of doctors across the state learning about the therapy and prescribing it to their patients suffering from covid 19 the regeneron treatment the therapy being used by state run infusion centers was used by both then president trump last fall and gov greg abbott last week after they each were diagnosed with covid 19 houston area congressman troy nehls posted on social media he received the treatment saturday after testing positive for the virus the therapy uses antibodies developed in a lab and injected into the patient usually through an iv drip to help their own antibodies fight the virus abbott and other state leaders including the directors of the state s health department and emergency management divisions have pushed the experimental infusion therapy since it was given emergency use authorization for certain patients by the u s food and drug administration in november but after a slow response by an initially skeptical medical community and by hospitals that were too overwhelmed by the pandemic to devote time or space to offer the hourslong treatment appointments the therapy is finally being recognized as an important part of the arsenal against a virus that has roared back this summer demand has increased across the country as covid 19 cases have exploded the therapy s distributor amerisourcebergen has sent 136 932 treatment courses of monoclonal antibody therapies to texas since december more than a quarter of them nearly 37 000 treatment doses made by regeneron arrived this month according to the texas department of state health services there are now about 140 doctors offices hospitals clinics and infusion centers in texas that can not only administer the drug but order it directly from the company making it easier to keep it in stock the treatment is free for patients who are required to have a prescription and meet certain guidelines we prescribe it all the time said dr emily briggs a private physician in new braunfels who was hesitant about the therapy at first but began prescribing it in march after learning more about it we re using it a lot the unfortunate truth is that my patients who are unwilling to get the vaccine want us to throw everything at them when they get this virus and more are catching the virus every day in texas where the delta variant is being blamed for what health care officials describe as the worst surge in infections that the state has seen since the pandemic began the result is twofold a spike in hospitalizations of unvaccinated people who represent more than half of the texas population but more than 95 of patients hospitalized with covid 19 and a strain on intensive care units more than 100 hospitals have reported few or no icu beds available in the past week on thursday 10 772 new confirmed cases and 3 285 new probable cases were reported across the state and 12 841 people were in texas hospitals with covid 19 those grim statistics are the main motivator behind the sudden re emergence of previously shuttered mass infusion centers as a primary tool in helping keep the hospital system from buckling under the strain of too many patients most of the centers supported by the texas division of emergency management that had opened at the end of 2020 and early 2021 were closed or turned over to locals months ago when hospitalizations and deaths dropped in the wake of mass vaccination efforts mobile treatment units and hospitals kept offering infusions but the mass centers weren t needed as much because the hospitals were able to handle patient loads once again in june texas providers received fewer than 2 000 monoclonal antibody treatment courses according to the texas department of state health services throughout the january surge abbott and other state leaders criticized the low rate of prescriptions that physicians were writing for the therapies which were arriving to the state on a weekly allotment through the u s department of health and human services state and national leaders repeatedly suggested that part of the reason hospitals were becoming overwhelmed during the winter surge was that not enough doctors were prescribing the treatment which they argued could keep patients from requiring a hospital bed physicians at the time complained that the criteria set by the u s food and drug administration and the manufacturers of the treatment limited their ability to prescribe it a patient s age the timing of their symptoms and their risk factors all had to be considered doctors said too few met all the criteria and some patients weren t showing up at their offices early enough after the onsent of symptoms for the therapy to work properly several like briggs the new braunfels physician did not want to use their patients like guinea pigs and preferred to wait until the therapies were more proven then delta hit driving hospitalizations back up and this time the health care community is embracing antibody therapy and even encouraging each other to use it by putting together public awareness campaigns and training sessions on thursday night nearly 250 people attended a private virtual town hall for the medical community hosted by the travis county medical society and the dell medical center at the university of texas at austin its purpose to answer questions from doctors and nurses about the therapy and encourage them to start prescribing it in may the fda expanded the criteria for who can receive it dropping the qualifying age from 55 to 12 which gave more discretion to the doctors who would be writing the prescriptions the changes also included new weight guidelines that allow some 75 of texans to qualify to receive it the majority of texans are overweight which increases the risk of hospitalization for covid patients regeneron is most effective on people with covid 19 who have had symptoms for less than 10 days but the fda s broad guidelines largely leave the decision of who should receive it up to physicians health officials say in an email to staff at houston methodist hospital system on wednesday dr robert a phillips executive vice president and chief physician executive said the hospital has scheduled 867 infusions for this week more than double the highest number for a single week during the last surge the texas department of state health services sent houston methodist 17 nurses to help administer the treatment he said in the email they arrived last week as you may know gov abbott is receiving monoclonal antibody treatment after testing positive for covid 19 this likely will bring more attention to this treatment which has proven to cut down on hospitalizations he wrote nim kidd chief of the texas division of emergency management said he s glad to see the enthusiasm we ve been trying to push these therapies for all texans all along he said they work i m a 100 believer in that personally doctors and state leaders point out that the benefits of the infusion last only about three months and that it should not be used as a substitute for vaccines we are continuing to focus on vaccines as the goal kidd said the mass infusion center at the bexar county fairgrounds near san antonio had closed in march but reopened on aug 10 and in just over a week more than 500 people showed up with prescriptions for the infusions county officials said there are nearly 1 400 people in san antonio area hospitals with covid 19 just under the peak the county saw in january bexar county judge nelson wolff said daily new hospitalization admissions have been holding fairly steady in recent days instead of climbing exponentially as they have been for the past month and he says it s likely that the antibody infusions are contributing to that it is a significant tool wolff said what it does is it helps keep people out of the hospital so i think we re beginning to see some effect of that at titus regional in mount pleasant dr fritz thurmond believes the same thurmond oversees all covid 19 related operations at the hospital which for weeks has been teetering on the edge of its capacity in a county that s only 28 vaccinated the number of daily antibody infusions has more than tripled what they were administering earlier in the year officials there said the hospital has done about 160 in the past three weeks the therapy s remarkable efficacy at keeping people with covid symptoms from becoming seriously ill is likely helping the hospital avoid a critical tipping point thurmond said it s kept people out of the hospital and you know that real estate especially now is almost unavailable anywhere thurmond said hardman the mount pleasant patient experienced symptoms for just a few days before she had a fever over 101 degrees body aches and other flu symptoms within a few hours of the treatment on thursday evening her fever was gone by friday she said she felt almost normal it feels like a miracle she said i m so very grateful i ve told all of my friends retirees if you get covid go do this now that the therapy is much more mainstream than it was six months ago the idea that only the exceptionally needy or the extremely influential can get it isn t true anymore thurmond said the reality is that the rest of us can get it too he said from the texas tribune copyright 2021 kut 90 5 to see more visit kut 90 5

president biden s proposal for a new death tax to help pay for his 3 5 trillion social welfare expansion is hitting resistance from members of congress including a top farm state democrat who warns that the tax will hurt family farms the proposal would change the way capital gains are calculated on inherited assets worth more than 1 million taking a bigger bite out of inherited stocks real estate businesses and farms of all the proposed tax increases to help pay for mr biden s bigger welfare state this one would have the greatest impact and rake in an estimated 800 billion in revenue mr biden has said he would give breaks to certain family owned businesses possibly farms but that hasn t sold the idea for house agriculture committee chairman david scott georgia democrat i am very concerned that proposals to pay for these investments could partially come on the backs of our food fiber and fuel producers mr scott wrote to mr biden in june on the eve of the house s first planned vote on the 3 5 trillion budget bill the lawmaker s worries had not been allayed a spokesman said proprietors of small businesses also are worried far left lawmakers such as sens bernard sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts have said a repeal of what is known as step up basis would finally make millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share the calculation would apply the capital gains tax to the increased value of an asset during the deceased s lifetime inheritance currently is subject to a capital gains tax on the asset s value at the time of death or its step up basis pat mcdowell said the tax would spell the end of the mcdowell ranch which he owns with his two brothers in central texas the brothers want to pass the ranch to their niece to keep it in the family as it has been for five generations if the proposed tax is approved she would have to sell off part of the ranch just to pay the death tax he said then there might not be enough ranch left to thrive this plan punishes our family just because we want the next generation to be able to make a living in agriculture mr mcdowelll said the federal government already imposes a death tax on the total value of an inheritance but only 50 of 31 000 farms whose owners died last year were subject to the tax according to the agriculture department more farms businesses and estates are expected to be taxed under mr biden s proposal the tax kicks in when the deceased has a net worth of 11 7 million or more and it applies a 40 tax after the first 1 million in taxable assets the biden death tax would apply a 40 8 capital gains tax to inherited assets with an exemption for the first 1 million and another 250 000 exemption for a personal residence married couples would get a 2 million exemption and the exemption for their residence according to the proposal details of the 3 5 trillion budget bill including inheritance tax are still being finalized the house is preparing to vote tuesday to advance the package agree to its price and send it to committees to work out the details democrats plan to pass the bill in party line votes in the house and senate they will use a special budget procedure known as reconciliation which allows the senate to avoid the 60 vote hurdle that most legislation must clear instead senate democrats plan to pass the legislation with a simple 51 vote majority with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie that is the only way democrats can get the liberal wish list of anti poverty education and health care programs through the evenly split senate liberals for years have been pushing for higher taxes on the wealthy to fund more benefits for working class americans the left leaning center on budget and policy priorities argued that the current inheritance tax is unfair because it lets those who are rich enough to own valuable real estate stocks or businesses escape taxes as their wealth grows the group pointed to amazon founder jeff bezos who paid income taxes on his 81 840 salary last year at death under current tax law mr bezos heirs would not have to pay taxes on the 100 billion that his amazon stock generated from 2010 to 2018 their estimates were based on securities and exchange commission filings in addition to taxing the full appreciation of inherited assets mr biden proposes increasing the rate of the capital gains tax to 40 8 from 23 8 the tax bill on an inherited 100 million estate could nearly double to 61 1 million according to the conservative tax foundation mr biden promised to soften the impact by delaying the tax for some family owned businesses until the business is sold to someone outside the family however neither he nor congressional democrats released details of such a plan families in agriculture and other small businesses feel this tax hike is about punishing them and know that democrats are unlikely to provide any exemption said rep kevin brady of texas the top republican on the tax writing house ways and means committee kery murakami can be reached at kmurakami washingtontimes com

written by jonas sterling mcgaha founder the sterling realty group the dc real estate market has been breaking historic records in 2021 with listing and offer prices at all time highs and inventory volume and time on market at all time lows the district has never seen anything quite like the current market leaving homeowners wondering if now is the time to sell or if they re better off waiting for the market to calm any dc homeowner on the fence about selling now should consider the following five factors before making their decision 1 fall is one of the best times to sell august and september can be a bit slow on the dc real estate market sellers are competing against the sweltering heat summer vacation plans an influx of tourists chasing locals away and back to school chaos but every year the market turns upward as the area heads into the pleasant autumn season according to the real estate data firm homelight october is the best month of the year to sell your house fast in dc but that window of opportunity in the autumn closes quickly as the december through march period becomes the slowest time of the year for dc house sales homeowners who wish to sell need to start the listing process now so their house can be on the market during that coveted october timeframe if you miss the october listing window you risk being stuck on the market during the winter months when both dc and its housing market are ice cold 2 record low mortgage rates are ending low mortgage rates help new buyers afford houses pushing them into the market sooner and allowing them to buy bigger homes according to long and foster the mortgage on a 600k house would be 1500 less per month today than it was in 2000 thanks just to low interest rates millennials the largest generation in american history have been slow to become homeowners due to economic recessions stagnant wages and heavy student loan debt but thanks to low mortgage rates and improved savings during covid millennials have recently been flooding into the market as first time buyers the entry of these younger folks into the market has been like a shot of adrenaline for the housing market helping to spur the recent market rise but all good things must come to an end and according to forbes the end of the housing boom will be when mortgage rates rise these rates are likely to rise when financial markets anticipate more inflation and action by the federal reserve to stem inflation thanks to multiple rounds of covid related economic stimulus america is at risk of rising inflation the labor department recently announced that consumer prices jumped another 5 in july the largest jump since 2008 earlier this year inflation rates were at a higher level 4 than mortgage rates 3 an economic statistic that has not been seen since 1980 the federal reserve combats inflation by increasing interest rates with the current fed rate around zero percent and inflation on the rise there is nowhere for the fed to go with interest rates except up when the fed raises interest rates mortgage rates will increase along with it homes will become less affordable and the housing market will cool dc realtor angela allison agrees it s smart to get on market while the rates are so low the rates are going to go up they have to go up and we re going to start to see a turn in buyer demand it s so crazy how this market turns on a dime it can shift that much that quick get on now because we really don t know what s going to happen in the fall 3 the supply of homes is rising one well known impact of an item being in low supply and high demand is that the price of that item rises the price continues to rise until it reaches a point where even the most enthusiastic and motivated buyer says yeah i m not paying that much or as is often the case in home buying mortgage underwriters say yeah we re not cutting a check this big for that house according to data from the federal reserve board the housing market held just 3 5 months worth of inventory in october 2020 the lowest amount of inventory in history during 2021 the amount of inventory has been steadily rising and as of june 6 3 months worth of inventory are on the market this rising supply means more options for buyers weakening the seller s market of the past year and it counts as another sign that the market is starting to cool a looming foreclosure surge is also on the horizon right now mortgage forbearances and bans on evictions and foreclosures have been keeping the supply of low priced foreclosures off the market these safety nets will be ending soon and homeowners who have already walked away from their homes or who have suffered a long term loss of income will be headed towards short sales and foreclosure auctions when the pent up foreclosure supply is finally released buyers will have even more options to choose from and traditional sellers may have to start lowering prices to stay competitive finally after taking a pause due to covid and skyrocketing lumber prices the new home construction industry is expected to have a busy year the mortgage bankers association mba predicts that 1 1 million new homes will be built in 2021 a rate not seen since 2007 according to lawrence yun chief economist at the national association of realtors most large builders have record or near record backlogs of new homes under contract and waiting to be built these new homes will also add to the rising supply of houses with the supply of homes rising quickly homeowners who delay putting their homes up for sale are at risk of having their listings get lost in the middle of a deluge of competing properties flooding the market instead the seller s goal should be to enter the market before the anticipated spike in housing supply 4 covid is ending today s hot market was sparked by the covid pandemic fears of the virus kept buyers and sellers in lockdown and that pent up demand finally exploded once covid restrictions were relaxed the covid related economic stimulus drove down mortgage rates making homes more affordable in addition the increase in working from home has caused homeowners to rethink how many rooms they need where they want to live and what kind of house they could buy with their budget the media has labeled this phenomenon the great re shuffling being able to work from home has caused an unprecedented exit from cities as buyers seek bigger homes at cheaper prices in the suburbs with dc vaccination rates approaching 70 and president joe biden pushing federal employees to get vaccinated the dc area should be able to weather the recent storm caused by the covid delta variant schools are expected to open up on 8 30 allowing many parents to return to the workforce and unemployment is expected to continue to drop given this positive economic outlook certain congressmen have said they do not expect any more federal stimulus all of this means that the pandemic is coming to an end and life should start to look like the so called old normal again this also is likely to mean a return to the old normal in the housing market with prices dropping over the winter back to the range of pre covid levels any homeowners thinking about selling should jump into the market now before covid and its pumped up housing prices come to an end 5 the dc market is hot right now the dc area is currently under an excessive heat weather warning as the heat index reaches a sticky 110 degrees approaching an all time record the dc real estate market is just as hot as the recent weather dc home prices have reached a median home price of 700k which is an all time record and up 12 from last year dc had 1 123 closed sales last month which is a 10 year high and up 23 from the norm dc homes sat on the market for only 7 days also a 10 year record the above numbers show we are still in a strong seller s market all signs point to these record market highs continuing for another few months but it is unlikely the market peak will survive the cold dc winter winter is coming homeowners on the fence about selling should make a decision quickly because the upcoming october peak buying season may be the last hurrah for this hot market if you miss this autumn window you may be waiting until spring to sell it s unclear what the market conditions will be like this coming spring mortgage rates will probably be up the supply of houses will likely be high due to foreclosures and new construction coming into inventory and covid will hopefully be behind us all of these factors are likely to be a drag on the dc housing market meaning spring sellers may not be able to profit from the best prices the dc area has ever seen recommended stories

pfizer has made clear that it s willing to open its checkbook to support growth opportunities and on monday the pharmaceutical giant unveiled its latest such deal a 2 3 billion agreement to acquire clinical stage trillium therapeutics a biotech taking a novel approach to cancer immunotherapy trillium is developing drugs that target cd47 a protein that sends out a signal that macrophages a pathogen chomping immune cell reads as don t eat me blocking this signal enables macrophages to see cancers cells as targets several companies large and small are developing drugs that also work in this manner but andy schmeltz oncology global president for pfizer said that trillium s molecules have the potential to be safer and more effective than others in this emerging class sponsored post behavioral health interoperability and econsent meeting the demands of cms final rule compliance in a webinar on april 16 at 1pm et aneesh chopra will moderate a discussion with executives from docusign velatura and behavioral health providers on econsent health information exchange and compliance with the cms final rule on interoperability while we re not first from the way it looks today we are very bullish on the best in class opportunity he said speaking on a conference call monday according to terms of the acquisition agreement pfizer will pay 18 50 for each share of trillium that it doesn t already own that s a more than 200 premium to the stock s 6 09 closing price last friday but that purchase price is still less than the 20 96 per share peak the company has reached in the past year in the past month shares of the biotech have been trading much closer to their 52 week low well below the 10 88 per share price pfizer paid last year when it made a 25 million equity investment in trillium trillium which splits its operations between mississauga ontario and cambridge massachusetts has two cd47 targeting drugs in early clinical development tti 622 and tti 621 are both fusion proteins designed to block cd47 but blocking the don t eat me signal is just half the battle the trillium molecules also engage a receptor on macrophages that triggers an eat me signal schmeltz said these drugs have demonstrated early promise in blood cancers whose cells express cd47 proteins in substantial amounts he added that these drugs are also showing potential for use in solid tumors which have been a harder target for immunotherapies in april trillium reported preliminary data from a 43 patient phase 1b 2 study testing both of its molecules in patients whose lymphoma had relapsed or has been resistant to treatment the overall response rate to tti 622 was 33 that response was observed across multiple types of lymphomas in updated data through late july the durability and efficacy of the treatment continued with a response rate of 30 for tti 621 the first cut of data in april showed that the overall response rate in relapsed or refractory t cell and b cell lymphomas was 18 to 29 pfizer did not report updated july data for that molecule sponsored content a deep dive into specialty pharma a specialty drug is a class of prescription medications used to treat complex chronic or rare medical conditions although this classification was originally intended to define the treatment of rare also termed orphan diseases affecting fewer than 200 000 people in the us more recently specialty drugs have emerged as the cornerstone of treatment for chronic and complex diseases such as cancer autoimmune conditions diabetes hepatitis c and hiv aids in addition to efficacy and durability the trillium molecules are also hitting key safety measures one of the challenges for drugs that block cd47 is that this protein is also found on red blood cells so these oxygen carrying cells of the blood can also be targeted when that happens patients develop anemia jeff settleman pfizer s oncology chief scientific officer said both tti 622 and tti 621 have shown minimal binding to red blood cells those results suggest the trillium molecules could reduce the risk of anemia compared to other cd47 targeting drugs while improving the therapeutic index how much of a drug can be used to provide benefit before toxicity gets too high we believe it will be possible to deliver a lower but still effective dose of these molecules settleman said settleman added the trillium molecules hold potential as monotherapies or as as part of drug combinations with currently approved pfizer drugs and candidates still in the pipeline other companies have similar ideas cd47 has become an attractive target as companies look to expand beyond checkpoint inhibitors a class of immunotherapies that block pd1 or pd l1 gilead sciences is the furthest along of cd47 targeting companies with magrolimab an antibody that the company added to its pipeline last year via its 4 9 billion acquisition of menlo park california based forty seven magrolimab is currently in late stage clinical development for myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia others in the chase with cd47 blocking drugs include abbvie which is partnered with i mab that shanghai based biotech s drug also an antibody is in early clinical development pfizer has been swinging deals to bolster its cancer drug pipeline a month ago the new york based pharma giant announced a 1 billion commitment to clinical stage arvinas in an alliance focused on the development and commercialization of that company s lead drug in breast cancer arvinas is developing drugs based on targeted protein degradation which harnesses a cellular process for disposing of old proteins as a way of getting rid of proteins that cause disease the trillium acquisition will require the approval of two thirds of that company

re thai economy nearing do it or die opinion aug 19 chartchai parasuk was incorrect in a number of his assertions targeted stimulus can have a strong multiplier effect research by the us department of agriculture shows that in the us food stamps officially the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap have the strongest fastest multiplier effect of any fiscal stimulus estimated at 1 79x us 1 allotted to food stamps adds to gdp by 1 79 cash transfers to low income demographics is good policy both economically and morally furthermore low income demographics are much more likely to spend on goods and services produced in country than on imports the effectiveness of us stimulus is sharply reduced due to american political realities furthermore much of recent budgets went not to stimulus per se but to life support preventing companies from going bankrupt and minimising lay offs in the private sector liquidity in thailand s financial market is not tight the benchmark thai government 10 year bond yield is currently below 1 6 percent so low that it s almost free if there were any risk of crowding out private sector demand for funding bond yields would be much higher and so long as the long term cost of servicing debt is lower than long term nominal gdp growth there is not a high price to pay in the future modest inflation will eat away at the effective value of that debt finally it would be really obtuse for the thai government to issue foreign currency debt when it can issue baht denominated bonds with really low coupons borrowing in a currency other than your own precludes your central bank from acting effectively in times of crisis in the wake of the 2008 2009 financial crash compare the sclerotic recoveries of spain and ireland which were saddled with the euro against the swift recoveries of iceland and sweden which had their own currencies steve davis

pennsylvania california and georgia as detailed below the lawsuit focuses on whether the company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and or misleading statements and or failing to disclose that 1 rekor s alpr technology and uved related business is outclassed by global competitors with an established dominant market share 2 it was unlikely that states would pass legislation authorizing deals similar to rekor s oklahoma uved partnership because of inter alia state and local privacy laws and related public concerns 3 rekor s uved partnership was not as profitable as defendants had led investors to believe because of known impediments to enrollment rates and costs associated with the partnership 4 accordingly rekor had overstated its potential revenues profitability and overall alpr and uved related business prospects and 5 as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times specifically on may 10 2021 a bill authorizing the establishment of a state uved program was excluded from the texas legislature s daily house calendar and left pending in a state committee because may 10 2021 was the deadline for the texas uved bill to move from the committee news sources reported significant market speculation that the bill was dead further on a post market earnings call that same day to

respect to rekor s alpr business prospects then on may 26 2021 private investor western edge published a report addressing rekor entitled rekor systems lackluster growth runway and exaggerated insurance scheme raise substantial downside risk the western edge report alleged among other things that global competition was miles ahead of rekor in alpr development and market establishment that realized results suggest management s potential revenue guidance could be overstated by up to 80 and that investors were at risk of facing a massive downside if growth doesn t show up also on may 26 2021 mariner published a report addressing rekor entitled rekr government documents do not support investor expectations the mariner report largely comported with and supplemented the western edge report finding that among other things oklahoma government budgets imply that s much vaunted uved program is a sub 2mm revenue opportunity almost 96 less than the 40mm in revenue intimated by rekor s ceo and that rekor s largest contributor to 2020 revenue will fall 95 in 2021 due to its non recurring nature following publication of the western edge and mariner reports rekor s stock price fell 0

investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost there can be no assurance that the fund s investment objectives will be achieved the fund may not be appropriate for all investors principal risk factors securities held by a fund as well as shares of a fund itself are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions political events regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations in addition local regional or global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others the outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as covid 19 in december 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets which have caused losses for investors while the development of vaccines has slowed the spread of the virus and allowed for the resumption of reasonably normal business activity in the united states many countries continue to impose lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the spread additionally there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease the debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks including issuer risk reinvestment risk prepayment risk credit risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund s portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolio s current earnings rate prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates liquidity risk is the risk that illiquid and restricted securities may be difficult to value and to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the fund believes it is desirable to do so a mortgage backed security may be negatively affected by the quality of the mortgages underlying such security and the structure of its issuer for example if a mortgage underlying a particular mortgage backed security defaults the value of that security may decrease moreover a downturn in the markets for residential or commercial real estate or a general economic downturn could negatively affect both the price and liquidity of privately issued mortgage backed securities a portion of the fund s managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of mortgage backed securities such subordinated classes are subject to a greater degree of non payment risk than are senior classes of the same issuer or agency to the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference interest rate it is subject to libor risk the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor will cease making libor available as a reference rate over a phase out period that will begin immediately after december 31 2021 the unavailability or replacement of libor may affect the value liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades any potential effects of the transition away from libor on the fund or on certain instruments in which the fund invests can be difficult to ascertain and they may vary depending on a variety of factors and they could result in losses to the fund investments in asset backed or mortgage backed securities offered by non governmental issuers such as commercial banks savings and loans private mortgage insurance companies mortgage bankers and other secondary market issuers are subject to additional risks the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are a the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the instruments or indices underlying the futures contracts and the price of the futures contracts b possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired c losses caused by unanticipated market movements which are potentially unlimited d the investment adviser s inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other economic factors and e the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations if a security sold short increases in price the fund

on august 6 2021 the securities and exchange commission sec approved nasdaq s board diversity rule nasdaq stock market llc rules 5605 f and 5606 which requires listed companies to have at least two diverse board members or to explain their failure to meet the requirement with some exceptions the board diversity rule also requires companies to publish statistics on the diversity of their board members the rule is intended to increase transparency into the diversity of corporate boards giving investors more information to consider when deciding which companies are worthy of investment as investors have increasingly voiced concern over enhanced diversity in corporate leadership the board diversity rule may not only increase board transparency but also cause nasdaq listed companies to increase board diversity the nasdaq board diversity rule is not a mandate but instead requires listed companies that do not have at least one director that self identifies as female regardless of their designated sex at birth and at least one director who self identifies as an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority or as lgbtq provide a written explanation for their failure to meet these diversity goals the explanations must be provided in advance of the company s next annual shareholders meeting in either a proxy statement in an information statement or on the company s website the explanation alone is mandatory nasdaq and the sec will not evaluate the substance or merits of any company s explanation there are a number of exceptions to the board diversity rule foreign issuers are only required to have one diverse director who is female and one director that is female lgbtq or a member of an underrepresented community in the context of the country of the company s principal executive offices meaning that a board member may be considered ethnically diverse in the foreign issuer s home country even if they would not be considered diverse in the united states smaller reporting companies are required to have two diverse directors so long as one of them self identifies as female i e a smaller reporting company can satisfy the rule by having two female directors the securities and exchange act of 1934 defines smaller reporting companies as an issuer that is not an investment company an asset backed issuer or a majority owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and that 1 has a public float of less than 250 million or 2 has annual revenues of less than 100 million and either no public float or a public float of less than 700 million see 17 cfr 240 12b 2 finally a company with a board of directors of five members or fewer is only required to have one member who is diverse as with other companies subject to the board diversity rule companies in the above three categories are not required to meet these diversity goals but they must explain their failure to do so other companies are exempt from the board diversity rule based on type including acquisition companies asset backed and other passive issuers cooperatives limited partnerships management investment companies issuers of non voting preferred securities debt securities and derivative securities that do not have equity securities listed on nasdaq and issuers of securities listed under the nasdaq rule 5700 series companies are required to comply with the board diversity rule at different times depending on which nasdaq exchange they are listed companies listed on the nasdaq global select market or the nasdaq global market must have or explain why they do not have at least two diverse directors by the later of august 6 2025 or the date the company files its proxy statement or its information statement for its annual shareholders meeting during the 2025 companies listed on the nasdaq capital market must have or explain why they do not have at least two diverse directors by the later of august 6 2026 or the date the company files its proxy statement or its information statement during 2026 companies listed on the nasdaq global select market the nasdaq global market and the nasdaq capital market must have or explain why they do not have at least one diverse director by the later of august 6 2023 or the date the company files its proxy statement or information statement for the company s annual shareholders meeting during 2023 the board diversity rule also allows newly listed companies to be phased in depending on which of the nasdaq markets they are listed on in addition to the minimum requirements for diverse board membership companies are required to disclose statistics on the demographics of all of their board members under rule 5606 companies will be required to disclose the number of their directors that are male female non binary or that refused to disclose their gender as well as the same gender based statistics broken down by race and ethnicity companies must comply with these disclosure requirements by august 6 2022 or before the date the company files its first proxy statement or information statement for its annual meeting of shareholders whichever happens first the most immediate impact of the board diversity rule will be more information for investors ideally consistent and comparable information about board diversity whether this information will in turn lead to more diversity at the board level remains to be seen with more and more investors including institutional investors basing investment decisions on environmental social and governance factors esg companies may choose to add diverse board members to meet the minimum diversity goals to avoid investor scrutiny or may further increase board diversity in order to maximize their appeal to investors nasdaq certainly hopes that this trend will have the ultimate effect of increasing corporate board diversity according to nasdaq the board diversity rule promotes diversity in company leadership while maintaining companies flexibility to choose their leaders including preserving a company s choice to not select any diverse leaders so long as that decision is explained in defending the board diversity rule nasdaq relied on empirical evidence and peer reviewed studies that established a link between diverse boards and enhanced company performance innovation long term sustainable returns and investor protection

investment company the fund s primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current income as a secondary objective the fund attempts to preserve capital the fund pursues these investment

value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost there can be no assurance that the fund s investment objectives will be achieved the fund may not be appropriate for all investors principal risk factors securities held by a fund as well as shares of a fund itself are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions political events regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations in addition local regional or global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others the outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as covid 19 in december 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets which have caused losses for investors while the development of vaccines has slowed the spread of the virus and allowed for the resumption of reasonably normal business activity in the united states many countries continue to impose lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the spread additionally there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease the fund will typically invest in senior loans rated below investment grade which are commonly referred to as junk or high yield securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the fund and such defaults could reduce the fund s nav and income distributions an economic downturn would generally lead to a higher non payment rate and a senior loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs moreover any specific collateral used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid which would adversely affect the senior loan s value the senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and or trading levels in the future the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates this may hinder the fund s ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the fund s ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss as a result the fund s exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions in the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the fund the fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the fund s common shares if the fund acquires a senior loan from another lender for example by acquiring a participation the fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral the value of the collateral may not equal the fund s investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the fund s investment also to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates the fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value be relatively illiquid and or may lose all or substantially all of its value causing the senior loan to be under collateralized therefore the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer s obligation to the fund in the event of non payment of scheduled interest or principal and the collateral may not be readily liquidated to the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the london interbank offered rate libor as a reference interest rate it is subject to libor risk the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor will cease making libor available as a reference rate over a phase out period that will begin immediately after december 31 2021 the unavailability or replacement of libor may affect the value liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades any potential effects of the transition away from libor on the fund or on certain instruments in which the fund invests can be difficult to ascertain and they may vary depending on a variety of factors and they could result in losses to the fund the fund s portfolio is also subject to credit risk interest rate risk liquidity risk prepayment risk and reinvestment risk interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk may be heightened for the fund because it invests in below investment grade securities liquidity risk is the risk that the fund may have difficulty disposing of senior loans if it seeks to repay debt pay dividends or expenses or take advantage of a new investment opportunity prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund s portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called instruments at market interest rates that are below the fund s portfolio s current earnings rate a second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of assets second lien loans are typically secured by a second priority security interest or lien on specified collateral securing the borrower s obligation under the interest because second lien loans are second to first lien loans they present a greater degree of investment risk specifically these loans are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the borrower and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher priority in addition loans that have a lower than first lien priority on collateral of the borrower generally have greater price volatility than those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid distressed securities frequently do not produce income while they are outstanding the fund may be required to incur certain extraordinary expenses in order to protect and recover its investment the fund also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the distressed securities will eventually be satisfied use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports

abc s this week host george stephanopoulos brought up what else the michael wolff gossip book fire and fury during his interview with u n ambassador nikki haley on sunday after a non stop media assault using the book like an rpg nikki haley had a truly non debatable response stephanopoulos asked her after first framing it as reinforced by tweets of course you know a lot of these questions of tweets reinforced by this book that came out this week the michael wolff book he said not so innocently when you ve in your dealings with the president he says 100 percent of the people around the president are concerned about his fitness have you seen any behavior that concerns you unperturbed the formed governor gave him an answer he likely didn t expect you know the one thing about this book having been a governor and now an ambassador i m always amazed at the lengths people will go to to lie for money and for power it s really this is like taking it to a whole new low i will tell you i have not read the book i won t read it but the excerpts that i have seen and the things that i have seen in the press i know those people in the white house i m there once a week these people love their country and respect our president i have never seen or heard the type of toxic language that they re talking about now i m not there seven days a week but i m there once a week and i m there for a day with white house meetings and everything no one questions the stability of the president she said stephanopoulos then brought up the alleged 200 interviews and all the time wolff spent in the white house adding a lot of the most damning anecdotes have not been denied by those involved haley said you know i can t vouch for anything like that i don t know if it was 200 interviews with steve bannon or if it was 200 interviews with himself but i can tell you i know these people i work with these people i work with the president and speak with him multiple times a week this is a man he didn t become the president by accident and as much as everyone wants to talk about stability was he unstable when he passed the tax reform was he unstable when we finally hit back at syria and said no more chemical weapons was he unstable when we finally put north korea on notice was he unstable when he said wait we need to look at iran because this is getting to be a dangerous situation was he unstable with the jobs or the economy or the stock market we need to be realistic at the fact that every person regardless of race religion or party who loves the country should support this president it s that important where did these quotes come from the absurdities in the book are largely ignored for the narrative they prefer one of those absurd hyperbolic comments made by wolff is that 100 of the people around trump think he s batty which would include his family the cabinet vp pence yet he admitted on cbs morning that he never interviewed cabinet members or vice president pence we should be supporting the president for the sake of our nation as haley suggested but people who have differing opinions will not haley will be dismissed because no one can win against a hardened group of people committed to one point of view it s not truth seeking in this political climate it s gossip mongering threats and a drive to overthrow the president people don t really want to hear if people working with the president question his stability they want to hear it through the prism of a man who thinks his book will take him down related

generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the periods reported actual results could materially differ from those estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies common stock subject to possible redemption we account for common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic 480 distinguishing liabilities from equity common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value conditionally redeemable common stock including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the company s control is classified as temporary equity at all other times common stock is classified as stockholders equity our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events accordingly common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity outside of the stockholders equity section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets net income loss per common share we apply the two class method in calculating earnings per share net income loss per common share basic and diluted for class a ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the trust account net of applicable taxes if any by the weighted average number of shares of class a ordinary shares subject to possible redemption outstanding for the period net income loss per ordinary share basic and diluted for and non redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing net loss less income attributable to class a ordinary shares subject to possible redemption by the weighted average number of shares of non redeemable ordinary shares outstanding for the period presented fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date gaap establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 measurements these tiers include level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted for identical instruments in active markets level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 26 in some circumstances the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value

listen to this article listen to this article keep calm and stay the course advised two investment experts speaking during friday s jr now webinar the 24 hour news cycle is enough to shake the confidence of many investors said zac reynolds founder and chief investment officer for oklahoma city based full sail capital and stacy murray adviser and chief compliance officer for full sail capital in the absence of a major life change it is best to check on investments only perhaps twice a year reynolds told journal record interim editor joe dowd who served as moderator studies show the more frequently you trade the worse wealth outcomes you have reynolds said there s a lot of noise out there in the world ultimately the market is going to trade on fundamentals at some point on a day to day basis though it may be too high or too low investors who pulled their money out of the stock market when the recession hit in 2008 and 2009 may have felt that they were doing the smart thing but that action came at a cost reynolds said investors who kept their money in the market when the s p 500 was around 660 until today when the s p is well over 4 400 did well for themselves that s a great increase and that amount of wealth creation for most people is just not possible anywhere outside of the stock market reynolds said we re still very big believers in using the stock market to build wealth over time even knowing that we re going to have recessions we re going to have black swan events it s a little bit of a leap of faith but investors who stay the course that get rewarded in a big way on the other hand those who converted their investments to cash have seen the buying power on that cash eroded 20 by inflation over the last decade reynolds said not investing runs its own set of risks and those risks are increasing today as we see inflation go up reynolds said risk can be mitigated by diversifying investments and thinking long term murray said it s not a matter of if but when there will be another economic downturn murray said noting that it took about 18 months for the market to rebound after 2008 the timing might present particular challenges for certain investors at a critical point in their lives we re seeing our older clients come back who were planning to live on a fixed income portfolio for the next 10 to 15 years hoping to get 5 to 6 and bonds aren t returning that murray said health care costs are also higher than many would have projected for those clients a shift in approach may be warranted if you re a very conservative investor and you need to earn 6 7 8 you can t do that the way you historically could having a good amount of your money in bonds reynolds said you re going to have to be a bit more aggressive it is never too early or too late to begin investing even a small amount toward your future the investors agreed interest rates are unlikely to rise before late 2022 or early 2023 reynolds said which is good for asset owners and for borrowers where low interest rates really hurt someone is if you are the classic saver and you don t want to take a lot of risk reynolds said some questions do exist about potential changes to tax law a person of significant wealth should work with a team of advisers and accountants to monitor how changes to tax and estate law might affect them

karen brooks harper texas tribune what surprised texas retiree kathy hardman most was not that she got covid 19 five months after being fully vaccinated and it was not even that she qualified to receive an increasingly popular yet still largely unfamiliar experimental treatment that had been prescribed to some of the most powerful people in the country what shocked the 66 year old grandmother of four was that the monoclonal antibody infusion therapy estimated to decrease chances of hospitalization by up to 70 was available to her at her hometown hospital in mount pleasant a community of 15 000 in rural northeast texas it s amazing to me that we have this available to us in little old titus county hardman said on friday less than 24 hours after she was diagnosed and got her infusion at titus regional medical center the infusions are in fact more available and accessible to texans than ever before with ever loosening restrictions on who may qualify more people hearing about them and an increasing number of doctors across the state learning about the therapy and prescribing it to their patients suffering from covid 19 the regeneron treatment the therapy being used by state run infusion centers was used by both then president trump last fall and gov greg abbott last week after they each were diagnosed with covid 19 houston area congressman troy nehls posted on social media he received the treatment saturday after testing positive for the virus the therapy uses antibodies developed in a lab and injected into the patient usually through an iv drip to help their own antibodies fight the virus abbott and other state leaders including the directors of the state s health department and emergency management divisions have pushed the experimental infusion therapy since it was given emergency use authorization for certain patients by the u s food and drug administration in november but after a slow response by an initially skeptical medical community and by hospitals that were too overwhelmed by the pandemic to devote time or space to offer the hourslong treatment appointments the therapy is finally being recognized as an important part of the arsenal against a virus that has roared back this summer demand has increased across the country as covid 19 cases have exploded the therapy s distributor amerisourcebergen has sent 136 932 treatment courses of monoclonal antibody therapies to texas since december more than a quarter of them nearly 37 000 treatment doses made by regeneron arrived this month according to the texas department of state health services there are now about 140 doctors offices hospitals clinics and infusion centers in texas that can not only administer the drug but order it directly from the company making it easier to keep it in stock the treatment is free for patients who are required to have a prescription and meet certain guidelines we prescribe it all the time said dr emily briggs a private physician in new braunfels who was hesitant about the therapy at first but began prescribing it in march after learning more about it we re using it a lot the unfortunate truth is that my patients who are unwilling to get the vaccine want us to throw everything at them when they get this virus and more are catching the virus every day in texas where the delta variant is being blamed for what health care officials describe as the worst surge in infections that the state has seen since the pandemic began the result is twofold a spike in hospitalizations of unvaccinated people who represent more than half of the texas population but more than 95 of patients hospitalized with covid 19 and a strain on intensive care units more than 100 hospitals have reported few or no icu beds available in the past week covid 19 surge prompts state to reopen infusion centers those grim statistics are the main motivator behind the sudden re emergence of previously shuttered mass infusion centers as a primary tool in helping keep the hospital system from buckling under the strain of too many patients most of the centers supported by the texas division of emergency management that had opened at the end of 2020 and early 2021 were closed or turned over to locals months ago when hospitalizations and deaths dropped in the wake of mass vaccination efforts mobile treatment units and hospitals kept offering infusions but the mass centers weren t needed as much because the hospitals were able to handle patient loads once again in june texas providers received fewer than 2 000 monoclonal antibody treatment courses according to the texas department of state health services throughout the january surge abbott and other state leaders criticized the low rate of prescriptions that physicians were writing for the therapies which were arriving to the state on a weekly allotment through the u s department of health and human services state and national leaders repeatedly suggested that part of the reason hospitals were becoming overwhelmed during the winter surge was that not enough doctors were prescribing the treatment which they argued could keep patients from requiring a hospital bed physicians at the time complained that the criteria set by the u s food and drug administration and the manufacturers of the treatment limited their ability to prescribe it a patient s age the timing of their symptoms and their risk factors all had to be considered doctors said too few met all the criteria and some patients weren t showing up at their offices early enough after the onsent of symptoms for the therapy to work properly several like briggs the new braunfels physician did not want to use their patients like guinea pigs and preferred to wait until the therapies were more proven then delta hit driving hospitalizations back up and this time the health care community is embracing antibody therapy and even encouraging each other to use it by putting together public awareness campaigns and training sessions new criteria mean more people qualify for therapy in may the fda expanded the criteria for who can receive it dropping the qualifying age from 55 to 12 which gave more discretion to the doctors who would be writing the prescriptions the changes also included new weight guidelines that allow some 75 of texans to qualify to receive it the majority of texans are overweight which increases the risk of hospitalization for covid patients regeneron is most effective on people with covid 19 who have had symptoms for less than 10 days but the fda s broad guidelines largely leave the decision of who should receive it up to physicians health officials say in an email to staff at houston methodist hospital system on wednesday dr robert a phillips executive vice president and chief physician executive said the hospital has scheduled 867 infusions for this week more than double the highest number for a single week during the last surge the texas department of state health services sent houston methodist 17 nurses to help administer the treatment he said in the email they arrived last week as you may know gov abbott is receiving monoclonal antibody treatment after testing positive for covid 19 this likely will bring more attention to this treatment which has proven to cut down on hospitalizations he wrote nim kidd chief of the texas division of emergency management said he s glad to see the enthusiasm we ve been trying to push these therapies for all texans all along he said they work i m a 100 believer in that personally doctors and state leaders point out that the benefits of the infusion last only about three months and that it should not be used as a substitute for vaccines we are continuing to focus on vaccines as the goal kidd said it s kept people out of the hospital the mass infusion center at the bexar county fairgrounds near san antonio had closed in march but reopened on aug 10 and in just over a week more than 500 people showed up with prescriptions for the infusions county officials said bexar county judge nelson wolff said daily new hospitalization admissions have been holding fairly steady in recent days instead of climbing exponentially as they have been for the past month and he says it s likely that the antibody infusions are contributing to that it is a significant tool wolff said what it does is it helps keep people out of the hospital so i think we re beginning to see some effect of that at titus regional in mount pleasant dr fritz thurmond believes the same thurmond oversees all covid 19 related operations at the hospital which for weeks has been teetering on the edge of its capacity in a county that s only 28 vaccinated the number of daily antibody infusions has more than tripled what they were administering earlier in the year officials there said the hospital has done about 160 in the past three weeks the therapy s remarkable efficacy at keeping people with covid symptoms from becoming seriously ill is likely helping the hospital avoid a critical tipping point thurmond said it s kept people out of the hospital and you know that real estate especially now is almost unavailable anywhere thurmond said hardman the mount pleasant patient experienced symptoms for just a few days before she had a fever over 101 degrees body aches and other flu symptoms within a few hours of the treatment on thursday evening her fever was gone by friday she said she felt almost normal it feels like a miracle she said i m so very grateful i ve told all of my friends retirees if you get covid go do this now that the therapy is much more mainstream than it was six months ago the idea that only the exceptionally needy or the extremely influential can get it isn t true anymore thurmond said the reality is that the rest of us can get it too he said disclosure the university of texas at austin has been a financial supporter of the texas tribune a nonprofit nonpartisan news

curiosities is a column where i preserve for posterity the you can t make this up parts of the art news below here are some questions posed by the events of the last week 1 can the hermitage stop this godawful nft i am truly not sure whose side i am on in the battle of the hermitage museum versus till lindemann for those who do not follow the german shock metal scene as closely as i do the latter is the lead singer of the band rammstein basically lindemann has unveiled the terribly named nftill collection of digital artworks which consists of pictures of himself hamming it up at the hermitage the famed st petersburg museum which has been itself minting official nfts of its famous artworks really does not like this saying that lindemann s use of its works was not and could not have been agreed with the museum the images being nft ed came from a performance by the singer inside the hermitage as part of russia s official year of germany a cultural diplomacy initiative what nobody could have foreseen is that the man most recently in the news for his line of vibrators and a golden showers themed sparkling wine would turn out not in fact to be a good cultural ambassador for germany one nft one shot video hermitage edition featuring him surrounded by violinists in the hermitage is priced at a modest 100 000 117 458 in an edition of 10 that seems like a lot but to be fair it does come with a dinner with lindemann in moscow i just hope at that price it also involves a lot of caviar my main thought here is that the real scandal is how unbelievably janky the nftill collection is which basically just looks like a bunch of jpgs and gifs treated with random stock effects fans eager to meet lindemann and own his exclusive art pieces need to be quick nme reports like total marks all 10 of the 100k nfts in the nftill collection remain unsold at this time incidentally so no need to rush too fast i mean forget buying nfts of lindemann just standing in front of a veronese with his hands in his pockets or on his knees in front of this prodigal son canvas where is the nft of him simulating anal sex with a squirting dildo onstage where are the flame shooting robot angel wings or the 10 foot long penis canon that ejaculates foam on the crowd can i at least own the nft for rammstein s cameo in the vin diesel movie xxx play the hits man 2 what s the deal with this michelangelo chatbot someone sent me this link to an artificial intelligence version of michelangelo it s built by querlo a company that makes a i chatbots and it s kind of like an art history version of those eager little windows that pop up when you are online shopping that you never really want to engage with only it s for college students who don t want to do the reading about michelangelo ask a i michelangelo anything about michelangelo and it will give you answers that feel like the a i is throwing darts at a dartboard and randomly getting closer to hitting the center of your question or like it is carving a form out of marble that never fully emerges maybe michel a i gelo keeps eagerly asking you if it s helped and offering links to find out more now that i think of it if there s one very un michelangelo like thing about it it is how eager it is to be ingratiating at any rate it is fair to say that a i michelangelo is not the michelangelo of a i if you know what i mean 3 what is the essence of mermaid art i keep a ranking of greatest mermaid art stories until this week i thought that starbucks changing its original logo in 1992 because for some reason people thought that the twin tailed siren holding her fish legs around her head looked lewd was secure in the number one position then came the news that the heirs of edvard eriksen the artist behind copenhagen s little mermaid statue are suing the nearby village of asaa demanding that it pay the estate compensation for copyright infringement and tear down a rival mermaid sculpture the latter is made by palle moerk an asaa artist and was installed in 2016 the eriksens say it is an unauthorized copy the case is raising profound artistic questions destined to have reverberations spanning the worlds of etsy nautical memorabilia and middle school girls what truly is an original image of a mermaid asaa mayor mikael klitgaard tells the new york times of the city s mermaid it s clear she s local she looks just like an asaa girl the eriksen mermaid for its part has the body of the artist s wife and the face of a dancer that his patron was thirsting for her pose may be the same but klitgaard says how else is she going to sit she s a mermaid you can t put her in a chair 4 and finally can we get this reader a banksy please no idea if this reader writing in about banksy s summer spraycation is joking but i hope not because i admire the problem solving impulse i m having trouble with a noisy neighbour and would love banksy to paint someone on the front of my house wearing ear muffs to say keep your noise down i m from norfolk and i know he s been in the area hope you can help i hope that i can do my part to help by just posting his plea follow artnet news on facebook

activtrades weekly by ricardo evangelista www activtrades bs august 2020 was a remarkable month for gold traders with the price of the precious metal reaching an all time high of more than 2000 per ounce the spectacular rise in the price of bullion coincided with moments of uncertainty in global financial markets as the coronavirus caused the most pronounced slowdown in the planet s economic activity since world war ii since then thanks to successful vaccination plans and despite some lingering concerns over the spreading of new variants especially in asia the economic outlook improved considerably so far this year demand for the precious metal decreased and trading has occurred within a narrower range than in 2020 with the price dropping approximately 6 5 percent since early january in the run up to year end the performance of gold is likely to remain under the influence of two main factors the performance of the us dollar and the level of risk appetite in global financial markets there is an inverted correlation between gold which is priced in dollars and the american currency with the precious metal suffering losses every time the greenback rises and gaining whenever the opposite occurs recently the outlook for the american currency has improved the economic recovery in the us triggered inflation related fears forcing the federal reserve to adopt a more hawkish posture that offered support to the dollar as investors started pricing in the likelihood of an earlier tapering of the central bank s asset purchase programme and even the beginning of the discussion on the timing for interest rate hikes so as the dollar climbed gold suffered losses which could increase should economic data in the us continue to surprise to the upside on the other hand gold is the ultimate refuge asset one that always rises when the global economic outlook deteriorates which is what happened in august 2020 at the moment there are some reasons for concern among investors mainly due to rising numbers of cases of the delta variant of the virus which forced the authorities of several asia pacific nations to impose fresh lockdowns this scenario together with growing geo political instability triggered a spell of risk aversion in the financial markets over the last few days offering support to gold considering the present scenario gold could suffer losses as we approach the end of the year if fears over the growth of the global economy dissipate and above all if the hawkish pivot of the fed materialises and the us dollar reaches for fresh multi month highs however it is also possible that the economic recovery will slow down in the us forcing the fed to keep the current levels of stimulus for longer which would create downside risk for the dollar and therefore support gold this scenario could be exacerbated by a deterioration of the situation in asia due to the return of the virus which would increase the appetite for the safe haven gold

toronto a new study from stanford university in california suggests that exposure to wildfire smoke during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm birth the study entitled associations between wildfire smoke exposure during pregnancy and risk of preterm birth in california was published in the journal environmental research aug 14 and found there may have been as many as 7 000 extra preterm births in california attributable to wildfire smoke exposure between 2007 and 2012 the births occurred before 37 weeks of pregnancy a timeframe when incomplete development of the fetus heightens the risk of various neurodevelopmental gastrointestinal and respiratory complications and death according to a press release the study details how wildfire smoke contains high levels of the smallest deadliest type of particle pollution or tiny specks of toxic soot known as fine particulate matter or pm 2 5 these particles are 2 5 microns in diameter or less and are fine enough to embed in the lungs and pass into the bloodstream when levels are high pm 2 5 is what causes the air to appear hazy and reduces visibility and wildfire fine particle pollution comprises a different chemical makeup than other sources of pm 2 5 such as agriculture tailpipe emissions and industry emissions patterns of preterm birth to compile the study data researchers analyzed satellite data of smoke plumes from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to identify smoke days for 2 610 zip codes in california they then compared the data with estimates of ground level pm 2 5 pollution rates which were developed by a machine learning algorithm that analyzed information from air quality sensors satellite observations and computer models of how chemicals move through the atmosphere researchers compiled california birth records excluding twins triplets and higher multiples of infants which commonly are born early they also accounted for other variables known to influence preterm birth risk such as temperature baseline pollution exposure and the pregnant person s age income race or ethnic background looking at patterns of how preterm birth within each zip code changed when the number and intensity of smoke days rose above normal for each location researchers found that every additional day of smoke exposure during pregnancy raised the risk of preterm birth regardless of race ethnicity or income a full week of wildfire smoke exposure meant 3 4 per cent greater risk of preterm labour compared to a pregnant person exposed to no wildfire smoke exposure during the second trimester between 14 to 26 weeks of pregnancy had the strongest impact the study says especially when the smoke was heavy enough to add an additional 5 micrograms per cubic metre to pm 2 5 levels the study results show wildfire smoke may have contributed to more than six per cent of preterm births in california in the worst smoke year of the study period 2008 researchers posit in the study that the link between wildfire smoke exposure and preterm birth is that the pollution may trigger an inflammatory response which then sets delivery in motion no safe level of exposure while the study built on an already established link between particle pollution and adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth low birth and infant deaths it is the first to isolate the effects of wildfire smoke on preterm birth and to establish the importance of exposure timing the release says our work together with a number of other recent papers clearly shows that there s no safe level of exposure to particulate matter any exposure above zero can worsen health impacts said economist and study co author marshall burke in the release while as a society it will be extremely difficult to fully eliminate all pollutants from the air our research suggests that further reductions in key pollutants below current acceptable levels could be massively beneficial for public health the study was released as the western u s and vast swaths of canada are again dealing with massive wildfires a year after the 2020 fire season torched more than 4 million acres of california with more than half the state s population experiencing a month of wildfire smoke levels in the range of unhealthy to hazardous the study says in the future we expect to see more frequent and intense exposure to wildfire smoke throughout the west due to a confluence of factors including climate change a century of fire suppression and construction of more homes along the fire prone fringes of forests scrublands and grasslands as a result the health burden from smoke exposure including preterm births is likely to increase said lead study author sam heft neal in the release how pregnant canadians can stay safe while the study only addresses data from california wildfires have burned across massive tracts of land in canada particularly in b c and the prairies with smoke from the wildfires making its way across the country prompting air quality warnings nation wide doctors have long known that the environment plays a large role on pregnancy said calgary based obstetrician gynecologist dr fiona mattatall i think we know that the environment has big influences on pregnancy and on the health of the fetus and newborn mattatall said in a telephone interview with ctvnews ca monday i think seeing this more specific research looking at big environmental changes like wildfire and seeing the specifics of how they are impacting pregnancy that s a little more surprising mattatall said her advice to pregnant canadians who may be living in a wildfire zone or may have increased exposure to wildfire smoke should think first about reducing risk staying indoors as much as possible and making sure doors and windows are closed would be an easy strategy she said adding that people who have the ability to have cleaner air inside the space whether an air filtration system or hepa filters should take advantage of it mattatall said that if pregnant people need to go outdoors to try and not do anything too strenuous that would require more intense breathing and in turn cause someone to ingest more pollutants if you re doing a workout try doing it in the basement instead of going out for a run she said mattatall said that pregnant people who are in high risk areas for wildfires or are experiencing warnings for air quality should consider wearing a higher level of mask like an n95 mask while outdoors to reduce exposure to wildfire smoke and its pollutants the second thing i thought about is i ve been chatting with patients is planning ahead mattatall said so if it looks like there s smoke coming into the area wildfires are approaching stock up on essentials to make sure that you can stay inside more in particular mattatall said pregnant people with underlying respiratory conditions like asthma should stock up on any medication necessary including inhalers which she stressed are safe to use while pregnant pregnant people in areas of heavy smoke pollution those who have been evacuated and those living in wildfire zones should be conscious of the symptoms of preterm birth and should contact their physician if they have any questions or concerns mattatall said to keep an eye on symptoms of labour when someone is far from term which can appear abdominal cramping or lower back pain increase in pressure in the pelvis or any amount of bleeding would be reasons to get seen and cared for other symptoms of exposure may appear in the respiratory system having sort of a more acute reaction to the smoke would be things like having trouble breathing a heartbeat that s getting really fast a headache changes in how you re able to focus or concentrate mattatall said nausea will also be another one that would be a warning sign

getting worse spurring shortages of consumer products and making it more expensive for companies to ship goods where they re needed unresolved snags and the emergence of new problems including the delta variant mean shoppers are likely to face higher prices and fewer choices this holiday season companies such as adidas crocs and hasbro are already warning of disruptions as they prepare for the crucial year end period the pressures on global supply chains have not eased and we do not expect them to any time soon said bob biesterfeld the ceo of c h robinson one of the world s largest

international shipping lines including maersk hapag lloyd and cma cgm have adjusted schedules to avoid the port and are warning customers of delays the partial closure of the world s third busiest container port is disrupting other ports in china stretching supply chains that were already suffering from recent problems at yantian port ongoing container shortages coronavirus related factory shutdowns in vietnam and the lingering effects of the suez canal blockage in march shipping companies expect the global crunch to continue that s massively increasing the cost of moving cargo and could add to the upward pressure on consumer prices we currently expect the market situation only to ease in the first quarter of 2022 at the earliest hapag lloyd chief executive rolf habben jansen said in a recent statement the cost of shipping goods from china to north america and europe has continued to climb over the past few months following a spike earlier in the year according to data from london based drewry shipping the pressures on global supply chains have not eased and we do not expect them to any time soon bob biesterfeld the ceo of c h robinson the company s world container index shows that the composite cost of shipping a 40 foot container on eight major east west routes hit 9 613 in the week to aug 19 up 360 from a year ago the biggest price jump was along the route from shanghai to rotterdam in the netherlands with the cost of a 40 foot container soaring 659 to 13 698 container shipping prices on routes from shanghai to los angeles and new york have also jumped the current historically high freight rates are caused by the fact that there is unmet demand soren skou ceo of container shipping giant maersk said on an earnings call this month there s simply not enough capacity he added port congestion the terminal shutdown in ningbo will add to bottlenecks arising from the closure in june of yantian a port about 50 miles north of hong kong after coronavirus infections were detected among dock workers while a partial reopening of yantian took only a few days a return to normal services took nearly a month to achieve according to s p global market intelligence panjiva as the congestion spilled over to other ports that spells trouble for retailers and consumer goods companies trying to restock inventories heading into the crucial year end holiday shopping season the closure at ningbo is now particularly sensitive as it may hold up exports for the peak season of deliveries into the u s and europe which typically arrive from september through november s p global panjiva said in a research note on aug 12 drewry shipping said friday that congestion at nearby ports shanghai and hong kong is spiking and spreading elsewhere in asia as well as in europe and north america particularly the west coast of the united states some 36 container ships are anchored off the adjacent ports of los angeles and long beach according to a report thursday from the marine exchange of southern california that s the highest number since february when 40 container ships were waiting to enter ordinarily there would be just one or zero container ships at anchor according to the marine exchange the congestion in california is starting to spread to pretty much every port in the united states according to biesterfeld of c h robinson the chances of your vessel arriving on time are about 40 when it was 80 this time last year he told cnn business the backlog at ports will have a ripple effect on jammed warehouses and stretched road and rail capacity logistics networks have been running at maximum capacity for months thanks to stimulus fueled demand led by u s consumers and a pickup in manufacturing truck driver shortages in the united states and united kingdom have only exacerbated supply disruptions u s imports in march and may exceeded levels seen in october 2020 typically the peak of the shipping season said eric oak supply chain research analyst at s p global panjiva this means that logistics facilities have been running flat out for most of the summer he added it s not just ports that are under pressure air terminals are receiving increasingly large amounts of freight as companies turn to alternative methods to transport their goods at some of the larger u s airports such as chicago there are delays of up to two weeks to claim cargo according to biesterfeld efforts to contain covid 19 outbreaks have recently disrupted traffic at shanghai pudong and nanjing airports in china related us retailers scramble to stock shelves as kids head back to school retailers are navigating a storm of challenges higher production costs cargo delays from china and other asian countries and sky high shipping rates as they gear up for the industry s second biggest selling season retailers brace for impact name almost anything and it seems like there s a shortage of it somewhere biesterfeld added retailers are struggling to replenish inventory as fast as they re selling let alone prepare for holiday demand supply chains were discussed on nearly two thirds of some 7 000 company earnings calls globally in july up from 59 in the same month last year according to an analysis by s p global panjiva consumer goods producers are taking drastic steps to meet demand such as changing where products are made and moving them by plane instead of boat but companies such as shoemaker steve madden say they re already missing out on sales because they simply don t have enough goods the company has moved half the production of its women s range to mexico and brazil from china in an attempt to shorten delivery times in terms of the supply chain we could talk about this all day there are challenges throughout the globe ceo edward rosenfeld said on an earnings call last month there is port congestion both in the u s and china there are covid outbreaks at factories there are challenges getting containers we could go on and on it s one of several major apparel brands hit by factory shutdowns in vietnam over the past month data from s p global panjiva shows that nearly 40 of the volume of goods imported into the united states by sea over the 12 months to july came from the southeast asian country adidas ceo kasper rorsted said the sportswear company will be unable to fully meet the strong demand for its products in the second half of the year due to the shutdowns despite switching production to other regions supply chain difficulties have been leading to significant delays and additional logistics costs particularly as we have been making more use of airfreight he said on a recent earnings call andrew rees the ceo of crocs said that transit times from asia to most of the company s leading markets are approximately double what they were historically that s been the case for some time and we re expecting to live with that he told investors last month to ensure product availability during the holiday season hasbro which makes monopoly and my little pony said it is increasing the number of ocean carriers it works with utilizing more ports to expedite deliveries and sourcing more products earlier from multiple countries for consumers the supply chain crunch is likely to mean higher prices hasbro for example is increasing prices to offset rising freight and commodities costs the company is projecting that its ocean freight expenses will be on average four times higher this year than last according to chief financial officer deborah thomas shoppers should also brace for longer than normal delivery times and may need to have several different gift ideas up their sleeves as we ve been forecasting for months shoppers are going to see some bare shelves at the holidays
