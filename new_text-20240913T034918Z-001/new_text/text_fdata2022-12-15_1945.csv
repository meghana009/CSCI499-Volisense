with private real estate outperforming most sectors globally in 2022 asianinvestor examines the opportunities risks and trends that could define real estate investments in apac in 2023 global inflation has reached its highest levels in more than 20 years and most central banks in the asia pacific region are in the process of tightening monetary policies to stave off inflation which will inevitably slow growth in the coming year but what will this mean for real estate in the region even as the market slows opportunities will remain in commercial real estate rising interest rates have put upward pressure on cap rates and corresponding downward pressure on values while this is not the preferred dynamic there are reasons for measured optimism louise kavanagh chief investment officer and head of asia pacific real estate at nuveen told asianinvestor louise kavanagh nuveen as apac s monetary authorities are compelled to keep pace with the fed s hiking cycle and walk the fine line between growth and inflation kavanagh and other industry insiders believe the region s interest rates will approach multi year highs in 2023 despite the ongoing market tensions the economies in the apac region are in a better position than the us and europe where milder inflation and more robust gdp growth will continue to support real estate markets according to kavanagh significant capital appreciation has fuelled outsized returns over the last few years but many investors allocate to private real estate for the consistent income yield often borrowing allocation from their fixed income portfolios to increase their exposure to real estate she said on this measure real estate is well positioned with healthy fundamentals to support stable income in 2023 retail trends there are several key trends that will define investment decision making in 2023 most of which can be seen as a continuation of the trends witnessed over the past 24 months according to david asplin deputy managing director and head of funds management at qic global real estate david asplin qic while bond yields have risen significantly over the past year and we expect that they will continue to place some upward pressure on real estate capitalisation rates over the short term inflation pressures are expected to gradually ease over 2023 asplin told asianinvestor the tail end of covid 19 will also continue to influence the behaviour of australian consumers and of particular note is the trend towards retail and localisation he said accelerated by the pandemic we are increasingly seeing a desire for consumers to live shop and work more locally driving visitation and sales at our regional and neighbourhood shopping centres said asplin retail real estate also continues to provide diversification benefits within an investment portfolio with differing macroeconomic drivers to other asset classes and real estate sectors the depth and diversity of businesses and mix of uses including exposure to tenants in the non discretionary spend category underpins relatively lower volatility and risk than may be evident in other asset classes or real estate sectors with more concentrated tenant profiles and less diversity of uses he said retail as a sector will be gaining traction more broadly in asia in 2023 too in light of recent large deals in singapore japan and australia according to john howald executive director head of international capital asia pacific colliers john howald colliers retail reflects broader economic demand and activity the late reopening of borders in some markets japan korea hong kong and china has caused pent up demand asia pacific doesn t have as severe a forecast as the european or north american regions so it s expected retail activity will not abate or be heavily impacted in most markets in this region howald told asianinvestor the reopening of all major tourism and business markets across asia pacific will also likely see a return of robust activity in the hotels sector said howald howald also believes that other prominent trends throughout the peak of covid will continue namely the pursuit of the three ls logistics living and life sciences structural growth drivers structural growth drivers connected to the major forces changing society demographics digitization and decarbonization will be key to capturing positive real growth in asia pacific over the long term according to benett theseira managing director and head of asia pacific at pgim real estate benett theseira pgim digitalisation is changing businesses everywhere demand is driving growth for logistics and hyperscale data centers he told asianinvestor this is on the back of very strong business and consumer migration to the cloud due to the accelerated adoption and pace of e commerce online entertainment communications social media and smart devices which will no doubt continue to be a trend said theseira from the demographic perspective the opportunities are two pronged on the one hand a young population and a growing middle class are driving demand for residential housing in particular rental housing due to the high cost of home ownership in major cities on the other hand the growing ageing population will boost demand for senior housing which is very much under supplied in major markets in the region he said as for decarbonisation more businesses and end users are shifting their thinking and preferences towards green buildings which is driving the continued demand for properties with better esg credentials in turn this is expected to provide more opportunities for upgrading older building stock and finding new ways to create higher value green assets said theseira risks ahead most buyers will also have to take a position on the debt in the market if investors are getting debt today at high interest rates they will have to look at purchasing with the view to refinancing in the future according to colliers howald once interest rates are seen to level out and more certainty emerges around the interest rate outlook many investors will see this as a green light to resume to normal property investment activity he said every investor will take their own view on what will happen with interest rates which is the main reason for a lot of pause in investments across asia pacific now said howald however the risk here is if inflation stays stubbornly high and this leads to a higher interest rate in a lot of markets that we re used to this could potentially cause pricing dislocation there is a risk of interest rates staying higher for longer than most investors and economists are currently projecting he said pgim s theseira agrees that the asia pacific region is not spared from the effects of slowing global growth pressure on regional currencies supply led inflation and rising policy rates however government corporate and household balance sheets were strong heading into the

file photo federal reserve chair jerome powell hosts an event on fed listens transitioning to the post pandemic economy at the federal reserve in washington u s september 23 2022 reuters kevin lamarque file photo by howard schneider ann saphir and michael s derby washington reuters the federal reserve will deliver more interest rate hikes next year even as the economy slips towards a possible recession fed chair jerome powell said on wednesday arguing that a higher cost would be paid if the u s central bank does not get a firmer grip on inflation recent signs of slowing inflation have not brought any confidence yet that the fight has been won powell told reporters after the fed s policy setting committee raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point and projected it would continue rising to above 5 in 2023 a level not seen since a steep economic downturn in 2007 those rises in borrowing costs would come despite an economy that fed officials projected will operate at near stall speed through next year with an annual growth rate of 0 5 and an unemployment rate nearly a full percentage point higher by the end of 2023 well beyond the increase historically associated with a recession we don t talk about this kind of recession that kind of a recession we just make these forecasts powell said in a news conference i wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability there isn t and this is the best we can do he described the slow rate of economic growth penciled in by fed officials next year as still modest i don t think it would qualify as a recession that s positive growth the fed chief said even though it is not going to feel like a boom but other aspects of the fed s projections notably a rise in the unemployment rate to 4 6 from the current 3 7 are consistent with a downturn settling in as the central bank keeps its target policy rate at a restrictive level for at least the next two years the rate increase on wednesday which was approved unanimously by fed policymakers and widely expected by financial markets lifted the targeted policy rate to the 4 25 4 50 range with officials expecting it to rise to a level between 5 00 and 5 25 next year if anything the bias is higher seven of 19 policymakers projected even higher rates will be needed and u s central bankers are unanimous that the risks are tilted towards higher than expected inflation rather than a surprise in the other direction still powell said repeating the hard line on enforcing the fed s 2 inflation target that he has developed through the year the largest amount of pain the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched the new economic projections imply an even higher pain threshold than before for a fed willing to tolerate the equivalent of about 1 6 million lost jobs wrote aneta markowska chief financial economist at jefferies this suggests hawks still outnumber the doves by a significant margin even with recent improvements the fed s preferred measure of inflation remains around triple the central bank s target and policymakers project it will take at least three years to fall all the way back only two of 19 fed officials see the benchmark overnight interest rate staying below 5 next year a sign of a still broad consensus to lean against inflation the message from the fed on wednesday also leaned against market expectations that recent data showing slowing inflation might push the central bank from its hawkish path and move policymakers toward cutting rates before the end of next year getting markets to hear that is key to fixing financial conditions that have loosened in recent months as inflation data has improved a move counter productive to the fed s inflation fighting strategy said carl riccadonna chief u s economist at bnp paribas restrictive enough the new statement was released after a policy meeting at which officials scaled back from the three quarters of a percentage point rate increases delivered at the last four gatherings u s stocks closed lower on wednesday in the u s treasury market which plays a key role in the transmission of fed policy decisions into the real economy yields were little changed to slightly lower the dollar dipped against a basket of currencies taken together today s statement and economic projections tell a simple but persuasive story this fed isn t prepared to pivot in any meaningful way until it sees sustained and conclusive evidence of a reversal in inflationary pressures said karl schamotta chief market strategist at corpay powell said the speed of coming rate rises is less critical now than earlier in the year when the central bank was front loading rate hikes to catch up with accelerating prices it s not as important how fast we go he said noting the bigger question facing policymakers is finding an appropriately restrictive endpoint and determining how long to stay there our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 goal over time it s not on rate cuts powell said the inflation data received so far in october and november show a welcome reduction in the pace of price increases but it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence inflation is on a sustained downward path powell said reporting by howard schneider and ann saphir additional reporting by lindsay dunsmuir michael s derby and saqib ahmed editing by andrea

the prosecution of three businessmen caught up in one of canada s most spectacular cannabis industry flameouts suffered its own collapse on wednesday as lawyers for the ontario securities commission osc moved to withdraw all charges mid trial but even defeat didn t come easy for the prosecution defence lawyers for former canntrust holdings officials peter aceto eric paul and mark litwin refused to merely have the charges dropped and held out for full acquittals for their clients after careful review of the evidence during the trial we are of the view that as charged there is no reasonable prospect of conviction osc lawyer dihim emami told the court he asked for more time to consider the defendants request for acquittals however saying it had only been presented to him minutes earlier scott fenton a lawyer for canntrust s former vice chair litwin appealed to the judge to end the matter today i m respectfully against drawing this out it s time to end it for all the gentlemen on thursday judge victor giourgas acquitted the defendants on all counts the sudden turnaround in the case is just the latest twist in a saga that saw one of canada s most valuable publicly traded cannabis companies shattered by allegations that it grew thousands of kilograms of illegal weed and then lied to investors about it hundreds of jobs and nearly a billion dollars in shareholder value were wiped out while the company and its executives directors underwriters and auditors were hit with a raft of class action lawsuits on both sides of the canada u s border charges based on alleged illegal growing the rcmp and osc charged paul litwin and aceto who previously headed up scotiabank s online banking subsidiary tangerine with quasi criminal securities offences last year canntrust s greenhouse in pelham ont was at the centre of now abandoned allegations against the company s former ceo ex chairman and a former director tijana martin the canadian press the charges came after canntrust announced in july 2019 that health canada had learned of the growing of cannabis in five unlicensed rooms at the company s pelham ont greenhouse between october 2018 and march 2019 before the rooms received the proper approvals in april 2019 the osc claimed the men did not disclose to investors that nearly half the growing space at the facility wasn t properly licensed and that they used corporate disclosures to assert that canntrust was compliant with regulatory requirements prosecutors were also alleging litwin and aceto signed off on pitches to u s investors that stated canntrust was fully licensed and compliant and that litwin and paul traded shares of canntrust while knowing about the allegations of unlicensed growing but before it was publicly disclosed trial testimony last week and submissions by defence lawyers however painted a different picture that the company s entire greenhouse was licensed all along and it just needed some routine approvals from health canada to start growing pot plants in the additional rooms under cross examination canntrust s former director of quality and compliance graham lee agreed with fenton that the company s cannabis production licence from health canada didn t actually restrict what rooms it could grow in that undercut the prosecution s case which hinged on the idea the company had been engaged in unlicensed cannabis cultivation at one point lee testified canntrust staff did stage photographs as part of a submission to health canada in an attempt to disguise the extra growing rooms but senior management did not instruct him to do this he said fallout the consequences of canntrust s regulatory struggles have been vast days after it made its july 2019 announcement about the purportedly unlicensed rooms the company voluntarily suspended sales of all its cannabis products then in september 2019 health canada officially suspended the company s licence to sell the next month the company said it would destroy 77 million worth of plants and inventory as its revenue streams ran dry canntrust was forced into bankruptcy protection in march 2020 once worth 1 5 billion on stock markets the business was quickly delisted in new york and toronto the company some of its former executives and a number of its underwriters settled the cross border class action lawsuit for 83 million last year without any admissions of wrongdoing most of the company s remaining assets were bought earlier this year by a group of investors led by a dutch based private equity firm canntrust then changed its name to phoena holdings inc defence lawyers did not want to comment after wednesday s hearing at toronto s old city hall courthouse before the trial began aceto s lawyer frank addario told the canadian press that his client behaved legally and with integrity during his time at canntrust the osc ontario s stock market regulator said it wouldn t comment while the matter is still before the court cbc news also reached out to health canada with questions the agency said it would look into it the case is back in toronto s old city hall court on thursday for a determination of whether all three men will be formally acquitted

we have seen a wide range in oil prices during 2022 from the start of the year when west texas intermediate wti was trading in the upper 60s to late march where it topped 130 per barrel in the last six weeks there has been a collapse of this closely watched commodity benchmark with wti briefly trading below 70 this has also resulted in the stock price of oilfield service companies osv fluctuating in response to advances and declines in wti some companies have appeared to be more resilient in market sell offs retaining more of their cycle high levels in this article we will review some possible reasons why investors have stayed with certain companies and abandoned others as wti dropped we will also draw some summary conclusions about what this might portend for 2023 the drillers outperform it s been a while since we could say that looking at the chart above contract drillers have robustly outperformed the others companies like patterson uti nyse pten and helmerich payne nyse hp are the clear winners in this contest from peak to trough they have retained 85 and 91 of their 2022 stock price highs respectively from review of their corporate filings it appears a couple of key factors drove this result revenue growth and margin improvement figure prominently in the stock performance of these companies in the case of pten tightness in the tier i super spec category has resulted in a virtual sell out in this class the pten rig count grew from 113 to 132 in 2022 with another four lower tier customer funded upgrades to tier i scheduled for 2023 tier i rigs can walk to the next pad well saving rig down time for simple moves as well as other upgrade pipe handling and pumping capabilities what s more impressive is the growth in the tier i day rate from the low 20 000 s to the current 40 000 s which has led to revenue topping 702 mm for q 3 a 64 increase from the first of the year the rise in revenue has been at increasingly profitable terms bringing eps earnings per share from 038 in q 4 of 2021 to a positive 0 18 in q 3 of 2022 with rates at the current levels the company is now seeking and getting longer term 3 5 year contracts which will stabilize cash flow at high levels for years to come this figure may improve still further in the year to come as was noted in their q 3 quarterly conference call where ceo andy hendricks commented going into next year we expect to see further pricing increases as many of our existing contracts roll over especially in contract drilling as such i believe we still have significant upside to our current margins and free cash flow h p largely echoed the details driving their business john lindsay ceo commented i m encouraged to report that our leading edge pricing levels are now delivering margins in line with that goal these are results not seen since the 2012 2014 upcycles strong demand from customers coupled with rollovers of term contracts should help drive average pricing higher across our active fleet and we believe there is significant momentum heading into fiscal 2023 pten is trading at an attractive valuation of 5 3x ev ebitda despite holding on to most of its high side price h p trades a little lower on this basis at 3 25x both companies have solid balance sheets good capital discipline and are considering implementing capital return programs to shareholders in the coming year company filings the big colors halliburton nyse hal and schlumberger nyse slb come in second on the category percentage gains retained for the year hal has held on to 85 of its high side gains this year while arch competitor slb is only off 7 at 93 a couple of drivers here seem to be responsible for their performance revenues are up 20 in the case of slb but eps has doubled since last year hal s revenues are up 15 yoy but eps has more than doubled both companies cited growth in key divisions in north america and in the international sector in the case of hal their fracturing fleet is in high demand while slb noted their well construction business success both companies saw margin expansion from the prior quarter with hal documenting 16 and slb citing margins of 19 for the quarter high technology leads the business case for both companies much of which is ai driven with lower input costs and personnel intensity this has been a multi year focus of investment for both companies that now seems to be paying off handsomely slb ceo olivier le peuch made bullish comments about the year to come in 2023 turning now to the macro we have strengthened our view in a multi year up cycle as we are on the cusp of yet another year of growth a significant step up in investment is required to create supply redundancies rebalance markets and rebuild global spare capacity to levels that provide for sustainable economic growth and third recent opec decisions and the extension of its framework for cooperation through 2023 are additional factors that will enable operation operators to invest with a higher degree of confidence in their commodity price assumptions company filings the frackers liberty energy nyse lbrt and propetro nyse pump are both generating positive cash flow and earnings and in a position to be raising rates for their pumping services pump grew revenues and cash flow 50 yoy lbrt exceeded that with a double to 1 2 bn in q 3 and tripled cash flow to 157 mm both companies have grown ebitda per fleet to 25 28 mm in the current quarter and see a line of sight for further increases though chris wright of lbrt noted that the rate of increases might moderate in 2023 given current pricing for wti lbrt added upgraded tier iv six fleets in the quarter from stacked onestim equipment that was legacy slb other fleets are tier iv dual gas blend dgb to reduce diesel consumption further growth will come from electric fleets that can get power from either natural gas or directly from the grid pump is also going the dgb route but is also ordering new build electric fleets and expects to have 2 fully electric fleets available for a contract beginning in q 3 2023 given the growth in their top and bottom lines it s not hard to understand why investors have chosen to stick with lbrt in particular with the stock maintaining 88 of its high side share price in the recent sell off pump with a third the size of lbrt has been more volatile dropping nearly 50 over the same time frame company filings water management and sand suppliers the lower capitalization companies that supply needed materials water and sand to fracking operators have not sustained the gains made in the first half of 2022 aris water solutions nyse aris grew revenues yoy by 50 but eps fell over the period from 0 69 to 0 02 suggesting that their growth capex is being met through operating cash flow ocf and at the market share sales not scenarios the market is rewarding currently aris has not generated any free cash flow in 2022 select energy services nyse wttr grew revenues by nearly 100 to 375 mm in q 3 and eps from 0 14 to 0 23 select hasn t generated any free cash in 2022 and generated funds for growth capex through ocf and share sales the two water management companies wttr and aris are ending the year down from their highs of about 15 and 25 respectively u s silica slca is a premiere sand supplier to the fracking industry it grew revenues over 100 yoy and eps from 0 19 to 0 35 the company generated about 175 mm in free cash over course of 2022 contribution margin per ton was 24 in q 3 and volumes were 3 5 mm tons this represents a 20 increase in volumes and a 2 5x increase in contribution margin the company is down about 40 from mid year highs with legacy debt of 1 1 bn hanging over the stock the company reduced this debt load by 150 mm with free cash over the course of the year ceo bryan shinn noted a very robust environment developing for 2023 we enjoyed a full quarter of price increases to fight inflationary impacts in our industrial segment realized greater contract coverage and improved prices in sand proppant and delivered further margin expansion in sandbox last mile logistics looking out to 2023 our oil and gas segment is in an excellent position for further sequential growth and cash generation advertisement smart sand nyse snd doubled revenues in their core bakken and marcellus areas and took eps from 0 29 to 0 06 contribution margins have ramped from about 8 00 per ton to 16 per ton as of q 3 the company has suffered historically from crippling breach of contract lawsuits and its dependence on northern white sand nws logistically challenged as companies began to shift to in basin sand a few years ago the company was optimistic in its outlook for these basins and perhaps a pickup in sales of nws due to problems stemming from in basin sand snd carries no debt and expects the key marcellus market to remain strong in the coming year the collapse of the stock is probably due to some unfortunate commentary coming out of the call charles young ceo commented about the we re not seeing a lot of the new northern white sand supply come back online there may be some pockets of incremental supply but with some of the capital constraints out there and the course reserves of most of the idle mines with the inefficient processing that that yields we don t see much if any of that capacity returning at the current pricing and margin levels company filings summary and your takeaway it is clear that u s shale is set up for another growth year of activity driven primarily by rig reactivations which could add another 50 rigs over the course of 2023 most of the growth in 2022 occurred in the first half and the rig count has plateaued in the past six months the tightness in the super spec walking rigs has restored the drillers to profitability with a long ramp higher in the coming years the drillers probably represent the most asymmetric bargains among the service company cadre with pten trading at 5 3x ev ebitda and h p trading at 3 25x ebitda they are delivering growth to the market and seem to be able to leverage cash upfront from clients for new rig activations if that s not having your cake and eating too i don t know it might be with rig rates and terms still on the increase 2023 should be another good year for them and we should see multiple expansions it should come as no surprise that the frackers are right behind the drillers on the bargaining table lbrt is trading at 5x ev ebitda on an adjusted basis debt free pump is even cheaper on this basis at about 3x i think as the new rigs come to work that frackers multiples will adjust higher with the stock prices reflecting new valuations halliburton and schlumberger are trading at higher multiples 12x and 13 6x respectively growth should come from increasing cash flow as in the case of north america from 50 new rigs tightening equipment and personnel availability and in the case of international activity particularly mena from massive new projects kicking in as the gcc countries try to increase output in a few years in the past both companies have run at multiples in the upper teens during a growth cycle and i see no reason they can t return to those levels in the coming year one of the sand suppliers also presents a compelling value given its present level slca is trading at about 8x ev ebitda on account of their debt load with their cash flow 275 mm on a run rate basis and low capex this can easily be cut in half over the next couple of years snd is a more complex picture given its size about 1 10 that of slca its contribution margin of 16 per ton is a substantial discount to slca s in the mid 20 s suggesting there are costs they are incurring dragging the margin down i consider snd a good bit more speculative than slca over all the service company picture appears to be an attractive setup for growth in the coming year all of the companies we have discussed will probably end 2023 higher than where they are now with the usual oil price caveat understood some look more compelling than others but beauty and value is in the eye of the beholder by david messler for oilprice com more top reads

war wars force into the open the real class interests that political tendencies represent with the outbreak of the first world war in 1914 social democratic parties around the world organised in the second international lined up behind their own national war efforts the vote of the german social democratic party the largest in the world for war credits was an epochal betrayal of the socialist movement only a small group of revolutionary internationalists led by vladimir lenin stood against the tide and fought for a united struggle of the international working class against their national ruling classes under german socialist karl liebknecht s immortal phrase the main enemy is at home it was this political fight which prepared the russian revolution of 1917 whose seismic impact brought an end to the bloody slaughter in 1914 lenin wrote the war and russian social democracy denouncing the french social democrats who claimed to be waging a defensive war against german aggression and the german social democrats who claimed to be fighting russian despotism he explained it is primarily on social democracy that the duty rests of revealing the true meaning of the war and of ruthlessly exposing the falsehood sophistry and patriotic phrasemongering spread by the ruling classes the landowners and the bourgeoisie in defence of the war what is the true meaning of the war in ukraine which has been buried under a mountain of lies in 2014 american and european imperialism helped to bring to power an anti russian regime in ukraine resting on armed groups of fascists the geopolitical strategists and military planners in washington intended to use ukraine as a proxy against russia threatening its geostrategic vital access to the black sea vast resources were poured into ukraine s military support was given to its ambitions against russia in crimea and discussions were held on nato membership with the war now underway these shipments have massively increased while nato has expanded further eastward in scandinavia the united states is taking vast strides in its pursuit of global hegemony through the subjugation of russia and ultimately china none of this is changed by the fact that russia invaded ukraine on february 24 2022 yet this is what the myriad pseudo left tendencies equating russia and the nato imperialist powers would have workers and young people believe resting on the facile argument that russia fired the first shot these organisations echo nato s propaganda with denunciations of russian imperialism identifying the kremlin rather than washington as the state with designs on eastern europe and eurasia the characterization of russia and of china as imperialist serves to legitimize a policy of breaking these countries up into a series of puppet regimes with their vast oil gas and mineral resources to be controlled by the us and nato imperialist powers that is why these tendencies never place the war in the context of the three decades since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 in which the us has waged an uninterrupted series of wars to open up the entire world to its predatory ambitions were it simply a matter of denouncing the russian invasion then as we explain in our statement there are ample grounds to do so without capitulating to the reactionary and deceitful narrative concocted by nato and the western corporate media but in the name of supporting ukraine s supposed war for self determination against russian imperialism the pseudo left groups lend support to the us and european powers proxy war against russia waged by far right ukrainian forces lenin and his co leader of the russian revolution leon trotsky wrote scathingly of those who argued this way during the first and second world wars in a 1915 resolution on world war i lenin wrote the question of which group dealt the first military blow or first declared war is immaterial in any determination of the tactics of socialists both sides phrases on the defence of the fatherland resistance to enemy invasion a war of defence etc are nothing but deception of the people in war and the fourth international written in 1934 trotsky denounced as a delusion the concept of national defence especially when it coincides with the idea of the defence of democracy he explained the character of war is determined not by the initial episode taken by itself violation of neutrality enemy invasion etc but by the main moving forces of war by its whole development and by the consequences to which it finally leads lenin s great insight was to connect the social chauvinist betrayal of the second international to its socioeconomic origins the pressure on the revolutionary vanguard of a privileged strata of the petty bourgeoisie including a labour aristocracy grown accustomed to the standard of life afforded by the plundered wealth of their national state today the pseudo left s response to the war in ukraine expresses even more directly the interests of the affluent middle class a social layer which has travelled far to the right in recent decades they are viciously hostile to socialism hooked on rising stock markets which depend on the suppression of the class struggle and increasingly aligned with the capitalist state this is the yawning class divide separating the trotskyists of the icfi and the iysse from every other political tendency which all act to tie the working class to this reactionary milieu in the uk this found consummate expression in recent years in the support of every pseudo left tendency for jeremy corbyn whose leadership of the labour party was meant to mark a socialist revival instead corbyn and his supporters surrendered to the right wing on every question of principle above all in their abandonment of opposition to nato and the trident nuclear weapons system the labour party is now firmly in the hands of the warmonger sir keir starmer who declares its unshakeable support for nato corbyn is no longer permitted even to sit as one of its mps today s rump of 11 corbynite mps have prostrated themselves before starmer s warmongering withdrawing their support from a stop the war coalition open letter criticising nato within an hour of him telling them to do so in 2003 prior to the iraq war the stop the war coalition led a protest of more than a million people today having crumbled under the first salvo from the labour party and the bourgeois press it barely functions corbyn himself makes an occasional personal call for a negotiated end to the war while reassuring the cia s own radio free europe that labour under his leadership would still be supporting ukraine s right to defend itself and declaring that he did not blame nato for the fact russia has invaded ukraine the international committee of the fourth international bases its response to the nato russia conflict on the understanding that the same conditions which give rise to war give rise to social revolution bringing the international working class onto the field of battle in its 2016 statement socialism and the fight against war the icfi set out the principles on which a new socialist mass anti war movement would have to be built above all we insisted the struggle against war must be based on the working class the great revolutionary force in society uniting behind it all progressive elements in the population right now in the uk hundreds of thousands of workers are engaged in national strike action on a scale not seen for generations millions have balloted for action this is part of an international upsurge of the class struggle driven by a collapse in living standards intimately connected to the imperialist war the international youth and students for social equality is determined to politically prepare the developing struggle of the working class against the imperialist warmongers make the decision today to join this fight for genuine socialism
whether increased regulation would have prevented the spectacular collapse of cryptocurrency exchange ftx was fiercely debated at a hearing of the senate s banking committee wednesday however new legislation is potentially on the way sen elizabeth warren announced at the hearing bipartisan legislation aimed at cracking down on cryptocurrencies being used in money laundering the legislation co sponsored by republican sen roger marshall of kansas would require cryptocurrency exchanges to verify customer identities like banks and other financial institutions do crypto has become the preferred tool for terrorists for ransomware gangs for drug dealers and for rogue states that want to launder money said warren the massachusetts democrat adding that crypto doesn t get a pass to help the world s worst criminals no matter how many television ads they run or how many political contributions they make republican sen cynthia lummis of wyoming said she and democratic sen kirsten gillibrand of new york would reintroduce their bipartisan legislation the responsible financial innovation act next year that act would require disclosures and consumer protection obligations from cryptocurrency issuers lummis like several other republicans on the banking committee said the alleged financial crimes of former ftx ceo sam bankman fried should not be used to target cryptocurrency more generally let s separate digital assets from corrupt organizations she said ftx is good old fashioned fraud however democratic sen sherrod brown chairman of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs asked the hearing s four witnesses two crypto proponents and two critics whether fraud was systemic at other firms in the industry they all indicated that it was one of the few points of agreement in the entire hearing actor ben mckenzie testifies during a senate banking committee hearing on cryptocurrency and the collapse of the ftx crypto exchange and its founder sam bankman fried at the capitol in washington wednesday dec 14 2022 he is joined at left by investor kevin o leary and cato institute center for monetary and financial alternatives director of financial regulation studies jennifer schulp hilary j allen professor of law at the american university washington college of law testified that the current environment cryptocurrency operates in is highly conducive to fraud sam bankman fried may have engaged in good old fashioned embezzlement she said but the embezzlement was able to reach such a scale and go undetected for so long because it was crypto shrouded in opacity complexity and mystique entrepreneur kevin o leary best known as mr wonderful on the tv show shark tank disagreed with the characterization even though the 15 million he earned as a paid spokesman for ftx is now essentially worthless i am of the opinion that crypto blockchain technology and digital payment systems will be the 12th sector of the s p within a decade he said referring to the s p 500 a well known benchmark for stocks o leary also testified that bankman fried told him that the collapse of ftx was due to its battle with crypto competitor binance which also held a stake in ftx these two behemoths that owned the unregulated market together were at war with each other o leary said and one put the other out of business federal prosecutors say bankman fried defrauded ftx customers and investors starting in 2019 and illegally diverted their money to cover expenses debts and risky trades at the crypto hedge fund he started in 2017 alameda research bankman fried 30 was arrested monday in the bahamas at the request of the u s government and remains in custody after being denied bail based in the bahamas ftx was able to bypass u s futures restrictions and offer a range of leveraged derivatives generating huge trading volume amid volatile crypto price swings the u s trading platform for ftx launched in january 2021 establishing chicago as its headquarters in june of that year a u s regulated exchange ftx us offered fewer products than the global exchange but was the only ftx platform licensed for american investors to trade crypto ftx generated 3 45 trillion in global trading volume this year while ftx us hit 65 billion before both exchanges came to a mandated halt in november according to nomics a leading cryptocurrency index sen sherrod brown d ohio chairman of the senate banking committee and sen pat toomey r pa right the ranking member lead a hearing on cryptocurrency and the collapse of the ftx crypto exhange and its founder sam bankman fried at the capitol in washington wednesday dec 14 2022 pennsylvania republican sen pat toomey the ranking member of the banking committee said during wednesday s hearing that ftx s actions do not reflect the business of cryptocurrency as a whole there s nothing intrinsically good or evil about software it s about what people do with it he said code committed no crime however actor and author ben mckenzie schenkkan best known for his role as jim gordon on gotham said his research shows cryptocurrency is built on misinformation hype and fraud and that the estimated 40 million americans who have invested in it were lied to in my opinion the cryptocurrency industry represents the largest ponzi scheme in history he said the fact that it has roped in tens of millions of americans from all walks of life as well as hundreds of millions of people worldwide should be of concern to us all chicago tribune contributed

the patriot missile system which first gained prominence shooting down iraqi scud missiles during the 1991 persian gulf war could soon return to battle taking out russian drones and cruise missiles in the skies over ukraine the pentagon is said to be on the verge of announcing plans to send the patriot its most sophisticated air defense system to ukraine to ward off an unrelenting barrage of russian missile and drone attacks it would be the latest escalation in the biden administration s support for ukraine as it tries to hold off russian invading forces and it would almost certainly spark anger in the kremlin the need for the patriots was on display again wednesday when more than a dozen iranian made drones were fired at ukraine s capital kyiv air defense troops took them out of action ukrainian officials said it is obvious that the russian military feels confident only when attacking peaceful cities ukraine s defense ministry said in a twitter post today the ukrainian air defense took the terrorists down a peg by shooting down 13 out of 13 shahed 136 131 drones president biden who in the past has ruled out moves that might draw the u s and its nato allies into direct conflict with russia would have to sign off on the patriot deal that could happen as early as thursday according to multiple media reports officials in moscow said they would wait for confirmation before reacting but the russian embassy in washington denounced what it called a provocative move that could lead to unpredictable consequences see also moscow blames u s after blast kills two at russian oil refinery upgrading ukraine s defenses with the sophisticated patriot system would cause colossal damage not only to russian american relations but would create additional global security risks the embassy said in a statement ukrainian officials have been urgently requesting a more robust air defense system to shoot down incoming russian missiles on monday president volodymyr zelenskyy told western leaders during a meeting of the group of seven industrial powers that his country needed high tech air defense systems to counter russian aerial attacks which have knocked out electricity and other crucial utilities for millions of ukrainians as winter weather settles in russia still has the advantage in artillery and missiles this is a fact mr zelenskyy said ukraine needs constant artillery support with guns and shells we need more rocket artillery and more long range missiles germany is one of the countries that use the patriot system which includes a fire control system a launcher and multiple support vehicles this week berlin decided to install patriot batteries in poland to help defend against any russian attacks a stray ukrainian defense missile targeting russian salvos landed across the border in poland last month killing two people these rockets will protect the polish skies and polish earth polish president andrzej duda said monday according to the deutsche welle media company the white house on wednesday would not confirm reports that the patriot missile system would be sent to ukrainian fighters see also u n watchdog to base staff at endangered ukraine nuke plants we have been prioritizing air defense capabilities of late because that is the urgent need of the ukrainians john kirby spokesman for the national security council told reporters at the white house russia may rely more heavily on its air campaign as depleted weapons stocks make ground operations unlikely adm tony radakin the chief of staff for british defense forces told a london think tank wednesday he said the arms shortfall reflects a war of attrition 10 months after russian president vladimir putin started what he thought would be a lightning victory let me tell putin tonight what his own generals and ministers are probably afraid to say the admiral said according to an account by the guardian newspaper russia faces a critical shortage of artillery munitions this means that their ability to conduct successful offensive ground operations is rapidly diminishing relying on drones with its ground attack stymied russia has relied on drones and missiles to attack ukraine while digging in along defensive lines in the east and south moscow s new strategy has forced the u s and other western countries to provide kyiv with additional air defenses such as the national advanced surface to air missile system and the infrared imaging system tail thrust the white house and pentagon officials have given priority to providing kyiv with western style air defenses but some analysts say that adding ukraine to the list of countries using the patriot missile system at least 17 so far could ratchet up tensions in the region the patriots will provoke a russian reaction it s the u s s most escalatory action to date said sean mcfate an adjunct professor at syracuse university s maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs this is not like a stinger missile from the afghan war they re very sophisticated mr mcfate a former army officer who also serves as a senior fellow at the atlantic council think tank questioned whether ukrainian troops would be able to quickly grasp the intricate steps needed to operate the patriot system a u s army soldier has 30 weeks of patriot missile training this is going to be done in germany under less than ideal conditions he said these things will become huge targets for russians they re not cheap either the kremlin said it would consider the american made patriot missiles legitimate military targets which could raise the stakes for the biden administration kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters on wednesday that russia would certainly target any patriot air defense battery in the war zone i would refrain from comment for now though because these are just media reports nowadays media reports are an unreliable thing mr peskov said according to the official russian tass news agency let us wait for some official information if the deal is approved the patriot systems will likely come from existing u s stocks mr mcfate said they ll be downgraded some of that is highly classified u s only technology then raytheon and lockheed martin will get more contracts to replenish the stocks he said the international atomic energy agency announced wednesday that it would establish a permanent presence at all of ukraine s operating nuclear power plants and at chernobyl the site of the 1986 nuclear accident because of continuing concerns that russia s invasion has put the sensitive sites at risk the u n nuclear watchdog agency already has staff at the nuclear plant in zaporizhzhia the largest in europe ukrainian workers are operating the plant under russian military control as fighting rages nearby under an agreement announced tuesday between iaea director general rafael mariano grossi and ukrainian prime minister denys shmyhal the khmelnytskyi rivne and south ukraine plants also will have permanent iaea staffing the move is part of a stepped up effort to prevent a nuclear accident during the armed conflict u n officials said our mission at the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp has shown the vital importance of the iaea being there to monitor the situation and give technical advice mr grossi said after the agreement was signed in paris thanks to this presence the iaea is providing the world with impartial technical and factual information about developments on the ground the agency has voiced concerns for months about the lack of clarity at the zaporizhzhia plant

as the snow flies and temperatures plummet regulatory agencies and analysts alike warn that residents in multiple u s states are at an elevated risk of dangerous winter blackouts states such as texas and north carolina and also the great lakes and new england regions are in the highest risk category according to a report from the north american electric reliability council nerc meanwhile a large portion of the u s power grid is at risk of insufficient electricity supplies during peak winter conditions the agency concluded in the same analysis although climate change advocates claim that severe weather events are the primary culprit energy insiders say tight fuel supplies and an outdated electric grid play a critical role in potential blackouts people take shelter at gallery furniture store after winter weather caused electricity blackouts in houston on feb 18 2021 go nakamura getty images conservative estimates this year put the cost of critical power grid and infrastructure upgrades at 4 trillion with the use of supplemental nuclear power the price tag jumps another 500 million without nuclear energy the biden administration approved a 13 billion stopgap measure on nov 18 to modernize and expand the power grid however people in the energy industry say it will take months or years for u s residents to see the difference falling behind there is a significant gap to upgrade aging grid infrastructure to meet net zero mandates and maintain reliability and we are running out of time analyst kim getgen told the epoch times getgen is the ceo and founder of innovation force which tackles complex issues such as america s energy crisis she says the biden administration s infrastructure investment is a good start but it s exactly that just a start upgrading aging infrastructure system hardening and resilience measures while complying with the evolving set of new cyber and physical security threats will require even more investment getgen said she added that the american society of civil engineers gave the u s power grid a c grade on its 2021 infrastructure report card getgen maintains that a greater level of investment is needed saying we can t maintain the millions of miles of distribution and transmission lines that deliver the power and we can t harness the potential of renewable clean power and although upgrades are crucial some energy specialists say the u s electrical grid won t become efficient overnight or even by next winter it s important to remember that something as complex as the electricity grid takes time to change ted kury director of energy studies at the university of florida told the epoch times working in the university s public utility research center kury says the regulatory process for new utility projects moves slowly no matter how much money is thrown at it it s a process with numerous safeguards but that also means it takes more time it s reasonable to think that we ll start seeing impacts in the next few years he said eric hendrick senior consultant in risk management at customized energy solutions agreed with kury s assessment given the politics involved in any legislation it ll take some time before any of these funds trickle down to the states that need the funds hendrick told the epoch times during a press statement john moura the director of reliability assessment for nerc said there are more areas at risk of blackouts this winter amid power generation and fuel supply challenges the u s and texas flags fly in front of high voltage transmission towers in houston on feb 21 2021 justin sullivan getty images u s secretary of energy jennifer granholm also noted in a november brief that 70 percent of the nation s power grid is more than 25 years old grid upgrades aside strained natural gas and coal supplies are also quite literally fueling higher power outage risks fuel factor not only are millions of americans facing a greater risk of losing power this winter they ll also be paying more for energy homes that run on natural gas can expect to pay 28 percent more for those using heating oil a 27 percent price spike is expected and a 10 percent increase is likely for households that rely on electricity alone for heat the increases are due to a combination of higher market prices and demand according to an energy information administration analysis and with the continued push toward biden s net zero energy goals an additional 11 778 megawatts of coal generation was retired in 2022 meanwhile the demand burden has shifted heavily toward natural gas which is already encountering supply issues natural gas pipeline in new york state stan honda afp via getty images this problem will be difficult to address in the short term keep in mind gas storage is currently 89 bcf below last year s level and 86 bcf below the five year average hendrick said he noted that low levels of natural gas storage and a lack of transportation infrastructure in the northeastern united states would likely create volatile scenarios with just 10 to 12 days of colder than normal weather nevertheless the federal energy regulatory commission predicts a 24 percent increase in net natural gas exports for the 2022 2023 withdrawal season and then there s the coal conundrum with fewer generating facilities and sporadic supply chain disruptions in 2022 nerc asserts that coal has limited stocks and resupply uncertainty this winter kury says 2021 saw a spike in coal consumption for electrical power this year has seen an overall decrease in demand but it doesn t shore up with diminished reserves it s still impacting coal stockpiles at power plants kury said when you also consider that coal is delivered by rail and rail transportation has been impacted by labor disputes it reinforces the need to get more fuel to power plants

the federal reserve moderated its all out campaign to cool us inflation wednesday lifting the benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point as its policy actions ripple through the economy america s central bank has taken aggressive moves to ease demand in the world s biggest economy hiking rates seven times this year with interest sensitive sectors like housing already reeling from tightening policy its latest increase takes the rate to 4 25 4 50 percent the highest since 2007 but officials signaled that their battle to cool the us economy is not yet over the committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate to reach a stance restrictive enough to rein in inflation said a statement by the fed s policy setting federal open market committee fomc advertisement the committee anticipates its interest rate will end up higher than earlier projected next year on wednesday policymakers also downgraded their forecast for us economic growth in 2023 to 0 5 percent narrowly avoiding a contraction and see inflation rising more than anticipated advertisement while it takes time for policy effects to ripple through sectors there have been positive signs with consumer inflation in the united states easing in november the consumer price index a key gauge of inflation logged its smallest annual increase in nearly a year fueling optimism that the fed could soon moderate its efforts advertisement the figures nudged wall street stocks up with asian indices rising wednesday as well as all eyes turn to the fed s post meeting statement and fed chair jerome powell s comments for hints on the path to come households have been squeezed by red hot prices with conditions worsened by surging food and energy costs after russia s invasion of ukraine and fallout from china s zero covid measures
with news that putin is taking steps to lend reality to his nuclear threats we must hope that the administration is taking him seriously whether he s genuinely planning to launch a nuclear attack which would indicate that he s crazy or is merely doing an elaborate head fake making him crazy like a fox is a matter of life and death for the western world what s concerning is that the biden administration seems so blasé about the whole thing since early in the russia ukraine war putin has been making noises about dropping a nuclear bomb if necessary that is if he thinks it s necessary for the second time in just three months he s preparing a long range missile footage released wednesday shows the installation of a massive russian yars rocket into a silo at the kozelsk military compound in the kaluga region southwest of moscow the intercontinental ballistic missile has a range of 7 500 miles and was installed in a silo launch pad using a special transport and loading unit according to the mirror the yars missile complex has a capacity 12 times greater than the american bomb that destroyed hiroshima russian newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported missile force commander col alexi sokolov said the latest drill was meant to send a message to the west since both the us and europe are within the missile s range the importance of this operation lies in the fact that the missile will be put on combat duty on schedule he said what western intelligence forces must determine of course is whether putin is posturing or planning is he crazy like a fox or just plain crazy image putin s nuclear missile new york post video screen grab one of the reasons we may be seeing a genuine nuclear threat to the west is that the biden administration is not only flooding ukraine with weapons which means we re effectively at war with russia but is also sending increasing numbers of military personnel u s military personnel are now on the ground in ukraine keeping track of and inspecting weapons the u s has shipped to ukrainian forces a senior defense official announced during a pentagon background briefing on monday these u s personnel are some of the first the pentagon has acknowledged have entered ukraine since russia launched its large scale invasion of the country in february the senior defense official who spoke on background during an official pentagon event said u s personnel have recently resumed on site inspections to assess weapon stocks in country whenever and wherever the security conditions allow the official said the return of our defense attaché and office of defense cooperation personnel in country has allowed us to resume this critical function sending in advisors was how america got its foot in the door in vietnam putin s increasingly aggressive displays of nuclear strength may be his way of saying that he will not stand for active american intervention in ukraine what s completely unnerving is how blasé the biden administration is about this perhaps it believes that putin is just engaging in attention seeking behavior and that the best way to address it is to ignore him however when that attention seeking behavior includes weapons of mass destruction one would think that our administration might at least comfort the american people that we re not facing nuclear armageddon one person who is taking this seriously is tucker carlson who also believes that the administration s relentless focus on transgenderism which it knows riles up conservatives and other normal americans is intended to disguise just how dangerous the situation really is

yogi berra the hall of fame new york yankees catcher and manager is famous for his yogi isms sayings that seemed nonsensical but often contained wisdom my personal favorite we made too many wrong mistakes the genius of this line is that there are indeed right mistakes errors that can eventually put you on the correct path the question of who was right and wrong and when is at the heart of our debate over inflation and what to do about it those of us who are inflation doves worry that hitting the economy too hard to bring prices down can lead to needless suffering particularly among the least advantaged of our fellow citizens in the form of high unemployment and lower wages the danger of our view is that we ll miss the mark when inflation really is out of control and requires a very tough response advertisement i was among those who did underestimate the immediate threat of inflation in early 2021 so i salute those notably former treasury secretary lawrence h summers who warned us about what was coming but in light of tuesday s bureau of labor statistics report showing that inflation slowed more sharply than expected i also want to make the case that we doves made the right mistake meaning that we were right that this inflation is quite different from earlier bouts follow this author e j dionne jr s opinions follow at the risk of oversimplifying inflation hawks examine our situation and see something approaching the situation of the 1970s inflation roaring out of control and in danger of becoming embedded in the economy the result back then was stagflation the worst combination of economic sluggishness with rising prices the problem is that many hawks made a lot of predictions of that sort over the past three decades that just weren t born out low unemployment did not automatically translate into an inflation spiral but then when inflation began spiking last year such hawks considered themselves vindicated but it s not the 1970s anymore jared bernstein a longtime adviser to president biden and a member of the white house council of economic advisers points to three big differences advertisement first the inflation of the 70s was driven by big oil price shocks from the middle east the united states is now far less dependent on middle eastern oil second unlike now unions were still strong in the 1970s and many contracts contained cost of living increases that created an upward wage price spiral the third difference the federal reserve has a much better understanding than in earlier years of the underlying mechanisms of inflation bernstein said including the importance of the expectations of those in the economy who set wages and prices the current fed is more attuned to managing these expectations this may help explain why fed chair jerome h powell after running into criticism from the hawks for not tightening quickly enough made big moves to signal his seriousness about curbing inflation advertisement and he s stayed on the tough side when the federal reserve announced a half percent increase in interest rates on wednesday on top of six other bigger rises this year it also signaled further future increases this disappointed stock markets and also people such as me who hoped the recent good inflation news might lead to a pause to assess how the economy would absorb what the fed has already done nonetheless it s good that powell insists he is seeking a soft landing meaning minimizing the damage inflation fighting can inflict on wages and employment his comments at the brookings institution in late november that he does not want to overtighten the economy were another signal that he may be a hawk for now but he is not a superhawk for its part the biden administration talks about transitioning to stable steady growth that s essentially the same thing as powell s soft landing advertisement it s important to be clear that while i call myself an inflation dove biden would certainly not cop to that title and neither does bernstein as bernstein put it the president is committed to maintaining the economic progress we ve made especially in the labor market while doing all we can to reduce price pressures both of these goals are equally important to him you could almost hear the italics on the word equally as bernstein spoke underscoring that biden was not giving short shrift to inflation there s another sign that a soft landing is a realistic possibility the words supply chain have become a kitchen table concept because the pandemic had the effect of clogging it so much goods in high demand weren t reaching the marketplace driving up prices one of biden s bragging points his administration s work with ports and trucking to speed goods to market has helped cut supply chain pressures by 72 percent from last december according to the new york fed

updated december 14 2022 at 3 41 pm et the federal reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point on wednesday as it continues its crackdown on slowing but stubborn inflation the hike smaller than the previous four increases comes after the latest government reading showed inflation is running at its slowest annual rate in nearly a year still consumer prices in november were up 7 1 from a year ago according to the report which is far above the fed s target of 2 it s good to see progress but let s just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability fed chairman jerome powell said at a press conference after the board announced its latest smaller rate increase the fed has raised its benchmark interest rate seven times since march from near zero to just under 4 5 many americans already contending with price increases in nearly every part of their lives are feeling the effects as they pay more in interest on credit cards mortgages and car loans currently used car buyers are charged an average interest rate of 9 34 compared to 8 12 last year and they re making the largest monthly payments on record according to credit reporting firm experian while wednesday s rate hike was smaller than the previous four officials say the central bank is no less committed to bringing prices under control inflation remains elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures the central bank said in a statement on wednesday on average fed policymakers now expect their benchmark rate to reach 5 1 next year up from 4 6 they were projecting in september the stock market fell after the announcement of another increase mostly as wall street digested the fed s warning that there are more rate hikes to come but stocks recovered and the major indices were mostly flat by mid afternoon after hitting a four decade high of 9 in june inflation is showing some signs of easing gasoline prices have fallen sharply and so have the prices of certain goods such as used cars and televisions rents continue to climb but fed officials believe the worst of shelter inflation may be behind us increases in market rents have slowed since spring the fed s looking at services where prices are still rising the biggest concern now is the rising price of services which is primarily driven by the cost of labor the price of haircuts rose 6 8 in the last twelve months while the price of dry cleaning jumped 7 9 services other than housing and energy account for nearly a quarter of all consumer spending we see goods prices coming down powell said we understand what will happen with housing services but the big story will really be the the rest of it and there s not much progress there and that s going to take some time with a tight job market wages have been climbing rapidly while that s good for workers it tends to stoke the flames of inflation powell has described the job market as out of balance with more job openings than there are available workers to fill them while the u s economy has now replaced all of the jobs that were lost during the pandemic the share of adults who are working or looking for work has not fully recovered many older workers who retired in the last two years may not return to the job market with the supply of workers constrained the fed is trying to restore balance by tamping down demand higher borrowing costs make it more expensive to get a car loan buy a house or carry a balance on a credit card that s already curbing demand in some of the more sensitive parts of the economy like the housing market while the vote to raise interest rates on wednesday was unanimous members of the fed s rate setting committee showed less agreement about where borrowing costs will go in the future some expect the fed s benchmark rate will need to top 5 5 next year while others believe a smaller increase will be needed to restore price stability copyright 2023 npr to see more visit

chevron will reportedly take over operations at joint ventures to process venezuela s hamaca blend crude grade using its own imported diluents caracas december 14 2022 venezuelanalysis com venezuela s crude production continues to hover below 700 000 barrels per day bpd as the industry enters its sixth consecutive year under us sanctions according to secondary sources from the latest organization of petroleum exporting countries opec report november s production stood at 656 000 bpd down from the 682 000 bpd pumped in october for its part venezuelan state oil company pdvsa reported 693 000 bpd also below the previous month s 717 000 bpd despite the output standstill exports increased moderately with 619 300 bpd of crude and refined products shipped in november 16 percent more than in october but still below august s peak of 813 000 bpd as registered by refinitiv eikon most cargoes were sent to china caracas s main buyer using ship to ship transfers to bypass us sanctions iran was another key destination as the allied countries celebrated one year since signing a swap deal that has provided venezuela with over 26 million barrels of crude oil and condensate to produce exportable crude grades while tehran has received about the same volume of venezuelan heavy oil and fuel the latest exchange took place on december 6 with the reported arrival of 2 million barrels of iranian ultra light oil in the caribbean country the increase in exports likewise responded to the resumption of oil shipments to europe last month italy s eni a pdvsa joint venture partner carried two cargoes with 1 85 million barrels of venezuelan diluted crude oil dco to be refined by repsol in spain in may both companies received licenses from the us treasury department to take venezuelan crude in exchange for debt repayment another surge in exports is expected by year end as us corporation chevron is reportedly ready to ship one million barrels of venezuelan crude to us refineries in the gulf of mexico by late december this would be the first us bound shipment since 2018 following washington s financial sanctions against pdvsa the year prior the 2017 measures were followed by a full fledged oil embargo in january 2019 as well as secondary sanctions and other threats throughout 2020 the sanctions were largely responsible for the country s 1 9 million bpd crude output decreasing to less than 350 000 bpd in the second half of 2020 exacerbating an ongoing economic crisis and migration wave a source told bloomberg that the california based company will soon take over operations at joint ventures to process the hamaca blend a tar like crude extracted in the orinoco oil belt and will use its own imported diluents to transport the sludgy venezuelan oil on november 26 the us treasury department issued a six month license authorizing chevron to resume limited extraction operations in venezuela as well as exports to us refineries a clause in the sanctions waiver prohibiting chevron from paying taxes or royalties to the venezuelan government has sparked debate some analysts have claimed that only joint ventures where the us corporation has minority stakes are in charge of such obligations while white house officials have stated that all profits will go toward the repayment of caracas s us 3 billion debt to the oil giant neither party involved in the negotiations has clarified the terms following the announcement venezuelan oil minister tareck el aissami and chevron s top representative in venezuela javier la rosa signed contracts to kickstart operations in at least three of their four joint ventures details of the agreements were not disclosed this is an important step towards the right direction but yet insufficient we demand the lifting of punishing measures that have hit our industry said el aissami after signing the contracts at pdvsa s caracas headquarters on december 7 8 venezuelan officials and chevron executives visited the petroboscán and petropiar projects located in western and eastern venezuela where they held closed door meetings to discuss operations and management currently chevron and pdvsa s joint oil ventures are producing a reported 20 000 50 000 bpd a significant fall from the 160 000 barrels a day pumped in 2018 and well below the 200 000 bpd maximum capacity although there is room for an increase chevron officials have discarded an immediate boost in output earlier this month the firm s chief executive michael wirth said the company will not invest in exploration and production in the next six months with the company instead focusing on shipping a reported 1 79 million barrels of exportable crude it has in stock to us refiners with future exports and rising oil prices the venezuelan government is expecting oil exports to finance 63 percent of its national budget in 2023 set at 14 7 billion as revealed in documents seen by reuters the number is 8 5 percent higher than 2022 s 13 6 billion budget the chevron license was issued in response to the resumption of talks between the nicolás maduro government and the us backed venezuelan opposition in mexico after a year long stalemate the two sides agreed on a 3 billion plan using venezuelan funds seized by washington and its european allies in recent years the resources will be channeled via united nations to invest in social programs with juan guaidó s self proclamation as interim president in 2019 the us government froze a number of venezuelan assets while handing control of some to the hardline opposition president maduro has warned that the talks would only resume if the right wing negotiators comply with their side of the bargain before the year ends the venezuelan president likewise welcomed the chevron license to restart oil operations but emphasized it was not enough for what venezuela demands which is the complete lifting of all criminal sanctions on the oil industry chevron s sanctions waiver expires in may and washington has conditioned its renovation on the continuation of the dialogue process and the discussion of electoral conditions ahead of the 2024 presidential vote in response maduro has said that venezuela wants elections free of sanctions edited by ricardo vaz in caracas

by luc cohen and chris prentice new york reuters when he took office as the top federal prosecutor in manhattan in late 2021 damian williams pledged to prioritize rooting out corruption in our financial markets now with the fraud charges filed earlier this week against sam bankman fried the founder of the bankrupt ftx exchange williams has further solidified his office s growing role in prosecuting financial crimes involving cryptocurrency according to interviews with a half dozen former prosecutors every u s attorney is defined in the public eye by some of the biggest cases that they bring said harry sandick a partner at law firm patterson belknap and former manhattan federal prosecutor this will forever be connected to the current u s attorney the indictment against bankman fried who was charged with using billions in stolen customer funds to buy real estate pay debts for his hedge fund alameda research and donate to political campaigns situates williams as a primary adversary for the high profile entrepreneur whose downfall has captured public attention and led to calls for greater regulation of cryptocurrency platforms bankman fried 30 has acknowledged risk management failures at ftx but said he does not believe he has criminal liability his lawyer said he is evaluating his legal options on tuesday a judge in the bahamas ordered him detained there while he contests a u s extradition request williams led the southern district of new york s sdny securities and commodities task force before being nominated as the district s top prosecutor by president joe biden williams sdny s first black u s attorney earned his law degree from yale and clerked for former supreme court justice john paul stevens as well as current attorney general merrick garland when garland was an appellate judge earlier this year williams brought the first ever insider trading cases involving digital assets with charges against a former employee of non fungible token trading platform opensea as well as a former product manager at coinbase global inc an ftx rival both those defendants have pleaded not guilty sdny has long been known as one of the most muscular enforcers of financial crimes and some former prosecutors compared williams string of crypto related prosecutions to the focus on insider trading by preet bharara who served as u s attorney from 2009 to 2017 and secured convictions of fund managers such as raj rajaratnam williams was a prosecutor on several high profile financial crimes cases during bharara s tenure including the insider trading conviction of former goldman sachs board member rajat gupta and the fraud conviction of a former portfolio manager at visium asset management lp crypto is the wild west but at the end of the day fraud is fraud said mike ferrara a former prosecutor and now an attorney with kaplan hecker fink llp in new york damian is doing a good job of saying we re going to push the envelope in crypto the way preet was aggressive about insider trading a spokesman for williams office declined to comment come see us before we come see you pursuing cryptocurrency related prosecutions is not without challenges defense lawyers may argue that because the sector is relatively new and questions about how it will be regulated are still being worked out their clients were not clear on how laws crafted for traditional finance applied to them the government is having trouble keeping up and making clear to participants in the industry what they re supposed to be doing said elise maizel a professor at nyu school of law and former white collar defense lawyer with these criminal cases a lot of the time they re regulating through enforcement in one setback for prosecutors three former founders of crypto exchange bitmex and its first employee who pleaded guilty to charges brought by williams predecessor of failing to establish an anti money laundering program earlier this year received lighter sentences than prosecutors requested the judge in that case said that while the crime was serious prosecutors had not brought more weighty charges of money laundering or fraud and there were no identifiable victims to be sure williams office has pursued more traditional financial crimes cases as well with charges filed this year against the founder of archegos capital management for lying to banks to obtain loans before the firm s meltdown and against the former chief investment officer at a unit of germany s allianz se for inflating fund results both pleaded not guilty in the wake of bankman fried s arrest williams has made clear he would plow on with cryptocurrency enforcement on wednesday he announced wire fraud conspiracy charges against the founders of two separate cryptocurrency mining and trading companies he called ponzi schemes the five individuals charged in one of the cases have pleaded not guilty while the three individuals charged in the other have not yet entered pleas on tuesday williams told reporters more charges in the ftx probe were possible this investigation is very much ongoing and it is moving very quickly williams said to anyone who participated in wrongdoing at ftx or alameda research and who has not yet come forward i would strongly encourage you to come see us before we come see you reporting by luc cohen and chris prentice in
