bloomberg sculptor capital management inc founder dan och and other former executives sued the hedge fund firm over chief executive officer jimmy levin s escalating compensation awards the plaintiffs are seeking emails text messages and other records related to levin s promotion to ceo and how the board determined his pay which totaled 145 8 million last year even as sculptor s main fund trailed peers according to a complaint filed wednesday in delaware chancery court levin 39 has two separate contracts one for the top job and the other for his role as chief investment officer since taking the reins in april 2021 levin has devoted himself to entrenching his position at the company shaping the board of directors and wielding that resulting leverage to extract ever escalating pay packages the former executives alleged yet while bringing massive returns to his own pocket mr levin has delivered less than mediocre performance to the limited partners in sculptor s investment funds and the company s stock price has collapsed shares of the new york based firm have tumbled 57 since levin took over as ceo in april 2021 compared with a gain of about 4 for the s p 500 the firm s main hedge fund lost 13 in the first half of 2022 a spokesman for sculptor didn t immediately comment the former executives of the firm previously known as och ziff said they want to probe whether the board broke its duty to shareholders by failing to consider other ceo candidates or conduct proper succession planning they also noted that seven directors have left since january 2020 including five who resigned in the middle of their terms levin has capitalized on these departures to appoint directors who appear handpicked to serve his interests according to the lawsuit the former executives also said in the complaint that it s necessary to understand how the board has gotten to this point and that levin s tactics have harmed and are continuing to harm sculptor s returns for its limited partners och 61 and the other plaintiffs are described as sculptor s original and largest shareholders they include harold kelly richard lyon james o connor and zoltan varga rising star the suit escalates a years long feud between two men who used to be close och was a mentor to levin who joined the firm as an analyst in 2006 and thrived during the 2008 financial crisis becoming a star of sculptor s credit business about a decade later och shocked wall street by appointing levin then just 33 as co cio and positioning him to take over as ceo but robert shafir got the job instead at the heart of the lawsuit is a series of raises sculptor s board granted levin which culminated last year when he became one of the highest paid ceos of any publicly traded us company earning more than the leaders of goldman sachs group inc and jpmorgan chase co remarkably he has demanded and the increasingly supine board has agreed to an ever larger share of returns catapulting his pay to stratospheric levels the plaintiffs said in the complaint in 2019 they and others relinquished some of their ownership in the hedge fund and decided to forgo annual payouts of profits on their remaining stakes until 2026 at the latest according to the lawsuit the idea was to give sculptor leeway to spread this equity among the new cadre of executives and invest for the future in exchange some thresholds were put in place to restrict how easily new pay packages could be negotiated levin nonetheless secured increasingly lucrative deals his nine figure compensation for last year was a complex mix of cash and equity granted under separate contracts for each of his roles a highly unusual arrangement for a leader of a public company lackluster performance proxy adviser institutional shareholder services criticized several aspects of levin s compensation the disparity between payouts and the firm s lackluster long term share performance and relatively small market value the size of levin s bonuses and awards and sculptor s apparent lack of responsiveness to shareholders who raised concerns the plaintiffs also questioned whether some of the board members who approved levin s pay arrangements were truly independent one is wayne cohen sculptor s chief operating officer who reports directly to levin another chairperson marcy engel who led the committee that negotiated levin s most recent pay saw her own fee for serving on the board almost double in 2021 according to the complaint earlier this year board member j morgan rutman quit saying in a letter that he was frozen out of the decision over levin s compensation because he opposed it rutman had been the sole board representative chosen by och a billionaire who now runs his own family office willoughby capital where rutman is president sculptor said in a filing that rutman s letter is filled with significant factual inaccuracies material omissions and baseless assertions that present a misleading view of board governance in a previous statement to bloomberg the firm wrote of its ceo s pay package the majority of the reported compensation has not been received by mr levin and requires that substantial shareholder return thresholds are met over a multiyear vesting period aligning pay to performance for our shareholders and clients updates with share decline in fourth paragraph details from complaint

bloomberg echoing nearly everyone on wall street jpmorgan asset management s bob michele and morgan stanley s michael wilson are on guard for the potential ripple effects of the federal reserve s so called quantitative tightening this is laid bare in the bond market credit spreads typically the difference between the yield on a corporate bond and the benchmark rate are still too expensive said michele jpmorgan asset management s chief investment officer on bloomberg television wednesday they don t seem to adequately price in recession risks by year end they are certainly going to go back up to the old highs of around 600 over michele said i also don t think the markets are adequately pricing in quantitative tightening that hits in full force next month in september the fed is scheduled to step up its balance sheet reduction to a maximum pace of 95 billion running off up to 60 billion in treasuries and 35 billion of mortgage securities since june the monthly cap has been a total of 47 5 billion but last month the fed only ran down its portfolio by only about 22 billion this need to tighten policy to rein in surging inflation has been a major headache confronting the fed read more the fed s qt isn t going to plan new economy daily wilson morgan stanley s chief investment officer in a recent note highlighted that while the fed stopped tightening its policy before the start of an economic contraction during the past four cycles triggering a bullish signal for stocks current historic levels of inflation mean the fed will likely still be tightening when a recession arrives us equities remain stuck in a trading range with the benchmark s p 500 swinging between gains and losses wednesday the benchmark index failed to cross the closely watched 200 day moving average a technical threshold many see as a signal for a durable uptrend the 200 day moving average is relevant because it is the trend wilson said in the same interview so we are in a downtrend and until the market can get back above that downtrend i think to be making some grandiose call about new highs is quite frankly it s irresponsible given what s going on with the fed and qt coming it s going to be a lot worse than people have experienced so far but some wall street analysts have begun entertaining the idea that the fed will stop tightening even as fears of a recession grow not wilson read more morgan stanley sees more fed hikes while jpmorgan expects pivot the big change this time versus say prior periods when maybe markets got excited about a fed pivot is this time they re not going to unless something really bad happens which of course won t be good for stocks wilson said i just think 15 years of excessive monetary policy has made the average investor sort of complacent around this reality still wilson offered two scenarios in which the central bank may pivot though underscored that it s unlikely either the us sees a collapse in inflation because there s deflation in many pockets of the economy or the jobs data shows that the nation is in a full blown recession where companies are really slashing employment i don t know where the pain point is on that for the fed but they don t want to drive us into a deep recession said wilson who correctly predicted this year s selloff but if we got negative payroll data in the next couple of months and that s possible because household data are already negative that would be maybe something where they would pause i don t think they would start slashing rates but they can pause the problem with that narrative for equity investors is that s not going to be good for earnings it s not going to be good for stock prices jpmorgan s michele said the central bank should issue more clarity on how hawkish it intends to be in the face of mounting concerns over a recession at the fed s much anticipated jackson hole wyoming annual event what i hope for at a minimum is that he gives us some metrics about what would it be that would cause them to pause rate hikes and what would cause them to actually start to cut rates michele said referring to fed chair jerome powell what i think the fed should be doing and powell in particular is taking the central bank lead on this and make it his moment for god s sake we are the facing highest inflation in 40 years 2022 bloomberg l p

colorado senator michael bennet speaks to a group of locals wednesday at grand ave grill in eagle chris dillmann vail daily locals on wednesday in eagle got to see what sen michael bennet called a different viewpoint than he often expresses during a campaign stop at grand ave grill last year we talked a lot about the dysfunction in washington and the inability to really get anything done and it s been like that off and on for an awful lot of the time that i ve been in there i regret to say bennet said having said that if you look at the last 12 months or so it is extraordinary what s been accomplished bennet said he was most proud of the recently passed inflation reduction act otherwise known as the climate bill sharing a story of an 11th hour fight to include 4 billion to combat the effects of drought in the colorado river basin i went on national television and said i m not voting for a bill that does anything to mess up colorado s water or the upper basin s water i will not do it bennet said not long after bennet said he found himself in senate majority leader chuck schumer s office support local journalism donate and he was saying to me you ve got an hour and a half to negotiate this language with sen kyrsten sinema sen joe manchin sen catherine cortez masto sen mark kelly bennet said and we were able to do it bennet touted other legislation that he had a hand in passing in recent months including the postal service reform act which was signed into law in april the veterans health care freedom act which passed the u s senate on aug 2 and the chips and science act which was signed into law on aug 9 but bennet also shared his concerns about the large issues that he said have been bothering him since he took office people say we can t save we feel like our kids are going to live a more diminished life than the life we live and we re already making choices that our parents and grandparents didn t have to make bennet said ninety year old katherine delanoy of eagle met bennet for the first time on wednesday after years of writing letters to his office delanoy said when she first started writing bennet early in his first term her letters contained some harsh criticisms but he s since withdrawn his support for fossil fuels so now the letters are nicer she said colorado sen michael bennet left addresses attendees at a campaign event at grand ave grill in eagle on wednesday on his right is katherine delanoy 90 of eagle who met the senator for the first time at the event chris dillmann vail daily delanoy was one of several locals who were able to ask bennet an impromptu question on wednesday delanoy said the climate bill does a lot to encourage change from oil and gas to renewables but my feeling is nothing is moving fast enough and i m wondering if there s anything else coming up bennet told delanoy that after years of having a policy that was terrible on reducing emissions he feels the u s is finally transitioning away from a fossil fuel economy bennet said the reason the transition didn t start sooner is the american people are worried about transforming the economy and the federal government will screw it up all legitimate concerns he said as a result it s been easy for the oil lobby to stop everything in its tracks bennet said but i do think the fact that we are able to assert fundamental american leadership on this question is going to mean we re going to be able to move the rest of the world in this direction more quickly than we otherwise would have bennet also said he was proud of the inflation reduction act because it will raise taxes on companies that are doing stock buybacks to engineer results along with companies that make more than 1 billion per year my kids and the kids that are the age of my kids in colorado and across this country they ve never lived in a democracy that s actually worked very well they ve lived in an economy that s relentlessly shoveled the benefits of that economy to the wealthiest people and their view of us people in congress is could you at least show some shred of caring for us by doing something on climate change bennet said bennet is running for a third term in the senate and in talking points for events like wednesday s my staff you know they put in the word proud bennet said saying he always removes the word from his speeches but on the climate bill bennet told delanoy i was proud katherine to call my daughter caroline who s my oldest daughter who s 22 years old and say to her that after working all night after fighting off all those amendments after being on the floor for 36 hours that i could report to her that we had passed the most significant climate change legislation that america has ever seen
the world s most powerful central bankers are jetting in for crisis talks as inflation spirals out of control us federal reserve chief jerome powell and bank of england governor andrew bailey are among those due to attend the three day event in jackson hole in the us top of the agenda will be how far to raise interest rates as they battle the soaring cost of living crisis talks us federal reserve chief jerome powell left and bank of england governor andrew bailey right are set to attend three days of talks in jackson hole in wyoming usa officials in america britain and europe are raising rates to try to douse the flames of spiralling prices but markets are worried about how hard and how fast they will go as higher borrowing costs add to recessionary pressures across the world ahead of the start of the meeting today global markets were muted and the safe haven dollar was again ascendant on signs of a further hawkish tilt from the fed the euro has fallen beneath parity with the dollar while the pound has swooned to just above 1 18 meanwhile the ftse 100 fell under 7500 and europe s stoxx index hit a four week low before recovering a keynote speech from powell tomorrow could signal a dialling down in the pace of us rate hikes and dampen hopes of rates being cut in 2023 comments this week by another fed official neel kashkari added to the caution warning that even more aggressive hikes might be needed also on friday america s pce index the fed s preferred inflation measure is released last year powell insisted inflation would be transitory spiking prices were largely attributed to the return of demand after lockdowns and supply chains buckling as they sought to readjust to reopening but war in ukraine has driven up energy costs and threatened blackouts in europe the fear is that inflation will become embedded driving demands for higher wages from workers in the uk where inflation hit 10 1 per cent last month the bank of england has tried to take control with a series of rate hikes the latest a 0 5 percentage point rise was the sharpest since 1995 and another looks likely in september followed by more going into next year the european central bank has been slower to act before ordering a surprise half percentage point jump last month in the us the fed has lifted rates from near zero at the start of 2022 to more than 2pc but the effect to choke demand threatens to strangle growth so officials at jackson hole are eyeing what comes next they are caught between a coming recession and sky high inflation said holger schmieding chief economist at berenberg their first concern is to react to high inflation once recession is clearly there the concern will shift us growth reversed at the start of this year but looks more likely to enjoy a soft landing than europe germany europe s biggest economy is seeing russian gas choked off and could face a tough winter with data suggesting it is in a downturn britain is forecast to enter a recession this year the key is energy energy energy electricity prices are ten times pre covid levels said thomas costerg at pictet wealth management we all knew the achilles heel of europe is foreign energy and now they are paying the price richard flynn managing director at charles schwab uk said he had seen signs of rates peaking adding this year s symposium may provide an early indication of when the turn from hikes to cuts may occur

in or around september 2022 however the partnership is currently negotiating a new proposed one year time charter contract with options to extend with an oil major to commence in or around september 2022 gary chapman chief executive officer and chief financial officer of knot offshore partners lp commented during the second quarter the partnership s operational performance remained strong with 100 utilization for scheduled operations while our financial results continued to reflect the high concentration of drydocking in the first half of the year there will be some residual impact in the third quarter as vessels complete these works and their voyages back to brazil but the bulk of this heavy drydocking is now behind us we have also recently agreed multiple interim charters and extensions to increase our substantial contracted forward revenue though it remains the case that we expect the shuttle tanker charter market to be bumpy for at least the duration of 2022 largely attributable to production ramp up delays caused by the initial onset of covid 19 we remain focused on securing further employment as the expected medium term market tightening draws closer driven by the limited shuttle tanker orderbook and the offshore production growth plans evidenced by large oil major capital expenditure outlays for new fpsos in brazil in particular on the basis of these strong medium term fundamentals we were pleased to acquire the synnove knutsen on a non dilutive basis and we remain committed to maintaining our longstanding leadership position in the shuttle tanker sector and delivering a strong operational performance to support our quarterly distributions to unitholders 1 ebitda adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are non gaap financial measures used

million for the three months ended march 31 2022 the first quarter the decrease was mainly due to increased off hire in connection with the scheduled drydockings vessel operating expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were 23 0 million an increase of 2 9 million from 20 1 million in the first quarter of 2022 the increase was mainly related to bunker costs for the windsor knutsen the lena knutsen the anna knusten and the vigdis knutsen in connection with their voyages to drydock depreciation was 26 1 million for the second quarter an increase of 0 2 million from 25 9 million in the first quarter general and administrative expenses were 1 4 million for the second quarter compared to 1 7 million for the first quarter as a result operating income for the second quarter was 13 4 million compared to 17 5 million for the first quarter interest expense for the second quarter was 8 3 million an increase of 1 6 million from 6 7 million for the first quarter the increase being mainly due to an increase in the us dollar libor rate the realized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments was 5 1 million in the second quarter compared to realized and unrealized gain of 16 4 million in the first quarter the unrealized non cash element of the mark to market gain was 6 7 million for the second quarter compared to an unrealized gain of 18 2 million for the first quarter the unrealized gain for the second quarter related to mark to market gain on interest rate swaps of 7 1 million and a loss of 0 4 million on foreign exchange contracts as a result net income for the second quarter was 9 9 million compared to 26 8 million for the first quarter net income for the second quarter of 2022 increased by 20 8 million from a net loss of 10 9 million for the second quarter of 2021 to 9 9 million for the second quarter of 2022 operating income for the second quarter of 2022 increased by 14 6 million to 13 4 million compared to an operating loss of 1 2 million in the second quarter of 2021 this increase is mainly due to the impairment of the windsor knutsen and higher operating expenses in the second quarter of 2021 total finance expense for the second quarter of 2022 decreased by 6 1 million to 3 4 million compared to finance expense of 9 5 million for the second quarter of 2021 mainly due to an increase in unrealized gain on derivative instruments distributable cash flow was 9 4 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 14 5 million for the first quarter of 2022 the decrease was mainly a result of lower utilization of the fleet due to offhire in the second quarter of 2022 arising from the scheduled drydockings and associated bunker costs the distribution declared for the second quarter was 0 52 per common and class b unit equivalent to an annualized distribution of 2 08 covid 19 the partnership has continued to date to avoid any serious or sustained operational impacts from the coronavirus covid 19 pandemic and there have been no effects on the partnership s contractual position enhanced protocols remain in place with a focus on ensuring the health and safety of our employees and crew onboard while providing safe and reliable operations for our customers travel restrictions and shortening of quarantine periods continue to ease in various places around the world however costs related to the movement of maritime personnel and vessel operational logistics including repairs and maintenance remain above their historical average and the partnership expects these higher costs to persist for some time into the future although the partnership is negatively affected by such higher costs they are not considered a material threat to the business operational review the partnership s vessels operated throughout the second quarter of 2022 with 100 utilization for scheduled operations and 90 5 utilization taking into account the scheduled drydockings of the lena knutsen the anna knutsen the vigdis knutsen and

shuttle tankers that knutsen nyk acquires or owns that are employed under charters for periods of five or more years there can be no assurance that the partnership will acquire any additional vessels from knutsen nyk outlook as of june 30 2022 the partnership s fleet of seventeen vessels had an average age of 8 5 years and had charters with an average remaining fixed duration of 1 7 years in addition the charterers of the partnership s time chartered vessels had options to extend their charters by an additional 2 4 years on average as of june 30 2022 the partnership had 487 million of remaining contracted forward revenue excluding options the partnership s earnings for the third quarter of 2022 will be affected by the offhire related to the mobilization trip back to brazil for the windsor knutsen and the lena knutsen which have each completed their scheduled drydocking in europe and the planned redelivery of the hilda knutsen and the lack of firm employment for the windsor knutsen notwithstanding the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on the oil industry and decisions made by our customers to delay and postpone offshore projects brazil continues to demonstrate increasing activity which supports our view that demand for shuttle tankers in our main market where 13 of our vessels typically operate is improving however the delayed resumption of activity in the north sea continues to dampen a return to high shuttle tanker demand in our secondary market and we believe that this situation could persist for several more quarters uncertainty caused by the ongoing war in ukraine the desire from developed economies for greater immediate and short term energy security continuing high oil prices and increases seen in newbuild vessel prices in 2022 are all contributory factors that could increase demand for shuttle tankers in the short and medium term although the north sea market gives some cause for concern the partnership is working to address the gaps in vessel employment that have occurred and is looking at all commercial and financial avenues to ensure that the best interests of the partnership s unitholders are respected during what the partnership believes is a bumpy but temporary period several new contracts were recently agreed with customers and other opportunities remain under discussion due to the niche nature of the shuttle tanker market the integral role that shuttle tankers play in customers supply chains and the absence of speculative ordering meaning that the vast majority of the global fleet are not â in the market the partnership believes that the mid to long term expansion of deep and ultra deep water offshore oil production in pre salt brazil and also some growth in the north sea and the barents sea remain fully supported by publicly announced investment decisions production sharing agreements and production forecasts made by the partnership s customers including the large number of fpso orders intended for brazilian pre salt fields as such the partnership believes that these factors will drive demand for existing and for newbuild shuttle tankers and that shuttle tanker demand growth will outpace net

jetcityimage bank of america corporation nyse bac has changed its business model since the great financial crisis of 2008 once at the epicenter of the highly destructive subprime loans it has now focused at the other end of the spectrum in conservatism today we will go over how the bank has performed over the longer run and take a look at a couple of great income choices that might make sense for investors fair value today bac has increased its tangible book value per share by over 120 since 2009 the performance has been steady with a few small drops along the way data by ycharts the stock though has had a far more volatile movement as investors went from extreme pessimism in 2012 0 6x tangible book to extreme optimism in 2022 2 3x tangible book data by ycharts the recent drop from the highs was predictable as investors became enamored with peak earnings and bid the bank to crazy heights q2 2022 brought investors back to earth as earnings fell 9 bank of america q2 2022 presentation don t get us wrong those results were fine all things considered we were particularly impressed by the control on non interest expenses a category we felt jpmorgan chase co jpm slipped on markets were probably focused on the falling income and the slowdown in capital return based on the new higher cet1 requirements the extremely high valuation was only the fodder for the fat bears at present we think the shares are in the hold neutral range valuation has come down but we would see only a sub 1 4x tangible book as a compelling entry point we are very confident we will get that in a recession with accelerating charge offs and a very flat to inverted yield curve so our take here is buy below 30 choices investors could no doubt wait for that setup and that would be a great point to buy of course there is no certainty in anything despite our stated confidence and you could never get that sub 30 price one way to approach that would be to sell cash secured puts for 30 00 below we have shown the february 2023 put options seeking alpha the 30 strikes have a great risk reward setup with a 10 27 yield even if prices drop about 15 till then author s app that is as long as bac stays over 30 at expiration you would make 10 27 on risked capital the other alternative of course not all income investors are comfortable navigating the options landscape even if provides the best risk adjusted yields for those that are not comfortable we do have another idea hear us out bac provides a very tiny 2 44 yield the advantage of that rather minuscule payout is that bac has an amazing dividend coverage and can buyback shares as conditions dictate with remaining cash but for those looking for more yield outside of options bank of america corporation 7 25 convertible preferred l bac pl a really busted preferred provides an interesting alternative bank of america preferred stock bank of america corporation a few relevant points on this preferred share class that we think investors should grasp are presented below bac pl was issued in 2008 and the par value was 1 000 the shares rank in line with other preferred issues and like almost all of them there is one exception the dividends are non cumulative bac pl and all other preferred shares need to be paid if bac wants to pay a single cent to common shareholders it is one of the rare preferred shares out there that cannot be redeemed by bac i e it is non callable bac pl is also convertible at the option of the holder into 20 shares of common stock this was based on a 50 common stock price 1 000 preferred share price at the inception of this preferred series at current market price the preferred stock conversion does not make sense preferred 1 221 versus 35 for common the 35 common shares would only equate to 700 in total the original conditions also allowed bac to force a conversion on or after january 30 2013 here the requirements were that if the common shares exceeds 65 130 of 50 for 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days the bank has the option to convert all or some of this issue into common shares the one reason we are bringing this one up now is that the price is far more reasonable looking at the one year timeframe we can see that there was a bohemian push on this all the way to 1 500 a share seeking alpha investors bidding that would get a 4 83 yield on their price they would also risk a forced conversion down the line where they would be paid back perhaps as less as 1 300 in bac shares assuming the same happened within a 4 year time frame those investors would make about 1 5 a year as their 290 in dividends would be offset with a 200 loss on conversion today however things look quite peachy in comparison bac pl now gets 5 99 on a stripped yield basis bac is nowhere near 65 but even assuming it gets there a forced conversion would create a capital gain of about 80 00 in other words you have sailed right past the return free risk zone which yield chasers had gotten into there are other events like an acquisition reorganization or fundamental change in the investment that can prompt a conversion to common receiving make whole shares which can be read in further detail in the prospectus our assessment on those is that they are extremely unlikely but investors may want to read through those by themselves verdict bac wins full marks for their longer term performance and we believe even in the upcoming turbulent times it will show its mettle the common shares are poor yield plays though and hence we have outlined two interesting choices for those looking for income we have our financial sector quota full for now but we are keeping an eye on both these choices for our subscribers please note that this is not financial advice it may seem like it sound like it but surprisingly it is not investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult with a professional who knows their objectives and constraints

continuing to optimise the performance of its existing mining fleet argo is making significant progress towards the completion of phase 1 of helios on 5 may 2022 the group energized the facility and commenced mining operations argo commemorated this important milestone with an inauguration ceremony attended by local state and federal elected officials as well as members of the local community since then the group has continued to install new machines and is on track to complete the installation of its order of 20 000 s19 j pro machines from bitmain by october 2022 additionally in july 2022 argo completed its machine swap agreement with core scientific which included the installation of an additional approximately 10 000 machines at helios upon completion of the machine swap agreement the group now operates 100 of its owned machines and has no third party hosting arrangements this is the culmination of the strategic pivot away from hosting to a fully vertically integrated business model that began with the acquisition of two data centres in quebec in early 2021 being vertically integrated will allow argo s management to have more operational control over its mining machines and drive increased performance additionally controlling operational expenses will be critical as the next bitcoin halving cycle takes place in may 2024 and the bitcoin block reward is reduced by 50 on the second goal argo is operating with a mining margin of 70 over the period which is among the highest of the group s peers as the group s fleet is upgraded to the newer and more efficient s19j pro machines it continues to review the profitability and performance of the older machines in its fleet post period end the group completed a comprehensive review of its mining fleet and removed 460 ph s of non operational mining capacity from its total hashrate this primarily comprises s17 and t17 machines which despite a higher rate of failure have been profitable for the group with a total aggregate roi in excess of 260 argo is also making progress on the custom mining machine it is developing in collaboration with epic blockchain that is specifically designed to utilize the intel blockscale asic chip delivery and deployment of these machines is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2022 in january the group formally launched argo labs its in house innovation arm established to identify opportunities within the broader web3 and blockchain ecosystem while supporting the decentralization of various blockchain protocols argo allocated approximately 10 of the group s crypto assets in its hodl to argo labs argo labs is primarily focused on two key areas network participation and strategic diversification through the efficient deployment of the group s crypto treasury assets network participation consists of providing infrastructure support running nodes and validators and staking innovative projects efficient deployment of the group s crypto treasury assets includes among other things supporting early stage projects and participating in decentralized finance defi as well as the nft metaverse ecosystem in each case in furtherance of the group s general business operations by gaining exposure to the broader digital asset ecosystem argo labs will allow the group to participate in disruptive technologies and provide long term value to its shareholders despite the overall market drawdown and the decrease in bitcoin price the group has been able to raise significant capital via secured debt financing in march 2022 argo obtained 20 2 million 26 7 million of debt financing from nydig the proceeds of which were used to continue the build out of helios these borrowings are secured by certain electrical infrastructure equipment at the helios facility additionally in may 2022 argo announced another debt financing agreement with nydig for up to 56 3 million 70 6 million these borrowings are secured by certain s19j pro mining machines located at helios the group is mindful of its carbon footprint and maintains a strong focus on environmental sustainability the group s mining facilities in quebec are powered by hydroelectricity and operations in texas are located in the texas panhandle where 85 of the generation capacity comes from wind power in 2021 the group signed the crypto climate accord committing to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030 in 2021 argo reached this goal releasing a full climate strategy and becoming the first bitcoin mining company to announce climate positive status through its use of renewable energy to power mining operations and by offsetting more scope 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions than it emitted in both 2020 and 2021 additionally argo was a founding member of the bitcoin mining council which educates the public on the increasing amount of renewable energy used for bitcoin mining it also seeks to improve reporting and increase the amount of data available on the use of renewable energy within the sector argo s operations in quebec and texas also promote sustainability by helping to stabilize the electrical grid in quebec argo participates in curtailment programs to lower electricity usage during periods of extreme weather in texas the helios facility will participate in demand response programs whereby it can reduce its electricity usage and increase availability of power to the grid in times of peak demand this flexibility in electricity load has profound benefits for grid stability and helps to ensure equilibrium between supply and demand this was demonstrated in july 2022 when argo along with most large scale bitcoin miners in texas voluntarily shut down operations in response to a conservation alert from ercot bitcoin miners collectively curtailed over 1 000 mw of electricity demand which was then available during a time of intense heat and peak electricity demand this action enabled ercot to avoid implementing rolling blackouts which would have negatively impacted residential and commercial electricity users across the state having successfully energized the helios facility and commenced mining operations the group s strategic focus for the remainder of 2022 is to complete the build out of phase 1 and lay the groundwork for the development of future phases at helios outlook while the first half of 2022 presented many challenges i am delighted with the progress that we have made in developing helios and positioning ourselves as a leader in the bitcoin mining industry we designed and built a world class bitcoin mining facility from the ground up balancing prudent growth with a volatile market furthermore we continue to lead the industry with our commitment to sustainability and we were proud to publish the group s 2021 sustainability report which explains our climate positive status as operations at helios continue to ramp up there are certain milestones which will enable us to optimise our operations and achieve greater efficiency we are evaluating several opportunities to execute a long term fixed price power purchase agreement ppa which will lock in our electricity prices and reduce our exposure to short term price fluctuations once the fixed price ppa is in place helios will have more optionality to participate in the demand response programs offered by ercot which will further reduce its overall electricity cost during the period there has been a global macroeconomic pullback as investors and central bankers grapple with inflation the war in ukraine and rising interest rates these headwinds have impacted all financial assets including bitcoin and the equity of publicly traded bitcoin miners argo is well positioned to weather the current downturn with its large and highly efficient mining infrastructure runway for growth and experienced management team which has successfully navigated the group through previous crypto winters in response to the challenging market environment we have adjusted our treasury management strategy throughout the period we have been steadily selling bitcoin utilizing derivatives to obtain a higher realized price than simply selling into the market in q2 2022 we sold bitcoin at an average realized price of approximately 28 500 realizing hedge gains in excess of 1 500 per bitcoin proceeds from these sales have been used for operating expenses capital expenditures and to reduce exposure on our bitcoin backed loan despite the challenging economic environment in 2022 we continue to focus on our strategic priority of completing phase 1 of helios and laying the groundwork to further scale operations on behalf of the board i would like to thank all shareholders and staff who share in argo s mission of powering the

mclean va accesswire august 24 2022 gladstone land corporation nasdaq land gladstone land or the company today announced the amendment of certain terms of the company s 500 million continuous offering of its 6 00 series c cumulative preferred stock the series c preferred stock to limit total sales to no more than 10 200 000 shares or up to 255 million in the primary offering and to limit the number of shares to be sold under the dividend reinvestment plan to no more than 200 000 shares as a result of today s amendment the primary offering was reduced from 20 000 000 shares approximately 500 million to 10 200 000 shares approximately 255 million and the offering of the company s series c preferred stock will now terminate on the earlier of december 31 2022 or the date on which all 10 200 000 shares of series c preferred stock offered in the primary offering are sold the company has so far sold approximately 213 million of its series c preferred stock since filing a prospectus supplement on april 3 2020 comments from david gladstone president and ceo of gladstone land we began selling our series c preferred stock in april 2020 after we completed our 150 million series b preferred stock offering since launching the series b preferred stock offering in may 2018 we ve used the series b and series c proceeds to help grow our farmland holdings from 75 farms with approximately 63 000 acres worth about 543 million in mid 2018 to 169 farms with over 115 000 acres and 45 000 acre feet of banked water worth a total of over 1 5 billion today having access to the independent broker dealer and ria markets has been invaluable for our growth and continues to enhance our breadth of capital sources mr gladstone added our current farmland portfolio continues to perform well and our existing debt remains very affordable for us as over 99 of our current borrowings are fixed at a weighted average cost of just 3 26 for the next five plus years however the cost of new financing including our undrawn lines of credit is becoming more expensive and we are seeing cap rates compress in many of our regions of focus while overall farmland values continue to increase rental rates in certain areas are not increasing quite as fast and we believe it may take some time for rents to adjust to current land prices we try to adhere to a disciplined underwriting approach so that we re only acquiring new farms that we believe will be accretive to both us and our shareholders however the rising cost of capital cap rate compression in certain markets and uncertainty surrounding the overall economy has led to a slowdown in our acquisition activity so far this year thus we believe it is prudent to slow down our fundraising efforts with regard to the series c preferred stock and reduce our overall cost of capital which we believe will allow us to make more competitive bids on new acquisitions the company intends to continue to use the net proceeds from the series c preferred stock offering to repay existing indebtedness fund future acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes there is currently no public market for shares of series c preferred stock the company intends to apply to list the series c preferred stock on nasdaq or another national securities exchange within one calendar year of the termination date of the offering

miniso stores are secretly owned by executives or insiders closely connected to the chairman and ltimately we believe that there is overwhelming evidence that miniso misleads the market about its core

public company through opaque caribbean jurisdictions as the middleman in a crooked headquarters deal blue orca further concluded that ndependent evidence including archived disclosures on miniso s chinese website reports in chinese media and interviews with former employees indicate that miniso is a brand in serious peril noting that miniso lowered its franchising fee by 63 over the past two

vancouver optimism over an expected bumper season for wild british columbia sockeye salmon has turned to distress after a regulatory body s estimate of returns to the fraser river dropped by nearly half this week vancouver optimism over an expected bumper season for wild british columbia sockeye salmon has turned to distress after a regulatory body s estimate of returns to the fraser river dropped by nearly half this week the pacific salmon commission s pre season estimate of 9 8 million returning fish went down to 5 5 million monday prompting environmentalists and fishers alike to express concern it s disturbingly bad said greg taylor senior fisheries adviser with watershed watch salmon society hopes were high for the sockeye run this year in part because the fish return to spawn in the fraser river on a four year cycle with 2022 being one of the expected peak years he said the low figure raises conservation concerns and suggests the sockeye fishery in b c waters is unlikely to open this year creating what a commercial fishers union says are dire circumstances for its members it came days after a less conservative estimate sparked tension between u s and canadian officials the commission which was created jointly by the united states and canada to manage pacific salmon stocks estimated last thursday that the run would be 7 2 million before dropping that figure further while the u s accepted the commission s assessment last week and allowed its sockeye fisheries to open over the weekend canada s fisheries department urged a more conservative count and canadian fisheries remained closed the united states agreed with our recommendations last week and canada wanted to see a number even lower than what was recommended said fiona martens the commission s chief of fisheries management programs martens said the commission makes its best guesses based on test fisheries and models the number of fish returning was still trending upward on thursday but had not yet peaked she said in order for us to come up with the best run size we need to see a peak in that data we weren t seeing that last week so there was definitely some uncertainty martens said the u s fisheries have since been closed she said fisheries minister joyce murray was not available for an interview and the washington state department of fish and wildlife did not return a request for comment kevin lemkay a spokesman for murray said the government is following the panel s decision with great concern for both wild salmon and canadian harvesters dfo was clear during negotiations that it believed the commission s run size estimates were far too high and were extremely disappointed to see fisheries proposals allowed based on overly optimistic estimates of run sizes lemkay said in a statement while canada is happy the commission has since adopted a more precautionary approach he said the government is equally disappointed that sockeye runs are proving weaker than expected fishers expressed dismay at both the missed opportunity to fish and the lack of support they felt from government for kyle louis who fishes out of steveston b c learning that his u s counterparts were hitting the water while he was forced to dock was heartbreaking fortunately for myself i m engaged in other fisheries i do crab prawn herring but for the mom and pop operations that only have gillnet licences and solely rely on that they re going to be forced to sell their boats they re going to be forced to sell their gear he said from cowichan bay james lawson president of the united fishermen and allied workers union unifor said some commercial fishers went out to sea thinking they would be fishing and can t afford to make it home with no catch the federal government isn t offering enough transition support to fishers as the industry crumbles around them he said employment insurance is inaccessible when tied to income that doesn t exist and licence fees should be reduced for financial relief he said they should be seeking a labour force adjustment for us maybe some disaster relief he said noting fishing has been limited for years the union believes in acting upon the best available science and it agrees with the commission s estimates including thursday s which provided for temporary harvesting he said now that he peak has passed the brief chance to fish is gone what little opportunity there was the americans took effectively leaving us out of the water they beat us to the punch while our government kept us tied to the dock he said lemkay said the impact to harvesters is not lost on the minister the government is developing a licence buyback program with input from licence holders through the 647 million pacific salmon strategy initiative supports will also be offered to dispose of vessels and non selective fishing gear he said the small fraser runs are a concerning anomaly that may point to the impact of human activity according to taylor notably sockeye returns to other parts of the north pacific from russia to the columbia river have been strong he said they include british columbia s skeena river and barclay sound the weakest fraser returns are in the southern and eastern parts of the watershed where humans have altered the landscape he said poor runs this year include the famed adams rivers run and others in the kamloops and shuswap areas that raises a few questions you know that s where a lot of the population lives that s where we humans have really manipulated the habitat he said adding that climate change is also contributing to warming waters wildfires and other negative local impacts declines of fraser river sockeye may be canaries in the coal mine potentially reflecting the health of the salish sea and land around it he added i hate to use that tired old metaphor but they truly are he said the numbers should send warning signals to all british columbians for a need to reform logging practices and protect and rehabilitate habitat he said the future does not look good for poor salmon unless we do that this report by the canadian press was first published aug 24 2022 amy smart the canadian press

more information visit www argoblockchain com interim management report argo entered 2022 with two clear goals to complete phase 1 of the group s helios facility in dickens county texas while continuing to optimise the performance of its existing mining fleet argo is making significant progress towards the completion of phase 1 of helios on 5 may 2022 the group energized the facility and commenced mining operations argo commemorated this important milestone with an inauguration ceremony attended by local state and federal elected officials as well as members of the local community since then the group has continued to install new machines and is on track to complete the installation of its order of 20 000 s19 j pro machines from bitmain by october 2022 additionally in july 2022 argo completed its machine swap agreement with core scientific which included the installation of an additional approximately 10 000 machines at helios upon completion of the machine swap agreement the group now operates 100 of its owned machines and has no third party hosting arrangements this is the culmination of the strategic pivot away from hosting to a fully vertically integrated business model that began with the acquisition of two data centres in quebec in early 2021 being vertically integrated will allow argo s management to have more operational control over its mining machines and drive increased performance additionally controlling operational expenses will be critical as the next bitcoin halving cycle takes place in may 2024 and the bitcoin block reward is reduced by 50 on the second goal argo is operating with a mining margin of 70 over the period which is among the highest of the group s peers as the group s fleet is upgraded to the newer and more efficient s19j pro machines it continues to review the profitability and performance of the older machines in its fleet post period end the group completed a comprehensive review of its mining fleet and removed 460 ph s of non operational mining capacity from its total hashrate this primarily comprises s17 and t17 machines which despite a higher rate of failure have been profitable for the group with a total aggregate roi in excess of 260 argo is also making progress on the custom mining machine it is developing in collaboration with epic blockchain that is specifically designed to utilize the intel blockscale asic chip delivery and deployment of these machines is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2022 in january the group formally launched argo labs its in house innovation arm established to identify opportunities within the broader web3 and blockchain ecosystem while supporting the decentralization of various blockchain protocols argo allocated approximately 10 of the group s crypto assets in its hodl to argo labs argo labs is primarily focused on two key areas network participation and strategic diversification through the efficient deployment of the group s crypto treasury assets network participation consists of providing infrastructure support running nodes and validators and staking innovative projects efficient deployment of the group s crypto treasury assets includes among other things supporting early stage projects and participating in decentralized finance defi as well as the nft metaverse ecosystem in each case in furtherance of the group s general business operations by gaining exposure to the broader digital asset ecosystem argo labs will allow the group to participate in disruptive technologies and provide long term value to its shareholders despite the overall market drawdown and the decrease in bitcoin price the group has been able to raise significant capital via secured debt financing in march 2022 argo obtained 20 2 million 26 7 million of debt financing from nydig the proceeds of which were used to continue the build out of helios these borrowings are secured by certain electrical infrastructure equipment at the helios facility additionally in may 2022 argo announced another debt financing agreement with nydig for up to 56 3 million 70 6 million these borrowings are secured by certain s19j pro mining machines located at helios the group is mindful of its carbon footprint and maintains a strong focus on environmental sustainability the group s mining facilities in quebec are powered by hydroelectricity and operations in texas are located in the texas panhandle where 85 of the generation capacity comes from wind power in 2021 the group signed the crypto climate accord committing to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030 in 2021 argo reached this goal releasing a full climate strategy and becoming the first bitcoin mining company to announce climate positive status through its use of renewable energy to power mining operations and by offsetting more scope 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions than it emitted in both 2020 and 2021 additionally argo was a founding member of the bitcoin mining council which educates the public on the increasing amount of renewable energy used for bitcoin mining it also seeks to improve reporting and increase the amount of data available on the use of renewable energy within the sector argo s operations in quebec and texas also promote sustainability by helping to stabilize the electrical grid in quebec argo participates in curtailment programs to lower electricity usage during periods of extreme weather in texas the helios facility will participate in demand response programs whereby it can reduce its electricity usage and increase availability of power to the grid in times of peak demand this flexibility in electricity load has profound benefits for grid stability and helps to ensure equilibrium between supply and demand this was demonstrated in july 2022 when argo along with most large scale bitcoin miners in texas voluntarily shut down operations in response to a conservation alert from ercot bitcoin miners collectively curtailed over 1 000 mw of electricity demand which was then available during a time of intense heat and peak electricity demand this action enabled ercot to avoid implementing rolling blackouts which would have negatively impacted residential and commercial electricity users across the state having successfully energized the helios facility and commenced mining operations the group s strategic focus for the remainder of 2022 is to complete the build out of phase 1 and lay the groundwork for the development of future phases at helios outlook while the first half of 2022 presented many challenges i am delighted with the progress that we have made in developing helios and positioning ourselves as a leader in the bitcoin mining industry we designed and built a world class bitcoin mining facility from the ground up balancing prudent growth with a volatile market furthermore we continue to lead the industry with our commitment to sustainability and we were proud to publish the group s 2021 sustainability report which explains our climate positive status as operations at helios continue to ramp up there are certain milestones which will enable us to optimise our operations and achieve greater efficiency we are evaluating several opportunities to execute a long term fixed price power purchase agreement ppa which will lock in our electricity prices and reduce our exposure to short term price fluctuations once the fixed price ppa is in place helios will have more optionality to participate in the demand response programs offered by ercot which will further reduce its overall electricity cost during the period there has been a global macroeconomic pullback as investors and central bankers grapple with inflation the war in ukraine and rising interest rates these

addressing a central criticism of the plan i will never apologize for helping working americans and middle class especially not to the same folks who voted for a 2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthiest americans and the biggest corporations biden said referring to a republican tax cut passed under former president donald trump borrower balances have been frozen since the beginning of the covid 19 outbreak with no payments required on most federal student loans since march 2020 many democrats had pushed for biden to forgive as much as 50 000 per borrower republicans mostly opposed student loan forgiveness calling it unfair because it will disproportionately help people earning higher incomes president biden s student loan socialism is a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college every graduate who paid their debt and every american who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our armed forces in order to avoid taking on debt senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said wednesday the administration has yet to determine the price tag for the package which will depend on how many people apply for it white house domestic policy adviser susan rice told reporters student loans obtained after june 30 this year are not eligible she said white house press secretary karine jean pierre told reporters the administration has legal authority to forgive the debt under a law allowing such action during a national emergency such as a pandemic earlier republican u s representative elise stefanik had called the plan reckless and illegal american university tuition fees are substantially higher than in most other rich countries and u s consumers carry 1 75 trillion in student loan debt most of it held by the federal government biden said other countries could bypass the united states economically if students are not offered economic relief pandemic pause pell grants the administration will extend a covid 19 pandemic linked pause on student loan repayment to year end while forgiving 10 000 in student debt for single borrowers with annual income under 125 000 a year or married couples who earn less than 250 000 the white house said some 8 million borrowers will be affected automatically the department of education said others need to apply for forgiveness the government is also forgiving up to 20 000 in debt for some 6 million students from low income families who received federal pell grants and proposing a new rule that protects some income from repayment plans and forgives some loan balances after 10 years of repayment the education department said a new york federal reserve study shows that cutting 10 000 in federal debt for every student would amount to 321 billion and eliminate the entire balance for 11 8 million borrowers or 31 of them inflation impact a senior biden administration official told reporters the plan could benefit up to 43 million student borrowers completely canceling the debt for some 20 million after dec 31 the government will resume requiring payment on remaining student loans that were paused during the pandemic the official said this would offset any inflationary effects of the forgiveness payment resumptions could even have a dampening effect on prices the official said former u s treasury secretary larry summers disagreed he said on twitter nyse that debt relief consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not for whatever reason have the chance to attend college it will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions similarly jason furman a harvard professor who headed the council of economic advisers during the obama administration said debt cancellation would nullify the deflationary powers of the inflation reduction act pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless he said moody s nyse analytics chief economist mark zandi sided with the white house saying the resumption of billions of dollars per month in student loan payments will restrain growth and is disinflationary

t he death knell for corporate america s greatest individual experiment in mergers and acquisitions sounded in november 2021 when general electric announced its intention to split in three a thousand deals were struck by jack welch its notoriously gung ho boss who ran the american industrial and financial giant between 1981 and 2001 the pace did not slacken under his successor jeffrey immelt the result has been a monumental destruction of shareholder wealth the firm s market value peaked at 594bn in 2000 today it is a relatively measly 83bn listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element this lesson notwithstanding bosses just cannot shake the need to shake hands in 2021 the urge reached fever pitch a record 5 9trn worth of deals were announced globally 3 8trn by operating companies and the balance by private equity funds and special purpose acquisition companies see chart competition for assets was fierce and due diligence frenetic the cost of capital was historically low and purchasers paid top notch prices at a record median valuation of 15 4 times earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda according to bain a consultancy the number of deals for highly valued technology firms soared accounting for a quarter of the total volume if history is any judge many of these deals will destroy value it is easy to identify disastrous deals large goodwill write downs or even bankruptcy are useful signposts but measuring the performance of the average deal is tough relative share price performance is a quick but noisy measure and asking a counterfactual what if question is crystal ball stuff a recent review of academic literature by geoff and j gay meeks at cambridge university estimates that only a fifth of studies conclude that the average deal produces higher combined profits or increases the wealth of the acquirer s shareholders mckinsey another consultancy reckons that firms pursuing large deals between 2010 and 2019 had only a coin flip chance of creating excess shareholder returns enough to put average joes off dealmaking but not budding neutron jacks those chances of success are further reduced by the circumstances in which the latest crop of deals were struck times of frenzy like last year are particularly bad for matching suitable buyers and sellers dealmaking tends to snowball as chief executives keen to expand their dominions and compensation watch others make their moves and are unable to stand idly by while competitors make hay unprecedented competition from private equity funds only intensifies the urge to move fast compounding their zeal are the middlemen investment bankers who get paid by the deal rather than by the hour convince them anything is possible flattery is hard currency in the market for advice there are few brakes on this train where activist investors might agitate on the sell side of a transaction for a higher price often successfully this kind of scrutiny is less common on the buy side strong shareholder dissent in reaction to unilever s abortive 66bn bid for gsk s consumer health care division in december 2021 is an all too rare example of owners holding trigger happy management to account today the division called haleon is listed on the london stock exchange valued at around half of unilever s offer the result has been ambitious deals made at high prices lower asset values are already exposing the flawed logic of some struck at the top of the market in august just eat takeaway com a european food delivery firm announced a write down of the value of grubhub its distracting american misadventure by 3 3bn barely a year after completing the 7 3bn deal as equity markets tumbled this year the shotgun weddings announced in 2021 were being consummated after the thrill of courtship begins the hard task of post merger integration this complex process is the domain of consultants organisational charts and budgeting rather than clandestine negotiations and punchy projections it is being turned on its head by a mix of inflation and slowing growth bosses bet big that high prices would be justified by higher profits they are now running new businesses in a new world buyers tend to overestimate the operational benefits of lumping two firms together synergies in corporate speak often promised but seldom fully delivered these projections persuade bosses that the pin factory is better in their hands than those of private equity s financial wizards scale was the idée fixe of dealmaking during 2021 such deals are usually predicated on heavy cost cutting which is far harder while inflation rages add current supply chain chaos to yo yoing input costs and managers soon find their powers waning that difficulty is apparent at warner bros discovery an american media giant formed in april 2022 through the merger of discovery and warnermedia in an industry among the worst at realising such targets came a promise of 3bn of annual savings rising costs and cyclical pressures on advertising revenue mean that integration will be more difficult than planned expectations for ebitda in 2023 are now 12bn rather than 14bn when the merger was announced the response of david zaslav the firm s boss has been to tighten the screws even further labour is often the first cost bosses turn to even if lots of layoffs raise the chance of rifts between new bedfellows many of the most spectacular blow ups have involved cultural transplant rejection at the highest levels though as in aol and time warner s ill fated 165bn tie up in 2001 this is usually a symptom rather than cause of strategic mismatch yet the real risks occur further down the food chain as labour markets continue to convulse the ability to retain good workers talent in the integration dictionary is critical it comes high on the list of reasons why deals succeed in a recent survey conducted by bain the war for talent has quickly turned into a great hiring freeze in the technology sector but elsewhere labour shortages are the norm significant challenges await the integration of canadian pacific railway and kansas city southern a 31bn deal announced in september 2021 which is awaiting its final regulatory stamps the merger in 1968 of pennsylvania and new york central railroad provides a warning from history shortly before the new entity s bankruptcy in 1970 an internal report laid bare the role of high staff turnover in its failed integration 61 of train masters 81 of transport superintendents and 44 of division superintendents had been in their job for less than a year the dealmakers of 2021 entered the present inflationary period with a high bar to clear in order to justify the top of market deals they struck as of now the mega disasters of this wave of mega deals are matters of speculation though no one doubts they will emerge even this will not be enough to convince bosses to kick their dealmaking habit at least while corporate balance sheets remain strong activity has been remarkably resilient in 2022 until bosses can be persuaded of other uses for their profits new challenges mean only new types of deals at least this year there may be a few bargains to be had for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets

many banks are set to receive a bigger tax bill next year under the new inflation reduction act which raises tax rates for some larger u s corporations and slightly penalizes share buybacks the two provisions are estimated to raise some 296 billion in revenues over 10 years for the federal government helping pay much of the tab for climate change investments that president biden signed into law earlier this month several large and regional banks may take a bigger share of the tax hit because they currently pay below the new 15 minimum corporate tax rate the new minimum tax applies to any companies with at least 1 billion in average annual earnings over the past three years president biden signed the inflation reduction act at the white house on aug 16 bloomberg the buyback provision which charges a 1 excise tax on share repurchases is more wide ranging and would impact publicly traded banks of all sizes two key democrats who have sought a buyback tax senate banking committee chair sherrod brown of ohio and senate finance committee chair ron wyden of oregon have pitched it as an incentive for companies to boost their investments and wages rather than making payouts to shareholders but experts are skeptical that a 1 tax is large enough to achieve that goal they say that the new tax may make dividends which are another way to distribute excess capital slightly more attractive but it won t meaningfully change the landscape the tax will likely curtail buybacks very little but it is definitely not going to decrease payments to shareholders overall said northwestern university finance professor phillip braun below is a breakdown of the two provisions impact on banks buyback tax the 1 buyback tax which will kick in next year applies to any company whose share repurchases are above 1 million a year that amount could capture many publicly traded community banks in addition to large banks the banking industry bought back roughly 75 billion in common shares last year led by bank of america jpmorgan chase citigroup and truist financial according to s p global market intelligence data the buyback tax may also apply to companies preferred stock redemptions and potentially other types of transactions according to a client alert from the law firm davis polk but braun and other experts don t expect the new tax will lead to a significant drop off in stock buybacks they note that repurchases still contain tax advantages over distributing excess capital through dividends if the scales were tilted towards repurchases in the past they re a little bit less tilted towards repurchases now said alice bonaimé a university of arizona finance professor whose research focuses on corporate payout policies but she said a 1 tax is too small to drastically alter corporate behavior another advantage is that buybacks are more flexible than dividends she added since companies can reduce buybacks without major pushback from shareholders while a dividend cut can send alarm signals about a company s health once you initiate a dividend investors expect dividends to continue pretty much forever bonaimé said if you cut the dividend you re heavily punished by the market those dynamics are evident in banks capital payouts this year banks have tempered their buyback programs in 2022 with some 12 8 billion in buybacks during the first quarter down from 13 5 billion a year earlier according to s p global market intelligence in july jpmorgan the country s largest bank by assets announced a temporary suspension of its buyback program to meet higher capital requirements after the federal reserve s most recent stress tests but rather than cutting their dividends large and regional banks are either keeping them flat or even increasing them shareholders really dislike it when they decrease their dividends braun said though he noted that one off special dividends may become slightly more attractive and do not carry that same risk corporate minimum tax the new 15 minimum corporate tax targets companies whose effective tax rates are currently below that threshold though it would also allow for some wiggle room through tax credits and deductions because of those factors a definitive list of companies that will be affected is tough to gather but some analyses suggest certain large and regional banks could see a tax hike a washington post analysis of calcbench data found that bank of america u s bancorp truist financial keycorp m t bank regions financial and huntington bancshares may be impacted by the new minimum based on their tax rates from 2019 to 2021 overall 83 companies in the s p 500 could be hit with higher taxes including amazon verizon at t and general motors according to the newspaper s analysis commercial banking almost purely opportunity banks prep for historic climate investment the 369 billion directed toward climate preparedness in the inflation reduction act is expected to reverberate through the economy for years to come and could supercharge private investment in the nation s clean energy sector august 21 a separate morgan stanley analysis which factored in the impact of tax credits pension adjustments and other adjustments found that 70 to 100 companies may be hit with higher taxes in any given year in a research note last week the morgan stanley analysts flagged comerica wells fargo pnc financial services group american express bank of new york mellon first republic bank sallie mae first horizon corp and western alliance bancorp as other banks that may be affected the morgan stanley analysis did not identify bank of america or huntington as companies that could face higher taxes though it noted that the full picture will be uncertain until more regulatory details emerge if the difference in taxes is large enough it does limit those banks profitability a little bit and it s definitely a headwind for them next year said kyle sanders a senior equity research strategist at edward jones who covers the banking industry
