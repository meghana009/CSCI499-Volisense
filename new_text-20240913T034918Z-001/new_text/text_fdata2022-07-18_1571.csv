u s natural gas has rallied as much as 10 to a two week high following forecasts for hotter than usual weather to continue across much of the country with the sweltering heat and tight grid conditions reminiscent of the deadly summer heat wave of 2011 the heat has already raised power demand to record levels in texas and other parts of the u s thanks to a sharp increase in cooling demand nymex natural gas for august delivery was quoted at 6 49 mmbtu in friday s session good for a nearly 70 climb in the year to date the gains come despite a sharp increase in u s production to record highs as well as forecasts for lower gas demand over the next two weeks meanwhile the freeport lng export plant in texas remains out of service and is expected to remain shut until october though some analysts believe the plant could remain shut longer the facility south of galveston the second biggest u s lng export plant was gobbling up 2b cf day of gas before it shut on june 8 after an explosion caused a big fire the natural gas rally has come mainly thanks to russia s war on ukraine which has supercharged the american lng boom u s lng boom europe s natural gas demand has skyrocketed as the eu tries to lower its reliance on russian natural gas following its invasion of ukraine europe has displaced asia as the top destination for u s lng and now receives 65 of total exports the eu has pledged to reduce its consumption of russian natural gas by nearly two thirds before the year s end while lithuania latvia and estonia have vowed to eliminate russian gas imports outright the european gas crisis has only deepened after russia cut off the gas supply to poland and bulgaria ostensibly for failing to pay for gas in roubles sending european gas prices soaring the move marks a ratcheting up of tensions and could reduce supplies to europe as many pipelines pass through poland en route to the rest of the continent adding to supply woes russia s nord stream 1 pipeline that supplies germany has gone offline for scheduled maintenance while it is due to resume operations on july 21st europe fears that it may be delayed for political leverage indeed the imf has warned that further natural gas disruptions on the continent could trigger a much dreaded recession imf managing director kristalina georgieva says russia s war in ukraine has darkened the economic outlook significantly with the fund saying it would scale back its previous forecast for 3 6 growth in 2022 for the third time this year with the possibility of a recession in 2023 it s therefore not surprising that european importers are willing to pay a premium to secure long term lng deals demand for long term lng contracts has increased sharply in the current year with suppliers taking advantage of robust demand thanks to a global effort to cut russian imports to demand for much higher rates for new long term contracts according to a report by the oil gas journal 10 year lng contracts are currently priced at 75 above 2021 s rates with tight supplies expected to persist as europe aims to boost lng imports meanwhile volatile spot prices and a worsening supply outlook have triggered a rush by importers to negotiate long term deals as they attempt to lock in prices last year the volume of long term lng contracts signed to end user markets climbed to a 5 year high and the momentum is showing no signs of abating in the current year so far this year more than 10 million tonnes year tpy of lng has been signed to end market users according to a report by wood mackenzie for instance louisiana based lng company sempra infrastructure a majority owned subsidiary of sempra energy nyse sre bmv sre has inked its sixth long term contract in five months the deal calls for sempra infrastructure s cameron lng in hackberry to supply 2 million metric tons of lng annually to the polish oil gas co sempra infrastructure struck another 2 million ton deal with polish for its upcoming port arthur lng facility in port arthur texas most new contracts are from u s supply as operators move projects forward all these contracts are linked to north american prices meanwhile chinese buyers continue to dominate the market signing more than 8 million tpy of new lng sale and purchase agreements this year the russian invasion of ukraine has had a dramatic impact on long term lng contracts many traditional lng buyers will neither procure spot gas or lng nor renew or sign additional lng contracts with russian sellers spot prices have also been high and volatile pushing many buyers towards long term contracts additionally some buyers are returning to long term contracting on behalf of governments to protect national energy security wood mackenzie principal analyst daniel toleman has said in europe french multinational utility engie sa has signed up to 1 75 million tpy for 15 years from nextdecade s rio grande project a project that will use carbon capture and storage ccs to reduce its emission footprint recent brownfield henry hub linked deals are rumored to have liquefaction tolling fees below 2 mmbtu this follows deals signed last year in a similar range we expect higher capacity fees for henry hub linked deals under negotiation this is reflective of two trends first more advanced projects capable of delivering lng in the 2025 2026 timeframe will attract premiums second rising raw material labor and epc costs are all driving up the cost of delivering projects on the us gulf coast in turn resulting in higher capacity fees toleman has said luckily u s suppliers appear to be up to the task back in april the u s department of energy authorized additional lng exports from the planned golden pass lng terminal in texas and magnolia lng terminal in louisiana as the u s seeks to boost lng exports to europe jointly owned by exxon mobil nyse xom and qatar petroleum the 10b golden pass lng export project is expected to become operational in 2024 while magnolia lng owned by glenfarne group will come online by 2026 the two terminals are expected to produce more than 3b cf day of natural gas although magnolia is yet to sign contracts with customers previously american lng developers were unwilling to construct self financed liquefaction facilities that are not secured by long term contracts from european countries however the ukraine war has exposed europe s soft

health experts have shared advice on how to cope as the met office warns lives could be at risk during expected record breaking hot weather temperatures are expected to exceed 37c in parts of the uk with the met office warning of a very serious situation as it issued its first red warning for extreme heat britain could be hotter than delhi and the sahara desert on monday with experts predicting the mercury could reach 41c double the uk summer average peterborough is expected to hit 37c and milton keynes norwich and lincoln set to hit 36c while temperatures could hit 40c in london on tuesday a quick google search for how to keep cool in a heatwave will bring up a range of weird and wonderful measures including drinking hot tea eating spicy food and keeping your curtains closed for the entire day but do any of these methods actually work ahead of the heatwave mailonline has spoken to the experts and delved into the science behind these cooling methods to help sort the fact from the fiction so you can stay protected during these increasing temperatures drink hot tea while you might be tempted to reach for a cold drink to help cool you down surprisingly hot drinks such as teas and coffees may actually be more effective a study in 2012 by researchers from the university of ottawa looked at the effect of drinking hot drinks on body temperature the met office is warning temperatures could reach 40c in some parts of the uk with large parts of england set to see their hottest ever day on tuesday a woman uses a fan as she waits to board a london underground train at green park train station during hot weather the results revealed that a hot drink can cool you down but only in dry conditions speaking to the smithsonian mag dr ollie jay one of the authors of the study explained if you drink a hot drink it does result in a lower amount of heat stored inside your body provided the additional sweat that s produced when you drink the hot drink can evaporate when you ingest a hot drink you start sweating more if the sweat can evaporate it cools you down more than compensating for the added heat to the body from the fluid while sweating can be embarrassing it s an essential bodily function to help keep us cool as the sweat evaporates from the surface of your skin it removes excess heat by converting the water from a liquid to a vapour however in humid conditions this cooling effect is less effective so drinking hot drinks won t help to cool you down dr jay explained on a very hot and humid day if you re wearing a lot of clothing or if you re having so much sweat that it starts to drip on the ground and doesn t evaporate from the skin s surface then drinking a hot drink is a bad thing the hot drink still does add a little heat to the body so if the sweat s not going to assist in evaporation go for a cold drink children cool off in the southbank centre fountain during a heatwave in london july 17 archie adams aged 16 months tucks into an ice

fitness coach joe wicks enjoys an ice bath to cool off eat spicy food instead of grabbing an ice cream you might want to opt for a spicy curry this week the burn you feel in your mouth from eating spicy food is caused by capsaicin a chemical found in chillis this is usually followed by a similar warming sensation across the rest of hte body causing you to sweat writing in scientific american yale professor barry green explained spicy foods excite the receptors in the skin that normally respond to heat the burn you feel in your mouth from eating spicy food is caused by capsaicin a chemical found in chillis this is usually followed by a similar warming sensation across the rest of hte body causing you to sweat the central nervous system reacts to whatever the sensory system tells it is going on therefore the pattern of activity from pain and warm nerve fibers triggers both the sensations and the physical reactions of heat including vasodilation sweating and flushing as we saw with drinking hot drinks sweating is one of the key methods to help regulate your temperature so tea and curry it is eat gazpacho during the day one piece of advice spanish health authorities are issuing to help people keep cool is to enjoy one of the county s national dishes gazpacho gazpacho is a cold soup made of blended raw vegetables it is a common summer dish in spain since it is refreshing and cool gazpacho is a cold soup made of blended raw vegetables including tomatoes and cucumbers is a summer staple in spain and famed for its refreshing qualities jesús aguirre the health chief for

its high water content gazpacho also contains high levels of vitamins and minerals lick your wrists it s a tactic used by several creatures in the animal kingdom including kangaroos and monkeys and as disgusting as it sounds licking your wrists also works to help keep humans cool the wrists contain pulse points areas where you can feel your pulse because your blood vessels are close to the surface of your skin the met office had already this week issued an amber heat warning for only the third time ever from sunday to tuesday for most of england and wales but today this was extended to all of england and wales and southern scotland and upgraded to an unprecedented red for parts of central and southern england including london on monday and tuesday by licking your wrists you re using saliva to mimic the effects of sweat cooling the surface of the skin this slows the flow of blood stopping your body from overheating if the idea of licking your wrists doesn t appeal you can also pour water on your wrists for a similar effect unplug your chargers while most of us know that big powerful electronics like tvs and computers generate a lot of heat you might not think to unplug smaller appliances lamps kettles irons and even chargers can generate a lot of heat if they see heavy use in 2020 researchers from zdnet put a wireless charger to the test using a thermal camera to study how hot it was both in and out of use they found that when an iphone 11 pro max was placed on the wireless charger the device reached 32 c while the surrounding air hit 20 c if you want the charging to be cooler remove any cases don t charge the phone in direct blazing sunlight and keep the pad on a hard surface not on blankets or anything that might block the air holes they advised while most of us know that big powerful electronics like tvs and computers generate a lot of heat you might not think to unplug smaller applicances like chargers ditch the booze you might be tempted to head for your nearest pub garden during the heatwave but if you do try to lay off the booze alcohol is a diuretic that causes you to urinate more and can leave you severely dehydrated alcohol makes us pee more and more frequently and fluid leaving our bodies at this rate can lead to dehydration if not replaced drink aware explains it is important to replace lost fluid by drinking water if we choose to drink alcohol the effects of dehydration include feeling thirsty dizzy lightheaded and tired experiencing a dry mouth and lips and dark yellow and strong smelling pee alcohol also causes the blood vessels in your skin to dilate making you feel hotter don t open all windows it may sound counterintuitive but research suggests that you shouldn t open all the windows to keep your house cool hot air rises which means sunny upstairs rooms will be warmer than those that are downstairs in the shade setting up a pressure difference by opening windows in these rooms you can create a strategic breeze that draws in cool air from downstairs and forces warm air out of the house through the sunny upstairs rooms the idea of breathing yourself cooler may sound ridiculous but seasoned yoga experts swear by a

days on record people should steer clear of sitting in a closed parked vehicle which can quickly overheat and others especially babies children and animals should not be left in a vehicle britons are

take care and follow local safety advice how can hot weather be deadly heatwaves kill up to 2 000 people in the uk each summer hot weather can cause dehydration which causes blood to thicken it also lowers blood pressure making it harder to push blood around the body this can lead to blood clots and strokes and overheating can make symptoms worse for those with heart and breathing problems which can become fatal margate beach in kent was packed today as thousands of people made their way to the coast to enjoy the glorious sunshine before temperatures skyrocket on monday and tuesday there is also a higher risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke especially if exercising outdoors when it s hot this is caused by not drinking enough and losing fluids through sweat studies have also found accidents and injuries such as from car crashes are higher worldwide during hot spells experts believe this is because heat can interfere with thinking making mistakes more likely why does our body react to hot weather the body works to maintain an internal temperature of 37c on average which is needed to regulate bodily functions as the temperature outside gets hotter so does our internal temperature this means the body has to work harder to maintain its usual level and its thermoregulation system kicks in which triggers sweat this then evaporates from the skin which helps the body cool down but sweating too much and not replenishing the body with fluid can cause dehydration which can lead to heat exhaustion and heatstroke what are the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke and how can i cool down heat exhaustion occurs when the temperature inside the body rises from the normal 37c and gets up to 40c this causes the levels of water and salt in the body to fall which can cause a person to feel sick light headed and sweat heavily bbc meteorologist simon king said parts of the east midlands could see temperatures of up to 107 6f 42c at the peak of the heatwave on tuesday at this stage a person can cool themselves down by going to a cool place drinking water and removing excess clothes they should start feeling better within 30 minutes however is a person does not cool down within 30 minutes heat exhaustion becomes heatstroke which is much more serious heatstroke happens when the body can no longer bring its temperature down causing cells to break down and important parts of the body to stop working symptoms include mental confusion rapid shallow breathing and loss of consciousness if left untreated it can lead to organ failure brain damage and death britons are told to call an ambulance if they suspect they or someone else is having a heatstroke get to a cool place remove excess clothing and drink cool water heatwave helpers for hot dogs rachel halliwell explains how we can look after pooches during the high temperatures oh boy the heat is on with temperatures reported to reach 41c 106f today and tomorrow just as we are sweltering so too are our poor hot and bothered pooches my own dog three year old buddy the cockapoo hates hot weather and can be found sensibly snoozing his way through the current heatwave lying prostrate under the table on our cold stone kitchen floor wise boy overheating poses a serious health risk to dogs they can suffer heatstroke which can cause permanent damage to their vital organs humans rely on sweating to regulate their temperature but dogs don t have that mechanism they pant instead which cools them down but during a heatwave as extreme as the one we re enduring panting may not be enough in which case we their doting owners need to step in and help temperatures in the uk are reported to reach 41c 106f today and tomorrow so rachel halliwell and her dog buddy pictured have been trying out products which cool your dog down in a heatwave with a third of uk homes having at least one canine companion that equates to an awful lot of worried pet lovers trying to cool down their hot dogs but fear not as you would expect from the 10billion ayear dog industry there are plenty of products on the market to help buddy and i put them to the test the cool coat petface cooling dog coat 8 50 argos petface cooling dog coat 8 50 argos rachel awarded this full marks saying not only does this keep buddy cool he looks pretty cute in it too adding clothing to an already hot animal seems counter intuitive but this jacket is chilled it s easy to prepare just place it into a bowl of cold water before kneading it to help it absorb the liquid then you wring it out and slip it on to your dog s back in winter buddy refuses to wear his coat so i m surprised when he stands still as i settle this on to him then fasten it in place poor boy is hot it must give him relief because he doesn t attempt to shake it off and is soon back under the table the jacket clearly comfortable to wear because he goes straight back to sleep verdict full marks not only does this keep buddy cool he looks pretty cute in it too 5 5 cold mat for mutts sunny daze cooling mat 16 pets at home sunny daze cooling mat 16 pets at home the only issue for rachel is that you can t leave a dog with it unattended in case they chew through the material it s not just hot days you need to worry about during a heatwave after the sun goes down temperatures are staying so high our homes can t cool down that means little respite for us or our pets at night during the day buddy hasn t shown much interest in this cooling mat which is filled with a non toxic gel that automatically cools under the weight of your dog but when i lay it down next to my bed on a particularly hot night he lies straight down on it it must provide some blessed relief because i notice his panting eases a little the only issue is that you can t leave a dog with it unattended in case they chew through the material and not everyone s as tolerant as my husband about sharing their bedroom with their besotted wife s mutt verdict good for cooling down your pooch after you ve been out for a walk too 4 5 magic fountain whitedrop pet water fountain dispenser left 19 99 amazon co uk whitedrop pet water fountain dispenser left 19 99 amazon co uk this is gimmicky and much more expensive than a plain old water bowl preferring to drink from dirty ditches and muddy puddles buddy approaches most drinking vessels with great suspicion this cute water fountain which filters then pumps fresh water out of a daisy shaped spout gets the same treatment he has a sniff walks away comes back for another sniff then off he goes again this goes on for ten minutes until the cat appears and drinks so deeply from this fountain you d have thought it had always been there wherever she leads buddy follows a couple of tentative licks then he s soon lapping away this is gimmicky and much more expensive than a plain old water bowl but it will help keep my fussy boy hydrated verdict a costly watering hole 3 10 paddling pool sunny daze dog paddling pool 35 pets at home sunny daze dog paddling pool 35 pets at home rachel says this is great but feels guilty filling it up with a hose pipe anyone who has a cockapoo like buddy will know how water obsessed this breed is it might be boiling outside but my dog thinks christmas has come early because suddenly he s got his own pond installed in the back garden and no one is yelling at him to get out of it he jumps in and out before shaking himself off and diving straight back in again this is the happiest i ve seen him since the heatwave began this is a pop up pool so easy to set up and take down again to store my teenage daughter however is unimpressed her attempts to sunbathe before the gloomy weather returns are hampered by buddy clambering soggily all over her small price to pay for a happy dog i tell her verdict great product but it loses a mark because it needs filling with a hosepipe which i feel guilty about when our reservoir levels are so low 4 5 and don t forget spf petkin spf15 doggy sunmist spray below amazon co uk 6 07 petkin spf15 doggy sunmist spray below amazon co uk 6 07 according to rachel this is probably more useful for dogs with short hair spraying sun screen on a dog is a new one on me this doggy version which the label says compares to spf15 for humans smells like the stuff i spray on myself and is the same milkywhite consistency the instructions recommend using on your dog s ears nose muzzle and any pink areas all of which are especially vulnerable to sunburn buddy has other ideas running off in fright after the first spray of his nose but it s a different story when i put it on his belly he lies legs akimbo while i rub it in like a pampered pet who s enjoying a tummy massage buddy likes to lie on his back on the patio enjoying the sun on his belly so applying this could be a good idea but i think it ll be more useful for dogs with short thin hair verdict rubbing it in your hands first rather than spraying is less scary for a dog 2 5

policy magazine the western green revolutionists were so pleased that they bestowed sri lanka with a near perfect environmental social and governance esg score of 98 much higher than the united states score of 51 but sri lanka s adoption of green policies brought nothing but disasters its rice production has dropped more than 50 percent while domestic rice prices have increased more than 80 percent once sufficient in rice production the nation has been forced to import 450 million worth of rice in the words of sen rand paul r ky sri lanka is experiencing a government created famine reminiscent of mao in addition the ban on synthetic fertilizer and pesticides also affected the nation s tea production a primary export compounded by the effect of falling tourism after covid 19 lockdowns the nation s foreign reserves shrunk sri lanka s government eventually was forced to lift its ban on fertilizer and pesticides when prices of both had reached historical highs with its foreign reserves dwindling close to zero sri lanka s government struggled to import necessities such as food fertilizers and fuels it also has had difficulty paying back its foreign loans to finance the nation s infrastructure its currency value dropped and the country defaulted on its debt obligations the sri lankan people angry and hungry staged protests and stormed both the president s residence and prime minister s office president rajapaksa resigned and fled the country this week sri lanka is the tip of the iceberg of how green policies promoted by western liberal elites have brought miseries and instability worldwide food security depends on energy liberal politicians and climate activists in the west have failed to appreciate how much food security depends on oil and gas for example about 80 percent of synthetic fertilizers are made out of natural gas the wide adoption of synthetic fertilizers was the main reason farmers could feed a global population of 7 9 billion while available farmlands were shrinking farmers also need pesticides sourced from petroleum to protect crops and control weeds insects and diseases despite the vital role energy plays in food security many european countries have closed down coal plants and nuclear power generators cut natural gas production and banned fracking aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2050 according to the wall street journal mere 15 years ago countries in the european union produced more gas than russia exported but europe s green revolution has made it vulnerable to russia s energy and putin s aggression in the u s the biden administration has waged a similar war on fossil fuels including canceling the keystone pipeline project ukraine crisis worsened existing problems these wrong headed policies had driven up the prices of all energy resources that modern farming depends on from diesel to natural gas and petroleum long before russia invaded ukraine russia s invasion of ukraine increased energy prices and further exasperated the global food security problem russia and ukraine provide about a third of the world s wheat and barley exports in addition ukraine is responsible for 14 percent of corn exports and about half the world s sunflower oil russia s invasion has disrupted ukraine s agricultural production and halted exports as ukrainian ports are under the russian military s blockade since russia is also one of the largest fertilizer suppliers in the world putin temporarily suspended fertilizer exports as a retaliation to the west led economic sanctions farmers worldwide responded to rising operating costs from energy to fertilizer by cutting back production and using fewer fertilizers and pesticides the downstream effects include lower crop yield reduced food supply and higher prices for all food including corn which is also essential feed for live stock higher prices of corn will translate to higher prices of meat milk and other food products rising operating costs may also drive some farmers out of business doomberg a financial research site with extensive reporting on the relationship between energy policies and farming warns that farmers are on the brink and we are at the onset of a global famine of historic proportions warnings of food shortages the chief economist of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations maximo torero tweeted global wheat and barley prices went up 31 over the past year in feb food prices were at a record high due to high demand transportation costs port disruptions volatile natural gas prices sent fertilizer prices soaring all could lead millions more to face severe hunger similarly bloomberg analyst alexis maxwell called food shortages the next slow moving disaster that would hit the world even president joe biden warned americans to prepare for food shortages and higher prices another sign that a worldwide food shortage is approaching is china s hoarding food according to bloomberg china will hold 69 of the world s corn reserves 60 of its rice and 51 of its wheat by mid 2022 doubling down on green revolution yet despite the looming food shortages liberal politicians and climate activists in the west have chosen to double down on their green revolution at its recent summit nato integrated climate change into its statement of purpose and committed to reducing its military s greenhouse gas emissions rather than developing fossil fuels at home european nations are preparing to ration energy germany is sticking to its plan to shut down three remaining nuclear power plants while considering bringing back wood burning this winter the same european countries refusing to fund oil and gas development in africa are rushing to buy natural gas from the continent their hypocrisy has left millions of impoverished africans without access to natural gas and relying on black market kerosene and diesel to light wood stoves and power electricity generators the biden administration continues its war on fossil fuels by canceling oil and gas lease sales in alaska and the gulf of mexico essentially removing millions of acres from possible drilling as u s gas prices reach record highs the ap reported this week president biden travels to saudi arabia to beg the gulf state to produce more oil at home his administration is incentivizing farmers to produce more soybeans to make biodiesel even though soybeans are an important food source for human and animal feed and there are cooking oil shortages and food shortages around the world the researchers at doomberg asked in the face of a global energy crisis the war in ukraine food shortages and rampant inflation does it make sense to be redirecting so many acres of valuable cropland to make renewable diesel a fuel we can easily and directly drill for domestically from ancient rome to today s sri lanka history has taught us that revolutions erupted and regimes fell when people were hungry the looming worldwide food crisis may not hit the u s as severely as other parts of the world but we are not exempt from empty shelves and food shortages if the biden administration s green revolution continues

miami july 17 2022 globe newswire in a major boost to the global fight against criminal syndicates engaged in the illicit trafficking of flora and fauna acams has partnered with traffic to launch a simplified chinese sch version of its free of charge ending illegal wildlife trade a comprehensive overview certificate the original certificate launched in 2020 developed by acams and the world wide fund for nature wwf with the support of the basel institute on governance united for wildlife and the royal foundation of the duke and duchess of cambridge trains anti financial crime afc

today includes china specific case studies in addition to outlining the complex methodologies used to circumvent import export laws and anti money laundering aml controls of financial institutions the sch version of the certificate features new case studies highlighting recent ivory timber and wildlife trafficking investigations in thailand tanzania and china the financial action task force fatf which has focused on money laundering linked to environmental crime since 2019 concluded in a june 2020 report that iwt is a major transnational organised crime that fuels corruption threatens biodiversity and undermines the integrity of the financial system sector by exploiting banks and other institutions despite such concerns nations rarely investigate the financial trail left by iwt syndicates fatf noted wildlife trafficking networks are international by nature and their illicit proceeds often flow through accounts held for front and shell companies across multiple jurisdictions said acams ceo scott liles that s why it s critical that afc professionals in asia and other parts of the globe understand how to identify report and mitigate the risks associated with iwt schemes we

anti money laundering measures is an innovative yet fairly new approach in china even globally financial institutions undoubtedly play a significant role in exposing and interrupting the financial flow of wildlife crime said traffic china director ling xu the acams and traffic led simplified chinese version of the illegal wildlife trade certificate program will go a long way towards bridging

king county is ready to declare the fentanyl overdose crisis a public health emergency but it s democrat policies that are the problem and while seattle king county public health are sounding alarms they re also promoting safer drug abuse due to a health equity and justice approach there have already been 264 confirmed fentanyl involved deaths in seattle and king county in 2022 we re on pace to exceed last year s record high 396 it s not the only drug crisis either opioid deaths are on the rise at 308 this year with meth at 192 rather than take this crisis seriously public health officials adopt a harm reduction strategy and offer tips on how to get high conflicting messages the king county council s law justice health and human services committee unanimously passed legislation declaring the widespread distribution of fentanyl and fentanyl related overdoses a public health crisis the well intentioned move is meant to collect information on mitigation strategies offer public awareness recommendations and publicly express a public policy statement that the council takes this seriously it heads to a council vote in the coming weeks where it will certainly pass but it s not fentanyl per se responsible for the current crisis it s democrat policies that have effectively legalized drugs along with the adoption of a harm reduction model that still leads to death just more slowly public health distributed flyers on how to get high while avoiding a fatal overdose the flyer recommends you start with a tested shot warning that fentanyl is a potent drug about 100 times more powerful than other opioids and you should not get high alone instead invite friends over and watch and wait before the next person uses if everyone you re with is using take pills in turns just in case they re laced with a deadly dose of fentanyl there s no one to get help if everyone has overdosed a second flyer states don t forget to stock up on naloxone they recommend you pick some up at your local needle exchange program but that s not all if used correctly fentanyl test strips can detect the presence of fentanyl in street drugs and pills a flyer says talk about a conflicting message fentanyl use is a crisis but we ll help you get high democrats made this worse pre covid democrat leaders and public health sought to end the stigma associated with drug addiction out of fear it would stop people from seeking treatment they pretended that someone in the throes of addiction was self conscious about how they d be viewed if they admitted they had a problem consequently drug use was effectively legalized with the king county prosecuting attorney dan satterberg and then seattle city attorney pete holmes refusing to prosecute most drug related crimes public health officials meanwhile distributed needles booty bumping kits narcan and more to addicts including minors during covid democrats and public health made drug addiction even easier to continue when the virus shut down officers public health sent mobile units to the addicts to help enable their addiction by handing out tools to shoot up when covid 19 hit our community we transitioned to a model that minimizes the time someone needs to be out in public reducing their risk as well as staff risk of exposure to covid 19 we work with people to try to get a sense of what they need to stay safe for a two to three week period a spokesperson from public health told the jason rantz show on ktth last year unsurprisingly this approach had led to a surge in overdose deaths the bulk of which hit white males over 20 years old the hardest black men are disproportionately impacted as they reflect 17 of the overdose deaths democrats keep ignoring the data in 2018 satterberg announced he would not charge for personal possession of controlled substances he effectively legalized drugs arguing the so called war on drugs was a failure that same year resulted in the start of a years long surge in overdose deaths since 2018 the county has seen a jump in overdose deaths tied to fentanyl cocaine and meth heroin deaths were consistently high but did not see a surge most likely due to addicts switching to fentanyl or meth concurrently since 2018 we ve seen a surge in drug related crimes and homelessness satterberg s policies have been to blame satterberg and his democrat cheerleaders consistently cry out that the war on drugs was a failure but when the county adopted harsher penalties on drug use over a decade ago there were far fewer overdose deaths still satterberg s approach was lauded by activist journalists then statewide drug possession was decriminalized by an activist washington state supreme court what happened next more deaths thanks to a constant supply of drugs flooding our streets from china and our open southern border when you legalize drugs nefarious actors take notice jail must be an option while recognizing it s not the only option jail must be one of the options for addicts if someone knows they won t suffer any legal consequences such as a teen they ll be more apt to try taking oxycontin recreationally depending on where he buys it that pill is likely laced with fentanyl and can easily lead to a fatal overdose the homeless addicts who keep smoking fentanyl in downtown seattle on 3rd and pike throw them in jail and hassle them constantly until they take us up on our offers of addiction services if they re unwilling to get help then keep them in jail where they can be compelled to get clean democrats aren t willing to do this of course they view the criminal justice system as a system of white supremacy that must be dismantled even the state s plan to tackle opioid abuse declares itself more eager to signal one s support of left wing causes than to address the crisis the state opioid and overdose response plan s partners recognize that black lives matter and that racism discrimination criminal legal system involvement and the stigmatization of individuals who use drugs are systemic problems that disproportionately affect people of color this impact has manifested in profoundly unequal outcomes during the course of the war on drugs and has resulted in over representation of people of color in the criminal legal system further amplifying stigma and racism the argument effectively states too many black drug users were jailed i suppose they d rather them get off easy and die on the streets like white addicts i suppose democrats never really did identify as pro life i don t care if an addict feels stigmatized if it means that stigma leads to getting help and drug addiction should have a stigma attached to it it kills fentanyl isn t the health crisis democrat policies are the problem more people are dying from fentanyl than other drugs in the county the council is right to focus on the fentanyl overdose crisis but democrat policies and approaches permissive of deadly drug use are causing the overdose deaths there s a reason you see a surge of deaths concurrent to democrats approach to drug use and addiction partisans blinded by their own ideology and adherence to blm principles are the ones killing addicts with policies that enable addiction rather than hand out needles we should fund more addiction services instead of flyers promoting safer drug use we should stigmatize the deadly addiction and instead of declaring the fentanyl crisis a public health emergency we should declare the county s own policies are to blame but none of that will happen and it s why we ll keep losing more people to addiction but democrats and public health officials feel better about themselves when they fight systemic racism and stigmatization even if it kills the people they pretend to fight for listen to the jason rantz

plans for the future this week barry talks with michael hudson managing director of southern cross gold sxg the well travelled melbourne university graduate geologist has roamed from mining underground at broken hill to europe and south america in a 30 year plus career much of it spent in the canadian mining scene where he became founder of the toronto listed mawson gold don t be the

weekend update phone this field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged hudson continues as mawson s chairman with the company advancing a 1 million ounce gold project in finland but in may this year hudson brought the overlooked victorian gold antimony properties housed within mawson home by spinning out southern cross gold sxg in an ipo that raised 9 1 million for the victorian hunt hudson is managing director of sxg which joined the asx on may 12 it is one of the more successful ipos of any flavour in recent times the 20c shares in the ipo mawson retains a 60 stake took off in late may in response to the release of impressive drill results from sxg s flagship sunday creek project 60km north of melbourne on the eastern side of the hume highway the assays results were from a spectacularly wide intersection of gold antimony mineralisation at the project drilled during sxg s ipo phase the intersection in the historic apollo shoot assayed 3 9g t gold equivalent from 106 8m hudson says the result was unprecedented in the victorian context for the width of the high grade mineralisation continuing the homecoming theme sunday creek is just over the hill from where hudson went to a primary school with 10 other pupils and about 35kms east of kilmore where the son of a fifth generation stock station agent was born work at sunday creek has to date identified five high grade shoots within a 1km core area with another 10 km of a mineralised trend defined by historic workings and soil sampling remaining to be tested in the modern era by the drill bit two rigs are now whirring at project one of the three historic epizonal victorian goldfields in sxg s portfolio the recent acquisition of freehold property covering sunday creek and beyond protects the project s upside and ensures access investors have been switched on to the potential for high grade epizonal gold antimony at depth beneath historic goldfields in the state thanks to the success at the regionally close fosterville and costerfield operations the two mining operations rank amongst the world s highest grade operations and ironically enough are owned by canadian companies agnico eagle and mandalay respectively while he has always been melbourne based hudson says that much of his career has been about being on a plane to the world i was basically a road warrior hudson says when the family was younger i did spend four of five months living in either canada or europe but for the most part it was about getting on a plane and there was the irony of seeing all the capital flow here into victoria from the canadian market following the success at fosterville and costerfield and there i was drilling away in finland hudson says sunday creek is a classic victorian opportunity and no different to fosterville and costerfield in that that they it is an old gold antimony field which no one had investigated at depth and what modern day exploration has occurred was for shallow oxide mineralisation rather than the orientated deeper drilling like that at sunday creek by sxg and earlier at fosterville and costerfield what we have found at sunday creek though is a bit unique in terms of the width of the mineralisation hudson says a initial resource estimate is possible next year but according to hudson it will very much be the start of the story we have tested a core area of 1km but there is another 10kms of ground on which the old mines continue which has not seen a drill hole so there is no shortage of scale there is going to be multiple shoots we don t know how many in addition to the five we have now but we do know the oldtimers mined up to 40 structures there is going to be more without a doubt hudson says but we don t want to be a bull in a china shop we will be drilling with context hudson also predicts that that antimony at sunday creek it was an antimony producer in the first world war with the ore treated at costerfield 54km to the northwest will become a key part of the project beyond its co product revenue contribution antimony is rated as a strategic metal because it has a multitude of military applications it is also used as fire retardant and has growing exposure to the booming lithium ion batteries sector and the next generation of molten salt batteries the concern for the western world is that current production is dominated by china and russia costerfield is australia s only producer of the metal the price of which has more than doubled in the last two years this article was developed in collaboration with southern cross gold a

pacific island nations courted by china and the united states put the superpowers on notice telling the world s two biggest carbon emitters to take more action on climate change while pledging unity in the face of a growing geopolitical contest leaders at a four day summit of the pacific islands forum pif meeting in fiji s capital suva bristled at a chinese attempt to split some of the nations off into a trade and security agreement while washington pledged more financial and diplomatic engagement the exclusive economic zones of the 17 forum members span 30 million sq km 11 6 million sq miles of ocean providing half the world s tuna the most eaten fish the nations are also feeling some of the severest effects of climate change as rising seas inundate lower lying areas at the pif summit that ended on thursday leaders adopted language several members have used in declaring a climate emergency saying this was supported not only by science but by people s daily lives in the pacific a communique yet to be released shows the nations focused on the next united nations climate conference cop27 they will push for a doubling of climate finance to flow from big emitters to developing nations within two years money they say is needed to adapt to rising sea levels and worsening storms the communique seen by the reuters news agency also calls for meaningful progress at cop27 on financing for the loss and damage to vulnerable societies that cannot adapt and will need to relocate communities a battle lost at last year s global climate talks what matters most to us is we secure bold commitments from all countries at cop27 to phase out coal and other fossil fuels and step up finance to the most vulnerable nations and advance causes like loss and damage that matter dearly to the most at risk island communities fiji s president frank bainimarama told reporters we simply cannot settle for any less than the survival of every pacific island country said bainimarama the forum s chairman tuvalu s foreign minister simon kofe who literally made waves at the last global climate conference by standing knee deep in seawater to show what his country faces told reuters there is technology available to protect the islands and raise the islands and that is what we are seeking it is very costly as the pacific summit was ending australian coal mining stocks soared on expectations china could resume imports after a two year political dispute halted coal shipments to the world s biggest coal burner from its second biggest exporter in contrast to the market s bullishness leaders in the forum s thatched roof headquarters discussed how to deal with the statehood of people whose nation has sunk in rising seas or rights to fishing grounds defined by their distance from a landmass that may disappear the communique cites an urgent need for assistance on debt vulnerability and the rising cost of food amid the pandemic and russia s invasion of ukraine in a video address to the forum us vice president kamala harris pledged to triple funding to pacific islands over a decade under a fisheries treaty and open more embassies pacific leaders at times showed irritation at the global focus on the contest between the washington and beijing over their region australia in tune said less about security and pledged greater support for the climate change agenda of its neighbours although maritime surveillance announcements to protect sustainable fishing hinted at its core anxiety it s harder for countries that are responsible for most of the illegal fishing then to argue they are going to support the region to stop illegal fishing australia s pacific minister pat conroy said in an interview referring to china economic ties to china australian officials privately say they do not want security choices in the region driven by economic ties to china and although pacific islands are sophisticated actors they need funding support because many have historical debts to beijing fiji for example has taken no loans from china since 2012 but continues to service export import bank loans for chinese infrastructure projects that will cost the government 40 million fijian dollars 18m this year budget documents show australian strategic policy institute analyst michael shoebridge said beijing has a record of splintering regionalism drawing a parallel between its recent pacific diplomacy and a platform it created a decade ago to engage with european countries and bypass the european union some leaders said in interviews that china provided economic opportunities that small island economies could not ignore although they agreed to work through the forum to stay unified in their response to great power competition particularly on security after disquiet that beijing struck a security deal in april with the solomon islands the forum s secretary general openly criticised china s bid to have about half the forum members sign a deal on trade and security in may that would exclude members with ties to taiwan and exclude australia and new zealand leaders at the summit said it had been rushed without consultation china s embassy in fiji responded on twitter on saturday saying beijing had prepared and presented the outcome document to pacific islands a month ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers beijing has created a new platform for cooperation with pacific island countries through an annual meeting with its foreign minister it said

beijing july 16 xinhua despite facing mounting downward pressure from a lingering covid 19 pandemic a stormy world economy and other stiff challenges the chinese economy in the second quarter has still managed to secure positive growth showed data released friday by china s national bureau of statistics apart from that in the first half of this year china s value added industrial output went up 3 4 percent fixed asset investment jumped 6 1 percent and foreign goods trade shot up 9 4 percent prior to the publication of those numbers some western media sought to exaggerate the problems facing the chinese economy and paint an utterly dark picture for the country s future economic viability now that china s economy is regaining foot the momentum for recovery has proved once again that those western demagogues are as stubborn as they are selectively blind to china s ability to handle compounding crises and unexpected shocks people have meals at a restaurant in haidian district of beijing capital of china june 6 2022 xinhua zhang chenlin the steady recovery of the world s second largest economy is surely welcome news in this era of uncertainties yet it is hard won considering the complex international environment and the impact of the covid 19 outbreaks at home and other factors the bouncing back also indicates that the fundamentals of the chinese economy including its strong resilience enormous potential vast room for maneuver and long term sustainability remain intact meanwhile china has been improving the quality of its economic growth by prioritizing high quality development for example growth in the high tech manufacturing sector jumped 9 6 percent the value added output of information transmission software and information technology services rose 9 2 percent while financial services grew 5 5 percent china has performed notably well compared with other major economies the june cpi for the united states marked the largest 12 month increase since november 1981 and inflation for the eurozone hit a record high of 8 6 percent in the year to june while experts warn both economies are increasingly likely to slide into recession china has successfully kept its consumer prices stable its factory gate inflation eased for the sixth straight month and its major economic indicators bounced back in june the resilience of the chinese economy is made possible with a raft of targeted policies for instance the chinese government unveiled 33 measures in may to stabilize the economy covering policies on investment consumption food and energy security industrial and supply chains and people s livelihoods china has pledged that it will adhere to a people centered development philosophy it means that the country will always be ready to protect people s lives even though sometimes it means temporary economic cost given china s vast population the consequences would be unimaginable if it adopted such pandemic prevention and control policies as the so called herd immunity approach that is why beijing has implemented the dynamic zero covid policy while maneuvering to shore up the economy and ensure that people s livelihoods are affected as little as possible workers make clothes for export at a company in taihe county east china s anhui province may 26 2022 photo by liang xiaopeng xinhua to help industries individually owned businesses and micro small and medium sized enterprises hit hard by the pandemic beijing has rolled out detailed measures to stabilize market entities keep payrolls stable and boost job creation a total of 6 54 million new urban jobs were created in the first half of the year china has also been using policy tools to advance reforms and stimulate innovation to grow its economy effectively as the economist a weekly news magazine noted in an april article the government is nurturing thousands of groups big and small in the fields of data science network security and robotics which are working to upgrade china s industrial infrastructure and at this difficult moment when unilateralism and economic nationalism are rearing their ugly heads china has stayed committed to opening up and cooperation the start of trading exchange traded funds under the mainland hong kong stock connect programs in early july was the latest example of china opening its arms wider to welcome global investors agustin carstens general manager of the oldest international financial institution the bank for international settlements said china s resilient economy continues to be an engine of global growth looking into the future it has to be admitted that the foundation for further recovery of the chinese economy is yet to be consolidated and the risk of global stagflation continues to rise however with great potential as well as proven resilience china still enjoys a promising future of long term growth and instead of sticking to their prejudices those china sceptics in the west should

a viral post claimed montana s flathead lake is the clearest lake in the world that s false these are the clearest lakes in the u s and world example video title will go here for this video in early july a twitter account devoted to science and nature posts tweeted out a picture that it said was taken from flathead lake montana which it claimed had the clearest water on earth the tweet has since been liked about 400 000 times many of the most popular replies were from people either posting their own favorite clear body of water or debating the page s claim with suggestions that somewhere else had the clearest water on earth flathead lake the clearest water on earth pic twitter com sidcb9etan curiosity sciencenature14 july 10 2022 the question does flathead lake montana have the clearest water on earth the sources the answer no flathead lake does not have the clearest water of any lake on earth its water isn t even the clearest among american lakes what we found there are at least four lakes in the u s that are clearer than flathead lake the clearest lake in the world is new zealand s blue lake which researchers say has visibility similar to pure water the u s lakes confirmed clearer than flathead lake are crater lake in oregon waldo lake in oregon snow lake in washington state charlton lake in oregon every few years the environmental protection agency epa works with states federal agencies and tribes to survey the water quality of american lakes and streams the most recent survey from 2017 collected data on over 5 000 lakes which is still not every lake in the u s and includes data on water clarity scientists research water clarity using an object called a secchi disk water clarity is measured by dropping a secchi disk into the water the north american lake management society nalms describes a secchi disk as an 8 inch disk with alternating black and white quadrants the point it disappears from view at the surface is called a water body s secchi depth and is how water clarity is measured a similar method is used with an all black disk to measure water clarity horizontally in shallower bodies of water many states and nonprofit organizations also conduct their own secchi depth reviews separate from the epa survey secchi depth results can be variable based on the available light and day to day changes in the water clarity so measurements are typically recorded based on averages the average secchi depth recorded in american lakes according to nalms is less than 11 feet flathead lake the epa s latest lake survey from 2017 found that flathead lake has a secchi depth of nearly 55 feet according to flathead lakers a nonprofit that works to protect the water quality of the flathead watershed secchi disk readings at flathead lake from 1977 to 2018 were typically between 30 and 50 feet it is the largest natural freshwater lake west of the mississippi in the lower 48 states it s located within a glacier carved valley of the rocky mountains and the lake s southern half is inside of the confederated salish and kootenai tribes flathead reservation flathead lakers say the lake s clarity is because it is relatively low in nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen which promote the growth of algae clearest lake in the world blue lake the clearest lake on earth is thought to be new zealand s blue lake although it s not deep enough to record a secchi depth vertically research by new zealand s national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa found that the horizontal clarity of the country s blue lake is typically between 230 and 262 feet nalms says the theoretical maximum secchi depth which would be recorded in absolutely pure water is 230 to 262 feet a 260 foot depth was recorded in the ocean near antarctica and a 216 foot depth was recorded in the sargasso sea which is a part of the atlantic ocean off the southeast coast of the united states that means at least when looking through the water horizontally the lake is as clear as scientists believe it s possible for water to be the theoretical visibility in distilled water is about 262 feet as estimated from the best available instrumental measurements in the laboratory said rob davies colley a scientist who participated in the research so blue lake is a close approach to optically pure water blue lake also called lake rotomairewhenua is located in nelson lakes national park within the country s southern alps to reach it requires a four to seven day hike from the village of st arnaud the region s development agency says and the lake must be treated with care because it is sacred to the local māori people please respect the people of ngāti apa ki te rā tō and the purity of the water in this sacred place by not washing yourselves your clothes or your dishes in the lake says the nelson regional development agency clearest lakes in the u s snow lake snow lake in washington state was the clearest lake surveyed by the epa in 2017 although its recorded secchi depth was not as deep as the average secchi depth of two oregon lakes there isn t available data on snow lake s average secchi depth it s a small lake at an altitude of over 4 000 feet in the cascade mountains and is located just within the eastern boundary of king county where seattle is located the lake is more popular for its nearby hiking trails and fishing opportunities than it is for the clarity of its water crater lake crater lake is well known as one of the clearest lakes in the u s although it was not part of the epa s most recent survey in 2017 the oregon department of environmental quality deq found that the average secchi depth at crater lake was about 102 feet from 1978 to 2019 some secchi disk measurements at crater lake have exceeded 130 feet deq data shows the lake which formed within the crater of a collapsed volcano has the record for deepest secchi depth ever recorded within a lake depending on the source according to nalms a secchi depth of 144 feet recorded at crater lake is the record holder this record would not include lakes measured horizontally such as blue lake crater lake s clarity is credited to both a lack of mineral and sediment deposits and a lack of organic material like algae the u s department of the interior says the lake s water comes directly from snow or rain and there are no inlets to feed the lake which means there s nothing to carry minerals and sediments into the lake the crater lake institute says there is even less organic material absorption near the surface of the lake than there is in some of the clearest cleanest ocean waters the lake is within the cascade mountains at the southern end of oregon south of eugene and bend and just north of medford it sits at an elevation of over 6 000 feet more than a mile high waldo lake a secchi depth of just over 70 feet was measured at waldo lake in the 2017 epa survey but the lake s average secchi depth was about 107 feet from 1986 to 2019 according to deq deq gives waldo lake the edge over crater lake for the secchi depth record stating a 1938 measurement recorded a secchi depth of 157 feet at waldo lake waldo lake is also in the cascade mountains and sits at an altitude of 5 400 feet it s within the willamette national forest north of crater lake between eugene and bend charlton lake charlton lake is also an oregon lake the 2017 epa survey recorded a secchi depth of 64 feet at charlton lake the third deepest secchi reading in the survey charlton lake is much like snow lake in that it is a small lake more well known for nearby hiking trails than it is for water clarity there is no average secchi depth data available for charlton lake it s located less than two miles east of waldo lake still within the southern end of the cascade mountains it sits slightly higher than waldo lake at a height of 5 692 feet meaning all three oregon lakes listed are over a mile high

samso chats with mount ridley mines non executive director guy le page coffee with samso episode 150 with guy le page non executive director of mount ridley mines ltd asx mrd is all about the ree story one of the best kinds of exploration stories is the one that has substance and has a reasonable potential for it to come true the mount ridley ree project is something that stands out from the crowd as an observer of the recent ree announcements coming out of the woodwork i am learning bits and pieces my understanding of the ree industry has been largely from my coffee with samso with northern minerals limited asx ntu the appearance of ree in ionic clays have made a splurge in recent times i don t have much understanding of it and this was a great opportunity to talk to someone in this recent trend it was refreshing to be able to talk to industry and learn whether rees are rees or not in this episode of coffee with samso guy shares with us the history and the contents of the mrd ree story it was enlightening to hear from guy that the ree deposit is not ionic clays and that they actually don t know much about the project the company is in a learning phase and the upcoming drilling will drive a clearer picture on the whole project in the next twelve months what i like about this project is that it is 35km from a port have a highway railway and a gas pipeline adjacent to the project this is critical in any project as the company continues to work on the technical aspects i encourage viewers to look at this story as an early exploration project or an early development

mount ridley mines limited is undertaking the exploration of a significant deposit of valuable clay hosted rare earth elements in western australia the project was initially acquired for its nickel and copper sulphides potential and is now recognised as being prospective for ionic clay ree deposits currently this style of deposit is mined and processed only in china and myanmar in november 2020 mount ridley mines limited mrd commenced a review of data for its namesake mount ridley project and surrounding area the review concluded that areas of the biranup and nornalup geological provinces in south eastern western australia have the potential for ree mineralisation and in particular the style of mineralisation referred to as ionic adsorption clay iac ree globally deposits of iac ree are most significant in southern china and are the world s main source of heavy rare earth elements the project ree mineralisation occurs as large horizontal near surface sheet like lenses up to a depth of 89 metres ree mineralisation is interpreted to be present within the in situ saprolite clay horizon patchy lower grade zones occur within transported cover which may vector towards stronger ree mineralisation deeper within the regolith geological survey of western australia dmirs mapping shows that the mount ridley project ree mineralisation occurs within the weathered mantle regolith of the recherche super suite which is described as granitic and mafic gneiss may include intrusions of esperance super suite while the source of the ree mineralisation is currently unknown a detailed sample and litho geochemistry dataset from bottom of hole aircore samples has been established which includes whole rock chemical analyses sample pulps and some end of hole air core samples these samples and data are being studied by the company s consultant geochemist to identify the primary rock type and whether units are ree enriched re assay of 950 air core samples 162 pending returned significant ree

speed is not always your friend sometimes it s better to take the time to make the right decision than to rush to meet a false deadline in this instance i am referring to the process to select the chair of the sustainability reporting board srb which has been established under the european financial reporting advisory group efrag this is a very significant position to fill i have no opinion on who should be selected and do not know the opinions of those who have a say in the matter but i do know that a number of people have expressed concerns about the speed and lack of proper debate and scrutiny in this process as well as in the process to develop the first draft standards that preceded it the reason i m writing is to encourage the eu to have and be perceived as having a credible process for selecting the chair of the srb failure to do so will put both the standards they put forward and the eu s green deal at risk but this is not simply an eu issue it is one that matters to the world thus it is important to put the work of efrag in a broader context getty the international sustainability standards board issb and efrag have both issued exposure drafts of standards for sustainability reporting the issb s standards are based on the concept of single materiality those sustainability issues that matter to enterprise value creation efrag s standards emphasize double materiality those sustainability issues that also affect society in general along environmental and social dimensions the single vs double materiality question is a hotly debated one the sustainability taliban deride single materiality and want only double materiality or even more than that so called contextual materiality the sustainability flat earthers scream that sustainability destroys shareholder value or is even an existential threat to the united states of america i am in the much duller sustainability pragmatist camp i think enterprise value creation is important i also think that companies should deal with the negative externalities of their products and services as a result i think the work of both the issb and efrag is important and highly complementary the former can establish a global baseline efrag can build on this to move further and faster and perhaps mark a future path for issb standards in some regards after all based on the concept of dynamic materiality what is material from the perspective of impacts today can become material to enterprise value creation tomorrow the line is a blurry and changing one here the global reporting initiative gri has an important role to play it has collaborated with efrag in the development of its sustainability reporting standards and has also signed a collaboration agreement with the issb gri can act as an integrating mechanism between two groups the quality of the standards developed by each organization is fundamentally important credibility comes from a high quality standard setting process something well established for financial reporting even though the process is always a complex and contentious one both the issb and efrag have had an interim process pending appointment of their full boards to kick off the development of draft standards in the case of the issb this has been done through a technical readiness working group in the case of efrag it was through a project task force as these standard setting processes now become formalized their own credibility depends in turn on the credibility of the chair and members of their boards and it depends perhaps most particularly on the stewardship by the respective board chairs of due process that on the one hand respects the constitutionally defined roles of the board and the expert or advisory groups intended to contribute to the standard setting processes and on the other hand ensures transparency and meaningful consultation with external stakeholders each organization has a different process for appointing the individuals who will head up the bodies charged with developing their sustainability reporting standards the issb was established under the authority of the ifrs foundation an elite executive search firm egon zehnder was used to recruit for the roles of the issb starting with its chair emmanuel faber and its vice chair sue lloyd their credentials are impeccable getty efrag is in the process of selecting the chair of the srb which requires that the european commission nominate a candidate for appointment by the general assembly of efrag the nomination follows a commission led interview process with applicants and advisory inputs from both the european parliament and european council it is worth noting that efrag is not a part of the european commission but a private association of member organizations established under belgian law its role in interpreting financial accounting standards for eu use has now expanded to the very different task of developing sustainability reporting standards and it is the european commission that will ultimately sign off on those standards efrag s members consist of national standard setters european stakeholder organizations and since recently some civil society organizations they constitute the general assembly which is charged with major decisions and appointments its administrative board is responsible for efrag s organization administration and finance as well as for due process for both the financial reporting and sustainability reporting pillars each of these pillars has a board and a technical expert group teg the srb is currently interim chaired by prof kerstin lopatta a board member and professor at hamburg university until the formal chair is in place chiara del prete a former partner with mazars currently chairs both the financial reporting teg and the sustainability reporting teg the latter as acting chair efrag is funded both by the european commission and through private contributions of its member organizations you can see efrag s organizational structure here the efrag sustainability reporting board chair appointment is in many regards a political process there s obviously nothing wrong with this if it is done in a rigorous and transparent way that goes beyond the political connections of candidates to consider their credentials for the role this decision will set the course for whether the eu s standard setting progress will have the necessary robustness and credibility at this most fragile and important moment in the european project of sustainability reporting what first brought my attention to the significance of this process is a joint letter submitted by the french afep and german deutsches aktieninstitut business associations submitted to ms mairead mcguinness commissioner for financial services financial stability and capital markets union european commission on april 6 2022 it notes the importance of allocating sufficient time for serious discussions on the draft standards and raises concerns about the hasty approach being taken similarly a letter dated july 1 2022 from the confederation of swedish enterprise the council for swedish financial reporting supervision far the institute for the accountancy profession in sweden and nasdaq sweden expresses concerns that the restricted consultation will reduce the prospects for both the efrag european financial reporting advisory group and respondents to perform an adequate analysis and evaluation of the proposals as well as conducting an appropriate impact assessment getty voices expressing concerns about the speed with which the provisional standards were developed were soon joined by voices expressing concerns about the process for selecting the chair the commission has narrowed down the candidates to three patrick de cambourg former partner and chairman of mazars and current head of the french accounting standard setting authority who chaired the project task force of efrag that developed the initial draft standards and is a member of the board that will finalize them tjeerd krumpelman who heads up sustainability reporting for dutch bank abn amro and leads the group exploring integrated thinking and strategy for the international integrated reporting council among other work on sustainability reporting and dawn slevin who heads an environmental consultancy and has been part of an expert group contributing to the eu s green sustainable finance taxonomy these candidates names were apparently passed to the european parliament on the last day of june and its committee on legal affairs juri held a hearing on july 13 with the candidates and a vote on the 14th leading to a slim majority for mr de cambourg apparently 12 to 10 to 1 i have seen an email chain indicating that member states were at first only sent the cv for mr de cambourg bizarrely even before the hearing and vote in the parliament until some states objected and sought fuller information and debate they now seem set to take a vote on july 24 or 25 it remains unclear whether there will first be a debate in sending the candidates names to the parliament and presumably similarly to the council the european commission indicated that mr de cambourg was their principal candidate there may be an inherent logic in his continuing in the role that he has begun at the same time that would suggest some review of how that process has gone in the hearings held by the juri committee in parliament one parliamentarian asked what would seem like a particularly purposeful question in this regard lara wolters pointed to the significance of working methods and notably inclusiveness and consensus she noted that she was hearing that stakeholders involved in the process to date do not always feel like that inclusiveness and consensus is there at the moment the question struck me precisely because i have spoken with a number of people from business accounting civil society and academia who have been close to the process over the last many months who have uniformly and in many cases energetically highlighted such concerns one central figure in the process has observed to me the widespread antipathy generated by the management of the process to date among those charged with the work with views ranging from full opposition to at best neutrality another painted a disturbing picture a hot mess to be precise of members of the project task force being steamrollered and sidelined by efrag leadership the use of divide and conquer tactics to push through individual agendas and deliberate efforts to obfuscate the fact that large contingents of the task force had fundamental disagreements with the approach and architecture reflected in the draft standards it is noteworthy that the cover note that accompanies the draft standards out for comment states that the efrag srb has not reviewed or discussed the e ds and therefore has not taken any position on their content at this stage getty images moreover i am told that various people involved in the process have suffered from burnout from the high pressure autocratic and chaotic management approach being taken a crushing pace of work that apparently continues note that members of the srb and teg are all there on an unpaid part time basis only the chairs of each body are compensated that choice of structure surely must have implications for the timelines within which work can reasonably be done and done well the continuing pressure on the process may be seen as the only way to finalize the first set of standards for commission approval by the end of the year yet at what price responsibility for deciding on the chair of the board now continues with the european council comprised of eu member states to provide their independent assessment of all candidates credentials and make a recommendation to the commission given what is at stake and the narrow vote in the juri committee of the parliament it is of paramount importance that this process is not rushed and scrutiny is increased rather than decreased i realize that as an american many may think it is presumptuous of me to be expressing a view about how the eu is going about filling the role of the chair of the srb let me also acknowledge the even deeper set of problems that exist in the u s as i ve explained in my recent piece grift capitalism the gop s brilliant strategy for ripping off ordinary americans happily the eu is looking to be a leader and seeing how addressing climate change can be a form of economic competitive advantage and it is recognizing the relevance and importance of considering wider environmental social and governance issues in parallel good for them and much appreciated by me as a citizen of the world while not a silver bullet eu standards for sustainability reporting have a unique role to play in achieving more sustainable business practices incentivized by informed markets and other stakeholders their foundation must be a strong one it is at risk of being built on quicksand continuing with my temerity let me offer just three modest perhaps obvious recommendations for what needs to be done to ensure that the right person is selected as the chair of the srb those involved in the process can determine whether these recommendations are sensible ones and if they have already been met if the answer to their sensibility is yes but the answer to them having been followed is no then perhaps the eu should consider simply taking a bit more time to get this right my recommendations are 1 those involved in the nomination process should consider the credentials of candidates in two regards a their experience in issues of sustainability and sustainability reporting including reporting across the full range of environmental social and governance topics b their skills in stewarding complex multi stakeholder processes in an inclusive and consensus building manner with full regard to due process 2 in both regards the focus should not just be on claims made in hearings or interviews but on evidence provided how can they demonstrate the quality of processes they have contributed to stewarded or overseen and not just the fact that processes were completed 3 and just as candidates for any job would normally bring some references to bear some due diligence to gain insights as to candidates past performance will be relevant and necessary with a focus on people with experience of the candidates skills in the process as well as substantive elements of this role the issb hired a professional search firm to provide this kind of scrutiny for its board candidates including the chair and vice chair with the legitimately different process followed by the eu it is up to its own institutions to provide the same kind of scrutiny in order to set up the future standard setting process for the success it deserves this is important to the eu and to the rest of the world

will continue to buy because i am looking at a long term picture and that is very good for this sector says market expert ajay bagga the big issue is indian it has always been much pricier than the us it with the midcaps sitting at 28 to 35 times price earning and largecaps sitting at 22 25 times for that one needs to have stronger growth than what we are seeing and better margins we are not going to see that improving any time soon at least for the next quarter or two there are reports that overall it spend will increase by about 7 this year but the big risk is if the macro get impaired and if there is a slowdown globally companies could cut back on their future it plans and say we are going to make do with the existing it will anyone then spend on the digitisation and automation that we have been banking upon hoping that new orders will keep coming new orders will keep coming these are very well run excellent companies to own for the long term but i would agree that we will probably see lower prices before we go higher so there s no harm in waiting out a quarter to get some more clarity on it i am seeing the peak pessimism coming around september october when most of this rate hike cycle by the fed would be over and next quarter we will be able to assess how much is the macro damage that is flowing through because right now we are looking at a 50 lower gdp globally against about 6 3 we are looking at 2 9 for this year and next year is even more trouble at around 1 5 so the macro is severely disrupted and in that scenario people stop spending on it innovation and only the maintenance work will continue and that is the big risk we are running and we are not cheap even after this correction we are still on the higher side stocks can go 10 more very easily and still look on the higher side so wait and watch for it however i have been buying consistently and i will continue to buy because i am looking at a long term picture and that is very good for this sector there has been a chinese slowdown and we are expecting a chinese stimulus they have been talking about it for the last six months but precious little has been done on the ground once that happened it should be positive for markets and a much needed boost the us is stuck now senator joe manchin has told the democratic leadership that he won t support the climate provisions in the reconciliation bill manchin could potentially sink months of negotiations in washington over the sweeping policy package so in the us we might not see anything coming in india inflation is high rate hikes are expected the good thing is after friday s talk by the fed governor christopher waller and james brian bullard the president of the federal reserve bank of st louis the probability of a 100 basis point hike has sharply receded we are hoping there will be more talk on the possibility of a 75 basis point hike and then from monday they will go into a silent period in the 27th meeting there will be no more talks from the fed coming over the next two weeks that should give some support to the currency markets overall all emerging market currencies are hoping that this is the peak of the us dollar the flows are going as a safe haven flow into the us dollar and the japanese yen until that reverses we will continue to see the depreciation india has seen both the government and rbi taking some measures and rbi has been defending the rupee trying to ensure a soft depreciation instead of sharp depreciation the other thing is this week we saw very sharp rate hikes we saw korea going with a once in 25 years 50 bps hike we saw the philippines raising rates by 75 basis points the bank of canada by 100 bps so as inflation is staying quite persistent and high most of the central banks are hiking rates third there is a slowdown in the global economy with the second biggest economy at stall mode and with more lockdowns looming unless the chinese stimulus comes the markets will be a bit rattled next week the ecb comes in with its first rate hike in years we are expecting a 25 bps hike by the ecb but the italian government is under pressure and so a lot of things are happening we are just getting pulled in by the dollar strength it is not an india specific issue yes the 3 current account deficit remains an issue but the government has taken measures on that and oil coming down is very positive and that has not got factored in i think margin compression is very much on ex financials and ex oil and gas the second thing is that this quarter last year had been suppressed and so we are going to see very good yoy numbers we saw that in the auto numbers as well clearly we have to look at the management guidances to get a clear idea because the picture gets clouded by 2020 2021 it has made year on year comparisons different though sequential quarter on quarter numbers are giving better ideas and management guidances what is still looking good are top private sector banks and autos these are looking good across segments demand is returning to rural areas in two wheelers and that is good ancillaries are doing well as are defence related stocks and industrials the capital goods equipment suppliers will do well right now what is not looking good is it of course but somewhere it will start attracting some bottom fishing it is in an oversold zone pharma i am not very sure yet and again in five six segments within pharma the hospitals are doing well diagnostics not so well rest of the pharma is still under a cloud we will wait for this earning season and then make up our mind metals are in not so good a position but if china stimulus comes in metals could rally very sharply so keep an eye on that i am not recommending going into metals right now but i am expecting

the fifth race of the 2022 superstar racing experience srx season held at i 55 raceway was dominated by tony stewart for his third dirt win in as many tries in the process srx experienced more of the same issues they had last year on dirt while also highlighting some other ones in the series i can appreciate the idea of trying to get every driver to finish every race if they have a reasonable issue under caution however sometimes srx really needs to just throw its hands up and give up on sinking ships hailie deegan had an engine issue right before the field was coming back to green which extended the caution period for several laps and took a lot of green flag laps off the board after spending a number of minutes trying to get deegan s engine cooled down srx finally went back racing with just 18 laps to go in the main event keep in mind the caution initially came out for debris some 20 laps earlier somehow that wasn t the final caution of the night the last 10 laps in which only green flag laps count had five yellows primarily because ryan hunter reay and tony kanaan kept wrecking each other in the back that could have led to some exciting restarts but tony stewart was so far above everybody else in the field in dirt racing the only two drivers near his level either had a damaged race car ryan newman or were 67 years old ken schrader the good news is it was a whale of a battle behind stewart on all of those restarts but does it really matter that much when the leader is a second ahead after one green flag lap the good news is next week should give stewart more competition ryan blaney and chase elliott are nascar cup series drivers in their prime who may be able to close the gap in experience stewart has over them in dirt to me though it s clear a potential season three of srx cannot have dirt racing there are just so many more great asphalt tracks in this country like slinger superspeedway or salem speedway or elko speedway to have these drivers compete on even a mess like bowman gray stadium would hold better events for this series in my opinion than dirt ovals do in other news marco andretti finished a very impressive second it s his third straight runner up finish this year in the features and has allowed him to claim the points lead with just one race remaining it s becoming harder and harder to write andretti off from stock cars he s been actively campaigning for a while now to get a ride in the nascar xfinity series say what you will about the strength of the field in srx but winning a championship against a recent cup driver like newman is definitely something to crow about while it took a while last year for andretti to get going he definitely picked up speed in the second half of the season with the crown jewel being a big feature win at slinger and he s parlayed that into overall success this year the big question for andretti though may end up being that move he made late at south boston speedway where he spun off greg biffle after making a late dive on the former cup winner andretti finished eighth in that feature and scored 10 points had he settled for third at sobo not only would that mean four straight feature podiums for andretti he would have scored 20 points but he didn t so instead of entering sharon speedway with a 17 point advantage over newman he instead has a mere seven point lead as per tobychristie com five drivers enter sharon with a chance at the championship with the only true longshot being biffle who is down by 41 points bobby labonte is 18 points back and is still within striking distance but really has not shown the skill at dirt racing to be considered much of a factor stewart is down by 14 points and newman an aforementioned seven it is impossible for andretti to clinch after the first heat he may be able to clinch after the second heat if he has a 25 point lead heading into the feature if andretti finishes second in all three races on saturday night he will clinch the championship regardless of where his rivals end up it s a long way away from last year where stewart clinched the championship pretty easily after the first heat at nashville fairgrounds obviously outside of the championship fight the headlines for this race will be the battle of the blaneys dave blaney and son ryan will race each other in effectively their backyard in ohio while ryan will be bringing buddy elliott to the showdown as well as a guest driver those three as well as matt kenseth and the nine regular drivers make up the final 13 car field for the season follow finleyfactor
by mark w fowler a reader from northwest tennessee might wonder what sri lanka formerly ceylon has to do with our area read on for the answer sri lanka is an island 268 miles long and 139 miles wide to the south of india home to 22 million people it was formerly a british colony until gaining its independence in 1948 until the 1970s it was largely rural and poor with most involved in subsistence farming buddhism and hinduism were the predominant religious influences but in the 1970s liberalization of the economy led to increases in agricultural productivity natives migrated to the cities and modest industrialization occurred based on tire manufacturing and clothing tea became the leading export contributing over a billion dollars in revenue liberalization led to the use of first world farming techniques using tractors fertilizer and pesticide until the environmental social and governance esg movement arrived esg is a criteria for socially concerned investors reduced to its essence it means shifting to more organic methods of farming meaning labor intensive farming use of natural fertilizer and decreased dependence on machinery and fossil fuels it is based on the idea that advanced farming techniques are unsustainable in the long run damaging to the planet and lead to overpopulation this is not unlike the concerns of rev malthus who predicted that societal development would lead to mass starvation due to unsustainable population growth paul ehrlich formerly a science advisor to president obama is a proponent of this theory and persuaded sri lankan leadership to adopt it in effect returning sri lanka to subsistence farming the nation has a near perfect score of 98 on the esg scale america stands at 5 as a consequence the use of chemical fertilizer was banned in sri lanka over the objection of the agricultural community what happened was entirely predictable but necessary in the eyes of those comfortably ensconced in the offices of the united nations and western think tanks fundamentally the notion was that the world could not sustain energy intensive farming to sustain poorer populations and they would be limited to subsistence or organic farming from june 2021 to june 2022 food prices rose 80 five hundred thousand people of a population of 22 million slipped into poverty general annual inflation rose to 55 crop production on most small lots fell 55 60 and on the plantations by 33 tea exports collapsed and sri lanka recently defaulted on foreign debt payment it has accumulated a large debt to china the widespread misery led to large public rioting over hunger the president was run out of his palace why do presidents always live in palaces in poorer countries and police were forced to use water cannons on the populace to control rioting all because the ruling elites became enchanted with the notion of their superlative and largely imaginary wisdom to fundamentally transform society it is hard to fathom that some theoretical and as of yet unrealized global environmental benefit is worth the mass misery that has been visited on sri lankans governmental elites are fascinated with power and prone to try to impose their version of utopia on the masses without regard to the catastrophic effects how is sri lanka related to the united states green energy enthusiasts are seeking to impose renewable power on our economy so blind are they that they fail to see the irony of shifting to electric cars when texas and california have suffered brownouts and blackouts in times of peak demand they fail to understand that for the near future most electricity is generated by coal no new nuclear plants have been built in decades and wind and solar are largely understood by realists to be insufficient to sustain anticipated demand petroleum refining capacity is operating at maximum capacity with no new refineries built in decades the present administration and progressives generally have repeatedly expressed antipathy to fossil fuel development who do they think will invest in petroleum infrastructure when many millions were lost with the cancellation of the keystone pipeline and where do we find ourselves today dependent on china for many economic essentials including computer chips medicines antibiotics and surgical masks facing 9 inflation and shortages of baby food fuel and fertilizer while the stock market plummets progressive leadership touts the appointment of a transgender woman as an admiral to the public health service a lesbian woman of color as the presidential spokesperson and a gay man as transportation secretary whatever value those accomplishments may have they are of little concern to the families struggling to put food on the table and fuel in their vehicles in the meantime rome burns
pacific island nations courted by china and the united states put the superpowers on notice telling the world s two biggest carbon emitters to take more action on climate change while pledging unity in the face of a growing geopolitical contest leaders at a four day summit of the pacific islands forum pif meeting in fiji s capital suva bristled at a chinese attempt to split some of the nations off into a trade and security agreement while washington pledged more financial and diplomatic engagement the exclusive economic zones of the 17 forum members span 30 million sq km 11 6 million sq miles of ocean providing half the world s tuna the most eaten fish the nations are also feeling some of the severest effects of climate change as rising seas flooded lower lying areas at the pif summit that ended on thursday leaders adopted language several members have used in declaring a climate emergency saying this was supported not only by science but by people s daily lives in the pacific a communique yet to be released shows the nations focused on the next united nations climate conference cop27 they will push for a doubling of climate finance to flow from big emitters to developing nations within two years money they say is needed to adapt to rising sea levels and worsening storms the communique seen by the reuters news agency also calls for meaningful progress at cop27 on financing for the loss and damage to vulnerable societies that cannot adapt and will need to relocate communities a battle lost at last year s global climate talks what matters most to us is we secure bold commitments from all countries at cop27 to phase out coal and other fossil fuels and step up finance to the most vulnerable nations and advance causes like loss and damage that matter dearly to the most at risk island communities fiji s president frank bainimarama told reporters we simply cannot settle for any less than the survival of every pacific island country said bainimarama the forum s chairman tuvalu s foreign minister simon kofe who literally made waves at the last global climate conference by standing knee deep in seawater to show what his country faces told reuters there is technology available to protect the islands and raise the islands and that is what we are seeking it is very costly as the pacific summit was ending australian coal mining stocks soared on expectations china could resume imports after a two year political dispute halted coal shipments to the world s largest coal burner from its second largest exporter in contrast to the market s bullishness leaders in the forum s thatched roof headquarters discussed how to deal with the statehood of people whose nation has sunk in rising seas or rights to fishing grounds defined by their distance from a landmass that may disappear the communique cites an urgent need for assistance on debt vulnerability and the rising cost of food amid the pandemic and russia s invasion of ukraine in a video address to the forum us vice president kamala harris pledged to triple funding to pacific islands over a decade under a fisheries treaty and open more embassies pacific leaders at times showed irritation at the global focus on the contest between the washington and beijing over their region australia in tune said less about security and pledged greater support for the climate change agenda of its neighbors although maritime surveillance announcements to protect sustainable fishing hinted at its core anxiety it s harder for countries that are responsible for most of the illegal fishing then to argue they are going to support the region to stop illegal fishing australia s pacific minister pat conroy said in an interview referring to china economic ties to china australian officials privately say they do not want security choices in the region driven by economic ties to china and although pacific islands are sophisticated actors they need funding support because many have historical debts to beijing fiji for example has taken no loans from china since 2012 but continues to service export import bank loans for chinese infrastructure projects that will cost the government 40 million fijian dollars 18m this year budget documents show australian strategic policy institute analyst michael shoebridge said beijing has a record of splintering regionalism drawing a parallel between its recent pacific diplomacy and a platform it created a decade ago to engage with european countries and bypass the european union some leaders said in interviews that china provided economic opportunities that small island economies could not ignore although they agreed to work through the forum to stay unified in their response to great power competition particularly on security after disquiet that beijing struck a security deal in april with the solomon islands the forum s secretary general openly criticized china s bid to have about half the forum members sign a deal on trade and security in may that would exclude members with ties to taiwan and exclude australia and new zealand leaders at the summit said it had been rushed without consultation china s embassy in fiji responded on twitter on saturday saying beijing had prepared and presented the outcome document to pacific islands a month ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers beijing has created a new platform for cooperation with pacific island countries through an annual meeting with its foreign minister it said
ajit ranade timesofindia com updated jul 17 2022 21 04 ist ist rbi s decision to allow payments for global trade in rupees is not aimed at internationalising the currency it s just a way to pay for russian oil without falling foul of the sanctions regime recently the reserve bank of india announced an additional arrangement for invoicing payment and settlement of imports and exports in rupees many assumed that this is tantamount to rupee becoming an international currency not quite there is a huge difference for that to happen the rupee has to be freely traded across the world between third parties which have no connection to india like a saudi resident buying a japanese toyota car with american dollars even though that transaction has nothing to do with america thus to internationalise the rupee we basically must open up our capital account unlimited amount of rupees can go in or out to buy and sell stocks bonds real estate here or abroad third party countries should prefer to hold some of their foreign exchange reserves in the form of rupees or rupee assets our current policy is that the capital account is substantively closed and you need permission to buy assets abroad hence we are not quite ready for it nor will we be in the near future

an alberta organization that spreads government propaganda about the oil and gas industry has hired a u s crisis management firm whose stated mission is to defend against predatory journalists counterpoint strategies was contracted by the canadian energy centre also known as alberta s energy war room to provide strategic advice and assistance with social media and digital communications relating to u s energy issues according to documents registered in early may with the u s department of justice counterpoint explains on its website that it works with clients that are being threatened in the public discourse its services are necessary because the modern news media is hostile aggressive and willing to disregard standards and collude with almost any antagonist the firm advertises a counter adversarial strategy for fighting back we can stop hostile coverage in its tracks it says this may be a response to the fact that news media outside of alberta have been bringing more accountability to bear on the oilsands and the provincial government sean holman an environmental and climate journalism professor at the university of victoria said of the alberta contract with counterpoint the tyee reached out to the canadian energy centre which is funded by the alberta government and has three provincial cabinet ministers on its board to ask whether it shares counterpoint s perspective on journalism there are a lot of good journalists doing very important work tom olsen ceo and managing director of the canadian energy centre wrote to the tyee in an email olsen didn t provide any further information about the contract with counterpoint counterpoint didn t respond to a media request and shortly after the tyee reached out it changed its website so that a page explaining its ethos and strategy is only accessible with a password that page is still publicly accessible on an internet archive known as the wayback machine however and it describes a compliant media working directly with activist groups to create self sustaining controversy and inflict maximum damage to their subjects the activist media co operation is predatory and these attackers count on weakness counterpoint explains they assume that their targets are vulnerable and if pressed will either compromise or give in altogether the president and ceo of counterpoint james andrew mccarthy is listed in this may s foreign registration documents as someone who renders services directly for the canadian energy centre the centre was set up in 2019 by alberta premier jason kenney to counter a campaign of lies against the province s oil and gas industry the silly scary truth about alberta s new ministry of truth read more mccarthy founded counterpoint in the 2000s and gained notoriety from media watchers for pioneering the practice of using google ads to draw negative attention to specific journalists who wrote stories that his corporate clients didn t like when you include their name in the search it draws attention to it and lets the reporter know that you mean business and you re going to hold them responsible he told nieman lab in 2009 mccarthy subsequently created a short video which portrays journalists as ravenous predatory wolves who will literally tear your company apart destroy its reputation and cause its stock to plummet according to a description in the columbia journalism review the video s thesis is blunt our current information landscape is a war zone journalists are enemy combatants and unprepared companies are at risk counterpoint s current website contains a similar message competitive pressures and ideology are creating perverse incentives for journalists to cause harm to market share stock value brand and reputation and those incidents are happening with alarming frequency and drastic consequences a target of alberta s war room fires back read more with addresses in new york and washington d c counterpoint markets itself as a unique communications agency specializing in crisis solutions issue management litigation pr and reputation defense one which works with leading private equity firms dow 30 companies private industrial firms and prominent public figures it promises those clients now including the canadian energy centre that it can leverage digital ads expose the ulterior motives of adversaries rally specialized allies discredit attacks counterpoint does so by doing things like closely tracking all priority information affecting a client creating websites that can dismantle print articles and threatening legal consequences before a story is ever published or broadcast all of this means that opponents in the discourse are confronted with a choice adhere to principles or face being discredited it explains allan inquiry clears enviro groups but blasts kenney s war room read more in early june a recently created twitter account called matter of fact cec which is linked to the canadian energy centre and focuses on the u s took aim at a reuters story about canada s oil and gas industry reuters had reported that canadian banks were facing criticism for labelling some of the financing they made to fossil fuel companies as environmentally sustainable contrary to a recent article in reuters investments in canadian oil and gas projects are a smart move for those concerned with sustainable finance the account tweeted olsen didn t answer the tyee s question about whether this account is connected to counterpoint in a more recent tweet from july 11 matter of fact cec argued that the media are eager to write obituaries for fossil fuels but the global economy will still need oil and gas for decades especially in emerging economies that tweet currently has one like

an autonomous delivery vehicle by damo is displayed at the world artificial intelligence conference waic in shanghai china july 8 2021 photo reuters artificial intelligence ai has been a trending buzzword for some time it s a term commonly used for machines computer controlled robots and software systems performing intelligent tasks such as learning planning reasoning and interacting simulating the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals usually when people think about ai they associate it with human like robots taking over the world as depicted in hollywood movies like i robot ex machina and westworld to name a few those films portray a highly advanced version of ai formally known as artificial general intelligence agi which is currently close to impossible unlike hollywood ai today focuses on narrow problems such as autonomous driving stock prediction virtual assistants and solving impactful real world problems most of the fundamental ai concepts have existed for many decades the term ai was coined in 1956 by stanford computer scientist john mccarthy the past decade however has shown unprecedented growth in the development of ai technologies mainly unlocked by the availability of compute power the enormous amount of training data made available by the internet of things iot devices and the decrease in cloud storage and computing costs as a result ai technologies are already revolutionising most industries businesses and lifestyles we have sophisticated smart assistants such as siri on our phones self driving cars are closer to becoming a part of our everyday lives robots help farmers protect their crops from weeds by monitoring and spraying weedicide on plants ai models can paint and generate images from text and ai systems are already assisting doctors in the early detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and neurological disorders the global ai software industry is growing rapidly statista reports that it is expected to reach 126 billion by 2025 it is considered an engine of economic growth and the next big disruptor many countries have developed dedicated ai frameworks and policies to facilitate education programmes and research and development r d centres to forward technological advancements and economic growth examples include china s next generation artificial intelligence development plan the us executive order on ai leadership and ai made in germany to name only a few pakistan must follow suit and invest in programmes to promote youths enthusiasm about ai and modern technologies this means investing in education programmes research centres and industry readiness training programmes after all pakistan has great potential in ai with its scope ranging from solving local problems in agriculture governance climate change and manufacturing to creating tech unicorns and services companies specialising in hi tech ai software exports in fact a few research labs companies and startups are already making strides in the ai space and contributing to the global tech ecosystem for example a group of professors at information technology university itu lahore are solving impactful problems and publishing their research at top tier ai conferences one of the most exciting works from their intelligent machines lab is an economic indicators predictor that uses satellite and aerial imagery they are developing computer vision ai tech that examines a satellite image and responds with a poverty estimate for an area providing government and policymakers the data to make informed decisions the national centre of artificial intelligence ncai is a technological initiative established by the government of pakistan in 2018 it aims to become a leading hub of innovation scientific research knowledge transfer to the local economy and training in the area of ai and its closely affiliated fields it consists of nine research labs from six universities in pakistan in addition a few more labs at itu nust lums pucit fast and other universities are solving fundamental ai problems they publish their work at top tier international venues and collaborate with companies like google and facebook motive formerly keeptruckin is an inspiring example from the industry and a great success story from pakistan it s a us based tech unicorn that has leveraged pakistan s talent pool and built a vital engineering hub in pakistan motive brings ai to technologically underserved businesses that power the physical economy such as trucking construction energy and adjacent supply chain industries these businesses still employ inefficient expensive laborious and complex workflows to move trillions of dollars worth of goods motive equips them with technologies needed to improve their operations safety productivity and efficiency typically companies set up their r d centres in the west and only outsource basic engineering work to developing countries like pakistan motive has been an exception because it established its primary ai team in lahore this team consists of multiple phds postdocs in computer vision and machine learning and engineers with a solid academic research background they build ai technologies to help prevent road accidents keep our roads safer and save lives they have already shipped industry leading ai products published their work at top ai conferences and filed multiple patents thanks to r d done primarily in pakistan ai and innovation in general is not something new to pakistan we have a strong talent pool and a growing population of educated youth we are also an incredible engineering hub with a growing information technology it industry we have over 600 000 it professionals with over 25 000 fresh graduates added to the workforce annually we have around 17 000 software companies providing services to over 120 countries across the globe bringing in 3 billion in it export revenue last year it is encouraging to look at the tech companies startups and research labs working in both applied and scientific research in ai they are producing world class ai products conducting fundamental ai research and solving impactful problems right here in pakistan and yet the number of companies and startups providing services and building products in the ai space is relatively small we must invest in programmes that help bridge the industry academia gap and motivate the youth to pursue research and education in ai we must train some of our existing 600k it professionals in ai and we must create more centres like ncai the writer is an engineering manager at motive technologies formerly keeptruckin where he helps lead the efforts to develop world class ai products for driver safety published in the express tribune july 18th

people are less likely to splurge for their daily morning 6 coffee amid a looming recession and starbucks stock is down over 30 this year however another main problem facing starbucks stores is crime ceo howard schultz announced that the company is closing 16 stores with many more closures to come while potential union busting cannot be counted out as a reason for store closures there is no denying that crime is running rampant in america right now it has shocked me that one of the primary concerns that our retail partners have is their own personal safety schultz said in a leaked video america has become unsafe it is of no surprise that the store closures are occurring in democratic cities such as philadelphia portland seattle los angeles west hollywood and washington d c the coffee giant is also considering banning the public from using its restrooms as safety issues grow employees are being trained on how to deescalate situations and if needed how to deal with an active shooter in the store in fact stores are closing throughout the aforementioned cities as crime cannot be contained manzoor chughtai the president of the franchise owners association of philadelphia said right now we have a lot of problems with the city of philadelphia we are closing left and right robbers are coming in they re just robbing the place left and right manzoor said that nobody wants to take over these stores as it has become very dangerous even to work in these areas he estimates that the city has lost up to 20 stores already but will likely lose more solely due to crime los angeles has been forced to close countless stores after the californian pro crime government banned police from arresting shoplifters i reported in april that the california retailers association cra reported that san francisco and oakland alone lost 3 6 billion annually due to retail crime as the economy continually turns down we can expect crime to move in the opposite direction

in 2013 i got my first clinic in standing up to insufferable leftists when i watched ben shapiro demolish british gun grabber piers morgan on cnn conservatives need to stop approaching some of the debates with liberals on a conciliatory basis but recognize that a people on the left don t want to change their minds and b it s not going to be a civil debate anyway so stop crying when they don t play fair and denigrate themselves into name calling and demagoguery advertisement i have revisited that debate discussion denounce fest a number of times over the last few years but i watched it again with a deeper fascination and appreciation i specifically honed in on the fundamental argument shapiro asserted repeatedly regarding the united states citizenry and our desire to maintain not just the second amendment but to allow for the possession of assault weapons shapiro asserted the basis for the second amendment is not really about self defense and it s not about hunting it is about resistance to government tyranny that s what the founders said and that s what the right believes in this country of course the part that was the most insulting an attempt by piers to disrupt shapiro s unflappable demeanor was this snobby retort from morgan do you understand how absurd you sound of course the only thing that was absurd was piers naive belief in the basic goodness of government survey what has happened around the world for the last four years a number of democratically elected governments have indeed become tyrannical it s crystal clear that indeed democracies and democracy itself are not the solution to the world s problems and in fact can turn tyrannical as well as rapacious let s consider what happened in hong kong the former british colony in 2019 2020 when the beijing mainland government announced that it was going to direct the hong kong region to start trying criminal suspects in mainland china protests rocked and blocked daily business in the city state these protests rollicked the region for months and riots and other violent tumults broke out against the hong kong policy pro freedom anti beijing protesters held demonstrations broadcast to the world where they held american flags and sang our national anthem hong kong dissidents not only cried out to america for help but they also cried out to enjoy the rights which our political class is determined to undermine our right to self defense memorialized in the second amendment imagine if the hong kong protesters had been allowed to carry guns they could have fired back at the rogue police officers challenged the mainland chinese military in their subtle usurpation of the region s autonomy i am shocked though perhaps i should not be that piers morgan and the rest of the self righteous liberal chattering classes in the uk and throughout the commonwealth ignored this perverse development look at canada now a frozen banana republic because of the abusive autocratic tendencies of prime minister justin trudeau and his illiberal liberal party he imposed some of the harshest federal health mandates in the world preventing canadian citizens from even leaving their country he has maintained an onerous unnecessary vaccine and mask mandate for national and international travel he forced returning canadians into two week quarantines whether they manifested covid symptoms or not and then there was the outrageous crackdown on freedom of speech and assembly manifested against the canadian truckers and now every single gun owner in the country trudeau has outlawed the sale of firearms and has even declared that canadian citizens do not have a right to use firearms in their own self defense the huffington post predicted it trudeau has become a dictator a petty soy boy tyrant visiting wrath and condescension against his fellow canadian citizens or should i write subjects at this point advertisement and this contagion of tyranny is spreading democratically re elected emmanuel macron of france has declared that citizens should not use firearms to protect themselves either last week leaders in germany s new governing center left coalition declared that members of right wing alternative for germany should have their guns confiscated how outrageous arrogant and tyrannical can one get in 2021 south africa descended into critical race theory inspired mass riots another country that had enacted severe gun restrictions gun control did nothing but empower the ruling black supremacist regime in the nation and its widespread acolytes the police were powerless forced to rely on local guerrilla groups to stock up on munitions and australia throw in new zealand too in a recent interview in which shapiro and morgan revisited the topic of gun control piers vaunted the land down under as a model of peaceful residents who turned in their guns after a mass shooting yet morgan conveniently forgot to share that the federal government enacted some of the most crippling covid 19 related lockdowns and health mandates with outright government surveillance creeping over the entire nation anyone who failed to check in at certain times throughout the day on a government run app received a not so nice visit from the cops whether they manifested covid symptoms or not the police had the authority to drag them to covid quarantine centers is anyone seeing a pattern here advertisement across the globe we have witnessed so called western democracies shred the natural rights and constitutional liberties of their people ignoring the limitations placed on the governments all under the guise of keeping everyone healthy the people had no guns and they had no recourse to fight back morgan s myopic progressive arrogance was on display during his 2013 heated exchange with ben shapiro he was wrong then he owes us all an apology now of course shapiro made one small mistake during his interview with piers morgan democratic governments turned tyrannical less than 10 years after his remarks not a century afterward such trying tyrannical times have come upon us and we must fight to safeguard our natural right to self defense from the government all the more
united farm ranch management has historically done most of its farmland sales in the months after harvest and before planting season generally october or november to april that s because that s when farm owners have the time to think about buying or selling land but over the past couple of years chris scow said he has seen a noticeable change we ve kind of had an active sales market all through the year said scow managing broker and operations manager of the company s lincoln office the demand for farmland that s driving year round sales also is pushing prices to heights not seen in nebraska history according to final results from the university of nebraska lincoln s nebraska farm real estate report overall farm prices in the state rose 16 this year to 3 360 an acre an all time record values were strongest in the northeast part of the state up 21 while the northern region had the smallest increase of 11 the unl report is actually pretty conservative in its estimate of the increase in land prices in the state however scow said sales his company has been involved with indicate prices are up 20 25 in central and southeastern nebraska where the most productive cropland is located a report from the federal reserve bank of kansas city estimated nebraska s fourth quarter land prices were up 31 for non irrigated cropland 21 for irrigated land and 23 for ranchland compared with a year ago farmers national company an omaha based farm management and real estate firm said that the average price buyers paid for nebraska farmland in the first half of the year was 11 500 an acre up more than 30 from the first half of 2021 recent farmers national company auction sales demonstrate the strength in the land market so far in 2022 said randy dickhut the company s senior vice president good land that was selling for around 16 000 last fall sold for 19 000 to 21 500 per acre at company auctions in march this increase in prices is on top of a 15 30 jump in value across most grain belt states in 2021 while prices increased strongly in every state across the 18 state footprint where farmers national operates no state saw as big of a gain as the cornhusker state there are a number of reasons driving both demand and prices including higher crop prices political and economic instability increased interest from investors and historically low interest rates at least up until a few months ago the increased interest from investors has come as traditional investments such as stocks have seen a sharp decline in value this year jim jansen an extension economist with unl and co author of the report said there has been a renewed interest in all types of land because of the current economic uncertainty farmland is typically a less volatile asset than many other investments and u s department of agriculture data shows that since 1970 farmland has averaged a 5 7 annual return people are looking at land as a store of wealth said jansen who is based at the haskell agricultural laboratory in concord one investment firm that s bullish on nebraska is farmland partners a publicly traded real estate investment trust the company owns 32 farms in nebraska encompassing nearly 7 400 acres it has purchased three of those farms this year including two last month nebraska is a wonderful wonderful place to farm so that s driving value strongly said paul pittman chairman and ceo of the company which is the nation s largest publicly traded reit that focuses on farmland farmland partners two most recent purchases were in hamilton county and it paid 12 658 an acre for one farm and 13 842 an acre for the other farm land values in nebraska are incredibly strong pittman said especially in the eastern half or third pittman s view jibes with the unl report which shows that the east northeast and southeast regions rank first second and third for highest land values the big question now is whether the demand and the price increases are sustainable one thing to note about the various reports is that many are based on a time frame that precedes the recent sharp rise in interest rates jansen said rising interest rates might moderate prices to an extent but other factors such as high commodity prices will keep the market relatively robust high commodity prices help to keep farmers in good financial shape which means they take on less debt and are less likely to be forced to sell their farms which can drive down prices after recording 75 farm bankruptcies in 2019 and 2020 nebraska has had only 22 in the 18 months since scow of united farm ranch management said he has seen very few stress sales by farmers over the past couple of years we re not in that environment right now he said another factor that might blunt the effect of interest rates on farmland sales is that not that many sales are financed most of these farm transactions are done with cash pittman said he is a firm believer that prices will continue to go up in large part due to continued demand for farmland along with a decreasing supply of good quality farmland to sell i think you ll continue to see values go up in a place like nebraska most valuable crops grown in nebraska most valuable crops grown in nebraska 9 oats 8 sunflower 7 millet 6 sorghum 5 potatoes 4 wheat 3 hay haylage 2 soybeans 1 corn

it hasn t taken long for a change of government to embolden australia s stock of china grovellers last week especially they crawled from their hiding holes to begin a new campaign of useful idiocy for beijing it was led off by heavily conflicted coal director geoff raby at the righty afr in madrid the country of cervantes we had the spectacle of don quixote and his squire sancho panza tilting at windmills trying to convince others that the world is not cast as it is at the same time we had the prime ministers of belgium and the netherlands warning that china is not an enemy of europe and warning that equating china with russia as albanese did was not only a mistake but potentially harmful until albanese changes the advisers who have taken australia into these policy dead ends he will continue to cut a quixotic figure on the world stage worse he will run the risk that as china and the us recalibrate their relations australia will be left like a shag on a rock and our security seriously unattended the equally appalling afr still refuses to put raby s true byline on his stories from the foreign influence register advertisement raby s arguments are so distorted that they are best referred to as propaganda all of europe is recalibrating away from russia and china post ukraine liberal powers are coming together like they have not done since the cold war albo was not quixotic he was deep consensus the one great thing about australia s chinese posture through the trials of three governments turnbull morrison and albanese is that the advisors have been the same throughout this has allowed successive australian governments to adapt to each new challenge with impressive speed hence we have had the domestic influence pushback survival of the trade war the revitalisation of liberal alliances quad nato aukus etc after the 14 conditions to end democracy and the pacific reset this is a mighty pivot for a slow moving sovereign and much gratitude should go to the very advisors that raby unscrupulously attacks the us is not recalibrating towards china either even if the biden administration decides to cut tariffs its overarching posture is continuity with trump not break from it moreover ties with taiwan and other asian allies are clearly deepening us china rapprochement is geoff raby fantasy advertisement over the weekend hugh white also dragged himself into the twilight at the lefty saturday paper ask hugh white what has changed in australia s fraught relationship with china since the election of the albanese government and he invokes the law of holes the first law of holes is if you re in one stop digging says white emeritus professor of strategic studies at the australian national university the new government s primary concern has been to at least stop digging quite as bloody energetically in 40 years watching australia s approach to international affairs and national security white can think of no parallel to the way the morrison government deliberately tried to exacerbate the tensions with beijing for political purposes they thought it would help them win an election it didn t most voters saw the bilateral relationship as a complex issue to be managed rather than a threat to be confronted chinese australians in particular were offended he says by the warmongering talk it s not true to say the past government ignored the pacific it s just that their policy had one big fat hole in it which they were unable to address white welcomes the fact that the new government does not issue dire warnings about china s part of a threatening arc of autocracy bent on subverting the international rules based order as morrison did or utter repeated warnings that we should prepare for war like former defence minister peter dutton but what has really changed other than the rhetoric directed at china not much there was white says no material difference in policy between the two sides of politics before the election and there still is not the new government may have stopped digging but we re still in a hole it strikes me that they re hoping that a change in tone will produce a substantial improvement in the bilateral relationship he says but he notes even as the new government has softened its rhetoric towards china it has continued to mouth stock phrases about the united states the indispensable power it makes me think that they haven t thought at all deeply about the fundamental problem which is that we continue to hope and expect america to solve that china problem for us white doesn t see america solving it quite the opposite australia s core problem he writes in the latest quarterly essay is its decision to overtly explicitly and energetically oppose china s ambition to push america out of east asia and take its place as the leading regional power and white reiterates to the saturday paper that is to deny reality china s power and influence will inevitably grow particularly in our part of the world already it accounts for 19 per cent of global gdp compared with the us at 16 per cent by 2035 that gap is likely to widen to 24 versus 14 china s power is something we re going to have to learn to live with instead of trying to block he says other leaders have realised this he says pointing to new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern s speech last week to the lowy institute she very clearly articulated what australian political leaders will not articulate that it is necessary to be more accommodating of china notwithstanding our differences riiiiight us gdp is around 23tr chinese gdp is around 17tr advertisement i can only assume that white is using purchasing power parity numbers to boost chinese output above that of the us this makes no sense ppp is a cost of living not an economic power measure gdp comparisons using ppp are arguably more useful than those using nominal gdp when assessing the domestic market of a state because ppp takes into account the relative cost of local goods services and inflation rates of the country rather than using international market exchange rates which may distort the real differences in per capita income it is however limited when measuring financial flows between countries and when comparing the quality of same goods among countries ppp is often used to gauge global poverty thresholds and is used by the united nations in constructing the human development index these surveys such as the international comparison program include both tradable and non tradable goods in an attempt to estimate a representative basket of all goods in terms of economic power we use gdp because it measures the ability of a state to project influence and acquire power via imports and export volumes advertisement in those terms china still lags the us by a long way moreover china is about to slump japanese style into an ex growth bog not to mention that china exaggerates its gdp meaningfully by failing to write down bad investments as well post ukraine war it is clear that a revitalised nato is going to play a major role in any us china conflict if not in terms of boots on the ground or ships in the sea then definitely in terms of the economic and financial boycott that will smash the chinese economy a la russia in fact we can add all of the us alliance network to the same calculus which constitutes every developed market on planet earth all will blockade china back into the dark ages advertisement once we incorporate these facts china never gets close to overtaking the us in gdp terms and lags even more in terms of gdp power completing the triptych of china prostration was crikey where wanning sun professor of media and communication in the faculty of arts and social sciences at uts ventured into territory she should stay right out of after three years in deep freeze australia s relationship with china may be starting to thaw with the foreign affairs ministers finally talking to each other after the meeting between penny wong and wang yi the chinese ministry issued a carefully crafted statement in which china sounded positive and forward looking according to quite a few bilingual diplomats on all accounts one would have thought that this at last was a good news story but what has ensued is a classic example of how a good story can be turned into a bad one courtesy of australian media it seems most stories we have seen so far about this official statement pivot around how to interpret a few sentences in the statement translated by professor jocelyn chey they read as follows it was hoped that australia would catch the current opportunity take concrete actions reconstruct a correct perception of china and reduce negative equity and accumulate positive energy in order to improve china australia relations first china should continue to be regarded as a partner not a rival second the way of seeking common ground while reserving differences should be maintained third not aiming at others or being controlled by others should be maintained fourth the building of a foundation of positive practical community support should be maintained translated thus these seem to be just four vaguely worded points that may be taken as either advice or as principles that both sides should adhere to but despite these nuances the most frequently used word in the australian media to describe the four points has been demands for example an abc story asserted mr wang has made four general demands of the new government without any justification for its use of demands advertisement with respect who cares we ve spent the last six years fighting off various forms of chinese insurgency attack bullying insult blackmail and coercion this was the true face of xi s ccp there is no going back to putting aside differences and we should never again trust a single word from beijing what s ahead must be exactly what is behind diversification away from china building resilience against china and formation of alliances to contain china if we do that then our liberal system can survive and prosper as the wannabe chinese empire never is and its local useful idiots disappear with it advertisement
to be sure no single factor alone can wholly explain the growing populist appeal but rising worries about political corruption across the globe have surely played a part indeed even if their interest in the issue is far from genuine right wing populist politicians have proven especially adept at capitalizing on a growing sense that governments are working for private interests more than they are for regular people and those who claim to be committed to resisting them now need to get better at fighting back in late april we spoke to european lawmakers and civil society groups who have watched with alarm as the revolving door between the european union s governing institutions picked up speed with american companies and autocratic governments alike drawing on observations from our work here in the united states we then offered suggestions for how they might strengthen ethics standards at home while the policy specifics may of course differ according to regional context the principles that guide ethics reform should look the same everywhere and firstly lawmakers must recognize that perceptions are key to a successful ethics program if a practice plausibly corrodes trust in government giving the impression that public officials may be acting in the interest of personal or private profit and not the public for example the practice should be outlawed even if in some instances it may be harmless lawmakers should also strive to establish red lines that are simple to explain administer and enforce consider for example the current effort to address u s congressional stock trading after a first bid to police congressional insider trading by collecting and publishing annual and periodic financial disclosures for hundreds of lawmakers staffers and their spouses utterly failed to put an end to trading scandals congress has now turned to a more promising strategy banning stock trading and in some iterations stock ownership outright such a ban would not only strike at the heart of public anxiety but it would require significantly less paperwork and monitoring leaving less room for errors and making meaningful enforcement that much easier
