after scaling 40 year highs inflation in the united states has been slowly easing since summer yet the federal reserve seems decidedly unimpressed washington ap after scaling 40 year highs inflation in the united states has been slowly easing since summer yet the federal reserve seems decidedly unimpressed and unconvinced that its fight against accelerating prices is anywhere near over on thursday stock markets buckled on the growing realization that the fed may be willing to let the economy slide into recession if it decides that s what s needed to drive inflation back down to its 2 annual target the s p 500 stock index lost roughly 100 points 2 5 in its worst day since early november the losses came a day after the fed raised its benchmark interest rate for the seventh time this year the half point hike the fed announced to a range of 4 25 to 4 5 had been widely expected what spooked investors was wall street s growing understanding of how much further the fed seems willing to go to defeat high inflation in updated projections they issued wednesday the fed s policymakers forecast that they will ratchet up their key rate by an additional three quarters of a point to a hefty 5 to 5 25 and keep it there through 2023 some fed watchers had expected only an additional half point in rate hikes those higher rates will mean costlier borrowing costs for consumers and companies ranging from mortgages to auto and business loans the policymakers also downgraded their outlook for economic growth in 2023 from the 1 2 they had forecast in september to a puny 0 5 as near to a recession forecast as they were likely to make what s more they raised their expectation for the unemployment rate next year to 4 6 from 3 7 now all of which suggested that the officials expect or at least would accept an economic downturn as the price of taming inflation the message the fed was sending said ryan sweet chief u s economist at oxford economics was blunt we re going to break something we re going to break inflation or we re going to break the economy many investors had convinced themselves that with inflation pressures gradually easing the fed might soon declare some progress in their fight and perhaps even reverse course and cut rates sometime in 2023 there was seemingly reason for optimism consumer prices rose 7 1 last month from a year earlier down from 9 1 in june and the fifth straight drop even more encouragingly on a month to month basis prices inched up just 0 1 and core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy costs and which the fed tracks closely rose just 0 2 from october to november the mildest rise since august 2021 a slowing economy has eased pressure on supply chains which had previously been overwhelmed with customer orders causing shortages delays and higher prices oil prices too have plunged easing prices at the pump a gallon of unleaded gasoline cost an average 3 19 on thursday down from 5 02 in mid june according to aaa yet fed chair jerome powell who had been slow to recognize the inflation threat when it emerged in the spring of 2021 was in no mood to celebrate powell essentially shrugged off the signs of incremental progress two good monthly reports are very welcome he told reporters wednesday but we need to be honest with ourselves 12 month core inflation is 6 three times the fed s target it s good to see progress but let s just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability powell seemed to bat down hopes that the fed might end up cutting rates by late next year a move that typically acts like steroids for markets and the economy unless inflation had dropped significantly by then which he does not appear to expect the policymakers increased their inflation forecast for next year above what they were expecting back in september it suggested that they feel their anti inflation fight isn t having as much impact as they had hoped many economists were caught off guard by that change for next year the fed is projecting more rate hikes a slower economy and higher unemployment than it did three months ago all those things typically help tame inflation yet the fed s officials predict that their preferred inflation gauge will be 3 1 at the end of 2023 up from their 2 8 forecast in september that s above their 2 target and likely too high for them to feel they can cut rates the fed wasn t the only source of rising recession fears thursday the european central bank which is waging its own aggressive war against inflation signaled that it too might send rates higher than markets expected thereby raising the likelihood of a downturn in europe on thursday the u s government reported that americans slashed their spending at retailers in november that was disconcerting news in the midst of the holiday shopping season and the federal reserve banks of new york and philadelphia issued downbeat reports on manufacturing in their regions yields on long term treasurys fell a sign that bond investors are growing more concerned about a possible recession even the goods news out thursday a drop in the number of americans seeking unemployment benefits had a downside it reinforced the fed s concern that a strong and resilient job market is putting upward pressure on wages and overall inflation the fed is especially worried that a worker shortage in the labor intensive services sector everything from restaurants and hotels to airlines and entertainment venues could keep pay growth high and make inflation more intractable sweet of oxford economics said he suspects that the fed is overstating how strong inflation might be but he said he sympathized with its predicament powell and the other policymakers fear that a failure to curb high inflation even if it means a recession next year would lead to a central bank s nightmare scenario stagflation that s a worst of all worlds combination of weak growth high unemployment and persistent inflation it s a problem with no clear solution faced with that choice sweet said they ll do everything they can to prevent it ____ choe reported from new york ap economics writer christopher rugaber

as historic city exchange faces claims it is being usurped 1 4bn microsoft deal that proves london is king of the stock markets not paris a landmark 1 4billion deal between microsoft s satya nadella and the london stock exchange group s ebullient chief executive david schwimmer was finally concluded in a flurry of online video calls between the two leaders last weekend as soon as the loose strings were tied up microsoft s top commercial officer judson althoff caught the red eye to london for a handshake on the steps of st paul s cathedral for the epoch making deal between europe s leading stock market and financial data repository and america s pioneering 1 5trillion computing and software giant the new relationship didn t just happen the london exchange and microsoft have put in hours behind the scenes involving hundreds of engineers on both sides of the atlantic to bring the ambitions of the two companies closer together the talks began over a year ago and involved countless virtual calls on teams between experts schwimmer tells the mail on sunday for the former goldman sachs banker it is another transformational deal that follows the american s blockbuster 22billion takeover of refinitiv the former reuters data and trading arm last year in a post brexit era when so many uk companies have shown a reluctance to invest it has once again taken an overseas entrepreneur leading a great british corporation to recognise the city s global leadership as a financial centre one now ready to take advantage of the freedoms offered by the uk s new status in the world instead of allowing itself to be a seven stone weakling there for the taking by would be buyers the lse has robustly rejected all comers over two decades successive chief executives dame clara furse and xavier rolet largely stood firm against wooing from deutsche borse nasdaq the hong kong stock exchange and chose to go it alone under schwimmer the lse has ballooned into a 45billion behemoth valued more highly than each of britain s high street banks with the exception of under siege hsbc there are those keen to drag london s trading and information powerhouse crown from its head data rival bloomberg trumpeted euronext and the paris bourse as having overtaken london in cash trading of shares schwimmer is irritated by exaggerations built on sloppy data but is the french cac all tradable index really overtaking the ftse all share he tells me the paris claim was based on just a few days trading in november 2022 those making the case for paris s superiority excluded from their calculations international funds etfs exchangetraded funds ipos initial public offerings or flotations on the lse capital raising and much else he argues as the european union focuses on 20th century cash trading and launches a campaign to repatriate a proportion of derivatives trading and clearing to the continent the lse is steaming off in new directions the deal with microsoft not only puts the lse on the cloud helping to make it more flexible and efficient it also speeds up london s capability in processing and data analytics the microsoft alliance parallels 21st century deals in the us between nasdaq and the chicago mercantile exchange with silicon valley giving them access to cloud and the best tech processing at the outset the lse has agreed to relatively modest spending of 2 8billion 2 3billion in its cloud computing capacity over the next decade microsoft believes there is at least 5billion to be harvested the partnership with microsoft also enables the lse through refinitiv to step up its battle with bloomberg and other data providers in the trading rooms and on the desks of investment bankers hedge funds and brokers it is designed to spew out new products too as former wall street banker and writer michael lewis demonstrated in his book flash boys speed is of the essence and provides an edge in financial trading the arrival of big tech in market dealings data and analytics is a new frontier for the lse it has been a long journey from its origins in the coffee shops in the narrow lanes of the square mile in 1698 the stock market itself has become more of an adjunct to its ability to process analyse and aggregate financial data across the planet the lse also has capability in foreign exchange fixed interest and derivatives trading alongside europe s dominant site for settling complex trades the london clearing house plainly the world of cash trading is at the core of what london stands for and schwimmer takes credit for grabbing a decent share of ipos and capital raising in a year when markets across the world have suffered from extreme volatility schwimmer and the lse with a microsoft techie now on the board can genuinely claim to be the city s first institution to take advantage of new freedoms and reach across the atlantic and to the far east the arrival of silicon valley in the world of exchanges and financial data may give regulators concerned about the power of big data cause for pause but the rocket to trades on the cloud has already left the launch pad
stanford the economic financial and political chaos of 2022 has exposed the limits of forecasting recall the outlook from mid 2021 when very few observers were worried about inflation i was among the small minority that was the blue chip consensus reflecting the views of 50 private sector forecasters was that the us consumer price index would rise by just 2 5 per cent in 2022 yet over the last 12 months core cpi which excludes volatile food and energy prices has risen by 6 per cent similarly the us federal reserve s fed preferred measure the core personal consumption expenditures index was expected to rise by just 2 7 per cent it is up 5 per cent then when inflation did begin to surge many insisted that it would be transitory the fed s historically rapid tightening of monetary policy repeatedly raising its policy rate by 75 basis points before tempering its hikes with a 50 bps increase this month was hardly on fed watchers radar screens in mid 2021 the three month us treasury bill yielded just 0 1 per cent today the yield is 4 23 per cent given these forecasting misfires few in mid 2021 predicted a recession within the next few years but now almost 90 per cent of blue chip analysts expect that real inflation adjusted gdp growth in 2023 will be 1per cent or less and about 40 per cent of that cohort puts it at zero or negative after large gains during the lockdown year equity markets have entered bear territory with technology stocks taking a huge hit political forecasts didn t fare much better few predicted that right wing governments would come to power in sweden and italy or that binyamin netanyahu would once again become israel s prime minister most pollsters in the united states anticipated a red wave of republican victories in the midterm elections but the party lost a senate seat and gained only a narrow majority in the house of representatives not least because candidates endorsed by former president donald trump underperformed across the board what about 2023 despite all the bad recent predictions policymakers investors and households still need to plan for the future which requires establishing a baseline outlook as matters stand the us economy is sending decidedly mixed signals the labour market remains fairly robust but with an unemployment rate of 3 7 per cent and 1 7 job openings for every unemployed person businesses are struggling to find workers and while the employment rate has returned to its pre pandemic levels labour force participation still lags most worryingly among prime age 25 54 years males all told there are roughly 1 2 million missing workers who presumably would be in the labour force if not for the pandemic disruptions some older workers who lost their jobs ended up retiring early but others have not returned because of ongoing health concerns a lack of childcare expanded government relief payments that disincentivised work and raised savings perhaps half of which have been drawn down or changes in work life balance preferences beyond persistent inflation and tighter monetary policy which will remain in place until there is significant progress toward the 2 per cent target rate the single biggest factor in the 2023 outlook is how firms will respond to a likely reduction in demand will businesses announce substantial layoffs as usual or will the difficulties in finding and retaining qualified workers lead them to sacrifice short run profits to keep people on the payroll many have already been laid off in the tech sector but that is because those companies binge hired in 2020 and 2021 the biggest negative factor inflation has slowly abated but it remains several times higher than the fed s 2 per cent target the question then is whether price stability can be quickly restored through slower demand growth resolution of supply chain issues and tighter monetary policy one major risk is that firms will raise wages to attract or retain employees setting off a wage price spiral thus far wage growth has lagged price growth which is why many poll respondents believe the us is already in a recession but there is no guarantee that this trend will last central bank doctrine holds that monetary tightening operates with a long and variable lag often 12 18 months and that the target interest rate must rise above the expected future inflation rate for some period inflation in 2023 is expected to be around 4 per cent according to the blue chip forecast below 3 per cent according to the bond market and almost 5 per cent according to consumer sentiment surveys optimists are expecting modest additional fed rate hikes from the current 4 25 4 5 per cent level the fed envisions a peak of 5 1 per cent but hopes for some easing toward the end of next year receded this month with fed chair jerome powell s suggestion that rate cuts back towards 4 1 per cent will not come until 2024 and even that schedule presupposes significant progress toward the fed s 2 per cent target such soft landings with minimal job losses are historically rare the even bleaker outlook for many other economies will compound the difficulty of engineering a soft landing against the backdrop of anaemic growth or outright recession from china and europe to developing countries in latin america asia and africa the dollar s continued strength is bad news for us exports once the new congress convenes on january 3 republicans will likely block most of us president joe biden s initiatives especially on spending which will take fiscal pressure off the fed s inflation fight they will do their best to limit the passage of new regulations and to step up oversight of executive branch agencies house republicans will pass their own conservative fiscal and domestic agenda and try to get the senate to take up bills that will expose the democrats embarrassing positions on issues such as illegal immigration crime spending and the like senate democrats and biden will ignore most and reciprocate and all major legislation is likely to stall at the end of the day that may be a good thing given the current congress s dubious legislative record which has already proved far too costly for whatever modest benefits it provides michael j boskin is professor of economics at stanford university and senior fellow at the hoover institution he was chairman of george h w bush s council of economic advisers from 1989 to 1993 and headed the so called boskin commission a congressional advisory body that highlighted errors in official us inflation estimates copyright project syndicate 2022 www

jim long commentary topsy turvy hog market market observations usda s global meat production forecast and gmos gene editing 2 november 2022 2 november 2022 6 minute read 6 minute read by by jim long observations u s hog marketing s last week was 2 557 000 the same week a year ago 2 552 000 iowa s minnesota hog weights 284 1 lbs a year ago same week 288 2 lbs a difference of 4 1 lbs a large difference this lower weight tells us that packers got a good demand for hogs and want to maintain kill numbers while producers have willingness to ship the hog inventory is current and you could argue a 4 1 lb weight spread could indicate hog slaughter pulled ahead by 300 400 000 head all bullish indicators u s pork cut outs closed friday at 101 34 a strong price for this time of year with a good number of hogs coming to market the latest weekly sow slaughter was 63 859 head september sow slaughter was 258 000 and last year 251 000 sow slaughter levels indicate to us that there is no sow herd expansion in the usa the u s cattle herd continues to liquidate more heifers and cows went to slaughter in september than a year ago plus 90 000 year to date about 700 000 more cows and heifers have gone to market than in 2021 the herd keeps getting smaller there will be less beef in the future and which is supportive of pork usda s latest forecast for global meat production in 2023 beef 59 2 million tonnes similar to 2022 pork 111 0 million tonnes 1 compared to 2022 chicken 102 7 million tonnes 1 8 compared to 2022 pork is the number 1 meat in the world we disagree with usda s projection that china s pork production will increase by 2 in 2023 the liquidation of china s sow herd won t make that possible usda projected last year china s production would decline by 14 in 2022 actually it s up 5 in the latest information they also predict the usa up by 2023 1 not sure how this happens with the fact of a smaller u s sow herd year over year we continue with the view that the usa china and eu producing 75 plus of all the world s pigs will be down in production in 2023 there will be less pork in the world in 2023 compared to 2022 gmo gene editing the major swine genetic company in the world is betting heavily on the implementation of gmo gene editing in the hope it will combat prrs they have spent 10 s of millions in this quest it appears from industry discussion they have promised this technology to many producers seems many have been promised to be the first customers we expect at some point who knows when the technology of gmo gene editing could work the following comments are not about technology but the challenge of consumer and market acceptance we like you have much of our livelihood tied up in pork production we like you are all in the one thing we know is it s better for business to have solid pork demand whether it be domestic or export the big question to us will consumers and markets accept gmo gene editing technology in the food chain gmo salmon though legal has had big resistance from retailers and consumers most of the major u s retailers won t sell the salmon product i e walmart costco albertsons kroger hy vee h e b meijer target etc what happens when the same retailers take the same position on gmo gene edited pork link to list of national retailers positions on gmo salmon paylean ractopamine is a legal product there was no issue domestically about its use in swine production china one customer announced it will not accept ractopamine in pork then everyone falls over themselves not to use it an effective ban one customer and it s over for a legal industry accepted product with paylean you could stop immediately what happens if you have gmo gene edited pigs they won t disappear overnight mexico is the u s number 1 export market for pork year to date 539 000 metric tonnes total u s exports ytd 1 189 000 over 40 of all u s pork exports to mexico this past week the mexican government reiterated its position that it will no longer accept and import gmo corn in 2024 seems quite a drastic position but nonetheless what does it mean for the pork industry are we to believe that if gmo corn is stopped that gmo gene edited pork would follow pork is directly consumed just as the mexican government worries about gmo corn being consumed directly in tacos burritos etc many in the mexican pork industry wish to cut u s pork imports to support domestic prices we would expect many could push for stopping gmo gene edited pork from being imported a government that looks at stopping gmo corn could concur the national pork board reports monthly how much exports do for the value of market hogs we expect mexico is a big part of this what is our risk factor with gmo gene editing iowa state which most would agree is ag friendly did an extensive survey recently on gene edited foods of about 2 000 u s consumers the survey found around 60 of the women in the survey said they would be unwilling to eat and purposely avoid gene edited foods not exactly a demand enhancing driver is it iowa state survey article to us gmo gene edited pork is full of landmines that could jeopardize pork demand and decreased pork demand would crush profitability we can t figure out why retailers would jeopardize their own brand for gmo gene edited pork case in point the vice president of mcdonald s speaking at the npic conference in wisconsin don t ask us to explain gmo gene edited pork when the world s largest restaurant chain says they don t want to deal with negatives that could jeopardize its brand to put it bluntly why would they care about prrs they don t own hogs currently the world s largest swine genetic company is pushing the merits of gmo gene editing we respect that s their right the executives who run the company have financial pressures with their big stock devaluation genus plc stock down 53 in the past year to get 10 s of millions invested in gmo gene editing the major shareholder s baillie gifford wellington management company abrdn capital group and blackrock are not exactly pig farmers by nature they look for returns that s their business and right for us though a swine genetic company we are lifelong pig farmers we look at it differently we need genetics that grows demand better tasting pork not products that could very really gmo gene editing threaten demand disease resistance is done in a natural genetic way through selection vs gmo gene editing is an alternative gmo gene editing we doubt will fix the huge prolapse problem and 15 plus sow mortality that is occurring in some genetics after a while of blaming prolapses and dead sows on feed water management etc it gets old gmo gene editing won t fix the dead sow issue yes we have an opinion our opinion is motivated by the reality that our hog prices are driven by demand we are worried the mad rush to gmo gene edited pork could crush demand as an industry we should consider the risk factors vs reward whether it s gmo salmon retailers paylean china gmo corn mexico mcdonald s iowa state survey we need to approach with eyes wide open

bedding considerations to lower scc weigh the pros and cons when determining the ideal bedding for your cows 6 december 2022 6 december 2022 7 minute read 7 minute read by by penn state university regardless of the type of dairy operation some form of bedding is always necessary however with so many bedding options on the market how can you make the right choice the best bedding choice for your farm depends on a variety of factors such as cow comfort cost availability ease of handling udder health pathogen growth and more many times producers do not realize that the bedding material they are using could be contributing to a high somatic cell count writes amber yutzy penn state university extension when choosing a bedding material producers often only consider two factors cow comfort and farmer comfort obviously cow comfort is at the top of the list because if a cow is not comfortable she will not spend her day lying down and making milk if stalls are uncomfortable this can increase standing time for cows that could in turn lead to lameness issues reproductive issues and decreased milk production all of which are costly for a dairy bedding needs to provide support for a resting cow but also needs to form a soft bed the bedding material needs to provide a cooling effect in the summer as well as warmth in the winter one of the most important factors is that the bedding stays dry dryness of the bedding will limit the growth of mastitis causing pathogens in addition to all the needs of the cow farmer comfort is important as well in order to achieve this the bedding material must be both cost efficient and easy to use from a labor standpoint bedding options fall into two main categories organic and inorganic there are many organic bedding options available to producers one of the most popular choices in pennsylvania is sawdust or shavings this is due to ease of use and availability of the product cows have been observed lying more in stalls deeply bedded with sawdust clark 2019 sawdust and wood shavings are highly absorbent but because they are organic they allow for rapid growth of pathogens when soiled or wet this type of bedding often has a smaller particle size which can be broken down easily by micro organisms for disposal due to this trait in both sawdust and shavings they both can have high bacteria counts making it more difficult to control mastitis lime can be added to the rear of stalls to reduce the ph in turn reducing pathogens but this is typically short lived and should be done daily to be effective clark 2019 compost bedding or bedded pack barns are very popular for housing dry cows and heifers this type of bedding generally takes more management than producers often give to it but can be of a lower cost than other bedding systems to begin the pack approximately 12 to 18 inches of wood shavings or sawdust is spread on the floor of a bedded pack or compost barn the pack must be aerated twice daily to a depth of 8 to 10 inches this helps to incorporate oxygen for aerobic decomposition and to provide a fresh soft surface for cows to lie down it is important to add appropriate amounts of fresh dry sawdust often depending on the weather conditions and density most bedded pack barns are completely cleaned out once or twice a year this system requires excellent pack and ventilation management for cows to perform well many bedded pack barns have fans to blow air downward onto the bedded pack to help dry the surface oftentimes steam is observed rising from the pack during tilling this is due to moisture escaping in large amounts bedded pack barns typically have higher amounts of environmental pathogens to reduce the risk of mastitis in cows it is important that producers maintain adequate bedding in the bedded pack ensure frequent tilling provide excellent ventilation avoid overcrowding and practice good parlor hygiene to be successful another common bedding used for the milking herd are mattresses mattresses can be found in tie stall or free stall housing facilities mattresses are made with a waterproof exterior that is filled with a variety of products most commonly rubber often producers use mattresses alone but studies have shown that additional bedding is needed to make the mattress more comfortable for cows to lie on clark 2019 without the additional bedding producers will often see an increased incidence of hock injuries as well as lameness in their cows mattresses tend to be cleaner because of increased stall maintenance in facilities that they are utilized in resulting in a lower scc compared to other organic bedding types increased bedding costs and decreased availability in parts of pennsylvania has resulted in producers looking for other bedding sources this has led to some producers implementing the use of recycled manure solids recycled manure solids are obtained by mechanical separation of manure removed from the dairy housing system recycled manure solids may be used fresh or composted and then used for bedding this is a low cost form of bedding that has high availability on site this availability has allowed for the use as an alternative bedding source a downside to recycled manure solids is that this bedding provides favorable conditions for rapid growth of environmental pathogens compared to other organic materials such as sawdust or bedded packs harrison 2008 however the use of manure solids in deep bedded free stalls provides cows with a better resting surface resulting in lower incidence of lameness and hock lesions compared to herds that use mattresses endres straw is often used to bed our young stock due to its absorbency and insulating properties research shows that cows prefer straw that is of a smaller particle size 3 4 inch which increases comfort and absorbency and improves composting ability during disposed tucker 2009 straw is a low cost bedding choice if produced on the farm cows housed in straw bedding tend to be dirtier compared to other bedding materials and because of this the incidence of mastitis increases if the farm is located close to a paper mill paper may be available inexpensively as another bedding option chopped recycled newsprint has also been used for dairy bedding both can be effectively mixed with other bedding materials this bedding type is not effective when used alone due to the poor absorbency properties typically animals bedded with paper also tend to be dirtier compared to other bedding materials one popular inorganic bedding material on the market is sand sand is economical improves cleanliness of cows and has advantages for leg and hoof health when considering udder health sand is preferred because it does not promote pathogen growth however when mixed with manure pathogen growth can still occur sand has rounded edges and is cooler providing more comfort for cows especially during periods of heat stress particle size is important because sand that is smaller in particle size will hold water well and larger particle sized sand is not as comfortable for cows to lie on the ideal particle size for sand bedding is between 0 1 and 2 0 mm a depth of 6 to 8 inches in a free stall is recommended for cow comfort softness and molding an advantage of sand compared to other beddings is that it can be recycled and reused sand also provides excellent traction for cows to reduce slipping on wet concrete floors but it is also abrasive to concrete and other mechanical equipment a downside to sand is handling many manure storage systems are not designed to handle sand and it should not be spread onto fields additionally sand bedded stalls can become compacted without proper grooming every bedding type has pros and cons but these pros and cons can differ from farm to farm depending on the barn layout when considering the best bedding choice for a dairy operation evaluate the pros and cons and decide which satisfies both cow comfort and farm management needs without proper management of the bedding material that is chosen a low somatic cell count will never be achieved attention to cow prep at milking time is very crucial no matter what bedding type your farm is using producers can be successful at maintaining a low scc when using any bedding type when paired with excellent cow preparation at milking time sanitation of milking equipment cow hygiene adequate dry cow housing and bedding stall management image courtesy of penn state extension

new york ap at a gas station outside new york city retired probation officer karen stowe was faced with a pump price she didn t want to pay she bought groceries from the convenience store instead planning to buy cheaper gas elsewhere the price is so high people have to think very hard about where they re driving to said stowe who had just been volunteering at a food pantry people are in trouble and that s the truth though drivers in the u s europe and elsewhere are getting a break from the sky high gasoline prices they endured during the summer the cost is still difficult for many who have been struggling with relentless inflation the u s average was 3 19 per gallon down from a record 5 in june while european union pump prices have dropped the equivalent of 55 cents to 6 41 per gallon since october drivers now hope the situation doesn t get worse after a series of cutbacks tied to russia s war in ukraine accidents and the slowing global economy have strained the world s oil supply while oil and gasoline prices have dropped despite a recent supply crunch those threats could end up pushing costs higher this winter what s the world facing an eu ban on imports of most russian oil took effect last week at the same time the group of seven leading democracies and 27 nation eu capped the price of russian crude for other countries at 60 per barrel there was a major leak along the keystone pipeline in the u s which halted oil shipments along a major corridor dozens of oil tankers were stuck in turkey for days the opec coalition of oil producers has cut back production the global system can withstand probably a few more days of these outages but if they persist they re going to play a major role in price hikes said claudio galimberti senior vice president of analysis at rystad energy a key reason restrictions on oil supply have not sent prices higher traders think there will be less demand for oil in the future due to fears that the global economy is headed into recession which would mean less driving and manufacturing and some investors worry china s looser covid 19 restrictions could backfire for the nation s economy it can quickly turn into a major covid wave which engulfs the hospitals and then is going to have a worse effect on demand than covid policy galimberti said the restrictions on russian exports are likely to have a bigger impact on oil prices next month although western nations have banned russian oil customers in india and china are buying it so there s enough oil on the market for those who need it more than 97 percent of russia s seaborne crude exports went to china and india last month according to refinitiv a financial market data provider we do not ask our companies to buy russian oil we ask them to buy oil indian external affairs minister subrahmanyam jaishankar said in parliament last week but it is a sensible policy to go where we get the best deal in the interest of indian people and that s exactly what we are trying to do in february global oil supply could get more limited because european nations won t be able to buy russian refined products such as gasoline and diesel so russia could cut back on producing oil so far there hasn t been a major decline in russian production but once russia cannot export products to europe they will need to decrease production and that will result in a supply shortage which will be reflected in the prices most likely galimberti said russia also could decide not to produce oil due to the g 7 price cap its oil is selling for less than that now but if the price goes up and approaches the cap russia could decide to take oil off the market analysts said there s another shoe to drop on that front said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners the price cap will lock in a discount on russian oil especially in light of the 100 per barrel russia earned just a few months ago white house press secretary karine jean pierre said we are focused on limiting putin s ability to profit from rising prices to fund his illegal war while promoting stable global energy markets jean pierre said this is not about russian oil off the market this is about the cap the cap at this level maintains clear incentives for russia to continue exporting and we believe that it should international standard brent crude oil was selling for about 80 a barrel friday that s likely to grow to 92 per barrel on average next year according to projections by the u s energy information administration that is still below 125 seen this summer when it comes

that inflation indexed linked bonds are a very important asset class that serves a crucial role in allowing canadian investors to manage their exposure to inflation and in a well functioning market provides central banks and markets participants with an important measure of inflation expectations the group said in the minutes of its nov 29 meeting which the bank of canada published on its website on dec 16 with the decision to eliminate new rrb issuance market participants lost a way to express their inflation views and some members enunciated that the decision may create a perception that the government may not have full confidence in containing inflation canada is now the only g7 country not issuing new sovereign inflation index linked bonds minutes the minutes clearly state that bank of canada officials recused themselves from the discussion of rrbs because the central bank manages the federal government s debt strategy the members from bay street on the other hand appear to have shown up for the meeting in a mood to vent their frustrations with a decision that few saw coming for retail and institutional investors the cancellation removes a risk free security that helps them manage short and longer term inflation risks the minutes said several members noted that demand for rrbs has increased across the curve in the current higher inflationary environment and is expected to increase further with the aging of the canadian population they also point to the fact that canada is now the only g7 country not issuing new sovereign inflation index linked bonds top

includes 15 people including representatives from toronto dominion bank bank of nova scotia canadian imperial bank of commerce bank of america and canadian national railway co s investing division inflation protected debt is an important part of the modern financial system because financial institutions base their lending on the price and availability of risk free assets that didn t stop freeland from abruptly cancelling the government of canada s real return bond program with little explanation in her november fiscal update the government has decided to cease issuance of real return bonds effective immediately the finance department said in an update to its debt management strategy this decision reflects low demand for this product and will allow the government to promote liquidity by consolidating funding within our core funding sectors advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content low demand probably was related to the long period of muted inflation that followed the great recession central banks kept benchmark interest rates pinned near zero for the better part of a decade out of fear that weak economic growth could morph into protracted disinflation there was little need for investors to pay extra to hedge against inflation when there was none but the backdrop has now changed canada s headline inflation surged to 8 1 per cent in june and continues to hover around seven per cent the highest levels since the early 1980s members disagreed that liquidity for rrbs was an issue material enough to cancel the program the minutes said most noted that while it is somewhat worse than liquidity for nominal government of canada bonds they are still able to transact in quantities they need some members felt that rrb liquidity is generally better relative to inflation index linked bonds in several other jurisdictions for example the u k recommended from editorial kevin carmichael the failure at the bank of canada that likely made inflation worse here s where david dodge thinks the economy and the central bank are heading next advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the minutes on the discussion related to rrbs took up an entire page while most other concerns required only a paragraph many members of the committee expressed major concern over a lack of consultation and transparency around why the decision was made one member said finance had just completed a consultation on the debt strategy and no questions about ending the rrb program were asked members described the characterization of rrbs in the fiscal update as overly negative and an inaccurate reflection of bay street s views the committee unanimously agreed that freeland should reconsider as the sudden scrapping of rrbs in the wake of the government s unexpected decision to stop issuing ultra long bonds earlier this year could undermine confidence in the market for canadian debt some members felt that freeland s handling of the government s debt strategy could lead to less demand or participation in the whole government of canada bond market going forward and ultimately resulting in higher borrowing costs for the government than any potential cost saving it could get with the cessation of rrb issuance for now the government is unmoved by the complaints and criticism demand for this sector is too low to justify maintaining it marie france faucher a spokesperson for the finance department said in an email the government undertook extensive consultations in 2019 which showed poor demand for real return bonds this was reinforced in recent debt management strategy consultations email

though drivers in the u s europe and elsewhere are getting a break from the sky high gasoline prices they endured over the summer the cost is still difficult for many who have been struggling with relentless inflation the u s average was 3 19 per gallon down from a record 5 in june while european union pump prices have dropped the equivalent of 55 cents to 6 41 per gallon since october drivers now hope the situation doesn t get worse after a series of cutbacks tied to russia s war in ukraine accidents and the slowing global economy have strained the world s oil supply while oil and gasoline prices have dropped despite a recent supply crunch those threats could end up pushing costs higher this winter what s the world facing a new eu ban on imports of most russian oil at the same time the group of seven leading democracies and 27 nation eu capped the price of russian crude for other countries at 60 per barrel there was a major leak along the keystone pipeline in the u s which halted oil shipments along a major corridor dozens of oil tankers were stuck in turkey for days the opec coalition of oil producers has cut back production the global system can withstand probably a few more days of these outages but if they persist they re going to play a major role in price hikes said claudio galimberti senior vice president of analysis at rystad energy a key reason restrictions on oil supply have not sent prices higher traders think there will be less demand for oil in the future due to fears that the global economy is headed into recession which would mean less driving and manufacturing and some investors worry china s looser covid 19 restrictions could backfire for the nation s economy it can quickly turn into a major covid wave which engulfs the hospitals and then is going to have a worse effect on demand than covid policy galimberti said the restrictions on russian exports are likely to have a bigger impact on oil prices next month although western nations have banned russian oil customers in india and china are buying it so there s enough oil on the market for those who need it more than 97 of russia s seaborne crude exports went to china and india last month according to refinitiv a financial market data provider we do not ask our companies to buy russian oil we ask them to buy oil indian external affairs minister subrahmanyam jaishankar said in parliament recently but it is a sensible policy to go where we get the best deal in the interest of indian people and that s exactly what we are trying to do in february global oil supply could get more limited because european nations won t be able to buy russian refined products such as gasoline and diesel so russia could cut back on producing oil so far there hasn t been a major decline in russian production but once russia cannot export products to europe they will need to decrease production and that will result in a supply shortage which will be reflected in the prices most likely galimberti said russia also could decide not to produce oil due to the g 7 price cap its oil is selling for less than that now but if the price goes up and approaches the cap russia could decide to take oil off the market analysts said there s another shoe to drop on that front said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners the price cap will lock in a discount on russian oil especially in light of the 100 per barrel russia earned just a few months ago white house press secretary karine jean pierre said we are focused on limiting putin s ability to profit from rising prices to fund his illegal war while promoting stable global energy markets jean pierre said this is not about russian oil off the market this is about the cap the cap at this level maintains clear incentives for russia to continue exporting and we believe that it should international standard brent crude oil was selling for about 80 a barrel friday that s likely to grow to 92 per barrel on average next year according to projections by the u s energy information administration that is still below 125 seen this summer when it comes to prices at the pump they re lower than they were last year but americans have paid 2 to 3 per gallon for most of the last decade according to aaa data in the eu where taxes account for a larger share of the cost of gasoline prices fell to 1 65 euros per liter 6 41 per gallon as of dec 12 from 1 80 euros per liter 6 96 per gallon at the end of october according to figures from the bloc s executive commission

a health worker takes a woman s pcr test sample in shanghai china 12 december 2022 china eased anti covid 19 measures last week by abandoning pcr test requirements for most public places and allowing asymptomatic cases and people with mild symptoms to isolate at home from 13 december the itinerary card will be shut down for the first time after more than two years communications itinerary card was used for tracing the travel history of people in the country epa efe alex plavevski president xi jinping and other politburo members and senior government figures had been expected to attend the closed door central economic work conference most likely this week to chart a policy course for the embattled chinese economy in 2023 a bloomberg news report on tuesday night citing people familiar with the matter said the meeting had been delayed and there was no timetable for rescheduling the delay comes as authorities continue to overturn the previously resolute zero covid policy championed by xi long queues are appearing outside fever clinics in a worrying sign that a wave of infections is building even though official tallies of new cases have dropped in recent weeks as authorities reduce testing and companies in china from e commerce giant jd com to cosmetics brand sephora are rushing to minimise the impact of surging infections doling out test kits encouraging more work from home and in some cases procuring truckloads of medicine the signs come as china attempts to swiftly align with a world that has largely reopened following unprecedented protests last month in china three years into the pandemic the protests were the strongest show of public defiance during xi s decade old presidency and come amid growth figures for china s 17 trillion economy that were some of the worst in 50 years despite rising infections people in china cheered the withdrawal on tuesday of a state mandated app used to track whether they had travelled to covid stricken areas as authorities deactivated the itinerary code app at midnight on monday china s four telecoms firms said they would delete users data associated with the app goodbye itinerary code i hope to never see you again said a post on social media platform weibo where people cheered the demise of an app that critics feared could be used for mass surveillance the hand that stretched out to exert power during the epidemic should now be pulled back wrote another user and in a further sign of policy easing chinese healthcare company 111 inc has started selling pfizer s paxlovid for covid 19 treatment in china via its app medicine previously only available in some hospitals it sold out just over half an hour after the listing was reported by local media according to the platform s customer service for all the relief over last week s decision to begin overturning the government s zero covid policy there are fears that china may now pay a price infections are expected to rise further during the chinese new year holiday next month when people travel across the country to be with their families a risk for a 1 4 billion population that lacks herd immunity and has relatively low vaccination rates among the elderly according to some analysts the moves made last week to unwind the covid 19 curbs included dropping mandatory testing prior to many public activities and reining in quarantine hong kong relaxes beijing s envoy to the united states on monday said he believes china s covid 19 measures will be further relaxed in the near future and international travel to the country will also become easier china has all but shut its borders to international travel since the pandemic first erupted in the central chinese city of wuhan in later 2019 international flights are still at a fraction of pre pandemic levels and arrivals face eight days in quarantine financial hub hong kong which already has less stringent border controls than mainland china on tuesday said it would drop a requirement for incoming travellers to avoid bars and restaurants in the three days after arrival hong kong will also scrap its mobility tracking app governing access to restaurants and venues such as gyms clubs and salons chief executive john lee said while the lifting of controls is seen as brightening the prospects for global growth longer term analysts say chinese businesses will struggle in the weeks ahead as a wave of infections creates staff shortages and makes consumers wary analysts say the decline in reported new cases could reflect the dropping of testing requirements rather than the actual situation on the ground the rapid surge of infections in big cities might be only the beginning of a massive wave of covid 19 infections said ting lu chief china economist at nomura we reckon that the incoming migration around the chinese new year holiday in late january could bring about an unprecedented spread of covid 19 experts say china s fragile healthcare system could be quickly overwhelmed if those fears are realised in beijing empty seats on commuter trains and deserted restaurants highlight some people s caution maybe other people are afraid or are worried about kids and grandparents health it s a personal choice gao lin a 33 year old financier told reuters china stocks csi300 edged lower on tuesday as a recent rebound triggered by reopening hopes gave way to

see the open secrets volume 2 corporations and economic crime report cecr see last week s instalment here of the big four kpmg pwc and deloitte have all been publicly implicated in instances of corporate fraud and state capture in south africa ey has not been in our local headlines as such one might assume that ey formerly ernst young is the more trustworthy of the four that is until one examines the international financial media there you find a laundry list of illicit dealings by the firm including allegations of fraud tax evasion money laundering sexism and whistle blower intimidation then there s the wirecard scam europe s biggest corporate fraud since the end of world war ii the daily revelations about the dodgy dealings of the fintech company have led many to wonder whether its long term auditor and consultant ey was complicit in the scam it has also added to the urgent calls for immediate reform of the auditing profession germany s enron on 25 june 2020 wirecard the german multinational payments processing company filed for bankruptcy yet just a few weeks earlier on 2 june its long time auditor ey had given it a clean bill of health in a draft opinion according to the draft opinion given to wirecard and obtained by the financial times ft ey concluded based on the findings of our audit the attached annual financial statements comply in all material respects with german commercial law applicable to corporations and give a true and fair view of the net assets and financial position of the company ey s draft opinion rejected allegations made by a wirecard whistle blower and the findings of a special audit by kpmg conducted at the request of wirecard the allegations backed up by reports from the ft were that profits at wirecard s key third party acquirers tpas in dubai singapore and the philippines in particular were fraudulently inflated tpas are businesses licenced by a big payment network like visa or mastercard to help businesses accept credit card transactions there were also allegations that wirecard provided fake customer names to ey the allegations were true ultimately ey had missed a 1 9 billion hole in wirecard s finances when it filed for insolvency wirecard admitted that the 1 9 billion supposedly held in third party bank accounts simply did not exist despite the extent and depth of the fraud ey gave wirecard unqualified audits for a decade as more is revealed about the inner workings of wirecard including the alleged dodgy dealings of its russian intelligence affiliated chief operating officer jan marsalek it is emerging that the company had long been operating a scam using fake sale transactions to inflate its revenue and profits there were many signs of fraud which a sceptical auditor should have picked up on according to ft as early as 2008 the head of a german shareholder association was questioning wirecard s spurious accounts in 2015 the ft began reporting on unverifiable financial records of wirecard in its house of wirecard series furthermore several short sellers including jim chanos kynikos associates had started shorting wirecard s stock following whistle blower allegations of accounting fraud at wirecard wirecard fired back at short sellers and the ft claiming that they were attempting to manipulate its share price ft journalists dan mccrum and stefania palma reported active surveillance following their reporting on wirecard wirecard was backed by the german financial regulator the federal financial supervisory authority known as bafin bafin responded by banning the shorting of wirecard s stock and initiated a criminal investigation into ft and its journalists for market manipulation and unethical reporting bafin like so many financial regulators chose to protect the interests of the corporations it was tasked with regulating spending most of its energy pursuing the actors who were seeking to reveal criminality this suspect behaviour by the regulator has prompted a separate investigation in the aftermath of wirecard s insolvency short selling or going short is betting that the share price of a company will go down a short seller borrows the shares stocks in the hopes that the price will go down so that once it does they make a profit short sellers buy a stock and then sell them immediately at the current market price then when the stock declines in value they buy them back from the lender at the new significantly lower price investors will often short a stock if they identify that the company is misrepresenting its finances and overstating its value to allay concerns about its accounting wirecard commissioned a forensic audit by kpmg in 2019 the report released by kpmg in april 2020 revealed how wirecard s management had after contracting the investigation undermined it at every turn they stymied attempts to acquire the contracts account statements and bank confirmations of its tpas and commercial partners for the periods 2016 2018 the period that was the subject of the investigation these were where the accounts which wirecard claimed held the 1 9 billion were it has since been revealed that for the three years in question ey was similarly unable to access these documents for verification purposes but that they were reassured by the wirecard management board s assessment measures this is highly questionable conduct for an independent auditor professional standards require auditors to use professional scepticism and a questioning mind when analysing the finances of a company verifying bank balances is considered auditing 101 an independent auditor should not simply rely on the word or assessments of executives who have a vested interest in obfuscating fraud this is particularly the case in the context of numerous allegations of such fraud from internal whistle blowers and financial journalists ey s failed audits of wirecard thus indicate either complicity or negligence both which paint the firm in a negative light where were the auditors where they always are of course at the heart of the meltdown the fraudulent accounting practices at wirecard and the machismo of its ceo former kpmg auditor markus braun and its cfo jan marsalek alleged russian intelligence affiliate and arms dealer have led to the scam being referred to as germany s enron the collapse of the us energy giant enron revealed massive corporate fraud and how deeply embedded its auditor arthur andersen had become in enron andersen not only failed to report the company s overstated profits and money laundering by executives but when us investigators started closing in on the vast fraud at enron its senior audit partner ordered the immediate destruction of physical and electronic documents this spelt the beginning of the end for the firm despite what should have been a crucial learning curve for the auditing industry and their regulators audit firms have continued in many instances to rubber stamp inaccurate financial statements aiming to please clients rather than preserve the interests of shareholders and ultimately of the economies in which the public and private companies they audit operate every time a fraud this massive is uncovered the first question asked is where were the auditors to this enron and wirecard short seller jim chanos replies who cares almost every fraud has been audited by a major accounting firm therein lies the auditing industry s biggest crisis credibility ey s litany of irregularities wirecard is one in an ever growing list of ey s accounting irregularities in 2008 us corporate giant lehman brothers investment bank declared bankruptcy from 2001 until its collapse it had employed ey as its independent external auditor like at wirecard ey maintained a long term relationship with lehman brothers but also provided advisory services as consultants during its tenure at lehman ey oversaw a process in which the bank began using repo 105 an unorthodox financing transaction that allowed the bank to look like it was in better financial health than it really was ey not only failed to disclose this to the lehman brothers board but failed to flag the bank s impaired assets ey also did not inform the bank s audit committee that a senior vice president in lehman s financial division had raised red flags about the firm s use of repo 105 there is evidence that ey ignores whistle blowers even when they are senior ey employees former ey partner amjad rihan alerted ey of money laundering and compliance failures by one of ey s clients kaloti the largest gold refinery in the united arab emirates a uk court awarded rihan 10 8 million due to being forced out of the firm following his whistleblowing ey was also found to have colluded with dubai authorities to cover up the damaging findings that kaloti jewellery international was involved in laundering billions of dollars in cash ey has also been caught up in possibly the biggest economic crime of all time danske bank s 230 billion money laundering scheme the scam implicated a number of banks linked to danske in february 2019 after being implicated in danske s money laundering swedbank hired ey a mere five days later swedbank had no choice but to fire ey when it emerged that ey was also under investigation for its own role in the danske scandal swedbank would learn that it could not rely on the services of any of the other big four firms or another audit firm grant thornton between 2010 and 2014 danske bank had switched between grant thornton pwc kpmg deloitte and ey ostensibly to ensure quality by rotating auditors not one of these firms identified or reported the extensive evidence of money laundering and suspicious transactions through danske s estonian branch they all signed off unqualified audits the independence conundrum in 2019 the uk s regulator the financial reporting council frc reported that none of the big four firms had surpassed the 90 target that classifies audits as good quality one of the reasons for declining audit quality is the long term relationships that auditors build with their clients ey s relationships with lehman brothers and wirecard are testament to this in most economies the big four are the only auditing firms large enough to audit big multinational corporations and state owned enterprises this leads to extremely high market concentration in south africa 96 of the companies on the jse are audited by one of the big four and many of these relationships are long standing most of these firms employ members of the big four as consultants as well while audit rotation will soon be mandatory in south africa the danske scandal is proof that rotation is not enough to fix the problem the dual role of the big four as consultants and auditors results in an independence conundrum that is the commercially lucrative consultancy services compromise the credibility of the auditing side of the firm a notable decline in the quality of audits performed by the big four suggests that the big four are failing to strike and maintain the balance between auditing and consulting the public cost the public cost of audit failure is immense it has resulted in job losses the failure of several large corporations and vast losses for pensioners and other investors deloitte s conduct at steinhoff and tongaat hulett are south african examples of a global phenomenon former ey client lehman brothers collapse was seen as the catalyst in the sub prime mortgage scandal that precipitated the global financial crisis the financial contagion led to extensive job losses an economic downturn and enforced austerity across the globe lehman brothers became a symbol of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the unbridled impact of mega corporations on the livelihoods of ordinary people despite all of this neither ey nor lehman has been sufficiently held to account for their conduct ey settled one case with the new york attorney general for 10 million they also settled a class action suit brought by investors for 99 million despite paying what are tiny penalties for a firm worth over 30 billion ey has not admitted any wrongdoing and has not divulged the full extent of its advisory services for lehman brothers it remains to be seen if european regulators will hold them to account for wirecard closer to home in south africa the public still impatiently waits for accountability for the executives of steinhoff and tongaat hulett and a full independent investigation into how deloitte got the audits of both companies so wrong ey s escapades in europe and the united states show that the impunity enjoyed by powerful corporations like the big four is a global phenomenon as the world hurtles deeper into the twin crises of the covid 19 pandemic and the economic recession the wirecard saga unravels and envelops institutions and individuals across several jurisdictions from europe asia and north america and even to south africa where wirecard has a subsidiary in cape town the profound impacts of the collapse of wirecard will be felt across the world it is thus imperative that this time the bean counters bear full accountability for the global misery their negligence and complicity causes ey cannot continue to be

to many the recent virulent attacks and counter attacks by top nigerian journalists served a la carte to the world in the last two weeks are indications of an autumn for journalism practice in nigeria nigerians have thus been treated to a disgraceful brew of damaging and ignoble exchanges from these media warlords the public spat has made nigerians to call to question the integrity of their media practitioners to them the media space in the name of politics has become a hostile jungle revealing the patent biases of its practitioners in the coverage of society three warlords are at the centre of this spat they are bayo onanuga dele alake and nduka obaigbena except for obaigbena publisher of the thisday newspaper whose current political leaning is a subject of intense guess work the other two have apparently gone to thessalonica as biblical paul awaited execution he lamented how demas his friend and associate had forsaken him because he loves the things of this life and has gone to thessalonica thessalonica signifies the world of perfidy judging by its abhorrence of partisanship journalism profession seems to be shawled in lamentations today at the apostasy of these barons because they love the things of this life to be fair to both alake and onanuga they possess lofty pedigree of media practice after graduating in mass communication from the university of lagos in 1980 onanuga worked with the ogun state television where he began practice he moved to the guardian and thereafter to the national concord and african concord magazine before finally founding thenews tempo magazine as well as p m news in 2014 onanuga opted to contest the ogun east district senatorial ticket of the all progressives congress apc an ambition which got botched he thereafter became the dg of nan alake s media foray is not totally dissimilar from onanuga s after a degree in political science from the university of lagos and an internship with the ogun state broadcasting corporation ogbc he joined the lagos state broadcasting corporation lsbc as senior sub editor but in 1985 joined business mogul mko abiola s concord group of newspapers wherein in 1989 he was appointed editor of sunday concord and in 1995 editor of the national concord he held this post till june 1999 when then governor of lagos state bola tinubu appointed him information commissioner since then alake has literally gone to thessalonica away from journalism he is implicated in virtually every sub media construction deconstruction and misconstruction of the tinubu perspectives in the nigerian media in 2010 alake also made an attempt to contest the senatorial seat of his ekiti state home s central district but retreated in the heat of defeat staring him in the face onanuga and alake are today major sharks in the tinubu media ocean in his bid to clinch the nigerian presidency in the 2023 election having been appointed presidential campaign council s pcc director of media and publicity and director strategic communication respectively advertisement the two have escalated their defence of public angst and disgust at their principal tinubu s peremptory gaffes at public events locating these gaffes at the doorsteps of a claimed disaffection obaigbena and his media group have for tinubu while the gaffes and speech incoherence have made many to submit that tinubu either lacks the mythical depth attributed to him by his lieutenants over the years or is suffering from an unnamed mental disconnect onanuga and alake have pursued the narrative that tinubu is neither of both obaigbena s group has however doubled down in an overarching manner on the need for public scrutiny of both claims two journalists in the obaigbena arise television group highly respected reuben abati and oseni rufai have been held as culprits by the tinubu group common sense should have dictated that the path to walk was to address the fears that tinubu if elected would be a worse replica of nigeria s current infirmary bound president this view if they care to investigate is ten a dime on nigerian streets rather onanuga and alake have sought to make a victim of tinubu insisting that the arise group s invitation to him to attend a town hall debate it organized was designed to embarrass tinubu the result is that both onanuga and alake have gone very low in their pursuit of this mindset this they did by dwelling on what they claimed was obaigbena s crooked media dealings they have since vowed never to make available our candidate to validate a scheme which they said in the light of unassailable information at our disposal is nothing but a racket by the arise tv owner designed to embarrass our candidate apart from their gambit to criminalize scrutiny into tinubu s past and any demand for him to attend any presidential debate onanuga and alake s plan is to make obaigbena abati oseni and their thisday and arise tv media worthless to the public giving them the dan rather treatment before the 2023 election rather a cbs news icon in september 2004 fell to his own and foibles a few months to the presidential election of that year he had commented on some documents that were critical of president george bush s air national guard service the bush internet bloggers within minutes went into action and documents presented by rather as forged rather s thirty three year long career on cbs came crashing and his worth reduced to the basest advertisement in response to arise s demand of satisfactory answer to the circumstances surrounding the forfeiture of funds to the us government by tinubu in an alleged chicago drug dealing onanuga and alake went into the abyss of argumentative fallacies they regurgitated irrelevant traits alleged to be their opponents and attacking their personal matters for instance they claimed that the thisday founder owes taxes abroad and is a slave driver while i am yet to know whether their principal s media house is free of these charges i submit that these are different and irrelevant matters entirely to the riveting allegation that is expected of them to defend the truth is that the nigerian public is wary of an impending inclination to elect a drug peddler as president and needs clinical answers to queries on tinubu what to do methinks is to offer documentary unassailable evidence of tinubu being above board but as it is known with ad hominine arguments onanuga and alake chose to deal in the person of their victims again they committed what is called the strawman fallacy in argument when rather than provide irrefutable evidence that tinubu didn t do drugs they brought out a third party buruji kashamu who became their referent and his association with abati an apt response to the chicago drug allegation is abati running for the nigerian presidency is association immoral criminal or both so if every association is immoral how does one rate their own association with tinubu does it make them guilty of all moral criminal drawbacks that tinubu has been alleged to be complicit of one error made by the public is to see erstwhile practitioners of media in the same mould as when they were active in the profession these are persons who have entered into liaison with politically exposed persons yoruba call this the horrific error of viewing the dead same way as they were when alive the punishment for this error yoruba say of this error is a call on the gnome the ebora to de robe such ignoramus it is thus a great blunder to refer to the three main musketeers at the centre of the debate on the role of the media in these shameful exchanges as journalists dog tenders know that the moment a dog tastes blood it is ripe to be excised from tame animals onanuga alake and obaigbena can no longer be referred to as journalists in the true sense of it judging by their current preoccupation they can conveniently be referred to as merchants of news who merchandize and have a consumeric relationship with news and journalism at the least they are journal preneurs if there is anything so called i have always maintained that the moment a journalist columnist or even an activist bails out of active practice and mingles with politicians they most times lose their erstwhile objectivity the people who used to be their constituency are substituted for the politically exposed persons who are now their employers in this wise it would be tantamount to waiting for godot for society to expect such erstwhile media practitioners to preference the people at the expense of their principals advertisement in the tiff between onanuga and alake on one side and obaigbena on the other ordinary nigerian people are not in their consideration at all it is the warlords bellies businesses political principals and their projected political positions in the federal government that are at issue so when nigerians now obfuscate the issues as if journalism practice is on parade and is implicated it beats me hollow where they are today is comparable to that of a vulture which sees carcass from a purely gourmet point of view and not as a dying creation the exchanges nigerians read from these people are gourmand epistles as is the allegation onanuga and alake leveled against obaigbena most media houses in nigeria and even in other democracies of the world are explicitly linked to particular politicians these politicians are their friends and associates to many others due to economic interests and political association or affiliation of their publishers or owners they are forced to trade in politically tainted views in the process news and opinions reflect those political interests leanings and loyalties and facts are relegated to the background in a chapter in a book entitled reflections on a decade of democratization in nigeria 2010 a project of the german friedrich ebert stiftung foundation edited by prof lai olurode which we entitled a decade of democratization the nigerian press and ethno proprietorial influences authored by prof adigun agbaje and i we submitted that the nigerian media has always been a battleground of interests we looked at how the nigerian press of the first republic was not blameless in the fall of the first and second republic nigeria and how journalists pandering to proprietorial financial and ethnic interests have since the advent of the fourth republic been tossing nigeria right left and centre the strategy of shielding candidates from public scrutiny which alake and his pcc are attempting was same path they trod with buhari as presidential candidate buhari s health and depth limitations were shielded from the nigerian public through all manner of shenanigans by alake as media director in the muhammadu buhari campaign organization in 2014 in company with his colleagues nigerians will be making another huge mistake if they allow a reactivation and effectuation of same strategy it only led us to the buhari doom in our hands so if alake and onanuga feel that the arise tv of obaigbena are attempting to embarrass tinubu which is a valid fear let them bring their principal to the tvc which is public knowledge that he owns for an organized debate the debate must however be coordinated by respected nigerians as anchors tinubu must answer critical enquiries that will help voters evaluate his mental depth cohesion of thoughts and ability to govern nigeria nigerians must refuse to be cowed by onanuga and alake at all advertisement arisetv and thisday group must also proceed from zeroing in on tinubu alone into grilling atiku abubakar and peter obi as well we need to ask abubakar questions about scandals that rocked his time in office in 2007 the guardian of london reported that senators accused abubakar then sitting vice president of diverting more than 100m 51m of public funds into companies he was connected to his boss president oluesgun obasanjo was said to have petitioned the senate a senate inquiry according to the newspaper recommended that abubakar should be prosecuted abubakar office s reply was that the legislative body should not allow its name to be dragged into the mud by a few members who may be pursuing their own hidden agenda a plethora of other allegations especially one flowing from william jefferson and the petroleum trust development fund ptdf scandal which involved atiku abubakar and obasanjo must also be totally explained despite the senate indicting him and obasanjo in the ptdf scandal no action has been taken against them since 2007 it should be same for peter obi allegations of any fraud connected to him must be brought to the public space and he must be made to answer them these two too must be brought to the open by the arise thisday group and indeed on any nigerian media platform we cannot afford to have a country presided over by malefactors and journal preneurs in thessalonica who are prescribing and imposing on us their own brand of the nigerian moral code advertisement what did osun state buy with n407 billion when i was told that osun state s debt stock was n407billion i asked my friends from that state what they bought that sold them to that farm of bankruptcy i had reservations for the personality of the new governor of osun state senator ademola adeleke i felt that yorubaland does not deserve his kind of owambe carriage in leadership but as i wrote earlier i raised my hands up in surrender the day osun people s votes for him were announced to be in tomes it was my own way of showing deference to that ubiquitous mantra called the wishes of the people i however pray that i will someday come back to this platform to praise him and apologize for equating or assuming that pedigree matters in the task of bringing redemption to a beleaguered people advertisement last week however the governor went a step lower in my very unflattering rating of him he did well by talking tough as he assumed power lest anyone hoping to try his will mistake him for a sissy don t forget that the man he took over the mantel of governorship from had the reputation of one with the laudable management of the state s finance in spite of paucity of funds oyetola had announced to the world that he didn t borrow a dime and wasn t owing anyone in a world where we were tutored that indebtedness was a virtue that statement caught nigerians gaping no wonder that adeleke s dissembling arrow was to disorganize this parting kudos in a release issued by him that the press entitled osun is indebted to the tune of n407 32 billion governor adeleke the governor gave details of the debts he inherited he stated that with high sense of responsibility i am reporting to our people through our traditional rulers the total debt profile inherited by my administration from governor oyetola s administration advertisement i am pleased to present to you the official debt profile of osun state as at november 30th 2022 as submitted to me by the accountant general of osun state he said he then went ahead to itemize the debt one after the other and in closing the speech berated those he claimed had mortgaged the future of osun state with nothing to show for it this is definitely not acceptable i was as shocked as anyone that a poor state was that rich in debts what did it buy where are the projects that fetched that humongous debt figure however subsequent rebuttals from the oyetola administration got me thinking could the new governor be merely playing politics with this typecast in a release issued by bola oyebamiji the state s former commissioner for finance oyetola literally tore the governor s claims into shreds alleging that it was a reflection of adeleke s combative and vindictive posture and purely a campaign of calumny against a people centric government bit by bit oyetola repudiated every of adeleke s claim asking that his claim could be affirmed or disputed by the annual auditor general s report and the reports from the debt management office in osun and abuja what later came to the fore was that governor adeleke was pointing his finger at the wrong culprit in trying to put a lie to the allegation that governor oyetola accessed a loan facility of n18billion after losing the july 2022 gubernatorial election the ex commissioner for finance said that the adeleke government would have won an iota of credibility for itself if the details of the loan including the name of the creditor were mentioned that was a major challenge which adeleke should take up if there is any truth in it i am sure i am not the only one interested in getting more words on that from the new government what has not failed to strike the discerning world watching the drama in osun is that adeleke has apparently deliberately tried to whitewash the real judas in that state the questions that then come in are did he or didn t he know who borrowed the said money if he knew was he by that dramatic irony paying his own 30 pieces of silver to osun s judas iscariot by not shaming and naming the real culprits with the graphic picture presented by oyetola s ex finance commissioner about the debt portfolio of osun state including when each loan was taken it is obvious that if adeleke is serious about going after those he called out for mortgaging the future of osun state he only needs to take a trip to abuja not iragbiji the man with a queer administration model in osun rauf aregbesola is obviously the smelly shrew eku asin that adeleke apparently knew but failed to mention because they are now political bedmates facts presented thereafter have shown that aregbesola who was known to revel in inexplicable borrowings and who single handedly mortgaged the future of the state in the process should have been given the back of his tongue by adeleke however political expediency and the governor s iou to aregbesola for the support he gave during the last election made adeleke to speak tongue in cheek unbeknown to him what adeleke did by that gubernatorial inexactitude lest i call a governor a liar was that he helped oyetola to reach for the limelight yet again he afforded him an opportunity to explain his own role in the financial ruination of osun state at every forum i attended where the figures adeleke gave were discussed last week i heard people affirming that oyetola did well by not owing salaries or paying half salaries unlike aregbesola who got billions of naira as salary bailouts from buhari but refused to pay salaries now those diverted bailouts and budget support funds form the core content of the current debt stock of osun state i am one hundred percent in support of adeleke asking questions but the questions must be directed at the right culprits now adeleke should go after the people who by his own admittance sold the future of osun children unborn in a disastrous debt binge how could a barely surviving state like osun be owing that much as if it is delta while adeleke started well by availing the osun public with details of debts he met on ground it was sheer hypocrisy that he did not append the right culprit to it someone said if he had simply announced that the apc government owed that much it would not have raised any uproar i agree because aregbesola s queer penchant for debts when he was governor was legendary also now that adeleke has known the gravity of the debt and the real mastermind he must let the world know whether the procurement of the loans followed due process what it was deployed for and give his people a full disclosure as well as conducting forensic audit into the state s account in any case aregbesola was only yesterday quoted to have admitted taking those long term loan facilities from the federal government which all made up the legendary n407billion the man heartedly dismissed the huge loans as posing no threats to the state because the repayment periods spread over decades some as far as the year 2046 imagine that how many years from now is that generations of innocent children will pay debts which they know nothing about now that the right culprit has been found for the debts i hope to begin my growing fondness for adeleke this i will do when i hear him readdressing the state naming and shaming the debt baron and admitting his gaffe he should find out how the opon imo nonsense and other elephant projects constituted the serpentine journey of no return called the n407 billion debts he should ask aregbesola to explain what he did with the hundreds of billions from the federal government which constitute the bulk of the almost half a billion naira debt he should also say sorry to oyetola for calling him a name that belonged to rauf aregbesola i should also say that oyetola too should apologise to the people of osun state for spending his entire four years covering up the evil of his predecessor who mortgaged the fortune of the state or maybe what oyetola suffers today is the punishment for not speaking up and doing the right thing when he should and for not doing justice on the debts without fear or favour a lesson there for all

four major u s defense contractors sponsored a washington d c party for the 31st anniversary of the ukrainian armed forces as they stand to gain billions from the ongoing war in ukraine according to a report vox reported saturday that the celebration hosted by the ukrainian embassy last week took place in downtown d c at the ronald reagan building and international trade center located less than a mile from the white house and that chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen mark milley was in attendance the invitation said the event was supported by northrop grumman raytheon pratt whitney and lockheed martin their logos emblazoned on the invite reportedly prompting some observers to laugh out loud it s really bizarre to me that they would put that on an invitation a think tank expert told vox s jonathan guyer an academic also told guyer the fact that they don t feel sheepish about it that s interesting the explicit sponsorship indicates how intimate major military contractors have become with ukraine and how much they stand to gain from the war guyer wrote adding the invitation is a clear expression of how the war in ukraine has been good for business as ukraine fights a defensive war against russia s brutal invasion ukrainians in washington have been pushing for the us to send ukraine more weapons so far president joe biden s administration has committed a substantial 19 3 billion of military assistance since february the four companies sponsoring the party produce missile defense systems and anti tank missiles that the biden administration has poured into ukraine since russia invaded in february 2022 defense contractors stocks have soared since the war began lockheed stock is up 38 percent according to vox the companies either declined to comment or did not respond to queries from vox the ukrainian embassy however was not shy about publicizing the event on their facebook page they posted photos from the event including one of milley along with a post that said ukrainian armed forces day in washington an opportunity to once again remind the world about the courage and the price paid by ukraine for shared democratic values a chance to express gratitude to our strategic partners for profound aid to ukraine and the u s leadership for creation international coalition to support our country according to the post deputy assistant secretary of defense for russia ukraine and eurasia laura cooper was in attendance as well as other defense white house and congressional officials international military attachés and representatives of the defense industry and the ukrainian community a former sen bernie sanders i vt adviser told vox that defense contractors sponsoring a party for ukrainian forces who they are essentially profiting from is a bad look sustaining american popular support is absolutely essential for ukraine s continued defense matt duss who is now a carnegie endowment for international peace fellow said so ukrainian diplomats should probably think harder about how it looks for them to be throwing parties with the defense contractors who are making bank off of this horrible war bill hartung a researcher at the quincy institute for responsible statecraft told vox i can t imagine another situation where the contractors would sponsor an event for a country that they re arming in the middle of a war hartung added it s one thing to support ukraine to defend itself which i think is certainly legitimate but i think the companies want to go beyond that they want to cash in on this reputationally the companies stand to benefit in the long term from the war as the u s seeks to replenish its stocks sent to ukraine and as european nations want to boost theirs the biden administration has said it will support ukraine in its fight against russia for as long as it takes congress has passed 68 billion in taxpayer funds for overall aid for ukraine just this year alone and could pass tens of billions more before the year s end the biden administration has asked congress for 38 billion more before the end of the year anticipating that republicans may tighten spending on ukraine when they take control in january follow breitbart news s kristina wong on twitter truth social or on facebook
by jack metzgar every time i hear that we as a nation cannot afford something whether that might be assuring non toxic water in jackson and flint or universal pre k or an industrial policy with teeth i have wondered how many dollars a national wealth tax might yield so i looked the numbers up wealth turns out to run way bigger than income our total u s wealth in 2021 sat at 150 trillion total income combining personal income and company profits amounted to about 25 trillion a small wealth tax would clearly produce much more government revenue than a much larger income tax like income wealth in the united states remains highly concentrated the wealthiest 1 percent of americans hold about one third of that 150 trillion in u s wealth that comes to 50 trillion twice the total annual income of all americans everyone from the millions of workers making less than 15 an hour to the corporate executives making multiple millions again you don t need an algorithm to figure out that even a tiny wealth tax on the top 1 percent could produce as much or more than a large income tax on everybody a modest national wealth tax could solve a lot of problems and fund a lot of common good even if that tax only somewhat reduced our savage economic inequality senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders have offered pioneering proposals to introduce national wealth taxes to the united states critics have raised various objections to these proposals collecting a wealth tax would prove impractical some charge others say that taxing wealth at the federal level would be unconstitutional senator warren has convincingly addressed these objections but i d just like to add one point taxing wealth would provide a nearly inexhaustible source of government revenue collecting that revenue may well hit some administrative or political obstacles but overcoming those obstacles would be well worth the effort don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free let s look at what a 1 percent wealth tax on our top 1 percent could buy and then see how much pain and suffering that levy would impose on those who would pay the tax a 1 percent wealth tax on the top 1 percent would produce 500 billion a year in revenue or 5 trillion over the 10 year budget calculation demanded of federal legislation that 500 billion could buy something like a revolution in child rearing president biden s original build back better proposal had elements of such a revolution but never won full funding because implementing family friendly policies will always be so damned expensive with a 1 percent tax on the top 1 percent we could meet that expense here s what a plan concentrated on helping children and making parenting more manageable could do with a 1 percent on the 1 percent tax from build back better annual cost 10 year cost expanded child tax credit 160 billion 1 6 trillion childcare subsidies and universal pre k 125 billion 1 25 trillion paid family leave 20

from 1 percent on the 1 percent tax of 500 billion 122 billion 1 22 trillion sources congressional budget office committee for a responsible federal budget cnbc this package would provide 3 000 per child for virtually all parents save an average of 11 000 for those now using day care for pre schoolers and open up employment opportunities for those parents with pre schoolers who cannot now afford day care this would all be great for children s academic psychological and social development and would transform the economics of parenting most especially for low and moderate income families senator booker s baby bonds would create and seed a savings account of 1 000 at the birth of every child in the united states and then add up to 2 000 each year depending on household income the funds would earn income that would not be available for the children until they reach 18 at that point they could use the money for education to buy a home start a business or continue as a retirement account taken as a whole this package would cut child poverty by more than half greatly improve general educational levels over time and immediately provide substantial support for families during their most challenging years for managing both time and money a modest wealth tax could provide all this benefit with money left over to do still more common good but at what cost how much harm would a wealth tax do to those elite few who would have to pay the tax as illustrated below the amount individuals would pay in wealth taxes would indeed be very hefty often running into the millions even billions of dollars but in most years and on average america s top 1 percent would continue to get wealthier even with this wealth tax in effect given that the s p 500 s annual average stock market return since 1957 has topped 11 percent a mere 1 percent tax on wealth would amount to little more than a rounding error for anyone in the top 1 percent the impact of a 1 wealth tax on the top 1

producing 2 trillion a year in revenues based on current levels of wealth or we could tax higher levels of wealth at higher percentages as senator warren proposes with tax rates on billionaires reaching 6 percent even at those higher rates the wealthy would go on getting wealthier but taxing the wealth of these wealthy would open a cornucopia of public capital to invest in addressing our multitude of problems and in bettering working people s lives don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free by not taxing wealth we are failing to tap by far the largest

scientists are experimenting with seaweed as well as concoctions having several other ingredients to make the specialised digestive system of livestock release less methane but much still needs to be done avijit dey and his colleagues at the central institute for research on buffaloes in haryana have spent the past 15 years developing and perfecting a formula that could potentially help the world from getting ever hotter they have prepared a feed supplement that can reduce a potent greenhouse gas belched out by stock animals like cattle goat and sheep yes just like fossil fuel infrastructure and coal mining ruminants also release methane the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide co2 which is seen as the biggest concern as well as the best opportunity for tackling global warming although the warming effect of methane is 30 times greater than co2 it is shorter lived and lasts in the atmosphere for about 12 years by contrast co2 lingers for centuries reducing methane emissions has therefore been touted as one of the most immediate opportunities to slow global heating in 2021 over 100 countries signed the global methane pledge where signatories agreed to take voluntary steps to reduce global methane emissions by 30 per cent from 2020 levels by the end of the decade this they say could eliminate over 0 2 c warming by 2050 the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration says human activity alone emitted 640 million tonnes of methane in 2021 dey and scientists across the globe are placing their bets on diet supplements to help bring down the emissions i think we are going to be heavily reliant on feed supplements to reduce methane emissions ermias kebreab director world food center and professor and sesnon endowed chair university of california davis told down to earth in a 2021 study published in the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society researchers from new zealand australia and the us write it is technically possible to reduce emissions from enteric fermentation to 50 million tonnes per year by 2050 diet check the science of abating methane emissions with the help of feed supplements is fairly straightforward unlike other animals ruminants have specialised digestive systems comprised of stomachs that have four compartments instead of one plant material is initially taken to rumen the largest compartment in the stomach that is inhabited by microorganisms such as fungi bacteria protozoa and archaea these microorganisms break down the otherwise indigestible cellulose rich plants to release protein and energy for their host animal in exchange for nutrition and shelter but during this process which scientists call enteric fermentation one particular microbe the archaea combines co2 and hydrogen made by the cellulose digesting microbes to create methane this means the archaeal population and a diet rich in roughages dictate the amount of methane released by a ruminant read methane emissions from fossil fuels much higher than current estimates the feed supplement prepared by dey and his team thus targets the archaeal population while boosting the growth of bacteria that are good at digesting feed the supplement is a concoction of ingredients such as indian cherry and indian elm leaves garlic oil mustard oil cottonseed oil sodium nitrate and magnesium sulphate while tree leaves possess compounds like saponins and tannins that are known to reduce archaeal population and cut off hydrogen supply to them sodium nitrate and magnesium sulphate stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria when given individually these chemicals must be administered in high doses to have a measurable impact on the archaea they also affect beneficial microbes hampering digestion and animal productivity such as milk or meat production so dey and his team decided to combine the ingredients with composite food additives the dose of individual components is lower giving beneficial microbes a free pass to measure efficacy of the feed supplement and the best dose for optimal results the researchers initially conducted laboratory tests where they mimicked the rumen by mixing rumen fluid collected from a buffalo with the composite supplement since many rumen microbes may not survive in the laboratory in 2016 they initiated another experiment involving calves aged 1 1 5 years the team put murah calves a buffalo breed predominantly found in punjab haryana and delhi on a six month long diet consisting of 2 3 kg of concentrate feed and 10 g of composite supplement per day during this period the researchers fixed an inflatable gas collecting bag onto the mouths of the calves before and after they ate the meal to collect exhaled air laboratory analysis showed that methane emissions dropped by 75 per cent the calves also recorded a 9 7 per cent higher growth rate in 2018 dey expanded the experiment to include lactating animals and fed them 6 6 5 kg of concentrate feed mixed with 50 g of the composite supplement per day for three months from the exhaled air the team recorded a 44 6 per cent decrease in methane concentration a food supplement is considered ideal if it can lower methane emissions by at least 20 per cent said alexander n hristov distinguished professor of dairy nutrition at the pennsylvania state university us early this year dey and his colleagues received a patent for the supplement our next step is to seek regulatory approval followed by commercialisation dey said since ruminants can be picky eaters dey and his team gradually introduced the feed additives on the first day we give 10 g and maintain this for three four days before we increase it to 20 g for the next four days we continue this until we reach the actual dose of 50 g said dey though he tested the supplement on one of the 17 buffalo breeds found in india he argues that the product could be effective on other breeds and cows as digestive tracts of ruminants and their microbial inhabitants are similar seaweed an option globally there is a race to develop different strategies to reduce methane production in ruminants in 2021 the eu approved a feed supplement bovaer developed by dutch bioscience company royal dsm saying it consistently reduces methane emissions from dairy cows by 30 80 per cent bovaer is a fine granular powder containing 3 nitrooxypropanol which inhibits an essential enzyme responsible for methane production some experts are placing their bets on seaweed particularly asparagopsis taxiformis a red alga growing in tropical and subtropical waters in 2017 18 matthias hess associate professor of animal science at the university of california davis conducted a laboratory study using asparagopsis taxiformis and recorded a 95 per cent decline in methane production the seaweed supplement could be commercially available in a few years but hess is not sure if the response will be similar for all animals experiments on cattle have also yielded encouraging results kerbreab s 2021 study published in plos one records an 80 per cent decline in methane emissions in cattle raised for beef production they do not have any health effects and meat quality is intact people could not detect any difference between cattle fed a seaweed diet and those on a regular diet a follow up study to be published soon corroborates these findings hess and his colleagues dived deeper into the rumen looking at changes in gene expression where instructions in the organism s dna are converted into proteins the seaweed did not displace microbes from the rumen but they may have become less active the animal does not want to get rid of those microbes because they might need them again later he said hess stressed that it is important for countries to rely on local ingredients the problem is the supply chain even if the supply chain works well one cannot ship seaweed from australia to the us to reduce methane given the higher carbon footprint of the shipping sectors he said adding that local species should be evaluated so his team conducted laboratory tests on locally sourced asparagopsis taxiformis and brown seaweed zonaria farlowii the two species reduced methane emissions by 74 per cent and 11 per cent respectively as per their findings published in 2020 in frontiers in marine science it is not as high as australian seaweed but still decent the bottom line is we are eliminating shipping emissions he observed a few issues exist seaweed appears to inhibit release of greenhouse gases through two chemicals bromoform and bromochloromethane which can induce cancer residues of the chemicals have been detected in milk and urine of cows fed seaweed more studies are needed to evaluate this concern ruminants also appear to dislike seaweed it has an objectionable odour said hristov kebreab added that feeding bovines smaller quantities of seaweed say less than 100 g for dairy cattle can help watson overcame this problem by mixing the seaweed supplement with distiller grains a byproduct of ethanol production regulatory procedures could also be a hurdle particularly in the us where feed is treated as a drug said watson the product is vetted thoroughly and could take at least five years to get regulatory approval there are other concerns stemming from an incomplete understanding of rumen microbes such as the possibility of them developing resistance to the supplement understanding the microbiome to predict how microbes respond to the supplement is essential and will help prevent resistance or develop alternative strategies said watson but these organisms are notoriously hard to study in the laboratory they are sensitive to oxygen and nutrients provided to them in laboratory conditions might not be conducive to their growth there is still much work to do said hess this was first published in the november 16 30 2022 edition of down to earth read more

a fire early last year took out two of brazos walking sticks main storage facilities but site manager hannah mcalister said the business did not skip a beat it was major she said it would ve been definitely worse had it hit our production area or our distribution area it was really just more storage than anything that happened on friday and we were up and running on monday though mcalister said the fire took out a significant amount of material one year later the business sits atop an e commerce throne shipping out handcrafted walking sticks and stuffing stockings across the world with a piece of waco the fire took out pallets of boxes full of product ready to be shipped as well as all of the company s exotic wood which was replaceable mcalister said she put a positive spin on the disaster and said it actually gave the business the opportunity to downsize its selection which was something it was likely to do anyway it doesn t affect the sales numbers it s overwhelming when you have too many choices anyway and that s really what it was we found she said people just go for a different style now mcalister began working for brazos walking sticks when she was 17 and has been there for 17 years the company created by warren owen started out as brazos oaks and was initially a picture frame shop mcalister said eventually the focus shifted brazos oaks became brazos walking sticks and about a decade ago the company was acquired by the health care product company healthsmart international owen stayed on as director until he retired last summer after taking an e commerce position with healthsmart mcalister agreed to manage the site amid changing leadership i was supposed to move five days after the fire mcalister said of course i didn t but i took an e commerce position with the company they called me to see if i would manage it as much as i can remote so i travel back and forth all the time from southwest virginia now mcalister spends about two weeks at home and two weeks at the shop at a time heading into a heavy season for orders it is all hands on deck she said summer is a peak season but it s not like christmas she said when we come back from the thanksgiving holidays black friday cyber monday we have tons of orders mcalister said there is not necessarily a higher total volume of orders during the holidays but a higher volume of custom direct to buyer orders that can be time intensive individual orders from the business website often include custom engravings unique handles special tips and badges or emblems and require more care to package than bulk orders every walking stick regardless of its final stop is handmade and hand packaged locally and starts with a sapling mcalister said she sources much of her wood from southwest arkansas by working with forestry companies on pine farms she said she gets her hickory sassafras sweetgum and maple from arkansas creating a sustainable process by utilizing underbrush that would otherwise be burnt away they grow the pine they harvest it they used to just burn all the underbrush she said but instead of burning it we pay them to go in and cut the saplings down it s sustainable because in the next five years you re going to need to clean that field out again she said the company s best selling cane is the root cane with handles made of tree roots sourced from upstate new york mcalister said saplings first arrive at the warehouse and are made into a walking stick s most basic components a cane shaft and handle attached by a mortis and tenon joint the company then supplies eight to 10 artisans in the waco area who run shops sometimes out of their houses to handcraft the sticks and canes bringing an individual and local touch to every product brazos walking sticks creates we do some production in the warehouse but very little mcalister said it s more if we run out of stock on something and i don t have an artisan actually making it that week i have the capability of doing it in house but the majority of our production is done with outside artisans with basically cottage industry shops when done the canes are brought back to the warehouse lacquered and prepared for shipping made to order products are packaged individually the company also ships in bulk to retailers around the country including bass pro shops cabela s and other outdoors and hardware stores the company even ships through amazon and has a walking stick model on shelves in walmart stores in addition to others walmart sells online mcalister said she has shipped some orders as far as the philippines kuwait and the united kingdom mainly through ace hardware she said the warehouse outside waco used to be open for walk ins but for safety reasons she does not do showings anymore making the business mainly reliant on e commerce
new york ap the federal reserve s move wednesday to raise its key rate by a half point brought it to a range of 4 25 to 4 5 the highest level in 14 years the fed s latest increase its seventh rate hike this year will make it even costlier for consumers and businesses to borrow for homes autos and other purchases if on the other hand you have money to save you ll earn a bit more interest on it wednesday s rate hike part of the fed s drive to curb high inflation was smaller than its previous four straight three quarter point increases the downshift reflects in part the easing of inflation and the cooling of the economy as interest rates increase many economists say they fear that a recession remains inevitable and with it job losses that could cause hardship for households already badly hurt by inflation here s what to know what s prompting the rate increases the short answer inflation over the past year consumer inflation in the united states has clocked in at 7 1 the fifth straight monthly drop but still a painfully high level the fed s goal is to slow consumer spending thereby reducing demand for homes cars and other goods and services eventually cooling the economy and lowering prices fed chair jerome powell has acknowledged that aggressively raising interest rates would bring some pain for households but that doing so is necessary to crush high inflation which consumers are most affected anyone borrowing money to make a large purchase such as a home car or large appliance will take a hit according to scott hoyt an analyst with moody s analytics the new rate pretty dramatically increases your monthly payments and your cost he said it also affects consumers who have a lot of credit card debt that will hit right away that said hoyt noted that household debt payments as a proportion of income remain relatively low though they have risen lately so even as borrowing rates steadily rise many households might not feel a much heavier debt burden immediately i m not sure interest rates are top of mind for most consumers right now hoyt said they seem more worried about groceries and what s going on at the gas pump rates can be something tricky for consumers to wrap their minds around how will this affect credit card rates even before the fed s latest move credit card borrowing rates had reached their highest level since 1996 according to bankrate com and these will likely continue to rise and with prices still surging there are signs that americans are increasingly relying on credit cards to help maintain their spending total credit card balances have topped 900 billion according to the fed a record high though that amount isn t adjusted for inflation john leer chief economist at morning consult a survey research firm said its polling suggests that more americans are spending down the savings they accumulated during the pandemic and are using credit instead eventually rising rates could make it harder for those households to pay off their debts those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards because of weak credit scores are already paying significantly higher interest on their balances and they ll continue to as rates have risen zero percent loans marketed as buy now pay later have also become popular with consumers but longer term loans of more than four payments that these companies offer are subject to the same increased borrowing rates as credit cards for people who have home equity lines of credit or other variable interest debt rates will increase by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which follows the fed s how are savers affected the rising returns on high yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit cds have put them at levels not seen since 2009 which means that households may want to boost savings if possible you can also now earn more on bonds and other fixed income investments though savings cds and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes online banks and others that offer high yield savings accounts can be exceptions these institutions typically compete aggressively for depositors the catch they sometimes require significantly high deposits in general banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to boost their profits by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering juicer rates to savers will this affect home ownership last week mortgage buyer freddie mac reported that the average rate on the benchmark 30 year mortgage dipped to 6 33 that means the rate on a typical home loan is still about twice as expensive as it was a year ago mortgage rates don t always move in tandem with the fed s benchmark rate they instead tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note sales of existing homes have declined for nine straight months as borrowing costs have become too high a hurdle for many americans who are already paying much more for food gas and other necessities will it be easier to find a house if i m still looking to buy if you re financially able to proceed with a home purchase you re likely to have more options than at any time in the past year what if i want to buy a car since the fed began increasing rates in march the average new vehicle loan has jumped more than 2 percentage points from 4 5 to 6 6 in november according to the edmunds com auto site used vehicle loans are up 2 1 percentage points to 10 2 loan durations for new vehicles average just under 70 months and they ve passed 70 months for used vehicles most important though is the monthly payment on which most people base their auto purchases edmunds says that since march it s up by an average of 61 to 718 for new vehicles the average payment for used vehicles is up 22 per month to 565 ivan drury edmunds director of insights says financing the average new vehicle with a price of 47 000 now costs 8 436 in interest that s enough to chase many out of the auto market i think we re actually starting to see that these interest rates they re doing what the fed wants drury said they re taking away the buying power so that you can t buy a vehicle anymore there s going to be fewer people that can afford it any rate increase by the fed will likely be passed through to auto borrowers though it will be slightly offset by subsidized rates from manufacturers drury predicts that new vehicle prices will start to ease next year as demand wanes a little how have the rate hikes influenced crypto cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have dropped in value since the fed began raising rates so have many previously high valued technology stocks higher rates mean that safe assets like treasuries have become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased that makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive still bitcoin continues to suffer from problems separate from economic policy three major crypto firms have failed most recently the high profile ftx exchange shaking the confidence of crypto investors what about my job some economists argue that layoffs could be necessary to slow rising prices one argument is that a tight labor market fuels wage growth and higher inflation but the nation s employers kept hiring briskly in november job openings continue to exceed job hires indicating employers are still struggling to fill vacancies said odeta kushi an economist with first american will this affect student loans borrowers who take out new private student loans should prepare to pay more as as rates increase the current range for federal loans is between about 5 and 7 5 that said payments on federal student loans are suspended with zero interest until summer 2023 as part of an emergency measure put in place early in the pandemic president joe biden has also announced some loan forgiveness of up to 10 000 for most borrowers and up to 20 000 for pell grant recipients a policy that s now being challenged in the courts is there a chance the rate hikes will be reversed it looks increasingly unlikely that rates will come down anytime soon on wednesday the fed signaled that it will raise its rate as high as roughly 5 1 early next year and keep it there for the rest of 2023 ap business writers christopher rugaber in washington tom krisher in detroit

let s just take the companies that actually have the word british in their name british airways is owned by iag a spanish registered company british steel was bought by jingye group the chinese steelmaker in 2020 the biggest shareholder in bt which used to be called british telecom is the french billionaire patrick drahi british land s top three shareholders are norway s massive sovereign wealth fund a dutch pension scheme and a us fund manager roll back the years and british leyland which incorporated most of the uk s car making industry was renamed the rover group in 1986 and then sold to germany s bmw most of the other notable marques were snapped up by other foreign buyers jaguar land rover is now part of india s tata group bentley motors is part of germany s volkswagen group rolls royce is another of bmw s stable aston martin lagonda is controlled by a consortium headed by the canadian entrepreneur lawrence stroll although the livery of his f1 team of the same name a separate company is british racing green british gas s parent company centrica is headquartered in windsor and listed on the ftse 100 it is therefore still pretty british scottish power however is a subsidiary of the spanish utility iberdrola but in common with the likes of british american tobacco and bae which was formed by the merger of british aerospace and marconi electronic systems in 1999 it will have a large number of foreign fund managers and hedge funds on its shareholder register they will be investing in these companies on behalf of pension schemes endowments and retail investors all around the world in total foreign investors now own roughly two thirds of all listed shares in the uk according to a study conducted last year by the investor relations consultancy firm orient capital such a granular analysis of privately owned companies is trickier but it is clear large swathes of british infrastructure are also in foreign hands heathrow is owned by a consortium of spanish qatari canadian singaporean and us investors although the uk s universities superannuation scheme does have a 10pc stake gatwick is majority owned by a french company and managed by an american outfit most of the uk s rail franchises are run by foreign owners including the german french italian and dutch states a recent investigation by the guardian found that at least 72pc of england s water industry is held abroad although some of the ownership structures are so opaque it could be an even larger percentage fall into foreign hands there has been a for sale sign over the uk for more than four decades now few western countries have allowed so many strategic assets and blue chip companies to fall into foreign hands two questions quickly follow from this how did it happen and does it matter the uk has been one of the world s leading advocates of free trade since william gladstone repealed the restrictive navigation acts in the 19th century this was admittedly something of a no brainer when a quarter of the landmass on world maps was coloured pink but the dislike of trade barriers survived the loss of empire and it has long been considered a net positive that foreign investors are queuing up to buy a piece of the uk this is partially because the uk is also a leading advocate of cakeism a doctrine that long predates boris johnson as the old joke has it britons aspire to scandinavian style public services paid for with us levels of taxation one way to bridge the gap is through the public private partnership model of infrastructure funding which was pioneered by the major and blair governments and seen as a cost effective alternative to public ownership that ensures borrowing can be kept off the government s balance sheet when allied with a light touch regulatory environment it attracted huge flows of foreign money in the early years of the century it was not uncommon for the uk to attract a full fifth of all the foreign direct investment flowing into the eu s 28 member states in any given year that money has been trumpeted by successive governments as a vote of confidence in the country sometimes a fall in the value in the pound will result in uk assets appearing cheap to those who account for their investments in another currency but on the whole most investors are putting their money into the uk because they think it is a good place to make money foreign investment also tends to come with fresh management styles and expertise techniques and technology this helps to ensure british businesses are competitive on the world stage as long as a company is headquartered in the uk employs plenty of britons makes its products or provides its services and pays its taxes here the main benefits of the business operations will still accrue to this country for the most part it should be largely irrelevant who the owners are loss of control water leak chris j ratcliffe bloomberg but foreign ownership can also result in a certain sometimes quite indefinable loss of control international owners may not feel as compelled to keep their promises to the government as british owners would soon after the us food giant kraft swallowed cadbury in 2010 it reneged on a pledge made during the bidding process to keep a factory open foreign investors may be less swayed by local activists and pressure groups and therefore arguably less accountable much of the criticism of this state of affairs focuses less on foreign ownership and more on privatisation the uk is one of very few countries in the world that has auctioned off its water industry partly because it is such a vital service and local providers operate quasi monopolies a common complaint is that investors milk these assets for dividends rather than investing in improvements hence the leaks hosepipe bans and dumping of sewage however it is not entirely clear the water companies would fare much better under government ownership when there are so many other competing demands on the public purse at the moment a better solution may lie in tightening up the regulation of such assets things get even more fraught when issues of national security are at stake a report in 2017 warned that ownership or control of critical businesses or infrastructure could provide opportunities to undertake espionage sabotage or exert inappropriate leverage the list of assets that are considered strategically vital and cannot be allowed to fall into hostile hands is constantly expanding the national security and investment act came into force in january which the government heralded as the biggest shake up of the uk s national security regime for 20 years most people would agree that a balance needs to be struck between holding a jumble sale for the uk s family silver and becoming so protectionist that we start repelling foreign investors at the border where the balance lies is of course a matter of fierce debate and is also liable to shift over time it has certainly done so in the past decade globalism s apotheosis for the best illustration of this look no further than how quickly the uk government s attitude to chinese investment has changed the golden age of anglo sino relations lasted barely seven years the epoch was ushered in by george osborne at the shanghai stock exchange in the autumn of 2015 it was pronounced dead by rishi sunak last month the symbolism of the location in which osborne made his declaration was lost on precisely no one this was all about trade the then chancellor claimed no economy in the world is as open to chinese investment as the uk if you exclude north korea he was probably right osborne s kow towing to beijing has not aged well but it is worth remembering the context osborne was operating at what we can now judge as globalism s apotheosis many rich nations had concluded that greater engagement with china was a win win win as the fast growing economy opened up it offered the possibility of a previously untapped market for western companies as it grew richer the savings of china s burgeoning middle classes could become a vast new source of capital and as china became more integrated in the global economy it was assumed the country would become more politically liberal germany dubbed this policy wandel durch handel change through trade and applied it to russia as well xi jinping london yui mok wpa pool getty images it hasn t worked out as hoped there has been a backlash in the west to globalisation while this had been building for a while it is relatively easy to identify the turning point the world looked a lot different after 2016 says jonno evans a former private secretary to two prime ministers in 10 downing street and former british diplomat in washington dc the election of donald trump and the brexit referendum were at least in part a result of public attitudes to globalisation souring china was seen by some to have benefited more than western countries suddenly the inevitability of globalisation didn t look quite so inevitable any more separately china s leader xi jinping has become more authoritarian not less the first pause for doubt was provided by beijing s crackdown on the uyghur population in xinjiang and pro democracy demonstrators in hong kong people started waking up to what china was doing and how powerful it had become says evans the us especially has now made the judgment that china s technological prowess had developed too far and is seeking to in the words of economist noah smith kneecap china s semiconductor industry and washington is quite explicitly putting pressure on its allies to do the same then came the double whammy of the covid pandemic and russia s invasion of ukraine suddenly global supply chains started jamming up for years the western world had only really considered where it could buy the stuff it needed most cheaply now it came to realise that this might mean it wouldn t be able to buy stuff for love nor money when it was most needed economic interdependence provides huge benefits in the good times but can also create massive vulnerabilities when the going gets tough geopolitics is back in the boardroom says evans who now advises technology companies at epsilon advisory partners for the past couple of decades companies didn t need to worry about it but we have now entered a new era of techpolitik he adds that they now need to consider not only sanctions but data sovereignty supply chain disruption cyber attacks and standard setting politicians are looking to ensure that the technology our children and grandchildren use is underpinned by western values says evans the us office of foreign assets control recently sanctioned a line of code it s possible that tiktok will be banned in the us pretty soon then the uk will have a choice to make as we did on 5g disentanglement george osborne david cameron dan kitwood pool getty images was the cameron government naive or has the world just become a lot more worrisome in recent years probably a bit of both either way the uk has been attempting to disentangle chinese investment from crucial infrastructure following mounting pressure from washington the uk decided to ban huawei and other vendors it considered to be a high security risk from its 5g networks in 2020 in november after months of prevaricating the government blocked the sale of newport wafer fab the uk s largest semiconductor plant to chinese owned nexperia it also bought the chinese state owned power group cgn out of its stake in the sizewell c nuclear energy project in suffolk under a long standing deal cgn which the us placed on an export blacklist back in 2019 after washington accused it of stealing american know how for military purposes invested in hinkley point c power station in somerset then sizewell c which has just been given the green light and is still technically due to be the lead investor at bradwell on sea in essex where it is hoping to instal its own design of reactor the chinese company still retains a stake in hinkley point and received formal approval for bradwell from the uk s nuclear regulator in february but there is growing scepticism at westminster that the chinese will ever be able to build on the site the government has deliberately cast the net very wide to make sure that it doesn t miss anything says neil cuninghame a partner at city law firm ashurst the government won t actively single out china but i m sure there s a hierarchy where china is at or near the top of the list in focusing on how the uk got into a situation where it sold off so many of its assets to foreign investors most people fail to consider the other side of the equation why british investors are selling up it s not like they don t have plenty of cash uk pension schemes insurance companies and retail investors own assets totalling something in the order of 5 6 trillion this is the largest and deepest pool of capital in europe however just 12pc of this money is invested in the uk stock market and less than 4pc trickles down below the ftse 100 group of the biggest companies defined benefit or final salary pension schemes reduced their allocation to uk equities from 48pc in 2000 to just 3pc last year according to the bank of england even more strikingly less than a single per cent of the 4 6 trillion in pensions and insurance assets is invested in unlisted equities according to new financial as william wright the head of the think tank says it s like the rime of the ancient mariner water water everywhere nor any drop to drink what s so frustrating is that with money so tight the country badly needs investors like pension funds and insurers with long term time horizons directing their patient capital at the real economy and theoretically at least such assets would provide exactly the right kind of return profile to meet their liabilities back ourselves last year boris johnson and rishi sunak wrote an exasperated letter to uk based institutional investors urging them to plough a greater proportion of their money into uk assets it s time we recognised the quality that other countries see in the uk and back ourselves by investing more money into the companies and infrastructure that will drive growth and prosperity across our country earlier this year local government pension schemes were told to set up plans to invest up to 5pc of their assets in domestic initiatives a target so low that it mostly serves to highlight the extent of the issue even this prompted swift pushback from a number of schemes who pointed out the goal might clash with their fiduciary responsibilities the trouble is uk investors are not investing as they do because they are unpatriotic or believe british assets are duds rather it is down to a number of deep seated regulatory and structural issues most defined benefit pension schemes are closed to new members and switching from equities to bonds as the majority of their members approach retirement onerous regulations make it too expensive for insurers to invest in illiquid assets like private equity and infrastructure most low cost retail investment products are also unsuited to these kinds of investment in fairness a good chunk of the regulatory tweaks that have been wrapped together and branded as the edinburgh reforms attempt to address this mismatch the cornerstone of this drive is solvency ii a piece of arcane insurance regulation that most people would never have heard about were it not for the fact its reform is frequently touted as a potential brexit dividend although the benefits are often overstated it is true the existing eu rules don t perfectly suit uk insurers without getting too lost in the weeds the reforms should mean that insurers will be asked to hold less capital against long dated investments the association of british insurers has calculated that this might free up around 100bn in what it calls long term productive finance whether this money will actually find its way to investments in british assets of say future dividend payments remains to be seen sliding doors moment perhaps the best answer to the predicament the uk now finds itself in can be found at an intriguing sliding doors moment in recent british political history in his book two hundred years of muddling through the surprising story of the british economy the economist and author duncan weldon points out an apartment paradox for all margaret thatcher s reputation as a tax cutting prime minister the amount of revenue being collected by the treasury during her time in charge hovered at around 40pc of gdp how come in a word oil crude was discovered under the north sea in the late 1960s but production didn t really start cranking up until the late 1970s the uk went from producing 1 5m barrels a day in 1979 to 2 7m in 1988 during the 1980s taxation on oil from the north sea delivered an average of 18bn a year to the uk s treasury when adjusted for inflation one in 12 pounds the british government received came straight from the north sea writes weldon north sea oil carina johansen ntb scanpix afp but whether the uk got the maximum bank for those bucks is open to debate weldon certainly doesn t think so and a country on the other side of the north sea provides the counter example he writes norway used its oil bonanza to build a sovereign wealth fund that is now one of the world s largest pools of assets britain used its take to cut corporation and personal tax actually the norwegian oil fund which was set up with the express aim of ensuring the country s petroleum revenues could be enjoyed by future generations is now the biggest in the world with 1 3 trillion in assets under management a figure that has increased sixfold since the financial crisis in 2008 it seems to exploit its long term nature to boost returns by investing in assets that aren t available to other investors its chief executive nicholai tangen recently said we can be more contrarian do the opposite of other people because when other people sell we can buy and vice versa we can be even more long term in how we invest because we have a 30 to 100 year time frame one of things his fund has been buying as others were selling was uk assets as of the end of last year it had 71 6bn 6 8pc of its assets invested in britain with stakes in 370 companies and 214 properties including london s regent street one of the green ones on the monopoly board it is as previously mentioned the biggest investor in british land the uk may be becoming more wary of accepting china s money but that doesn t mean we have to eschew the country s wisdom the chinese say that the best time to plant a tree was 40 years ago but the second best time is now the same may well be true of establishing sovereign wealth funds

on a factory floor in washington north east england sits a metal block about the size of a shoe box once punched into shape and filled with high explosives the steel lump correctly called a billet and destined to be turned into a 155mm artillery round could one day be piercing the turret of a russian tank as ukrainians fight to liberate their country the provision of artillery rounds is one of the defining factors of the war in ukraine and both sides are struggling to maintain supplies russia has had to turn to decades old munitions unstable and of dubious reliability to keep up the onslaught the head of britain s armed forces says russia faces a critical shortage of artillery munitions russian guns have now been firing for almost 300 days admiral sir tony radakin says the cupboard is bare ukraine is helped by external support mainly from the west but there are bottlenecks in supply lines industry can do only so much without firm direction and healthy order books the ministry of defence is expected shortly to signal to bae systems the primary ammunition producer for uk s armed forces an increased demand for such munitions both to increase domestic stockpiles and to be able to send more to ukraine
was the cameron government naive or has the world just become a lot more worrisome in recent years probably a bit of both either way the uk has been attempting to disentangle chinese investment from crucial infrastructure following mounting pressure from washington the uk decided to ban huawei and other vendors it considered to be a high security risk from its 5g networks in 2020 in november after months of prevaricating the government blocked the sale of newport wafer fab the uk s largest semiconductor plant to chinese owned nexperia it also bought the chinese state owned power group cgn out of its stake in the sizewell c nuclear energy project in suffolk under a long standing deal cgn which the us placed on an export blacklist back in 2019 after washington accused it of stealing american know how for military purposes invested in hinkley point c power station in somerset then sizewell c which has just been given the green light and is still technically due to be the lead investor at bradwell on sea in essex where it is hoping to instal its own design of reactor the chinese company still retains a stake in hinkley point and received formal approval for bradwell from the uk s nuclear regulator in february but there is growing scepticism at westminster that the chinese will ever be able to build on the site the government has deliberately cast the net very wide to make sure that it doesn t miss anything says neil cuninghame a partner at city law firm ashurst the government won t actively single out china but i m sure there s a hierarchy where china is at or near the top of the list in focusing on how the uk got into a situation where it sold off so many of its assets to foreign investors most people fail to consider the other side of the equation why british investors are selling up it s not like they don t have plenty of cash uk pension schemes insurance companies and retail investors own assets totalling something in the order of 5 6 trillion this is the largest and deepest pool of capital in europe however just 12pc of this money is invested in the uk stock market and less than 4pc trickles down below the ftse 100 group of the biggest companies defined benefit or final salary pension schemes reduced their allocation to uk equities from 48pc in 2000 to just 3pc last year according to the bank of england even more strikingly less than a single per cent of the 4 6 trillion in pensions and insurance assets is invested in unlisted equities according to new financial as william wright the head of the think tank says it s like the rime of the ancient mariner water water everywhere nor any drop to drink what s so frustrating is that with money so tight the country badly needs investors like pension funds and insurers with long term time horizons directing their patient capital at the real economy and theoretically at least such assets would provide exactly the right kind of return profile to meet their liabilities back ourselves last year boris johnson and rishi sunak wrote an exasperated letter to uk based institutional investors urging them to plough a greater proportion of their money into uk assets it s time we recognised the quality that other countries see in the uk and back ourselves by investing more money into the companies and infrastructure that will drive growth and prosperity across our country earlier this year local government pension schemes were told to set up plans to invest up to 5pc of their assets in domestic initiatives a target so low that it mostly serves to highlight the extent of the issue even this prompted swift pushback from a number of schemes who pointed out the goal might clash with their fiduciary responsibilities the trouble is uk investors are not investing as they do because they are unpatriotic or believe british assets are duds rather it is down to a number of deep seated regulatory and structural issues most defined benefit pension schemes are closed to new members and switching from equities to bonds as the majority of their members approach retirement onerous regulations make it too expensive for insurers to invest in illiquid assets like private equity and infrastructure most low cost retail investment products are also unsuited to these kinds of investment in fairness a good chunk of the regulatory tweaks that have been wrapped together and branded as the edinburgh reforms attempt to address this mismatch the cornerstone of this drive is solvency ii a piece of arcane insurance regulation that most people would never have heard about were it not for the fact its reform is frequently touted as a potential brexit dividend although the benefits are often overstated it is true the existing eu rules don t perfectly suit uk insurers without getting too lost in the weeds the reforms should mean that insurers will be asked to hold less capital against long dated investments the association of british insurers has calculated that this might free up around 100bn in what it calls long term productive finance whether this money will actually find its way to investments in british assets of say future dividend payments remains to be seen sliding doors moment perhaps the best answer to the predicament the uk now finds itself in can be found at an intriguing sliding doors moment in recent british political history in his book two hundred years of muddling through the surprising story of the british economy the economist and author duncan weldon points out an apartment paradox for all margaret thatcher s reputation as a tax cutting prime minister the amount of revenue being collected by the treasury during her time in charge hovered at around 40pc of gdp how come in a word oil crude was discovered under the north sea in the late 1960s but production didn t really start cranking up until the late 1970s the uk went from producing 1 5m barrels a day in 1979 to 2 7m in 1988 during the 1980s taxation on oil from the north sea delivered an average of 18bn a year to the uk s treasury when adjusted for inflation one in 12 pounds the british government received came straight from the north sea writes weldon
adam bates a former army ranger wounded in afghanistan in 2009 foreground demonstrates walking techniques for anatoliy kirda left oleksandr fedun center and ruslan tyshchenko right the ukrainian soldiers getting replacement limbs at medical center orthotics and prosthetics in silver spring md bill o leary the washington post america s most recent wars led to profound advancements in prosthetics and new standards for treatment for most ukrainian soldiers in need the best is often out of reach the ground was a thicket of russian land mines lethal too many to avoid oleksandr fedun a soldier in the ukrainian army remembers driving through the field and then a roar of fire shrapnel and light he leaped from the wreckage of his self propelled howitzer what was left of his legs snapped and splintered when he hit the earth alive miraculously and with enough presence of mind to slip on two tourniquets the field hospital though was hours away that was in may as ukrainian troops in the country s southeast blitzed pockets of russian forces in limited counteroffensives six months later fedun 23 was in suburban d c ready to attempt what his doctors back home had said was unlikely ever to happen he grasped the parallel bars took a breath and hoisted himself up on his new carbon fiber legs it was a start but fedun s goal isn t just to walk it s to run and then return to the front that would not only inspire his friends he said it would humiliate ukraine s enemy their amputees fedun said of the russians are not going back to the battlefield the war s toll has been devastating with u s officials estimating recently that around 100 000 service members have been killed or wounded on each side it s unclear how many ukrainian soldiers have lost limbs but their government with its economy in tatters and hospitals under constant attack possesses neither the funds nor the expertise to equip its military s growing number of amputees with state of the art prosthetics leaving many to seek help in western countries sympathetic to their cause advertisement the support that fedun and select ukrainian personnel have received reflects the profound advancements in combat medicine made by the united states and nato allies over 20 years of war in afghanistan and iraq it s the standard of care assured to american and western service members but for many ukrainian soldiers who ve suffered amputations it remains out of reach what s happening in silver spring md and at similar facilities in cities like minneapolis is only made possible through a flood of private charitable donations the defense department has not yet leveraged its vast medical resources to help wounded ukrainian troops as part of the nearly 20 billion in security assistance committed to the government in kyiv since russian forces invaded it s unclear why defense secretary lloyd austin issued guidance in may that allowed for the treatment of up to 18 ukrainian soldiers at a time in a u s military hospital in germany since then only a single wounded service member has been seen there officials said the patient was evaluated and transferred to an unspecified partner country late last month landstuhl regional medical center said in a statement a pentagon spokesman declined to address questions about the demand from ukraine for help treating wounded personnel or whether such requests have been denied ukrainian military officials did not respond to requests seeking information about the number of amputees in their ranks and their treatment options over several visits in the fall the washington post accompanied three ukrainian soldiers as they received their prosthetics and began the long difficult task of learning to use them their rehab was performed in a nondescript business park not far from walter reed national military medical center where hundreds of u s troops their bodies shattered by roadside bombs and other improvised explosives were shown how to regain their mobility and with it their sense of independence the experience they said has given them hope that better days are ahead starting over the soldiers each wounded in separate incidents and in separate locations gave harrowing accounts of the large scale conventional war being fought in ukraine and the harsh realities for those who are wounded skilled but overworked doctors struggle to keep up with a crush of patients one factor is the lack of fast air evacuation an assured resource in recent u s wars but often an impossibility in ukraine under contested airspace leaving many soldiers waiting hours to reach treatment their arms and legs crushed by tourniquets that can end up killing the limbs with necrosis some amputees receive rudimentary prosthetics with doctors explaining to those with the most catastrophic cases that a future with wheelchairs and crutches is the most realistic prognosis ukraine has focused on getting medical operations back online experts have said but the demand has only increased there are just not enough rehabilitation specialists able to proactively help the wounded recover and maintain the highest possible level of mobility said ivona kostyna chairwoman of veterans hub a nonprofit that provides resources for ukrainian troops and veterans simply speaking once stabilized soldiers might end up just laying in bed instead of actively restoring the functioning in their body and lose the precious time for their recovery a big challenge is expense fedun and his fellow soldiers made it to the united states and received care with assistance from multiple nonprofits including revived soldiers of ukraine and operation renew prosthetics in partnership with brother s brother foundation medical center orthotics and prosthetics donated the new limbs worth a total of 320 000 co founder mike corcoran said along with physical therapy from adventist rehabilitation hospital and others who volunteered services corcoran s company provided contract support to the u s military s primary amputee treatment facility at walter reed from 2005 until april he said treating roughly 1 400 american service members corcoran s ukrainian patients are eager to start working with their new limbs and like their american counterparts exhibit mixed comfort with their new appearance some want prosthetics made with rubber coatings that resemble human flesh others want to bare their mechanical designs american troops typically spent months or even years at walter reed undergoing physical therapy and numerous prosthetic fittings before continuing their care through other military or veterans affairs hospitals the ukrainians schedule is compressed into four weeks leaving open the question of how much support they will receive once they return home i need to take my time fedun who will spend some extra time in the united states for dental work comes across as focused and impatient he said his double amputation has interrupted his personal quest to push every russian soldier out of ukraine and that every day in america is a day he isn t making a difference there fedun who has served in ukraine s military for close to four years was nearly killed in the zaporizhzhia region about 26 miles from his family s home ahead of the assault that left him wounded a ukrainian reconnaissance had reported the area was clear the russians arrived later he said and laced the fields with antitank mines fedun s 2s1 gvozdika a self propelled howitzer led a column of vehicles after the explosion he cranked the wheel hard bringing the gvozdika to a stop so that it shielded the vehicles behind him his comrades killed nearby russian ambushers one by one before making an arduous evacuation that took about five hours using a small torch he said fedun cauterized his ruptured artery to save himself from bleeding out share this article share he woke up in a surgical center depressed about his new normal he said then his thoughts lingered on getting back onto artificial feet in maryland he started with a pair of shorties the low gravity prosthetics that help to strengthen an amputee s remaining muscles and improve the balance needed for walking with full size legs but they put double amputees at the height of a child which is unpalatable to some fedun did push ups on the parallel bars to demonstrate his strength but he got winded after only a few strides on his full legs a therapist explained it was a matter of physiology bones and muscle harness energy needed for movement and now every step requires considerably more effort to compensate for what he lost i was expecting it to be easier to be less taxing fedun said i just realized i need to take my time it s another commonality with american troops corcoran explained a stubborn sprint to recovery colliding with reality you have to let them make their own mistakes he said ruslan tyshchenko has moved at a more deliberate pace to master his gait the 44 year old engineer and military reservist was assigned to kharkiv along the russian border when he volunteered to crawl through a field and place mines in a bid to blunt russian tanks from reaching his unit to do this he affixed the mines to each of his limbs laying all but one when he raised his head he caught the glint of a tank s optic shimmering through nearby foliage the tank fired tyshchenko was blown several meters from his position he radioed for help and his comrades dragged him to safety his left leg was shredded his right still held a mine that somehow didn t explode tyshchenko said he was wary of running afoul of certain superstitions held by troops in the field like shaving before a mission or heading out donning a clean uniform he was wearing new boots when he was wounded after a chaotic evacuation and visits to five hospitals tyshchenko s entire left leg was amputated like a doll s leg pulled clean out of the socket i have nowhere to put them on now he said joking about his new boots tyshchenko suffered a hip disarticulation which means there is no remaining leg bone he praised the care he received in ukraine but learned his amputation was one of the most difficult to address his appeals to several european countries were answered but he was told there were waiting lists advertisement in the maryland clinic tyshchenko strode back and forth on his new leg painted in the ukrainian national colors of blue and yellow he and his wife iryna bought a home in the kharkiv area which will become his garden refuge he hopes to stock with rabbits a breakthrough not all of the challenges ahead will be physical iryna said watching as her husband ambled through the facility soldiers can slip into bouts of depression yearning for their pre injury lives it s important to make him feel accepted and loved iryna said and ensure his role as the family s patriarch is unchanged in big and small ways he used to make me coffee in the morning she said he still does family support has been vital to recovery said anatoliy kirda a 59 year old commercial sailor who after the invasion rushed home from israel and volunteered to fight he helped defend the capital kyiv during the war s opening phase then transferred to an assault brigade that experienced a fierce fight over the strategic city of izyum in eastern ukraine the russians launched endless volleys of rockets and mortars kirda said in may while moving through trenches to another position he heard the buzzing of a small enemy surveillance drone but couldn t see it the drone reported his position he surmised to a russian crew firing grenades into the trench line his leg was nearly severed in an explosion six feet away he strapped on a tourniquet and crawled to his comrades for help advertisement his wife also named iryna soon joined him as he moved from one hospital to another each was bursting with patients some of the wounded felt useless he said and refused to meet with their wives not him he said it saved me from emotional stress kirda said his wife by his side the men dealing with different injuries and on separate journeys back to their lives in ukraine perked up when their potential walked through the clinic door adam bates a former army ranger who lost both legs in an explosion in afghanistan in 2009 stopped by to offer some of his hard earned wisdom the ukrainian soldiers were instantly impressed with his balance and ease of movement they peppered him with questions how can they improve how long until they can move about like him bates held court in his demonstration keep your shoulder and hip aligned he told them widen your stance perhaps the most vital advice was to recognize and embrace inevitability they will stumble during therapy they will tumble alone in their hotel rooms they will crash to the ground at home in ukraine

had lost focus due to her husband s health that s according to a bombshell new feature from the wall street journal which citing unnamed executives at disney said that it was cfo christine mccarthy who eventually convinced former ceo bob iger to return to the role at the time iger was yachting around the fijian islands complaining to friends that he was frustrated with the idleness of his life post disney his wife willow bay was too busy with her job as a dean at the university of southern california to join him island hopping he stepped down as ceo in 2019 with chapek replacing him disney ceo bob iger pictured with his wife former model willow bay in 2018 iger separated completely with disney near the end of 2021 after remaining onboard for two years as executive chairman helping to guide chapek and to guarantee a smooth transition however during that period iger would allegedly hold meetings with executives without chapek 63 and often complain about his successor s leadership and refusal to lean on him saying that his replacement was doing a terrible job according to wsj mccarthy referred to chapek s leadership as devastating to the company she finally made the call to iger on november 16 to see if he was interested in coming back to the job he held for 15 years two days later disney s board would offer iger the job and then fire chapek who was marred by dropping stock prices and a battle with florida lawmakers over its special tax district status mccarthy was among the leading executives who often chastised chapek s failings catching him off guard during a meeting where she laid out disney s dropping revenue sources told the wsj long time disney cfo christine mccarthy hatched a plot to oust bob chapek as ceo after she found herself sidelined from important meetings during his sabbatical from disney iger spent time island hopping in fiji on his 184 foot yacht aquarius ousted ceo bob chapek had sidelined mccarthy from key meetings leading to her plot to overthrow him they noted the chapek was angry at mccarthy for not previously discussing the numbers with him while giving briefing materials to the rest of the board chapek allegedly held meetings without mccarthy and said she had lost focus and become unstable according to the wsj mccarthy s husband was experiencing bad health at the time the cfo has been married to real estate mogul michael mccormick since 1988 the couple has two children together daughter kelsey and son daniel revelations into the insight of chapek s final days comes as disney warns staff that job cuts are imminent with its stock down more than 42 percent in the last year according to current and former executives at disney iger continued to act as a shadow ceo at the company after retiring but taking a job as an executive chairman iger allegedly continued to work in his office at disney s headquarters in burbank california and conducted business with top executives without inviting chapek the meetings were to let chapek know they work for me not for you the sources said chapek on the other hand wanted to find his own footing in the company and often strayed from iger s advice when the pandemic hit iger had recommended the company delay staff cuts until congress approved relief aid chapek however pushed for the cuts to preserve cash but the board sided with iger who maintained much of his power to help guide disney through the pandemic sources said chapek was livid and would privately complain to his deputies that he wasn t fully in control after iger touted his work during the pandemic during a new york times interview the sources said that any chances of chapek personally turning to his mentor for advice went from unlikely to out of the question the two men also clashed over the rollout of disney s streaming service where iger had projected the company would get 60 to 90 million users within its first five years florida governor ron desantis office has said that he is not making a u turn on stripping away some of disney s special privileges which had become a major issue under chapek s leadership chapek noting the rise of streaming during the pandemic raised the projections in december 2020 to 260 million subscribers with iger saying it wasn t smart to offer such an ambitious goal although disney saw early success its latest quarterly report shows the streaming service has since lost 1 5 billion since chapek took over the company has lost a full one third of its value iger s sensational return as disney s ceo came as a shock to even some of the media conglomerate s senior executives who only found out about the change in leadership while at an elton john concert on november 20 chapek is expected to receive a 23 million exit package and will receive even more if share prices bounce back up after falling more than 42 percent over the past year iger right pictured with his successor and predecessor bob chapek left told disney employees in late november that he had an inkling he d be getting a call to return to the company since chapek took over the company it has been blasted as becoming too woke as the house of mouse further mishandled its relations with florida gov ron desantis over the bill which bars teachers of students in third grade and below from discussing sexuality as a result desantis decided to strip disney world of its special tax privileges the company has also been slammed for becoming more woke with scenes of a lesbian kiss in kids movie lightyear and a transgender man buying tampons in tv series baymax although those productions were likely signed off during iger s tenure disney is also facing pressure from park workers who have demanded wage increases as long time employees say they re grossly underpaid while the company enjoys 3 6 billion in profits over their work the services trades council union stcu which represents 42 000 of disney s 70 000 workforce has called on the company to bump employees wages to meet their high cost of living while disney granted employees a 2 raise to 15 an hour in 2021 the union said it was a far cry from the 18 19 now needed to make ends meet as workers protested outside the magic kingdom last week earl penson who s worked as a chef for 11 years told the guardian that the latest pay increase was not distributed evenly as he only makes 50 cents more than a new hire we re grossly grossly underpaid for the hours that we work penson said a lot of us have the same story in not being able to afford the cost of living on the pay that we make a lot of disney workers are barely squeaking by you have workers with families sleeping in their car disney park workers are demanding their wage of 15 an hour increase to meet the current standard living wage of 18 19 he criticized disney for not raising their wages to meet the average standard of living in orange county florida which the mit living wage calculator puts at 18 19 it s really heartbreaking it s a morale downer because you would think they would recognize how hard the cast members work penson said i wish they would let us know that they appreciate the magic that we bring every one of us is a part of the magic of disney and we enjoy making the magic we just want to be compensated for making the magic according to local 737 one of the six unions represented by stcu about 75 percent of its members have had to skip meals over the past year just to save money another 35 percent needed a second job to get by and a fourth of the union members skipped out on purchasing medicine prescribed by a doctor about 40 percent or more have suffered stress over money which has affected their relationships and health the union also found that 26 percent of its members have had to move because their rent or mortgages had gone up while 21 percent have taken on roommates to help with the costs about 39 percent of the members said they were worried about being homeless in regards to the negotiations disney said it was considering employees call for a pathway to a 20 an hour salary we have presented a strong and meaningful offer that far outpaces florida minimum wage by at least 5 an hour and immediately takes starting wages for certain roles including bus drivers housekeepers and culinary up to a minimum of 20 an hour while providing a path to 20 for all other full time non tipped stcu roles during the contract term the company said in a statement

even as it works out addressing local content hurdles to tap into the local energy sector trinidad and tobago conglomerate agostini limited plans to add to its over 3 billion in investments from two companies established here as it looks to also bring a number of the companies and international franchises it already holds in its home country after the purchase of some 17 2 acres of land aback the houston rome area in 2018 construction is moving rapidly apace to meet the demands for warehouse and office spaces in the area at present we are a trinidadian owned company so we haven t reached the local content we have not dealt much with the energy sector per se as yet either we have had some enquiries and the first thing they ask is for local content certification which we do not meet at this point in time so we have not been concentrating on that side of the business at all blaine chee ping country manager for both companies that are registered here told sunday stabroek news in an interview the agostini group itself is probably the fourth largest conglomerate in the caribbean it also represents starbucks in trini dad which falls under pres tige holdings limited s management and thus the bringing of starbucks a first store in amazonia mall and we made a commitment to starbucks to do seven stores in two and half years here in guyana but that is only a bite because we have big plans for guyana and here will only get better he added chee ping explained that the company also has plans for establishing the american restaurant chain tgi fridays future investments outlook however does not stop there since the company plans to establish a local office for the american headquartered multinational conglomerate general electric and says that pharmaceutical distribution and energy are other projects in the making we have starbucks we have the kfc franchise tgi fridays linda s bakery and a few prego foods which subway falls under so a few restaurants fall under prestige holdings we don t have the local franchise for some of them over here though like kfc and pizza hut for instance we have the tgi fridays chain for over here so we are looking for opportunities to come in with the tgif friday brand we also have an energy company called rostopetro we are looking at ways to see how we can get them over here to see how we can work and learn together but again it is looking for the correct and trusted people to partner with so we can meet local content requirements and all of that we can t come in and try to do it on our own so we need to try to find the right and trusted partner the country manager added with agostini being one of the largest distributor of pharmaceuticals in the caribbean coupled with its acquisition of oscar francois to amalgamate with smith robertson and separately being the general electric ge franchise holder chee ping explained that a guyana presence would be imminent we recently acquired oscar francois which is the largest distributor for pharmaceuticals in trini dad and we also acquired another pharmaceutical company in barbados as well the superpharm chain in trinidad falls under the agostini umbrella too so we do a lot of stuff we also represent ge and do hospital stuff as well we have had a presence for ge products here but the support always came from t t so now we are trying to see if we can put something on the ground locally so the support will be more readily accessible in guyana he informed guyana s own desinco trading already has a partnership with agostini and distributes its foods here in guyana it is why the company plans to give to desinco some of its acreage to build another office we own shares in desinco so on the northern part of the land our intention is to sell that to desinco and put up a distribution facility for them chee ping explained another guyanese to whom chee ping credits a lot of the work the company has done to date is ramphal persaud he has been with the company from its inception and advises on works here it is me and ramphal here but he gets so much done and i can t thank him enough you need someone who understands the culture the people to show you around and to know how you can serve the people ramphal is the man he said developing fast agostini s interest in guyana grew when it four years ago created two companies here and purchased land in houston it rented a space in eccles industrial site from its desinco partner as it worked out plans to build spaces to rent to smaller companies who could not afford purchasing land and building themselves at houston that land investment cost the company us 500 000 to build the structure that is currently on the property was about another g 1 3 billion overall chee ping said that over 3 billion has been invested in guyana since the two companies were formed chee ping said that when guyana discovered oil and those discoveries increased agostini knew that it would only be a matter of time before there would be transformational development here and it acted the country manager gave a synopsis of its coming and operations in guyana we have basically two companies in guyana one is agostini guyana inc which is this one we do interior construction products just for the interior finishing of anything offices hotels anything we do ceilings glass doors flooring carpeting all sorts of stuff the other company is called agostini properties inc that one owns the land in the houston rome area we purchased in december towards 2018 i guess we had the foresight but everybody knew that once oil was discovered the country was going to take off when we bought the land we had no idea the highway would passing just be 20 feet from where we would be all that was just bush the intention always was to have a presence in guyana we knew that the country was going to be developing fast we knew from experience that there would be a lot of new companies coming into the country and that there would also be a lot of startup companies coming into the country so what we initially decided to do is what you see on the site right it is a warehouse complex and it is geared mainly to the small startup companies he added the companies moved into the eccles building in february of 2020 but plans were brought to an abrupt halt because of covid 19 agostini interiors had already shipped seven containers with stocks of its interior outfitting products which included drop ceiling gypsum sheeting and office furniture it s kind of been up and down and not a lot of people know we are at the back here we are doing some advertising but we have not yet had a steady flow of customers in and out we do interior outfitting products anything for the interior of your hotel your office we could supply that we have drop ceiling we have a line of office furniture and supply those we do a lot of gypsum sheeting for walls it is a new technology for guyanese the stud and trap metals he pointed out when the economy was properly reopened here after covid 19 cases had dropped trinidad and tobago still had strict measures so the country manger had to wait until those were lifted before returning but when he returned work continued and the office warehouse space was completed in houston and today it forges ahead there are 12 warehouses in the current building plans are now ongoing to build a replica but with increased square footage as companies have expressed interest in larger spaces the warehouses are just 1800 square feet and they have a small office space of like 720 square feet and then downstairs there is kind of like a receptionist showroom area where they can display their products of the 12 warehouses six of them have been rented out and we are having talks with people to rent the remaining all of the rentals are trinidad and tobago companies though guyanese registered all carrying guyana inc but tt company s we had some interest from companies in suriname we have had interest from some companies in guyana but no one outside of tt has signed on as yet for a warehouse he explained one of the companies does escalators and elevators another is a specialist chemicals company which produces environmentally friendly chemicals for the construction industry and offshore another tenant is a cargo consolidator the other a freight forwarding company and most recently the trinidad and tobago brand home store which also has opened at the amazonia mall of the total 17 2 acres property the first project was built is on 6 acres additional space would be used to build the other set of warehouses but this time they would be some 4000 sq feet each to execute building plans the company submitted the necessary environmental protection agency permits and got the approvals chee ping said that while the epa permit received is very broad and covers the businesses renting from agostini they screen companies because they are considerate of their tenants he explained that in one instance a sheet metal and roofing company wanted to rent but they had to decline because we thought it would be a disruption to the other tenants with a presence in the booming houston area that has seen the establishment of several oil and gas and service companies agostini says that it has had interest from us majors halliburton and baker hughes but has had to refuse those because of local commitments sought the company awaits decisions from its shareholders on expansion into other sectors in guyana at the moment we don t meet the local content requirement and we are not pursuing it right now by any stretch of the imagination agostini is locally traded public company on the local stock exchange and to meet local content you have to give up 51 of your company to a guyanese individual i am not sure the shareholders are there any decision would be on agostini s shareholders on how they want to move forward chee ping contended
by erwin seba washington kan reuters farmer bill pannbacker got a call earlier this month from a representative from tc energy nyse corp telling him that its keystone pipeline which runs through his farmland in rural kansas had suffered an oil leak but he was not prepared for what he saw on his land which he owns with his wife chris oil had shot out of the pipeline and coated what he estimated was nearly an acre of pasture uphill of the pipe which is set into a valley the grass was blackened with diluent bitumen one of the thickest of crude oils which was being transported from canada to the gulf of mexico the rupture on dec 7 is the third in the last five years for the keystone pipeline and the worst of the three more than 14 000 barrels of crude has spilled and cleanup is expected to take weeks or months tc has not said when repairs could be completed and a 96 mile 155 km segment of the pipeline will restart crews will remain busy on site through the holidays and completion of the cleanup depends on weather and other factors the canadian company said in a statement we are committed to restoring the affected areas to their original condition or better beehive of workers keystone s two previous spills happened in unincorporated areas in north dakota and south dakota and while the city of washington kansas is small with just over 1 000 residents it is surrounded by farms where wheat corn soybeans are planted and cattle are raised the spill in washington county affected land owned by several people the once quiet valley is currently a construction site buzzing with some 400 contractors staff from pipeline operator tc energy and federal state and local officials they are working into the night leaving a glow from the high intensity lamps seen from miles away cranes storage containers construction equipment and vehicles stretch for more than a half mile from the site of the rupture the valley has become almost a small town with several quonset style huts erected for workers aerial photos showed a large blackened swath of land that almost looks like an airborne object is throwing a shadow over the land pannbacker said that pasture was used for cattle grazing and calving but with calving season over there were no livestock there at the time the oil blackened grass on the land which is owned by pannbacker and his sisters as part of a family trust is now completely gone it was scraped away and is now confined to a giant mound of dirt that is noticeably darker at the bottom but oil droplets on plants further up the hill were still visible wider group affected living in rural kansas the pannbackers are used to preparing for harsh weather but not an oil spill residents have been largely unconcerned despite the accident even as the area will resemble a work site for the near future how many people have experienced an oil spill who knows what it s like said chris pannbacker it s not like a tornado or a natural disaster kansas state representative lisa moser in a facebook nasdaq post said there are 14 landowners who are being compensated for either the spill or the use of their property during cleanup tc said it is discussing compensation with landowners but would keep details private the company said it has stayed in regular contact with landowners pannbacker said tc has not yet discussed compensation with them yet pannbacker says he does not expect the grass on the pastureland to return for at least two or three years there is a well site on the pasture used for the cattle that they will not be using either
if you are looking at the energy sector today these are the top names to consider adding to your portfolio energy prices have been on a rollercoaster ride since the start of the coronavirus pandemic geopolitics supply and demand and opec are just some of the things pushing oil and natural gas prices up and down today suggesting that caution is in order if you re looking to put any money even just 100 into the sector that s why totalenergies tte 0 58 and enterprise products partners epd 0 63 are two of the best options for investors with 100 available to put toward stock purchases right now prepared for the worst totalenergies is one of the world s largest integrated energy companies that means that its business spans from oil drilling all the way through to the gas pump this is notable because oil and gas production benefits from high energy prices while downstream operations like refining tend to benefit when energy prices are low it provides an inherent balance to the company s business that helps smooth out the ups and downs in the highly cyclical energy sector there are a lot of other companies that follow this model so that s not unique but it is an important benefit for investors on top of that the current good times in the oil patch have helped to strengthen totalenergies balance sheet the company expects to have zero net debt in short order which means that its cash holdings are roughly as large as its debt obligations it s a very strong position to be in the company is also projecting a very low break even price of around 25 per barrel of oil that gives it plenty of breathing room should an oil price decline occur and lastly totalenergies has made a huge commitment to clean energy at this point it is expecting to put around a third of its capital spending into this space so it can change along with the world around it most notably it is making this important business shift while still managing to maintain its dividend payment something that none of its closest peers has done all in if you are looking for a balanced way to play the energy sector totalenergies is a great pick and its stock is selling for less than 100 a share while paying a generous 4 8 dividend yield note that u s investors will have to pay french taxes on that avoid the headache if the inherent ups and downs in the price of oil and natural gas are a bit too much for you then you might want to look at master limited partnership mlp enterprise products partners units trade below 100 and the distribution yield is a very generous 7 9 the key here however is that enterprise doesn t drill for energy it simply helps to move it from where it is produced to where it gets used the mlp is what is known as a midstream company it collects fees for operating pipelines storage processing and transportation assets enterprise is one of the largest midstream companies in north america with a portfolio that would be difficult if not impossible to replace while its 50 billion market cap is dwarfed by those of the big integrated oil majors it is still an energy industry giant in the niche where it operates although the partnership has a strong core business long term growth comes from investing in new fee generating assets on that score enterprise has 5 5 billion in projects on the drawing board to support long term distribution growth the distribution notably has been increased for 24 consecutive years and is covered by distributable cash flow by a robust 1 8 times add in an investment grade rated balance sheet and there s a lot to like here even in the face of energy market volatility being prudent can still be profitable while you can easily find an energy stock with a high yield or with huge upside exposure to energy prices that probably isn t the best way to go about investing in the energy sector for most investors if you want exposure to oil and natural gas totalenergies can provide that while offering a solid foundation and a hedge against the shift toward cleaner alternatives enterprise meanwhile provides huge distributions while limiting the impact of energy price volatility on your cash flow both are great options that can be bought for under 100 a share today
debt swaps for emission reduction are a crucial tool for addressing three pressing issues they can help maintain fiscal sustainability promote biodiversity and green recovery and foster long term sustainable economic growth around 30 economies worldwide have undertaken debt for climate swaps as of right now primarily in latin america and the caribbean around 2 6 billion in debt swap accords were reworked globally from 1987 and 2015 of which 1 2 billion was spent in traditional projects additionally 29 international countries benefited from debt swaps throughout the pandemic debt swaps can modify procedures strategies and structures in the direction of a green rebound going past merely acting as finance sources for particular industries such programs allow national debt to be channeled toward meeting environmental pledges and significantly advancing the paris agreement goals debt swapping is a contemporary strategy that entails buying the debt of developing nations and demanding that they commit to safeguarding biodiversity and irreplaceable ecosystems in exchange identifying process of a green and blue bond but what makes a bond green bond is interesting how to label a bond loan or sakuk as green have an identification process the first track is for proposal resource and expense eligibility this entails the issuer exhibiting that the green bond s initiatives holdings and spendings are consistent with an array of green interpretations or a categorization recognizing environmental projects assets and expenditures describes how to choose which categorization to use and when not to use one the second track is for the authenticity of the lender s institutional governance framework when it comes to bond labelling mechanisms this involves processes and management for identifying green projects assets and expenditures managing bond proceeds and reporting and disclosure on a routine basis in accordance with the issuer s green bond structure social sustainable and sustainability related bonds green bonds have also gained traction in the last three years when used correctly the growing volume and liquidity of the feasible bond fund economy presents a valuable guidance and support for borrowers to raise capital for long term sustainability goals blue bonds are one of many funding sources intended to guide ocean wellness and blue economies and while they are valuable tools they are best suited for countries with strong ocean governance sustainable economic activities and a borrowing infrastructure pitch of the blue bonds blue economy and blue finance notions are mirrored in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development a sequence of international development aims adopted by the united nations sustainable development summit in 2015 the 2030 agenda emphasised the sustainable development goals sdgs a set of 17 goals aimed at eradicating poverty and creating a more sustainable planet the sdgs are global aims that apply to all nations goal 14 focus on life below water it calls for a healthy and environmentally friendly use of marine resources that preserves the ecosphere while allowing for economic growth the world bank defines blue bonds as a debt instrument issued by governments development banks or others to raise capital from impact investors to finance marine and ocean based projects that have positive environmental economic and climate benefits according to adb a blue bond is a relatively new form of a sustainability bond which is a debt instrument that is issued to support investments in healthy oceans and blue economies to issue a blue bond a blue bond guideline is created or an existing green bond framework must be expanded to overtly incorporate blue projects the structure includes a categorization of blue projects a classification of the various project types that are permitted as well as eligibility criteria for each segment the framework also specifies how the projects blue impact will be tracked and reported how blue economy helped debt swap evidence from seychelles following 2008 economic reforms seychelles effectively reduced its public debt from 175 of gdp to 60 of gdp by 2015 including a 45 buzz cut conferred by the paris club of creditors in 2010 however because of the limited fiscal support and seychelles reasonably high gdp per capita access to concessional finance was restricted seychelles pursued an aggressive strategy to fund long term development of the blue economy converting us 21 6 million of national debt through the world s first blue economy debt for nature swap and issuing the world s first sovereign blue bond the seychelles conservation and climate adaptation trust seyccat was founded to disburse funds from these measures in a productive manner to assist the governance and augmentation of seychelles marine protected areas mpas viable fisheries as well as other activities that contribute to the sustainability preservation and safeguarding biodiversity as well as climate change adaptation with 38 of gdp tourism is the primary driver of the economy it has a formal employment rate of 25 conversely fisheries account for 20 of gdp and 20 of formal employment seychelles is heavily reliant on blue tourism and there is a lot of emphasis on eco tourism which was high quality minimal impact and high return the seychelles blue economy framework intends to reach a framework of environmental sustainability that encompasses seychelles oceanic environment s opportunity to generate employment ensure income equality foster innovation identify adaptive capacity and increase resilience to shocks these improving adherence have proven to be extremely effective with the help of the nature conservancy the debt conversion enabled the seychelles government to make a policy commitment to protect 30 of its exclusive economic zone through mpas the seychelles blue bond was announced in 2018 overseas investors contributed 15 million to the blue bond illustrating the prospects for countries to use capital markets to fund the sustainable use of marine resources the seychelles blue economy strategic policy framework and roadmap was critical to the blue bonds plan s achievement as it outlined how the finances would be immersed prior to the debt securities being issued the seyccat blue grants fund has already gone through four rounds with the final one on july 6 2020 from debt for equity swap to debt for nature swap the debt for equity swap was pioneered by advisors to third world country governments the framework was tested on chile first in order to prevent any growth of the bond market chile developed a more credible framework that allowed for the conversion of debt into equity local banks compete for the privilege to conduct transactions to exchange a specified fixed amount of foreign debt into local currency at the central bank s monthly auction the banks serve as agents by helping the holders of international debt change it into cash or a resaleable commodity denominated in pesos with the approval of the local debtor it was considered as a way to rescue banks and third world countries from the global debt crisis certain foreign debt claims are eligible for conversion into equity by nonresidents under the provisions and they can be bought on the secondary market without using the auction system restitution of capital or dividends is governed by a variety of requirements and the domestic currency acquired must be used for authorized investments each application was evaluated on a case by case basis by the central bank which started to insist in 1988 that each conversion be accompanied by at least a tiny quantity of new money the central bank of chile stated in 1987 that the country s debt for equity program would be extended to permit the creation of overseas investment organizations whose assets acquired through the acquisition of subsidized debt may be reinvested in a variety of chilean equities and investment funds but how do someone account for debt to equity swap is important to understand the method of accounting of a debt equity flip entails over drafting the entire debt portion of the business designated for swap purposes and giving credit it into an equity shares issue account debt for equity swaps entailed western banks willing to sell a fraction of the lines of credit owed to them by developing countries to a foreign investor at a rebate this resulted in the creation of a secondary market for debt with some countries debt being sold for as little as 5 of its face value the debt sale necessitated the approval of the creditor country which would compensate the foreign investor by giving them shareholding in a domestic industry or cash equivalent to be used within the state in the amount equal to the face value of the debt debt swapping formulation evidence from pakistan earlier this year united nations secretary general during his visit to pakistan appealed for a substantial debt relief let alone recent floods in pakistan caused an estimated damage of 10 of the country s gross domestic product gdp a country which is already in debt trap with total external debt and liabilities surging to around 40 of the gdp while the debt servicing jumped to over 15 billion during last year debt swap is a viable option but under what conditions is important to understand either it is debt payback debt swapping for equity or debt swapping for nature but the difficulty is in identifying suitable investment opportunities for which debt can be swapped either because there are none available or because authorities withhold the permission at best the debt equity conversion may have a useful life of two to three more years but the debt swap cause controversy because they speed up the privatization process in third world countries because they provide cheap business opportunities and avenues to the international investors at a low rate this led to an increase in fdi because there is also no evidence of knocked down pieces debt swaps are now to be sponsored by impact investors who are private individuals or organizations who contribute funds in the hope of profiting from them debt swaps are pertinent to the topic of sustainability finance because of this so how this evolution of sponsor work is important to understand another framework which can be used is to low down the local currency valuation which pakistan seems to be using this help in debt conversion role of sbp and private commercial banks in it is significant it involves exchanging debt paper for equity which is then sold to a consortium of bidders with the returns on capital calculated by the profits realized by the capital appreciation in this frame of reference investments in the hospitality and tourism enterprises have been particularly convincing the accomplishment of either of these mutual fund schemes is predicated above all on the readiness of creditor banks to offer considerable quantities of debt paper at a discounted rate which most major banks appear unwilling to do but the ideal time limit of this debt equity swap is not defined for example one of the debt markets perform best within a period of two to three years that too depends on the nature of volatility in the country and that too is a risk if major investment opportunities do not attract towards it then venture enterprises grab them on the other hand what government can do to swap its debt is to privatize its properties many are already privatized but government can benefit from the under valued dump properties who are not attractive enough for a breather but that is too un realistic to happen government cannot afford to take up the risk of swapping its properties with debt because it s in loop and government will end up in having no under over market valued properties left to swap for the role differentiation of government and its central bank is important to understand either it is of a financial service provider or a buying debt institution governments in developing nations pay off foreign loans in exchange for repurchasing the debt rather than merely exchanging foreign debt for local currency payments this simply scale up the funding but what about debt buybacks debt buybacks are always negotiated at a higher degree confidentiality because it can leave both positive and negative effect on other investors and creditors similarly when the debt exchange for the seychelles was completed it was revealed that tnc had originally asked the contributors of the paris club for a deal worth 80 million with a rebate of 25 but had instead been successful in obtaining a debt swap for 21 million with a discount of only 6 5 pakistan recently was proactive on the climate fund from an angle of enthusiasm this fund can be seen as debt for nature swapping but a country like pakistan who is debt crunch and borrowing more money to pay off previous loans have a long road blue economy or green economy are the way forward but a country with total debt and liabilities peaking by an unsustainable 24 to rs62 5 trillion at the end of september 2022 will be holding the rope with soggy hands end at the time of negotiations either at debt swapping time or debt buyback time ali asad sabir is a freelance writer

this oil and natural gas extractor has a huge yield but income investors should tread with caution because it isn t sustainable devon energy dvn 0 95 is one of those stocks where you need to be extremely clear about what you own or you could end up burned badly it s not a bad company it s just that its stock comes with some nuances that you might overlook if you get overly enamored with its huge 9 dividend yield and that could leave you feeling upset with yourself here s why devon energy might be a buy for some investors but a terrible choice for those looking for consistent dividend payouts what does it do at its core devon energy is an oil and natural gas producer it operates in the onshore space of the u s energy sector with exposure to five producing regions it has been expanding its size via bolt on deals recently adding exposure in the eagle ford basin in texas and the williston basin in north dakota in the third quarter devon energy produced roughly 614 000 oil equivalent barrels per day beating its guidance by 2 it had 21 drilling rigs operating and brought 103 new wells into service it has been able to keep its operating costs low which allowed its field level cash margins to expand by 40 year over year in other words it s doing pretty well right now and this is a good time to be producing oil the average realized price of an oil barrel equivalent for the company rose by roughly 38 year over year in q3 that s because crude oil prices have been higher than normal as you might have guessed from the elevated prices you ve been paying for gasoline and all the headlines outlining the various supply and demand issues in the energy sector those issues range from geopolitical tensions to opec s decisions to cut production but the outcome has largely been generally high energy prices this is why devon energy was able to pay its shareholders a huge 1 35 per share dividend in the third quarter 61 more than the dividend it paid in the prior year period so far investors should really like what they see here there s a downside the problem is that oil and natural gas are highly volatile commodities making the energy sector a cyclical industry prone to both impressive upturns and swift downturns the market has experienced the full range of those dramatic swings since 2020 when the advent of the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a steep drop in global oil demand that pushed crude prices to historic lows while that downturn was particularly intense with west texas intermediate crude a key u s oil benchmark actually falling below zero at one point energy price volatility really isn t all that unusual in the grand scheme of things so while devon energy is doing quite well today there will come a time when it won t be that s just the nature of the business which brings the story back to its dividend while some large oil companies such as exxonmobil and chevron focus on providing stable dividends devon quite intentionally does not management has structured its payouts in two parts with a fixed dividend that gets supplemented by a variable dividend based on the company s recent performance this rewards investors during the good times however they ll collect smaller dividend checks when times get tough investors looking for relatively stable consistent payouts should look elsewhere the third quarter offers a perfect example the payment was up 61 over q3 2021 but it was also down nearly 13 from q2 2022 that may seem like a modest sequential slide given the year over year increase but when you consider the volatile nature of oil prices there s no reason to believe that the dividend couldn t fall all the way back to the level of a year ago or worse to the less than 0 10 per share that devon energy paid in each quarter of 2019 in essence over the past three years or so investors have likely seen the extremes of what they can expect from devon on the dividend front but they shouldn t count on either end of that range to be the ongoing status quo for the right person to state the obvious again devon energy s dividend by its nature will not be a good fit for investors looking for stable payouts however if you are specifically looking for a way to leverage yourself to increasing energy prices it could be a good fit for your portfolio rising energy prices should lead to larger dividend payments from devon energy thus in the end devon energy is an acquired taste but you have to look past today s fat dividend yield to see why

for 15 years i have walked at scorton lakes it has been a delight to see the raw quarries progressively transformed by imaginative landscaping planting path creation and habitat management tarmac have done a simply brilliant job no wonder scorton residents want to protect the site against the disneyfication described in last week s d s villagers ready to fight major tourism scheme north yorkshire edition dec 9 tarmac has every right to feel annoyed too why put so much effort into restorations if they are promptly turned into holiday home estates one of the partners in the scoping request says the development will focus on wellness the other the duke of northumberland s estates company claims on its website to impact the environment positively most visitors to this wonderful reserve probably feel that these aims have already been met and that any further changes are purely meant to line the developers pockets carl les leader to be of the new unitary council says the public s views will be vital in shaping the future of north yorkshire no doubt the council will be listening to the residents of scorton then and watching the response from richmondshire s planners nicholas reckert richmond read more villagers gear up to fight major scorton lakes tourism development dysfunctional i see the north yorkshire police and crime commissioner would like us to pay more towards a service which barely functions as it is views are sought on cost of 999 services d s times dec 9 a month ago i wrote to her complaining about the fact that the 101 phone line does not work as no one picks up it took one month for her aide to email me using an email address from a previous fruitless complaint response amazingly i was asked to re submit my complaint online even though the aide had a perfectly legible and cogent complaint in front of her how does one complain if not a computer user i wonder since i took the time to write about my concerns the least i think i could have expected was the courtesy of a reply from the commissioner not instructions from an aide to re submit online i suggest no one sanctions extra money for a service which in recent years has collapsed into dysfunctionality l marsay stokesley heartwarming i have never submitted a letter to a newspaper and i have never intended to but i simply have to share something i witnessed in the central coffee house northallerton on the morning of saturday december 10 if not only to offer a balance to all the doom and gloom that we currently seem to be submitted to a very pleasant and friendly gentleman with obvious communication difficulties entered the coffee shop and informed the young lady at the counter that he had no money today and could you treat me the young lady immediately offered him something and engaged in very pleasant conversation with him telling him not to worry about paying today whilst waiting for his food he found a small plastic bag in his pocket with some coins in and immediately tried to see if he had enough money to pay at which the young lady again told him not to worry and to sit down while they brought his food over shortly after another customer who was there with his wife went up to the counter and discreetly offered to pay for the gentleman s food but was kindly turned down by the young lady however the customer insisted and the young lady had to accept his offer what i witnessed really did affect me and made me reflect on my own selfishness in so many aspects of my life i take my hat off to the staff at the central coffee house to the customer who offered to pay and to the gentleman in question who showed great appreciation and humility for the kindness that was shown to him peter swan appleton wiske our landscapes value of our landscape has never been more important says rishi sunak in his column d s times dec 9 and especially so it appears if it is to be sold for retail parks service stations designer villages housing estates factories and garden centres the landscape has a very high value indeed it is apparently now comparatively worthless for traditional uses such as growing food crops or hosting a wide variety of endangered species such as the curlews currently using some of the sites presumably they didn t pay and so are of no value perhaps productive farm land is now to be designated further up in the dales national park i look forward to seeing the gentle dales breeze whispering through acres of golden wheat above keld national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty it seems are now to be the only acceptable and permitted landscapes landscape zoos then they can really come into their own as prime income generators an annual tax to live in them and visitor passes as a start yes it seems as though the value of our landscape has never been more important and indeed it will be used make a fine profit the old saying knowing the cost of everything and the value of nothing describes the situation perfectly susan chipping catterick garrison road closures i write with frustration at the latest news regarding road closures in swaledale the b6108 is closed this week for three days the b6270 has been closed since november 7 and will not now reopen until december 22 this has significantly impacted the number of visitors reaching reeth and upper swaledale and seriously impacted revenues at businesses up and down the dale communication from richmondshire and north yorkshire county council combined with total lack of timely notification and diversion signage has put small businesses already suffering from increased costs and reduced income on an even weaker financial footing i estimate that our final quarter revenues will be down by 60 per cent in comparison with 2021 we have christmas stock that will be unsold it may not have a sell by date on it but nevertheless it represents costs that we cannot recover for another year unsold stock represents significant loss of earnings across sales in retail and craft spaces of which we are just one operators of businesses in reeth have been cut off from potential customers for the whole of the pre christmas season in 2022 the question is what is the councils response or are they too busy spending ratepayers money on 100 000 pay offs for chief executives i remind all public servants that this is what you are servants of the public name and address supplied lords proposals labour leader keir starmer says he wants to turn the house of lords into a fully elected chamber on the face of it this proposal sounds democratic but unfortunately it could lead to the frequent paralysis of the legislative system as in the usa where the two elected houses are often controlled by opposing parties at present there are both hereditary and life peers and even bishops in the lords and because none are elected by the people this upper house is mainly a revising chamber unwilling directly to take on the elected house of commons if however the lords were all elected they would have a democratic mandate to do just that meaning that keir starmer s labour commons could be continually frustrated by his new upper house controlled by other parties in my view a workable compromise would be to scrap the hereditary peers and bishops retaining only the life peers most of whom have valuable life experience and have far less incentive to consider the effects of their actions on the result of the next general election cllr steve kay ind moorsholm east cleveland elected lords lords reform is a niche subject but this can be achieved for legal reasons this must be in the first two years of a labour government that government must be prepared to take the necessary action of creating 200 or 300 peers determined to end the current membership it is merely necessary to decide who should be elected to sit instead in the replacement reviewing chamber do not let the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of the good an elected house of some kind is much better than what we have now cllr nigel boddy lib dem north road ward darlington coal go ahead on october 25 prime minister rishi sunak proclaimed that his government would have integrity that trust is earned and that he would earn ours on november 7 at cop27 he talked about a global mission for new jobs and clean growth bequeathing our children a greener planet and fulfilling the uk s commitment to reducing emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030 then on december 7 mr sunak s government made the cynically delayed post cop27 announcement that it was giving the go ahead to a new coal mine in cumbria this environmentally damaging decision is a backward step criticised by environmentalists scientists and the chair of the government s own climate change committee within weeks mr sunak has moved from honouring the promises we made in glasgow and directing public and private finance towards the protection of our planet to giving the green light to the first coal mine to be opened in the uk for 30 years the prime minister was right to say that trust is earned unfortunately he has demonstrated very clearly that he and his government cannot be trusted as far as the climate crisis is concerned margaret lowndes richmond constituency green party adding to the chaos everyday traffic is at a standstill along darlington s carmel road north and south woodlands road west auckland road and staindrop road there is gridlock from 3pm onwards the news that yet another 2 000 houses are proposed in the area around staindrop coniscliffe road beggars belief the lives of those already living here will be made worse in every respect it seems we do not count a captive audience only useful for paying council tax the previous labour council did not listen the current council is not listening it was ever thus one has to be a developer to be heard no wonder people are angry and depressed no wonder voters feel hopeless our

after getting doused by an increase in interest rates by various deposit taking institutions dti earlier this year customers of three commercial banks can expect a more expensive new year as they have announced an increase in interest rates on variable rate and existing loans to be implemented in the first quarter of 2023 first global bank limited fgb a subsidiary of gracekennedy limited sent out an e mail to its customers dated december 8 that they should expect an increase in interest rates on all loans of up to 2 00 percentage points this is to take effect 45 days after the letter was sent to its customers which is january 22 2023 the advisory recommended customers to contact fgb gkco com or to contact the respective branch manager fgb has already increased the interest rates on some credit cards and increased some of the various fees charged on different services it increased the interest rate charged on variable rate loans to customers in july by as much as 2 5 percentage points its loan book net of provisions has grown by seven per cent up to september to 33 51 billion with its total asset base at 79 79 billion as per the bank of jamaica s boj unaudited assets and liabilities of commercial banks this letter advises that effective forty five 45 days from this communication first global bank will increase interest rates associated with all loans to align with changes in the financial sector please be assured that we remain committed to serving you and look forward to working with you as we partner in business for growth said the fgb e mail which was seen by the jamaica observer sagicor bank jamaica limited sbj is increasing the rates on loans and deposits by 2 50 and 2 00 percentage points effective january 26 2023 the interest rate hike on loans will only be applied to existing variable rate loans this is the second rate hike on variable rate loans implemented by sbj after it had an increase of up to 1 50 percentage points on june 27 sbj s deposit product guide shows that it was last updated in august 2019 its loan book is up 11 per cent to 102 54 billion with total assets at 192 98 billion as of september all impacted customers will be contacted individually concerning these adjustments to their credit facilities at sagicor we stand committed to supporting our clients through changing economic times and invite clients with specific concerns to consult their sagicor banking representative said the notice on sbj s online platform national commercial bank jamaica limited ncbj is the other bank which will be implementing interest rate hikes on its customers ncbj increased the interest rate on variable rate loans for personal and small and medium sized enterprise sme customers by an average of 1 14 percentage points on july 19 however in its latest rate hike to take effect on february 1 existing business interest rate loans will increase between 0 23 and 1 75 percentage points ncbj is jamaica s largest commercial bank with its loan book up seven per cent to 427 72 billion and total assets of 846 54 billion as of september following the bank of jamaica s increase in its policy rate there will be an upward adjustment in the monthly repayment on existing business interest rate loans all impacted customers will be contacted individually concerning these adjustments said the ncbj advisory excluding the bank of nova scotia jamaica limited scotia jamaica building society and citibank n a every other dti has announced an interest rate hike in 2022 as the boj has moved its policy rate from 0 50 per cent to 7 00 per cent as of november 21 its next monetary policy committee mpc meeting is set for tuesday where it will consider if it will adjust its policy rate the boj said at its november meeting that it would conditionally pause its rate hikes subject to the decisions of the united states federal reserve as well as the pass through effect of interest rates on dti s loans and deposit rates sunday finance has contacted every commercial bank to find out if they are expecting to increase their interest rates heading into the new year but there are no responses up to press time in an unprecedented move the boj began publishing the deposit rates of commercial banks on december 11 as it tries to improve the flow of information to consumers on the most beneficial rates in the market boj governor richard byles told the standing finance committee of the house of representatives on wednesday that the boj was trying to find solutions to the slow responsiveness of commercial banks to its policy signals on interest rates he mentioned that the peculiarities and rigidities of jamaica s system makes the transfer of its policy signals quite muted the november minutes of the mpc revealed that the weighted average deposit rate offered by banks increased by 51 basis points while the prime rate for new business loans increased by 109 basis points over september 2021 to september 2022 despite the policy rate increasing 600 basis points however an executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that commercial banks likely didn t have a choice since there were talks that section 33 of the boj act 1960 with amendments consolidated to 2015 could be used to compel the banks to adjust their loan and deposit rates section 33 allows the boj after consulting the minister of finance and giving 30 days notice to prescribe the minimum and maximum rates that specified financial institutions and commercials banks can impose on loans and deposits in addition in the context of the weakness in the credit channel of the monetary transmission mechanism the committee urge the bank s staff to continue to develop policy options aimed at improving the monetary transmission mechanism for its review said the boj minutes from its november meeting the us fed increased its federal rate by 50 basis points to 4 25 to 4 50 per cent on wednesday with it indicating that its signal peak rate should be 5 25 per cent in 2023 governor byles in an august speech highlighted the risk that capital outflows from jamaica and exchange rate depreciation can occur if domestic monetary policy is not properly aligned when sunday finance asked an executive at a dti about the expected impact of the second round of interest rate hikes by commercial banks he said a next round of loan increases are coming and deposit rates are raising on the wholesale funding side we should see a more pronounced impact on the pass through of rates to consumers and a commensurate change in consumption activity which may have negative economic effects another executive at a dti highlighted that commercial banks are absorbing the increased cost of funding in order to not push up the non performing loans on their books at a time when their capital is under pressure from the continued fair value losses from heightened volatility in the financial markets banks have been slow to act due to rates still being market sensitive the recent impetus by the central bank along with inability to continue to absorb the impacts have forced the move the simultaneous nature and uniformity suggest banks are still watching each other before determining their moves banks will still need to be careful considering the potential impact of global headwinds impacting further growth in the latter half of 2023 she posited when asked about the expected action at the boj s mpc meeting she said for the remainder of the calendar year i would say no i anticipate that the boj will hold and continue to focus on moral suasion and forcing market pass through of existing rate hikes and observing the impact on demand and the inflation rate as well as its forecast commercial banks are currently contending with the implementation of basel iii which will require there to be more capital held on books to meet the new requirements and risk ratings it was expected to be implemented on january 1 with the boj noting a transition period of july 2022 to june 2023 to provide feedback however some banks are concerned with the implementation and its impact not only on its overseas customers but also on the bank s flexibility under stress tests i m not expecting the implementation to take place at the start of the new year at this time i think we are in ongoing discussions with the central bank the analysis is taking place we re exchanging information and our own internal checks we ve not been able to quantify the impact in any clinical way but for certain it will a cost technically it could result in us effectively being able to coming to the conclusion that there may be certain loans for example the spread that we re getting is not sufficient to cover the capital allocated to that particular loan said ncb financial group deputy ceo dennis cohen at a recent investor briefing sagicor bank has announced that interest rates on its loans will rise by between 2 5 percentage points while deposit rates will increase by 2 percentage points ncb has announced increases for sme loans effective february 1 2023

president william ruto the first 100 days of a new administration are extremely important this is the time the new government defines its philosophy and structures people s expectations the first 100 days become more meaningful if elections are held at a time of economic depression and a new administration gets elected on the promise of turning things around the 100 day yardstick did not gain much prominence until the presidency of the 33rd president of the us franklin d roosevelt in 1933 roosevelt was in power at a time when the us and the world at large was going through a serious economic crisis the great depression between 1929 and 1939 many americans were out of jobs businesses were crumbling and the agriculture sector was on its knees roosevelt summoned the us congress to a special session and embarked on putting in place the legal framework for his plan which was later known as the new deal in those first 100 days congress passed 15 major bills and 77 laws to counter effects of the great depression he was purposeful about programmes to relieve the unemployed and other vulnerable members as much as he made several executive decisions towards enhancing agricultural productivity and profitability he marked those 100 days with a significant speech enumerating his achievements thus far he remains the only us president to serve more than two terms roosevelt s third term and fourth terms were spent dealing with another crisis world war 2 which ended four months after his death another small detail about his presidency is that he served while on a wheelchair he was paralysed from the waist down after suffering from polio in kenya the first 100 day yardstick gained prominence in 2002 following the late president mwai kibaki s decisive win coincidentally he too was inaugurated on a wheelchair albeit temporarily the most significant win that kibaki took pride was introduction of free primary education over 1 6 million new pupils were enrolled however kibaki insisted that the most significant change in first 100 days was in the hearts and minds of kenyans who had renewed confidence in their future in retired president uhuru kenyatta s first 100 days most significant achievement is free maternity programme famously known as linda mama both kibaki and uhuru s administration were defined by heavy investment in socially democratic programmes the greatest question is when president william ruto takes stock of his first 100 days what will be his defining achievement or philosophy hustler fund maybe the writer is anchor at radio maisha
cument may contain errors 155 november 2 1981 i v izuntarism and the reagan economc program i introduction in recent speeches president reagan has stressed the volun tary sector as a crucial element in his strategy to alter the balance between the government and the people in american society volunta r ism is an essential part of our plan to give government back to the people 11 mr reagan declared october 5 before the national alliance of business he then announced the formation of a presidential task force on private sector initiatives to be headed by armco inc chairman william verity which will examine ways of stimulating voluntarism considerable attention has been given to the feasibility of employing the voluntary sector as an alternative source of funding to offset the 1981 budget cuts in wel fare and other programs but reagan has made it clear that he views the sector as far more than a new source of finance for reduced federal programs it is a key part of the administration s policy of moving the provision of services as close as possible to their intended recipients so that local needs and sources of assistance can be blended strengthening the mediating structuresi1 between government and the individual voluntary associations churches foundations neighborhood groups etc is seen as i m portant in reinvigorat ing the bonds of community the growth of the voluntary sector is also viewed by the administration as necessary to the effective rebuilding of notions of social obligation and ilgood neighborli nessi1 fundamental features of amer ican society that have been eroded by the growth of government many representatives of the voluntary sector however seem to doubt that it can respond fully to its challenge and opportuni ty some analysts have argued for instance that tax law changes in 1969 together with the explosion of state and federal regula tions concerning fundraising and other charitable activities 2 have caused stagnation in the sector reversed it will be impossible for philanthropy to reach its full potentia1 l others g o even further by maintaining that at the very time the reagan administration is advocating an expansion of voluntarism its 1981 tax and budget package actually will discourage charitable giving a controversial urban institute study commissioned by the independent sector an umbrella group of non profit organizations maintains that the budget and tax portions of the 1981 economic recovery program will cost charities at least 45 billion during the 1981 1984 period compared with what would have been av a ilable without the changes 2 sector president brian o connell claims that the reagan admini stration has delivered the voluntary sector a triple whammy federal program support has already been cut contributions are now projected to go down and all this at a time when everyone is looking to these same organizations to expand their services yet the assumptions on which the urban institute study are based are open to serious challenge examined carefully it becomes evident that much of the extreme pessim ism of the charitable organizations is unwarranted there are tax and regulatory obstacles to philanthropy which could be removed there are also good reasons to suppose that the ilgapll left by the budget cuts is smaller than the critics believe and tha t charitable giving will expand more rapidly than is generally expected if this trend is not independent when the assumptions are while the size and nature of the impending irqap i1 and the ability of the voluntary sector to fill it is a critical issue in the administration s policy of encouraging voluntarism the urban institute study is the only comprehensive examination to date of this issue and it has widely been used as the definitive analysis of the impact of the economic recovery act it is necessa r y therefore to scrutinize the study carefully i yet there is another important element in the debate on voluntarism an element that is as much philosophical as practi cal in nature increasingly the argument is raised that founda tions and corporati o ns should expand considerably their charitable activities to alleviate the burden on other segments of philan see stuart butler philanthrow in america washington d c the heritage foundation 1980 b m charity under siege reeulations of

implications of the the urban 3 ropy will increase their contributions significantly given the exist ing regulat i ons and tax law but it is by no means obvious that corporations should be major sponsors of charity a discussion of the appropriaterole of corporations and foundations in philan thropy must therefore accompany an assessment of the outlook for voluntari sm not only is there doubt that foundations and corporations i part i can the gap be filled the budget cuts although the urban institute analysis of the budget changes was completed before the budget bill passed congress the differ ence between the adm inistration s proposals and the final outcome are not large enough to materially affect the study s claim that charitable non profit organizations will lose approximately 27 billion in government funding during 1981 1984 constitute almost one third of the i r direct government support in addition the study claims reductions in federal outlays in areas of interest to non profit groups will result in pressure on such groups to increase their public services organizations to finance existing services previou s ly funded by government without regard to new demands private giving allegedly would have to increase at three times the rate of previous years as proof that an impossible task faces the voluntary sector seem to ignore an important caveat in the study thi s report makes no effort to assess the merits of the budget proposals advanced by the current administration either with respect to particular proposals or with respect to the package as a whole the focus of atten tion is on what the proposals are and w h at they will mean for non profit organizations not on whether they are desirable or ndesirable this would for the non profit the independent sector and others who cite these conclusions in other words the study includes no assessment of the worth of pr o grams cut in the budget in calculating the gap the assumption is that for every dollar reduction in government support to a non profit organization a private dollar must be found to replace it this may be a necessary assumption to make in order to arr i ve at a llneutralll conclusion but it weakens the study as a guide to future needs although the budget cuts were generally intended to reduce the level of federal spending the administration did not cut at random but sought to concentrate the reductio n s in areas where government funding was of question able efficiency such as salamon budget proposals p 4 4 a reductions in waste fraud and ineffective programs several of the programs cut or eliminated were wasteful and unnecessarily bureaucratic out many research awards and other expenditures finance activities of highly questionable value seem to be more interested in obtaining and consuming government grants than in providing tangible assistance to anyone waste of this kind now be financed b y the private sector as senator proxmire often has pointed and many ilservicell organizations must many government supported programs have been of marginal use while others arguably have been counterproductive certain community development programs for example seem to have done little to develop communities and some may even have exacerbated the problems of depressed neighborhoods the public sector ceta program for instance has often been accused of providing little real training and of inculcating n egative attitudes about private sector employment in addition many welfare programs have trapped their recipients in a state of dependency rather than providing a ladder out of poverty although there would be considerable debate over the value of the p articular programs cut it is clearly not valid to view all the cuts as necessarily requiring some alternative sources of support allowed to die in many other cases enormous waste can be reduced without impairing the quality of services provided in som e cases programs cut should be reduced and even b activities to be financed directlv bv rechients a part of the budget cutbacks for the arts and education such as the new needs test for student loans rests on the contention that users of some service s hould pay directly for the cost while this involves trimming federal support of certain non profit organizations it does not mean that there is a gap to be filled by private donations the gap such as it is is to be covered by the beneficiaries organiz a tions would lose federal funding the urban institute study also examined the effect of the 1981 tax act on the incentives for charitable donations in addition to an analysis of the degree to which non profit the tax act individual income tax rates spokesm e n for the voluntary sector have expressed consider able concern over the effect that the reduction in individual income tax rates will have on charitable giving stated simply the argument is that the higher a taxpayer s marginal tax rate the more a ch a ritable deduction is worth and thus the lower is the ttpricelf of a gift a taxpayer in the top 70 percent bracket prior to the new law for instance would pay only 30 llout of pockettt for a 100 donation the new law raises this net cost of giving bec a use the top rate in 1982 will be 50 percent the 5 after tax cost of the 100 gift will be 50 in rates for the other brackets will have a similar effect in every case the new law will make charitab1 e contributions more expensive compared with other wa y s of spending one s income the 25 percent cut there is strong evidence for the contention that the price effect tends to reduce charitable giving but only if all other things are equal 4 price sensiti y is more pronounced at higher income levels than at lower high income donors tend to give more heavily to educa tional and health organizations than to welfare or religious groups and so the across the board tax cut can be expected to affect health and educational bodies to a greater degree than other n o n profit organizations the evidence further suggests complicating the calculation of the aggregate effects of the tax cut however are a number of factors a deductions for non itemizers only taxpayers who itemize deductions are influenced by the price e f fect under normal circumstances for the more than 60 percent of taxpayers concentrated in the lower and middle income ranges who take the standard deduction the price of giving has been the full amount contributed the 1981 tax act however contains a provision allowing non itemizers a special deduction on the short tax form this effectively reduces the price of donations by the amount of the taxpayer s marginal rate if a taxpayer is in the 30 percent bracket and does not itemize his deductions a 100 gift to charity has meant an out of pocket cost of 1 00 but under the new law the donor will be able to deduct charitable gifts from his taxable income and then take the standard deduction itemizing taxpayer in the 30 percent bracket will cost him only 70 until 1985 a ceiling will restrict this specia l deduction after that there will be no limit so a future 100 donation by a non although contributions by lower income donors tend to be less price sensitive than those by high income taxpayers the special deduction should stimulate gifts to organizati o ns supported by non itemizers in particular churches and social welfare organizations martin feldstein and lawrence lindsey of the national bureau of economic research estimate that the special see for example martin feldstein tax incentives and c h aritable contri butions national tax journal 1975 martin feldstein and amy taylor the income tax and charitable contributions econometrica 1976 feld stein testimony before the subcommittee on taxation senate

brookings institution 1981 6 deduction will increase total philanthropy by 12 percent will offs e t at least part of the price effect stemming from the this tax cut b income effects the negative effect of a reduction in marginal tax rates will also be offset by changes in the income of donors both as a direct result of the tax cut and because of fu ture growth in the economy the more money people earn the more generous their giving be a set of assumptions regarding the growth of the economy but there is no consensus on what that level of growth will be central to any projection of giving in the f uture must c switching a third albeit minor complication involves the manner in which gifts are made the tax act is so sweeping in its scope that it is likely to prompt changes in the pattern of giving the reduction in estate taxes for example may r educe the level of bequests to charity but donors could simply switch all or time thus swelling the aggregate of gifts by living individuals this would depend on whether a donor wished to defer a contribution until his death or simply wanted to give u n der the most favorable tax treatment there are several other similar tax changes which will be summarized later the interaction of these changes makes the net effect of the tax act very difficult to project accurately if the analysis is confined to only one form of giving even if that method is the most common part of their intended contributions to gifts during their life i i the urban institute study6 the recent urban institute study on the implications of the tax act for philanthropy has been widely q uoted as concluding that individual contributions to churches colleges hospitals and other non profit organizations will fall by a total of over 18 billion during the next four years their earlier estimates of the losses to be suffered from the budge t cuts the combined shortfall could be 45 billion between 1981 1984 lllossil would be from reduced giving by individuals in the top seven tax brackets and so the greatest impact would be felt by organizations supported by higher income donors study rest s on certain assumptions critical to its conclusions

nonstandard behavior table contributions cambridge massachusetts national bureau of economic an application to the tax treatment of chari research 1981 see note 2 7 once again these caveats were largely ignored in the media interpretations of the s tudy the principal assumptions and limitations of the study are a the exclusive focus on charitable donations by living individuals foundations corporations and bequests are not included the authors defend these omissions on the grounds that reliabl e analyses of the giving behavior of these other donors are not available and that contributions by living individuals account for well over 80 percent of to al charitable giving b income and donations that have been observed in the past study simply a s sumes that there will be no

used the present admini s tration s forecast for 1981 1984 basing projections on the relationships between tax the c using the carter administration s economic forecast to for their projection limiting the analysis to living individuals may appear to be a valid approach while t h e tax law does change the treatment of contributions by corporations and foundations these probably will result in only a modest change in donations in any case individual support dominates total giving on the other hand 60 percent of gifts by living i ndividuals are donated to religious organizations such gifts are a negligible proportion of donations by other segments of philanthropy of giving corporations and foundations account for over one fifth thus confining the study to living individuals g r eatly skews the outcome of the non religious element the second and third assumptions are even more problematical the study concludes that under the reagan tax act and economic scenario charitable giving in real terms will increase faster during the nex t four years than during the last four years a 14 percent total increase compared with 13 3 percent study s projections of giving under the new tax act suggest a rate of increase that is greater than the trend in recent years how can the study conc lude that there will be an 18 billion loss during 1981 1984 the answer using the carter economic forecast and tax law the study projected a quite remarkable upturn in individual giving compared with 1976 19 80 over the next four years said the study giv ing would have increased by 25 percent double the rate of increase during the last four years as table istrates it would also have meant a complete reversal of the present downward trend of individual giving as a percentage of

while the authors estimate that the rate of giving under reagan will increase they also claim that contributions to health and education will fall by 3 percent in real terms between 1981 and 1984 wi1 1 enjoy most of the increase gifts to health and educational organizations showed virtually no increase in r eal terms during the 1970 so a decline of 3 percent would not be a major departure from the present trend if one were to accept all the assumptions and reasoning of the study moreover corporations and foundations are heavy supporters of health and edu c ation contributions are split between these areas and about 20 vercent of all support to higher education comes from foundations consequently the future pattern of contributions to these two areas is likely to be influenced very strongly by factors th at were not examined by the study religious and social welfare organizations but this must be seen in context roughly two thirds of all corporate see butler philanthropy in america p 3 ibid 9 p 31 9 not only is the study s benchmark projection of g iving under the pre 1981 law very suspect but the assumption that the basic pattern of giving will remain unchanged over the next four years is also contentious patterns do change over time in constant dollars giving to religious organizations has ris e n steadily during the last twenty years hand doubled between 1960 and 1970 and then grew very little over the next ten years donations to welfare organizations measured in constant dollars actually fell between 1960 and 1970 while support to health more than doubled philanthropy patterns are complex and can change greatly in a relatively short period gifts to education on the other voodoo voluntarism the urban institute study assumes that the supply and demand for charitable dollars are completel y unrelated trends for the next four years the authors assume that a person s desire to give is simply a function of the price of giving which depends on the tax rate and the level of his income the princi pal reason why giving was projected to rise so rapidly under the pre 1981 law was because bracket creeptl would have lowered the marginal cost of donations the decision to give in other words is considered in the study to be exclusively a lfsupp1y side1 phenomenon to borrow a phrase bearing n o relation to any change in demand for charitable dollars supply and demand are unconnected is a serious and very fundamen tal flaw which could discredit the study and leave it as merely an interesting example of voodoo voluntarism there are very strong reasons to suppose that donors take into account perceived needs when they contribute funds do respond to appeals cuts there will be strong appeals for donations if the flexible patterns of the past are a guide the structure of giving will shift in f avor of those organizations hurt by the cuts and seen by the public as socially valuable to meet new needs is what may be called a ttcrowding outll theory of philanthropy according to this hypothesis people within a society have a view of what they feel to be an appropriate level of public services in each field time depending on attitudes and the wealth of the society and the range of services thought necessary sector in the form of fees or donations or by government if government funding of a par t icular service increases private support will tend to fall this is due in part to the popular feeling that private money is needed less to the disinclination of people to contribute twice to the same organization first in the form of a tax and then a s a charitable donation government support of charities according to the theory has the effect of ltcrowding outll private funding in assessing the assumption that people and as a direct result of federal budget another reason why we can expect charitab l e giving to increase this level will change over these services can be financed either through the private and it is due in part 10 there is historical evidence to support the theory the increase in government expenditures on public services has been acc o mpanied by an erosion of private funding in many countries the great charities of victorian england have declined in impor tance in the wake of the british welfare state in america the same trend is noticeable private donations to health education a n d welfare organizations have stagnated in real terms in the years since the great society programs were enacted operate in reverse which the public deems worthy of support private giving will increase to them will assist popular charities in their r e quests for private help and provide a stimulus to giving thus altering the pattern of support and the tax cuts rather than reducing the desire to give as supposed by the urban institute researchers may on balance tend to increase giving because don o rs will see fewer dollars pre empted by government the future pattern of giving therefore probably will have very little to do with the state of the economy previous patterns of giving or even the price of gifts it is more likely to be the product of a desire by the public to fund services that are considered of value to society in other words a simple case of philanthropy if the crowding out theory is correct it should also as government aid is cut to orqanizations the depth of the budget cuts a n d the publicity given the tax act estate and gift taxes in addition to changes in taxes on income the 1981 act contained certain other provisions that will affect gifts made by individuals the most important of these is probably the modifi cation of th e tax on estates and gifts under the pre 1981 law estates and accumulated gifts greater than 175 625 were liable to a tax ranging from 18 percent to 70 percent a spouse however could inherit half of an estate free of this tax threshhold in incremen ts to 600 000 in 1987 and reduces the maximum rate on taxable gifts and estates to 50 percent by 1986 the exclusion from tax of transfers to a spouse is raised to 100 percent and a lower valuation for farm and other real business property will be used for tax purposes furthermore the annual level of gifts allowed as an exclusion from the tax is to climb from 3 000 per donee to 10 000 the effect of these changes will be to increase the price i e after tax cost of bequests and lifetime gifts to cha rity relative to disposals for other purposes the degree to which this will affect total giving however is difficult to determine it may cause a significant fall in the level of contributions to colleges and other organizations traditionally funded t h rough bequests form of gift rather than in the amount some donors for in stance may create a foundation rather than provide for a bequest the new law raises the tax free gift and estate on the other hand it may cause an alteration in the i 11 there is understandable concern among college administrators about the net effect of these new provisions raisers point out that the increase in the tax free allowances will not substantially change the tax liability of the multi million dollar estates that a r e the source of so many bequests richard winter director of deferred giving at rice university noted recently that large contributors tend to have estates much greater than 600 000 tax problems i he said g a provision in the tax act may encourage ce r tain kinds of support to education and health organizations excludes tuition payments traininq fees and medical payments from the 10 000 annual tax free gift allowance there is no ceiling on this exclusion nor restriction on the relationship between t he donor and the donee so there will be a tax incentive for donors who take the full annual gift tax exclusion to consider providing scholarships and hence funds for education but several fund the major donors are still going to have the new law part 11 foundations corporations and voluntarism to non profit organizations increasing attention is being given to the role of foundations and corporations pressure is mounting for them to expand their charitable activities this raises two questions provid e more support to cha y qiven the present tax law and regulations and what should their role be while individuals provide over 80 percent of private support to what extent can foundations and corporations the tax act and foundations under the pre 1981 la w private grant making foundations were required to distribute annually either 5 percent of their net investment assets or their realized new income whichever was the greater limited to 5 percent of assets this change should help to reverse a trend tha t seemed destined to lead to the extinction of the private foundation as an important source of charitable funds the payout requirement was instituted in 1969 to ensure that foundations distributed a reasonable share of their income each year the 1970s however were a period in which the real value of equity investments fell while the income yields of most assets rose other than private foundations could defend their assets by holding high yield instruments and reinvesting the proceeds but the payout requirement prevented foundations from using this strategy to build up their financial base the base eroded and the ability to give consequently declined as a result gifts by in the new law this minimum payout requirement is tax exempt bodies the wall s treet journal july 28 1981 12 foundations measured in constant dollars have fallen by almost half since 1969 and according to the council of foundations the total real value of foundation assets has been reduced by about 40 percent that all net inc o me must be disbursed will enable survivina the new flat 5 percent minimum instead of the requirement foundations to stimulate the the old payout foundations repair the damage of the last twelve years a6d formation of new foundations since the rigidity o f requirement discouraged donors from establishing the tax act and corporations pre 1981 law allowed a corporation to deduct no more than 5 this percent of its taxable income as charitable contributions was raised to 10 percent by the new law tions cre ated by non profit organizations the ceiling on tax free unrelated business income remains at 5 percent for tax exempt corpora some spokesmen for non profit groups seem to assume that raising the limit on deductible corporate contributions will unleash a torrent of donations yet the 5 percent rule has hardly been a severe obstacle while some corporations may have felt restricted by the ceiling the average level of corporate donations in recent years has been closer to 1 percent than 5 percent the i n creased limit thus is not going to facilitate any constrained desire to give moreover the new depreciation sche dules and other business tax relief will reduce the taxable income of most companies especially in the short term this can only reduce the tax incentives for corporate philanthropy the corporate world does seem to be coming under strong pressure however to increase donations there have always been those who see corporations as a convenient source of money to finance any number of causes without regard to the function of corporations or the economic consequences of such a strategy these people are now arguing that an increase in corporate philan thropy is the price that business is obligated to pay for its tax relief while this kind of sentiment is expected from the usual critics of american business similar notions are

sector liaison remarked in a national journal interview iii don t think that the administration will hold th e corporate sector accountable i think the american people will we won t point out the good an d bad performances but the american people will 1f1e and if they thinly veiled threats and arm the national journal september 19 1981 pp 1668 1669 13 don t rosebush might have added ralph nader and his associates will be delighted to do so yet even if corporations responded to this kind of pressure and greatly expanded their giving they could not cover the reduction in federal support without severe cuts in their invest ment programs corporations account for only 5 percent of chari table contributions if the administration continues to jawbone corporations and to tell the public that business will come to the rescue it will achieve little more than providing its own critics with a very effective stick but is it correct to suppose that corporations should try to fill the gap even if they could charity for various personal reasons and they allocate their funds accordingly corporations on the other hand can hardly be said to have charitable instincts in any meaningful sense t hey are operated by managers of other people s money and the proper goal of the managers is to achieve the best return for the shareholders in so doing they also efficiently provide services and goods to the public engage in charitable activities the motivation is and should be a function of normal business goals individuals give money to when corporations in a free society within this framework charitable activities can have very tangible economic returns in certain circumstances and donations shou l d be seen strictly in that way support to colleges and training programs or for research can be a sensible way for a corporation to develop new techniques and a skilled workforce similarly there are often good reasons of mutual self interest behind c o rporate support for local community development groups a stable improving urban environment benefits the businesses as well as the residents of the city should blindly support charity out of some notion of corporate ilconsciencell is irrational at wor s e an increase in contributions would be little more than a begrudged and wasteful payoff to avoid harassment and at best it would be inefficient since the allocation decisions would be devoid of any element of individual obligation or charitable instin c t moreover the corporations would be simply controlling charitable dollars that should be allocated by shareholders in which the distribution of funds to charity reflects the cumula tive decisions of individuals rather than the boards of corporate ame r ica but the argument that business surely it is better to have a situation the best way that a corporation can f contributelf is through its owners the shareholders who are the corporation the duty of corporate managers is to provide revenue to the shar eholders it is the duty of shareholders to give to charity this is not to say that corporations cannot play an important role in providing services to the public but rather that this should be done in the context of normal business activities many priv ate firms deliver services under contract and they are 14 often much more efficient than either government or non profit organizations the for profit hospitals for example have an excellent record of providinq value for money dized job training prog r ams in the private sector have a far better track record than the wasteful ceta public jobs proqram cut by the administration corporations as a partner in the provision of necessary public services than to see them as a convenient source of tfguilttt mon e y similarly subsi it would be more sensible to view mobilizing the voluntary sector the president s task force on private sector initiatives will explore methods of expanding voluntarism and examine mecha nisms to increase support for non profit organi z ations while the trgaplf is narrower than many suppose and there is great potential in the sector there are nevertheless laws and regula tions that needlessly impede the voluntary sector in its efforts to respond to the challenge before it address th e se in addition it should be recognized that money is not the only issue innovative uses of voluntary sector resources should identify these and encourage other organizations to learn from them but the task force must there are some remarkable examples of the task force some of these problems and possibilities are summarized a the regulation of fundraisinq fundraising activities will have to increase considerably if the voluntary sector is to obtain the finance necessary to expand its role in providing services but the recent growth of govern ment restrictions on fundraising poses a serious obstacle his book charity under siege bruce hopkins a charity law expert described the nature of th is i1onslaughtlf of regulation below in fundraising regulat ion has not come upon the voluntary sector by means of a single law but is instead an amalgam of slowly building and encompassing local state and federal administrative regulation it is an unfortunate fact that the charitable world is now wholly expos ed to creeping regulation by federal state and local agencies while this re ulation inten sifies the charities seem immobilized l the greatest problem of all according to hopkins confronts organizations which seek to raise money by direct mail in se v eral states these groups face l1 hopkins charity under siege p viii 15 a bewildering array of differing requirements forms due dates exemptions and accounting principles all too frequently the organization solves this problem by registering in only a few states or perhaps in none at all regulation is not confined to mail fundraising however complex rules apply to virtually all aspects of funding activities by all non profit organizations the growth of most groups and cause others to ceas e their activi ties completely comply with the law the effect is to increase fundraising costs and to provide employment for lawyers and accountants these regulations discourage for those groups which try to understand and the task force should review t he debilitating federal burden on the voluntary sector and suggest ways in which state and local rules could be simplified path of existing organizations would be reduced and the formation of new voluntary groups would be encouraged by doing so obstac l es in the b taxes and restrictions on contributions12 the tax reform act of 1969 included substantial changes in the tax deductibility of gifts of appreciated property including stock to charitable organizations the proportion of the appre ciation in market value that could be deducted was cut severely for both individuals and corporations in the case of gifts to private foundations even lower deduction limits were imposed inflation during the 1970s and 1980s in conjunction with these changes ha s reduced the attractiveness of such gifts this has been particularly harmful to private foundations and has accele rated their decline the task force should examine these effects closely and suggest a new framework of legislation that will treat gif ts of appreciated property in the light of today s rate of inflation in addition the distinction between private foundations and other charitable organizations must be ended if the foundations are to be revived the 1981 law contained a little noticed wovision which could prove damaging to many non profit groupk the tax rates on unrelated business taxable income were reduced in line with the general cut on corporate rates however the new 10 percent ceiling on tax free income that can be contributed will not apply to unrelated business income earned by non profits latter case the old 5 percent limit continues in the l2 l3 for a general account of this issue see butler philanthropy in america that is income from a business owned by a non profit organization where the income results from operations which are unrelated to the charity s tax exempt activities for example a coffee shop run by a church 16 the tax on unrelated business income was instituted in 1950 to end unfair competition in the m arket place by putting busi nesses operated by charities on the same tax footing as any other business reater tax burden for charity subsidiaries not only is this b of the principle of equal treatment but it is particularly regrettable because many o f the charitable organizations which once relied heavily on government support are now in the process of creating business ventures to supplement their funding this process should have been helped not hindered by the new tax law but the new law will resu l t in a relatively foundations in addition to the regulations affecting fundraising private foundations have been inundated in recent years with restrictions on almost every part of their activities that must be filed with the federal government and the close scrutiny that is required in the case of grants to individuals have discouraged foundations from supporting new ideas government policy has forced foundations to become more bureaucratic and conservative as marian edelman of the children s defens e fund remarked recently to obtain foundation support for a thoughtful proposal these days ifthe burden of proof is more substantial than it used to be ff14 the extensive reports these restrictions grew largely out of a perception in the 1950s and 1960s t hat foundations were merely unaccountable tax havens some reforms were clearly necessary but the pendulum has now swung too far in the other direction private foundation must be reversed because these organizations play a key role in philanthropy a ro l e which is now more important than ever in view of the new demands on the voluntary sector foundations are sources of finance but they are much more than that voluntary sector thomas the decline of the they are the entrepreneurs and catalysts of the a c cording to ford foundation president franklin there is a growing need for foundations to play a connective role in society to link private sector resources with the energies of people in the community who are trying to address problems whether these peop l e are in community groups or social agencies that work for the public s benefit 15 this entrepreneurial feature will be vital in the new era of voluntarism the infusion of organizational skills combined with modest amounts of seed money is likely to in duce far more activity than simply providing large amounts of cash organizations are seeking ways of delivering new services and voluntary l4 l5 ibid u s news and world report march 23 1981 p 62 17 stabilizing their financial base foundations can aid that process and make it more efficient but they must be allowed to do so p rivatization and contracting in his speech to the national alliance of business president reagan drew attention to the work of one philadelphia organizatiqn operated by a ma rried couple the house of umoja on a shoestring budget has been responsible for turning 500 former gang members into responsible citizens and has helped to achieve a remarkable reduction in gang warfare the house of umoja is a highly successful exampl e of something that has been happening all over america small self help groups either supplementing public services or providing entirely new ones many of these unorthodox groups fail or at least do not reach their full potential because they find th e mselves frustrated by government rather than being helped by it the task force should monitor and publicize the achievements of these organizations and it should identify and press for the removal of barriers to them small inner city day care centers for example are often hampered by absurdly rigid licensing requirements which protect nobody self help housing rehabilita tion groups can find their costs soaring because of the davis bacon act the list is endless government can also help the finances of community based and other organizations while alleviating some of its own budget worries cities should consider contracting with non pro fit organizations to provide services which they can deliver more efficiently neighborhood groups for instance c an often provide cheaper and more effective management services for public housing projects than can professionals government should experiment with contracts of this form funding and experience for the non profit groups and they can result in considera b le savings to the city in addition cities and states should encourage businesses to bid for contracts when appropriate such as for job training and educational programs they are a source of valuable conclusion the budget cuts and tax reductions set in m otion by the reagan administration constitute a long overdue attempt to shift both power and responsiblity back to the people the voluntary sector will play a central role in this process and the admini stration must enable and encourage the sector to m eet the challenge in view of the restrictions imposed on the voluntary sector during the last twenty years it is perhaps not surprising that many of its representatives are pessimistic but the evidence indicates that the task is much less daunting than is generally supposed and that americans will respond to the obligations placed on them 18 but government must help the voluntary sectoramake the transition unnecessary obstacles to voluntarism must be identi fied and removed and every individual sho u ld be given encourage ment to increase their giving corporations should not be pres sured into fulfilling a function which is inappropriate to their role in society perverse tax incentives and regulations and their revival should be a priority the en t repreneurial skills of foundations will be desparately needed as non profit organizations adjust to the new era voluntary associations engaged in unorthodox solutions to the problems of providing public services must be given full rein foundations are in dire straits thanks to above all the vast potential offered by the countless stuart m butler ph d policy analyst
spoiler alert do not proceed if you have not watched the series premiere of paramount s 1923 did 1923 just hint at a major dutton death the yellowstone prequel launched sunday on paramount introducing harrison ford s jacob and helen mirren s cara dutton john dutton iii s kevin costner great great uncle and great great aunt as well as a new cast of characters to the franchise but one of the main members of the dutton family may not be long for this world narrated by the late elsa 1883 s isabel may who died in the 1883 finale after being shot by an arrow the prequel issues a tragic warning for this generation of the dutton clan hinting that one of her two surviving brothers will die before the series is over my father had three children elsa says in voiceover early in the episode referring to herself and her siblings john sr james badge dale and spencer brandon sklenar their parents are james and margaret dutton who were played by tim mcgraw and faith hill in 1883 only one would live to see their own children grow only one would carry the fate of this family through the depression and every other hell the 20th century hurled at them the ominous tease raises a lot of questions for 1923 over which of elsa s brothers who were raised by jacob like his own children after he found a widowed margaret frozen to death will be the one to perish and the circumstances that lead to his eventual death in the first episode there are barely any hints as to whether it s john who spends much of the episode serving as jacob s right hand man or spencer a world war i vet who left home some years ago and is in nairobi hunting the wildlife that s been terrorizing various camps because the first episode ends on a shocking cliffhanger a wild leopard unexpectedly pounces on spencer during one of his midnight stake outs it s natural for one to think that he is the dutton brother whose mortality clock may be ticking considering the story is just beginning we re not 100 percent sold yet while this 1923 mystery will be one to track as the yellowstone prequel carries on the premiere episode sets the table for what s to come paramount jacob and cara dutton as elsa narrates jacob and cara came into the picture after the death of her father james her mother margaret wrote to jacob pleading with him to bring his family to montana to save hers and when he arrived he and cara raised john sr and spencer as their own after finding their mother frozen to death jacob took james dream and turned yellowstone ranch into an empire but then as elsa warns the empire crumbled in present day 1923 jacob discovers cattle and sheep are dying and they don t know what s killing them at a local hearing in the city center an irish rancher and sheep herder banner creighton jerome flynn expresses his suspicions over what s killing his sheep and he and jacob who also holds office as a commissioner have a tense exchange in the town hall outside banner confronts jacob over the livelihood of his stock and it s clear he s going to be a problem while jacob and his men prepare to drive their cattle up the mountain so they can survive the summer cara attempts to busy herself as she worries over whether her husband will come home safely during a late night trek banner tells his men to cut the wires after they reach the border of the duttons claimed land knowing full well the repercussions of his decision will likely start a war as they cut through the barbed wire they shuffle their sheep through opening up a whole can of worms spencer dutton after serving in wwi spencer finds himself in africa where his nomadic existence leads him to hunting down wild leopards and lions that are posing a danger to others settling in the african safari though it s unclear why he chose to distance himself from the rest of the duttons back at the yellowstone ranch it s obvious he s still experiencing trauma from his time out on the battlefield after having another violent nightmare spencer nearly shoots an innocent train conductor when he arrives at the nairobi station meanwhile cara writes a letter to spencer adding context as to why he s in africa and not in montana with the rest of the family imploring him to return home while also updating him on all that is happening at the ranch there s a sense of urgency and confusion in her words implying that spencer left under non ideal circumstances when the house is full and the ranch is busy i can lose myself in the hurry of it and forget you re not here cara writes as jacob and the others are off driving the cattle but the house is empty i have no chores left and so i think of you and wonder why why won t you come home to us i can t help but think that your absence is punishment that somehow we are the reason you won t return she continues on that s selfish i suppose war changes men i can only assume you are seeking a part of yourself you lost and i can only pray that you find it and come back to us during his adventures in nairobi spencer and his two men think they re capturing one wild leopard on their latest job but as they soon discover it s actually two after a married woman openly flirts with spencer at dinner hours earlier spencer sees her leave her tent late in the evening to relieve herself after taking his eyes off her for a few seconds he notices she s gone one of the leopards silently attacked her in those few seconds as spencer would discover moments later discovering her bloodied lifeless body on the ground after shooting the leopard dead but spencer has no time to rest as those seconds turn out to vital as he s warned about a second leopard with no time to spare by the time he learns the information it s too late as he turns around only to be met with the leopard attacking him paramount jack dutton the eldest son of john sr and his wife emma marley shelton jack darren mann is engaged to be married to elizabeth strafford michelle randolph on a wednesday however issues regarding the cattle force their wedding to be postponed another week or two as jack joins jacob john sr and the others to drive the cows up over the mountain so they won t die of course the actual conversation between jack and his bride to be about delaying the wedding another week goes about as well as you d expect with elizabeth hysterical that he d choose cattle over her knowing full well that jack would not be able to handle the situation well cara comes to the rescue and talks elizabeth down telling her that she must understand that the cattle always come first but there is a freedom to that if she chooses to that life you will be free in a way that most people can barely conceive cara pitches to the young bride you have to want more than the boy you have to want the life too because in this life there s no debating which is more important the wedding or the cattle it s always the cattle whatever cara says works as elizabeth tells her she ll learn how to be a rancher s wife the matter of the wedding postponement is settled as jack and elizabeth will now get married two weeks from saturday as the two lovebirds passionately reunite after their fight elizabeth s dad bob tim dekay and jacob look on bob says a remark about the young couple who are very much in love and jacob hints that whatever comes from their union that he must not question it especially when it comes to pregnancies and babies is 1923 hinting that elizabeth is already or will be pregnant very soon possibly to john dutton ii john dutton iii s father in my experience bob when the first baby comes you don t want to be too picky with your math on the calendar jacob tells his fellow rancher who s seems less than enthused that his daughter is marrying jack soon after the wedding is officially delayed jack joins the group in driving the cattle up the mountain not long after they embark on their weeks long trek jack faces his first big test when he discovers banner creighton s herd of sheep have crossed into their territory paramount teonna and sister mary elsewhere teonna aminah nieves a young woman attending a residential boarding school for native americans suffers abuse at the hands of sister mary jennifer ehle and later headmaster father renaud sebastian roche the excruciating moment comes after she fails to correctly answer a question asked by sister mary in the classroom and talks back at her prompting the sister to continuously beat teonna s hands raw teonna reaches her limit punching sister mary multiple times before she and sister mary are brought to father renaud s office at first it appears father renaud is on teonna s side punishing the nun by beating her hands red with a wooden paddle and when teonna pleads with him to have mercy on sister mary he warns her with a menacing look not to undermine her and him ever again i understand your desire to lash out at a sister who lacks compassion but you lash out all will lash out he threatens before asking her to face the bookshelves for her own form of punishment as he prepares to punish her too i have compassion for you my child i do i have compassion but i have no mercy father renaud proceeds to hit her with the wooden paddle multiple times her piercing screams of pain echoing through the hallway later at the bath the severity of teonna s injuries are revealed and it s devastating to see her in pain as she tries to clean herself when sister mary approaches her during inspection blood trickles down teonna s legs from the rawness of father renaud s beatings the sister and teonna are at a mutual understanding now that they both need to steer clear of his office at bedtime teonna shows a friend the scarring that s starting to show on her legs from her punishment and she says she plans to put honey and cedar sap to hopefully help with the scarring as no man will want to marry her if he sees the extent of her injuries teonna though has her eye on the big picture wondering why they haven t received any letters from friends or family suggesting that they never made it home to write them her goal now is clear get out before it s too late new episodes of 1923 drop sundays on paramount paramount network will

archived document may contain errors the future of europe by antonio martino am very grateful to ed feulner for having invited me today and for choosing the title of this lecture in the seven months during which i was foreign minister i received the most violent criticisms from european federalists who accused me of practically e verything be cause of my views on european monetary unification and on the future of europe in general for example ii cor7iere della sera once the most authoritative now just the largest sell ing newspaper in italy on the eve of the franco italian su m mit in aix en provence published an article titled italy betrays europe attributing the expression in quote marks to franqois mitterrand the subtitle explained that the french president had harshly criticized foreign minister martino s views on the m aastricht treaty all of this was plainly false as president mitterrand made a point of telling me the following day and as his porte parole made clear in an apologetic letter to the italian ambassador in paris stating that coryiere della sera had s o if ossly misquoted him as to make him say exactly the opposite of what he had actually said another example of the fair treatment given to my views on europe by federalists left wingers and assorted lunatics was offered by an editorial in the weekly l espresso in which i was blamed for the depreciation of the lira because of my criticism of the maastricht strategy of monetary unification 2 on the other hand my views on europe are usually con sidered optimistic if not outright federalist by englis h euro skeptics so that i welcome this opportunity to clarify my position 3 europe s monetary futur i am convinced that to a very large extent the future of the european union depends on the strategy of monetary unification we are going to follow in the next few years should we continue with the present strategy based on gradual convergence according to the maas tricht parameters a common currency for europe is unlikely to be achieved furthermore the convergence paradigm might result in the divis i on of europe in the separation of the group of virtuous countries that have succeeded in meeting maastricht s arbitrary criteria from all other european countries presumably unfit to be admitted to the exclusive club of the virtuous such an outcome w o uld represent yet another illustration of the disastrous po litical consequences of unsound economic decisions in order to illustrate this view i shall analyze the future of europe s monetary unification in the light of the experience of the past twent y five years and in the perspective of what i consider a necessary revision of our strategy i maintain that pegging the exchange rates and trying to impose uniform convergence criteria on all european countries not only will pro duce undesirable conseque n ces but will not bring us any closer to a common european currency that outcome depends on whether we adopt a monetary constitution or not on whether that is we succeed in spelling out a set of rules of monetary conduct capable of providing adequate g uarantees against european monetary mismanagement 4 in other antonio martino served as foreign minister of italy from april 1994 to january 1995 he spoke at the heritage foundation on april 26 1995 issn 0272 1155 0 1995 by the heritage foundation w ords a monetary rule is a necessary precondition for moving toward a common european currency if on the other hand money continues to be used as an instrument of discretion ary polity monetary unification is unlikely to be achieved 5 therefore tho s e of us who believe that monetary unification is desirable should concen trate on identifying the rules most suited to that end advantages of a common currency 6 let me start by refuting some mistaken notions on the need for monetary union first of all it s simply not true that a single market is unachievable without monetary unification it is perfectly possible to have one without the other commonwealth countries had a com mon currency without economic integration canada and the u s a have econom i c integration without a common currency at present we have a single european market with out a european currency secondly it s dubious to say the least that claiming that there is a fundamental link between political and monetary union would brin g us closer to a com mon currency for europe 7 but would europe benefit from a common currency if for the moment we ignore both the difficulties of achieving that result and the preoccupations with the conduct of monetary policy after the establishmen t of a common currency the an swer is positive europe and the world would probably benefit a great deal from a common european currency interestingly enough most commentators seem convinced that the only advantage of a common currency for europe would be that of reducing uncertainty in foreign exchange markets 8 1 do not wish to deny the importance of reduced uncertainty in foreign exchange markets and of a saving in transactions costs but first of all i think it s reductive to see no other ad vanta g e in a common currency for europe as i shall try to show there are other possibly more relevant advantages secondly i believe it is this reductive interpretation of the bene fits of a common currency that has led to the fallacious identification of monetary unification with fixed exchange rates which is responsible for some of the difficulties which we have encountered thus far let me first start to list what i consider to be some of the main advantages other than the reduction in transactions cos t s international stability a common european currency could provide an alternative to the u s dollar as an instrument of international liquidity the national currency of such a large market could achieve the same degree of acceptability presently enj o yed by the dollar the competition between the two major international currencies would result in some kind of gresham s law in reverse because the more stable currency would be preferred in international transactions the overall stability of the inter n ational monetary system would increase 9 in particular europe would benefit in that it would be able to use its own currency rather than the u s dollar as a reserve asset 10 needless to say this would not be a minor advantage and by itself might i n fact be as important as if not more important than the saving in transactions costs the u s would also benefit to the extent that a monetary system based on two currencies would make the external value of the dollar less volatile balance of payment s equilibrium inside europe a common currency would eliminate balance of payments problems making the adjustment process smooth and automatic there would be no balance of payments problems between say england and france because both countries would be using the same currency national economic policies would therefore be relieved of one of their present worries 2 internal stability with a common european currency provincial considerations would play no role in monetary decisions which woul d aim at overall stability rather than respond to local pressures as a result for example there would only be one rate of inflation rather than twelve this is a very important consideration indeed i know of no economist willing to argue that a prol i feration of regional currencies within a given country would increase overall monetary stability on a national level i i freedom and efficiency a common currency would make the liberalization of capital movements within europe automatic and irreversible with all the known advantages in terms of personal liberty and economic efficiency it would be as difficult to restrict capital movements in an area using the same currency as it is within a given country the overall efficiency of the single market wou l d be enhanced these are not necessarily all of the benefits from a common currency for europe but it seems to me that they are possibly more important than the advantage of reduced uncer tainty in foreign exchanges and of savings in transactions costs furthermore while the smoothness of the adjustment process and the elimination of balance of payments problems could also be achieved by a system of freely floating exchange rates among european na tional currencies all the other advantages can only be attained by a single currency for europe objections to a common currency several objections have been raised to the idea of adopting a single european currency while some are undoubtedly well founded if not insurmountable others are in my view defi nitely dubious here are some of the major objections the most common objection is that money does not manage itself discretionary mone tary management requires political control europe s present political institutions are inadequate for that kind o f task a variation on this theme is that the surrender of monetary sovereignty is unjustifiable at this point since the existing european political institutions could not guarantee member states that the common currency would be managed in a way of which they would approve another objection is that a common currency would be premature given the present het erogeneity of the various european national economies monetary unification according to this view should follow not precede economic integrati o n a third objection states that monetary unification would be beneficial to high inflation countries and harmful to low inflation countries the idea here is that with a common european currency inflation in europe would settle at some kind of ave rage of the existing national inflation rates finally there is a problem which is seldom explicitly stated money creation is an impor tant source of revenue for national governments and they are not ready to give it up easily are the objections valid none of the preceding objections is insuperable some are totally false for example dif ferent regions of the same national economy are often very heterogeneous yet this does not prevent them from using the same currency as previously mentioned no one has advo cated the introduction of separate regional currencies as an instrument to reduce national heterogeneity 3 a different version of this argument draws on keynesia nism a monetary union would pre vent individual member countries from each attaining their optimum combination of inflation and unemployment on the so called phillips curve i however asvaubel pointed out the tradeoff between inflation and unemploy m ent has disappeared and few econo mists today believe that much good can result from monetary instability from this point of view therefore vaubel s conclusion seems as valid today as it was fifteen years ago if na tional monetary policy can no l o nger be used to raise employment the economic cost of joining a monetary union must be small indeed 13 also there is no reason to suppose that a common currency would result in an inflation rate equal to the average of today s national rates if europ e would adopt a common cur rency it would have one rate of inflation rather than twelve which would be high or low depending on whether the rate of growth of the money supply at the european level was high or low the classification of countri e s as high inflation and low inflation is highly misleading because it suggests that somehow the degree of monetary stability in stability of a country is determined by some inevitable law of historical destiny and it has nothing to do with the cou n try s actual monetary policy monetary history provides irrefuta ble evidence that this is not the case it seems to me that there are only two valid objections to a common currency one is re lated to the use of money as an instrument of discretionary policy the other is connected with its use as a source of revenue by european national governments but before discuss ing these i shall make a few remarks on the transition process the transition process does all this mean that european monetary uni on let alone european political integra tion is not an aim worth striving for in my view such a conclusion would be premature it may very well be that european monetary union would be a great achievement but that the road by which we are trying to r each it is conducive to serious breakdowns and accidents and indeed does not lead to its ultimate destination what must worry all advocates of european integration is precisely that the choice of an unworkable strategy will again and this time fatally discredit the whole idea of a united western europe y4 vaubel was right even today much of the discredit surrounding the idea of a common european currency is due to the political attempts at planning a strategy for the transition process this is tru e of the earlier efforts as it is of the present one the original sin is that of identifying monetary unification with fixed exchange rates 15 it is an old mistake it was the basic assumption of the werner plan of 1970 of the 1972 snake and of the present european monetary system as for the maastricht strategy it is based on the notion that irrevocably fixed exchange rates between national currencies and coordination of policy between separate national authorities are necessary and sufficient f irst steps toward monetary union once fixed exchange rates are attained monetary unifica tion will be completed despite the experience of the past twenty five years we still proceed on the assumptions that fixed rates are almost indistinguishable fro m monetary union and a necessary step to ward that goal i find this view unacceptable 16 furthermore while a single european currency automatically implies a single monetary re gime and is therefore immune from balance of payments problems 17 a sy stem of fixed exchange rates among different national currencies does not it can survive if and only if it 4 succeeds in imposing coordinated patterns of behavior on all member countries this last possibility witness the events of september 1992 is rather remote 18 finally it isn t true that fixed exchange rates would bring europe closer to monetary uni fication in fact the opposite might very well be true 19 this is so because under fixed exchange rates domestic policy goals are at times i ncompatible with external balance when such a dichotomy arises the alternative to a change in the exchange rate is that of im posing the burden of the adjustment process on domestic macro variables balance of payments equilibrium is then achieved with o ut any change in the exchange rate parity but at the cost of sacrificing domestic stability such a choice is neither desirable nor likely to be made should a country find itself forced to choose between pursuing domestic policy goals or adhering to irr e vocably fixed rates it would most likely let the exchange rate adjust to a new equilibrium the arrange ment suggested by the present transition strategy is therefore unlikely to succeed needless to add the failure of the authorities to maintain th eir irrevocably fixed rates for an indefinite period of time would result in frustration and would discredit the idea of monetary unification gradualism and convergence the crucial error of identifying fixed exchange rates with monetary unification is p rob ably the result of a mistaken concept of gradualism gradualism is a very useful political tool but it can be applied only to problems which have a divisible solution it certainly can not be used for problems with an indivisible solution of the a l l or nothing type a common european currency is indivisible we either have it or we don t we cannot have just a bit of it 20 it has been possible to liberalize trade gradually because tariffs are divisible and can be reduced progressively but i don t s ee how a common currency can be divided into separate allotments to be incrementally added to the existing bundle and in any case fixed exchange rates do not represent the partial creation of a common currency similar considerations apply to the con v ergence criteria adopted at maastricht while fi nancial discipline is undeniably desirableperse it s hard to understand why financial convergence should be a precondition for a common currency belgium and luxembourg have a common currency despite wid e differences in their public finances as for economic performance regions within a given country show extensive variation in their economic structure rate of growth and unemployment yet these differences do not prevent them from using the same curren c y the obvious conclusion is that convergence is neither a nec essary nor a sufficient condition for monetary unification a common currency and fiscal discipline 21 a major obstacle in the introduction of a common european currency is the obvious one th a t money creation is an important source of revenue for national governments and we must assume that they are reluctant to give it up on the other hand this would also be one of the main advantages of a common european currency some supporters of a uni t ed europe in fact saw this as the major reason for hav ing it 22 if europe had a common currency this would in and of itself represent a significant change in the existing fiscal constitution of national governments as they would have to forego th e use of inflationary finance the inflation tax debt monetization as a means to finance public spending as luigi einaudi maintained it would be a substantial 5 improvement over present fiscal procedures of course it is an open question whether na tional governments can be persuaded to give up such a source of revenue a european monetary constitution the preoccupations with the issue of monetary sovereignty are entirely justified money matters and as milton friedman has often repeated is too important to be left to central bankers the reasons that make us worry about monetary management by national central bankers are even more valid when referred to a single currency for europe monetary mis management on a national level can be a disaster on a european level it would be a catastrophe of unbearable proportions 23 moreover the argument against binding rules that they are undemocratic because they prevent elected officials from responding as best they can to the wishes of the elector a t e obviously does not yet apply to the case of europe 24 the problem arises because with the end of the gold standard money in addition to its traditional functions has become an instrument of discretionary policy to an extent that was inconceivable b efore discretionary manipulation of monetary aggregates on the part of in dependent central banks can produce pro cyclical rather than anti cyclical consequences instead of achieving a higher degree of stability monetary policy becomes an autonomous source of instability 25 this in no way implies incompetence on the part of the monetary authorities even the most competent central banker does not possess all the knowledge that would be required to make a discretionary anti cyclical monetary policy s u cceed information about the work ing of our macroeconomic systems is inadequate short term predictions are seldom sufficiently reliable decisions my be untimely and lags in the effects of monetary changes are largely unknown in advance 2 in any case the outcome of discretionary monetary policy in terms of increased economic instability already harmful at the national level would be disastrous at the european level it s hardly surprising therefore that so many people consider that risk unacceptab le and op pose a common currency for europe altogether a european monetary constitution the need to constrain discretion in the conduct of monetary affairs has long been recog nized from the pioneering classic paper of henry c simons 1936 arguing that an enterprise system cannot function effectively in the face of extreme uncertainty as to the ac tion of monetary authorities to contemporary times several economists have supported the view that monetary policy should be entrusted to rigidly sp e cified rules rather than to the discretion of authorities 27 for public choice theorists for example only a constitutional set of rigid rules can pre vent the ordinary working of political incentives from resulting in monetary instab ity 28 for the m the absence of an explicit monetary constitution is unacceptable 29 a common currency for europe would be desirable if its adoption meant an end of discre tionary short term policy should european nations agree on some kind of monetary constitution making discretionary manipulation of monetary aggregates impossible a com mon currency for europe would greatly increase overall stability both in europe and in the world one could think of a rule fixing the rate of growth of some monetary aggregate t o a 6 predetermined level and mandating its continuation for an extended period of time say three five years 30 the adoption of a monetary rule would be highly desirableperse if it would eliminate the variability of monetary growth with its accompanying eco n omic instability and uncertainty but it would also be the solution for the creation of a common currency for europe all the justified worries about the surrender of national monetary sovereignty to a politically irre sponsible european central bank w o uld lose meaning if money was entrusted to predetermined and agreed upon rigid rules rather than to the whim of policy makers pos sessing discretionary power furthermore all the advantages of a common currency for europe referred to before could be attained the problem is that even among those who believe in rigid monetary rules there is no general agreement on the specific type of rule to adopt 31 this is however less important than the decision to have a rule at all once the principle of a d i scretionary manipulation of monetary aggregates by an independent european central bank is rejected and the oppo site one of a rigid monetary rule is introduced the specifics of the rule can be progressively improved upon as experience dictates 32 w hat i mean is that the main point to be made about rules is that there is no such thing as the ideal rule because among other things as our knowledge progresses new devices are thought of which can replace older arrangements 33 once the principle of e ntrusting money creation to a rule is accepted in other words the choice of the best possible rule will be determined by accumulation of experience and ana lytical progress 34 what is essential regardless of the kind of rule adopted is that the targe t rate of growth of the chosen monetary aggregate is adhered to for several years so as to fa vor stable expectations the concrete design of a european monetary constitution would also have to consider the problem of enforcement so that it should cont ain the principle of accountability of the person s in charge 35 conclusion a common currency for europe could provide a good chance for introducing the kind of constitutional discipline monetary economists and public choice theorists have advocated for years it s hard to tell whether politicians and central bankers will in the end become convinced by this argument but one thing seems clear enough the present approach does not seem likely to bring about a common currency for europe since it does not s olve the problem of the shift of monetary sovereignty it will lead nowhere furthermore committed as it is to the enforcement of fixed exchange rates among european currencies it is likely to promote political conflict and disagreement rather than the h armonization it attempts to achieve if europe does not get a common currency it will not reap its great advantages and mone tary policy will continue to be in the hands of national central bankers money will remain exposed to the temptations of natio n al governments to use it as an instrument for financing public spending and monetary stability will be harder to achieve those of us who believe in a united europe and in the advantages of a common currency should abandon the eco nomically fallacious a nd politically dangerous strategy of gradual convergence and work towards the goal of a monetary constitution for europe this is i believe the greatest chal lenge of our time 36 0 7 references bradley michael d and

short run leijonhufvud 1987 p 130 5 agreement on the need for a monetary rule is far more important t h an the choice of the actual monetary constitution as pointed out by j m buchanan agreement on the need for a monetary constitution should take precedence over that on the specific kind of rule to be adopted i think that this debate discussion on mon e tary reform is prematurely joined when we start referring to the advantages and disadvantages of this or that rule this regime or that regime debates about which of the alternative regimes is to be preferred must take place but prior to this disc u ssion we should try to attain consensus on the need for some alternative regime that will embody greater predictability than the unconstrained monetary authority that describes that which now exists the familiar analogy is with the traffic chaos that wo u ld exist if there were no rules the first requirement is that there be some rules of the road whether or not these rules require driving on the left or the right is of secondary importance to the requirement that there be a rule buchanan 1983 1987 p 124 6 what follows draws on my 1989 paper and to a lesser extent on previous work see

central banker n what circumstances would the benefits of a single currency exceed the costs the benefits are fairly easy to identify where prices within an area are quoted in a common currency un c ertainties arising from unpredictable exchange rate fluctuations within the area are removed in consequence business decisions are not complicated by a need to take account of possible exchange rate changes within the currency area which would help to i mprove confidence particularly in relation to investment decisions with long time horizons furthermore there would no longer be any transactions costs associated with exchanging one currency for another or with trying to hedge against changes in rates leigh pemberton 1989 p 12 apparently this has also been the consensus among professional economists and pub lic opinion there is little disagreement among economists about the benefits of monetary union i e of a system in which exchange rate risk s exchange control risks payments restrictions the costs of information about exchange rates and exchange market prospects and hopefully the costs of money changing are eliminated monetary union defined in this way intensifies competition and 11 international integration of product as well as factor markets vaubel 1979 p 19 there would also be a big saving in transaction costs the story goes that somebody setting out of britain with s1 000 to visit each of the eec countries changing his mo n ey into local currency every time but buying nothing would arrive back with only s500 monetary union would be such a blessing to people like that and to everybody else the economist june 24 1989 p 20 9 for the analysis of currency competition s ee for example hayek 1976 vaubel 1986 and dowd 1988 10 if europe had a common currency there would be one central bank rather than twelve even more important the dollar reserves presently used by the national central banks would become unnecessar y and if the common currency was allowed to float freely in international markets the european central bank s reserve requirement would be very small 11 it is in the light of this argument that one should read the economist s point simply ask whether america would be better off with separate currencies for each of its states strangely enough the only problem that the authoritative publication sees in having the u s a use 50 different currencies is that of the cost of converting one into another 1 2 see vaubel 1979 p 20 13 ibid 14 ibid p 19 15 the adoption of a single curmty while not strictly necessary for the creation of a mone tary union might be seen for economic as well as psychological and political reasons as a natural and des i rable further development of the monetary union delors report april 1989 p 10 strangely enough this identification of monetary union with a system of fixed ex change rates is explicitly accepted even by the economist a fully fixed system would e l iminate the bands within which the currencies are allowed to fluctuate monetary un ion would then go one step further by adopting a single currency the economist 1989 p 18 16 in the words of professor milton friedman the basic fact is that a un i fied currency and a system of freely floating exchange rates are members of the same species even though superficially they appear very different both are free market mechanisms for interregional or international payments both permit exchange rates to m o ve freely both exclude any administrative or political intermediary in payments between residents of different areas either is consistent with free trade between areas or with a lessening of trade restrictions on the other hand national currencies li n ked by pegged exchange rates whether or not through the mechanism of gold and a system of variable exchange rates controlled and manipulated by governmental bodies either through an adjustable peg or day to day market operations are also members of t he same species both are interventionist standards neither in my opinion is consistent with a permanent lessening of barriers to international 12 trade but only with oscillating barriers as nations shift from surplus to deficit friedman 1968 pp 271 272 17 professor milton friedman has repeatedly argued that the two necessary and almost suf ficient conditions for disequilibria in the balance of payments are fixed exchange rates and autonomous national central banks 18 in the words of rolan d vaubel the snake approach the monetary harmonization ap proach and the combined money supply and exchange rate approach all belong to one family they are all co ordination strategies they do not lead to the creation of a com mon currency the cruc i al defect of all co ordination strategies is that they rely on discretion instead of automaticity since the co ordination approach lacks automaticity it fails to make exchange rates predictable if it involves the fixing of parities it may in deed lead to more errors and uncertainty than exchange rate flexibility and the pre announcement of definite rates of national money supply growth which exchange rate flexibility makes possible vaubel 1979 p 25 19 as sir alan walters has argued compa r ed with a floating system the ems entails a considerable politicization of exchange rates the occasion for realignments involves a great political bargaining session rather than an occasion on which to review the funda mentals of real exchange rates if the ultimate objective is the monetary integration of europe through a european central bank in a single currency area then the ems seems to be hardly a step in the right direction it creates too many tensions both eco nomic and political walt e rs 1988 pp 505 506 20 of course this does not imply that its introduction cannot be gradual as vaubel recom mends see vaubel 1979 pp 28 30 2 1 money can be a potent tool for controlling and shaping the economy its potency is exemplified by the extent to which control over money has always been a potent means of exacting taxes from the populace at large very often without the explicit agree ment of the legislature friedman 1962 p 174 22 einaudi 1944 1985 pp 102 103 23 i n a mo netary union the design of the central authority is crucial it must be the anchor against inflation that gold was in the gold standard and the d mark is in the present ems an emu under a badly run european central bank would be much worse than the ems under the well fun bundesbank in setting up the new central bank a balance would have to be struck between accountability and independence the economist 1989 p 20 the main costs arise from the loss of autonomy over domestic monetary policy leigh pemberton 1989 p 12 who would control such a central bank minford 1989 p 28 24 see leijonhufvud 1987 for a criticism of such an argument 25 it is not enough in other words to say that empirical evidence does not support the view that stabilization policies have in fact had a stabilizing effect on the economy romer 1986 the problem is that empirical evidence suggests that they may have had a destabilizing effect according to friedman anna schwartz and i have examined the cyclical behavior of the quantity of money in the united states for the whole period since 1867 throughout that period monetary growth has risen and fallen not with but 13 before economic activity the cyclical peak of monetary growth re gularly precedes the cyclical peak of economic activity by an interval that varies a great deal but on average is something like six to nine months the cyclical trough of monetary growth regularly precedes the cyclical trough of economic activity by an a verage interval of roughly the same length moreover sizable monetary accelerations and decelerations tend to be fol lowed by sizable expansions and contractions in economic activity modest accelerations and decelerations by modest expansions and cont r actions the evidence is clear vari ability in the rate of monetary growth is associated with variability in economic growth high monetary variability accompanies high economic variability and vice versa the federal reserve has sought to use m onetary policy to stabilize the economy that is to vary monetary growth in order to offset forces introducing disturbances into the econ omy had it succeeded high monetary variability would have been associated with low economic variability not with h igh economic variability the correlations between the moving standard deviations that we have calculated would have been negative or zero rather than systematically positive the implication is again that monetary variability has been a source of econom i c variability not an offset friedman 1984 pp 33 34 26 a common criticism of policy making is that economists and policy makers do not know enough about how the economy functions to have a model that describes accu rately the behavior of macroeco n omic variables like real gnp and the price level in this case it has been argued that policy action based on a flawed or incomplete model might cause more harm than good bradley and jansen 1989 p 37 as a result one cannot be confident that relax i ng constraints on discretionary policyrnaking will bring a net so cial benefit leijonhufvud 1987 p 131 27 for example the monetary authorities of the united states that is the administra tion the congress and the federal reserve system d o not obey any reasonably well defined set of policy rules that would tend to produce some particular reasonably pre dictable path of the price level over the long haul there is no monetary constitution in effect that limits the short run options of the authorities for the purpose of providing long run stability none of these uncertainties would matter very much if some set of constitutional constraints were in force that would prevent the rapid cumulation of moves in one direction leijonhufvud 19 8 4 28 for example for many of these politicians doing good comes down to the spending of public monies hence even for the most benevolent of politicians revenue becomes a goal to maximize an instrument through which they can promote public happi n ess and well being would it not then follow that for such well meaning politicians reve nue increasing policy is to be preferred to revenue decreasing policy would it not follow that for such agents inflation might still offer a very tempting sourc e of gain bren nan and buchanan 1981 p 58 which leads kevin dowd to the pessimistic conclusion whenever the government is involved in the monetary system monetary policy becomes an inherently political mat ter determined by the interplay of poli t ical and to some extent bureaucratic interests there is no mechanism to ensure that this non market incentive structure delivers a de sirable outcome dowd 1988 p 21 29 brennan and buchanan 1981 p 65 as is well known the main proponent of a monetary rule has been milton friedman 1 4 if we cannot achieve our objectives by giving wide discretion to independent experts how else can we establish a monetary system that is stable free from irresponsible governmental tinkering and incapabl e of being used as a source of power to threaten economic and political freedom a possibility is to try to achieve a government of law instead of men literally by legislating rules for the conduct of monetary policy the enactment of such rules would enable the public to exercise control over monetary policy through its political authorities while at the same time preventing monetary policy from being subject to the day to day whim of political authorities friedman 1962 1968 p 190 see also p r oponents of stable monetary policy have studied the quality of specific rules if central banks would concentrate on keeping the money supply on the path they have committed themselves to they would provide a public good price level stabil ity such a p r edictable policy would as empirical evidence shows contribute to a stable development of overall demand a result which has not been achieved by the discretion ary policies actually pursued in industrial countries it would eliminate a great deal of th e price variations on financial markets about which many observers complain so much langfeldt scheide and trapp 1989 p 40 30 a monetary constitution would also impose fiscal responsibility on national govern ments thereby achieving two goals at o nce in this case jerry jordan s opinion according to which a fiscal reform is needed in order to achieve the desired monetary re form would not apply the monetary reform would achieve both meaningful monetary reform cannot precede reform of the fiscal regime reform of the fiscal regime is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reform of the monetary regime reform of the monetary regime is neither necessary nor sufficient for reform of the fiscal regime jordan 1986 p 741 31 pe r sonally i agree with the view of langfeldt scheide and trapp an important ele ment in a policy rule is that the central bank uses a monetary aggregate that it can control with sufficient precision broader aggregates m i m2 or m3 can be influence d through changes in the monetary base but the link seems to become weaker the broader the measure is so it appears best to use the monetary base which reflects pre cisely the actions of the central bank langfeldt scheide and trapp 1989 p 40 32 see buchanan s opinion quoted above 33 this has always been explicitly recognized by milton friedman i should like to em phasize that i do not regard this proposal as a be all and end all of monetary management as a rule which is somehow to be writt e n in tablets of gold and enshrined for all future times it seems to me to be the rule that offers the greatest promise of achieving a reasonable degree of monetary stability in the light of our present knowl edge i would hope that as we operated with i t as we learned more about monetary matters we might be able to devise still better rules which would achieve still better re sults friedman 1962 1968 pp 193 194 34 as is well known in the light of the american experience milton friedman has r e cently changed his proposal of stating the rule in terms of mi friedman 1962 1968 p 193 and has suggested instead that the quantity of high powered money non inter est bearing obligations of the u s government be frozen at a fixed amount fr iedman 1984 pp 48 49 this clearly illustrates the need for trying out proposed 15 rules in order to ascertain how well they work in practice and formulating alternative proposals when the experiment is not as successful as it was hoped no matter what rule is chosen however it seems to me that it must conform to the principles spe l led out by langfeldt sheine and trapp 1989 p 43 35 the need for a monetary constitution governing the common european currency would be reduced but not eliminated if it was introduced through a competitive process of the kind advocated for exam p le by vaubel 1979 and minford 1989 for if the com petitive process would lead to a monopoly in money enjoyed by either the european or a national currency the need for some kind of monetary constitution would again pre sent itself the mere po s sibility of creating an alternative to the dominant currency would not be sufficient to constrain the inflationary tendencies of the monetary monopolist this is why though i agree with the parallel currency approach to the introduction of a common europ e an currency i still believe that a monetary constitution is needed 36 unless european countries are prepared to give up discretion in the conduct of mone tary policy which means giving up money as an instrument of policy the only kind of monetary u n ification that can be achieved is that which will spontaneously arise from the liberalization of markets as indirectly recognized by the delors report full free dom of capital movements and integrated financial markets would discipline incompatibl e national policies stable currencies would be preferred in international transactions and some kind of competition among national currencies would be estab lished countries with a high degree of monetary instability would see their national currency r ejected by increasingly competitive markets and would as a result be forced to change their policy therefore even if a common currency for europe is not intro duced europe might still get some kind of discipline in monetary affairs thanks to the fi l ter mechanism inadvertently introduced by the single act as pointed out by victoria curzon price it is often said and rightly so that creating a single european currency would represent such a loss of sovereignty that were we to get there we would n ot be far off full political integration and yet if ems govern ments stick to their stated commitments they will have tied their hands as firmly as if they had actually created a european central bank even if they retain the right to vary their exchange rates within the ems the need to compete for their citizens savings will force them to behave with extreme fiscal and monetary caution curzon price 1989 p 37 1 6
a nicaraguan government crackdown on free speech opposition parties and foreign diplomats has been condemned as an attack on civil liberties to bolster one party rule with less than five months to go until the country holds a general election former sandinista guerrilla leader daniel ortega looks almost certain to win a third presidential term unimpeded after the latest assault on opposition leaders the supreme court last week ousted eduardo montealegre as leader of the main opposition party the independent liberation party pli in a move widely criticized as politically driven ad criticized by international observers and the catholic church a statement signed by the bishops of the episcopal conference said that any attempt to create conditions for the implementation of a single party regime in which ideological diversity and political parties disappeared is harmful to the country the court ruling leaves the coalition which was led by pli and includes civil society groups without a means of contesting the 6 november national elections other parties in the coalition had already been stripped of their legal status by judges and electoral officials allegedly controlled by ortega s government view image in fullscreen daniel ortega the sandinista guerrilla leader poised to win third presidential term photograph pablo martinez monsivais ap montealegre who

election will be a farce a new leader from within pli pedro reyes vallejos who has strong ties to the ortega administration was appointed by the court as the rightful party leader ortega s 2006 election victory came after a marked move to the right which included a deal with the catholic church to ban abortion in exchange for its support since then social programmes such as improved access to schools have helped maintain his popularity but human rights groups have condemned the gradual concentration of power and weakening of institutions subsequent local and national elections been mired in allegations of fraud despite the reproach ortega recently announced that international observers would not be invited to monitor the forthcoming elections critics lambasted the decision as further evidence of the erosion of transparency and accountability under ortega and his wife rosario murillo the official government spokeswoman secrecy surrounding the interoceanic canal one of the world s biggest ever engineering projects has been widely condemned nationally and internationally the project has been clouded in controversy since the 50bn deal was agreed between ortega and the chinese telecoms mogul wang jing with minimal public or political debate the deal hands over large swathes of nicaraguan territory and many of its sovereign right to jing s company hknd which some believe is controlled by beijing the sandinista leader has pledged that the mega project will finally lift nicaragua the second poorest country in latin america out of poverty and has labelled critics

country s press was also coming under pressure we must keep an eye in local journalists who are less protected than foreigners she said the canal has dented ortega s popular support but he remains significantly ahead in the polls violeta granera an independent vice president candidate in the coalition said right now we don t have the conditions for free transparent and competitive elections we are not withdrawing from the elections mr ortega is doing everything he can to expel the coalition ortega like president maduro in venezuela wants to isolate nicaragua but the opposition like in venezuela is weak according to christine wade associate professor of political science and international studies at washington college the recent events look bad in an election season but the opposition are poorly organised bereft of ideas and spend too much time fighting amongst themselves regardless of the supreme court decision there s no one in opposition capable of beating ortega he s too popular it was always going to be one horse race
tech supremacy dictates global pecking order and both america and china are acutely aware of this in the last decade china has climbed up the innovation ladder and its tech and mobile companies have become household names in america this trend has made us policymakers both wary and suspicious of beijing s means to acquire technological secrets and their possible end uses it was in 2012 that american policymakers first publicly raised the security threat that chinese equipment providers like huawei and zte pose these companies provided network solutions to mobile companies us house intelligence agency feared huawei founded by a former pla army technician was snooping on behalf of china as espionage concerns rose america slapped bans on huawei and zte citing national security a bitter trade war and two presidents later america is now upping the ante in its tech battle with china the biden administration is using every tool in its arsenal to stop xi jinping from his stated goal of achieving tech parity with america by 2035 for this a slew of executive orders and legislations have been announced in the last two months to ring fence america s technology sector from greater scrutiny of investment proposals from chinese companies into priority sectors to detailed audits of chinese companies keen to raise funds on us stock exchanges biden administration s directives are going where the money is but perhaps the most important are the sweeping sanctions aimed to hit china s semiconductor industry significantly and these seem to hurt beijing much more than what the world s second largest economy may admit hoping to get access to chip making technology after being shut out by america this week china reached out to south korea seoul which has been caught between its security provider america and largest trading partner china is the last few options that beijing has after being blocked from access and even sources of funding for its chip manufacturing ambitions semiconductors have many civil and military applications everything from cars to refrigerators needs semiconductor chips and most artificial intelligence and advanced military programs require semiconductor chips dominance in the semiconductor industry translates into manufacturing prowess and military capabilities with the export controls launched in mid october the biden administration has halted china s ambitious chip making plans and its fast tech march the export controls were launched in mid october and the strict license restrictions have limited access to integrated circuits for semiconductor facilities in china as per the new controls tough license norms have hit exports of high performance chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputers the restrictions are aimed to limit or even eliminate the ability of american companies to export machinery that is used in manufacturing of chips to china unlicensed fab facilities in china are also finding it hard to hire american tech talent further crippling their development to stem the tide of tech transfer from american companies to their chinese counterparts new investment norms for chinese companies will further restrict access to cutting edge technology chinese investments into america s technology sector now need greater scrutiny from the committee on foreign investments if american investments into chinese companies are scrutinised further it will be a big blow to china s ability to get access to american technology china mandates foreign companies to form joint ventures with local companies a policy that has allowed easy tech transfers during its economic boom phase approvals for future american investments into chinese companies are likely to come by only if american companies provide adequate guarantees that their technological secrets will not land in chinese hands a guarantee that very few american corporations are likely to give ending an easy route to climb the tech ladder but this is not all safeguarding cutting edge technology will run concurrent to stringent data privacy rules to protect individual data the tiktok saga is proof that large volumes of personal data on mobile networks can be easily misused by chinese government agencies or corporations in a bipartisan move the us senate unanimously passed legislation banning the chinese company from all government owned phones and devices the legislation which needs to be passed by the us house could set the tone for a more stringent position taken by america india and other countries against chinese companies what started as a one off case of alleged theft of industrial secrets has now snowballed into a full blown tech war between the world s top two economies it is no more about a t mobile robot arm being stolen by huawei or surveillance for the chinese state but it is now about the future of economy and military preparedness and it is not just about the us versus china it is now china versus the rest global political headwinds indicate that the tech competition is headed in only one direction and seoul may not be able to do much for beijing
jarvis moves slowly yet meticulously from one station to another to make a cup of cappuccino jarvis makes the espresso pours the milk steams the foam and puts it all together topping it off with a carefully drawn foam leaf the result is a cup of cappuccino ready to go what stands out about this cappuccino its maker jarvis is a robotic arm not a human barista at artly in pike place market while jarvis is busy a human staff focuses on interacting with customers explaining the concept to newcomers and placing orders using a tablet seattle based robotic startup artly founded in 2020 has seven locations in washington oregon and california the highlight at each location is a unique barista bot that has its own name gender voice accent and personality the robot s techniques differ at each location as they learn from a different human barista it is intriguing to see the robot s coffee making techniques but pressing market needs were behind the innovation cost concerns and high employee turnover in food services have led artly and others to provide automated solutions to restaurants and businesses even before the pandemic hit and brought additional challenges just a couple of years into operation artly ceo meng wang said the company has maintained healthy operating margins the profit a company makes after paying for costs of production by eliminating the biggest expense in food business labor for a coffee shop that would need two or three baristas artly needs one staffer in addition to a barista bot like jarvis artly reinvests the money it saves from labor into sourcing more quality coffee wang said artly isn t alone in introducing robot help in food preparation another seattle based startup picnic offers automation solutions for a staple of the american diet pizza its food prep station can produce up to 100 pizzas in one hour using metered toppings since picnic was founded in 2016 its robots have assembled pizzas in many places including seattle s t mobile park and the las vegas convention center the company has seen a growing interest in its robots this summer picnic announced partnerships with pizzeria moto s west seattle location and a domino s store in berlin the startups behind these robots tout their automated solutions for bringing higher productivity and reducing costs automating pizza assembly can help restaurants reduce food waste and potentially save money said picnic ceo clayton wood for example it helps keep the amount of toppings even by automating the process with preset topping amounts pizza making can be more cost effective wood said automated solutions also fill a gap in finding and retaining workers food service jobs can be tedious and can be dangerous and there s very high turnover wood said there s no advancement and the working conditions are not great issues in productivity and turnover in the food industry predate covid 19 said geoff harris a picnic investor and co founder and managing partner of venture capital firm flying fish partners but the need grew with the pandemic as restaurants closed many employees were laid off or furloughed and did not go back to the food industry staffing levels at eating and drinking establishments remain below their pre pandemic levels as demand for labor nationally remains high according to a national restaurant association analysis of u s labor of bureau statistics data in november human touch robots can t fill in for humans in every setting however joe yang owner of several coffee stores in portland who is also artly s co founder and chief coffee officer experienced that firsthand at his coffee shops yang tested jarvis beta version at his own stores his customers were initially intrigued and excited about the robot barista but the service was slower than with a human barista he said customers craved the connection with the person making their coffee when go to the coffee shop their expectation is to be served by a human yang said with that artly has focused on opening locations in shopping malls and business office buildings rather than standard coffee shops artly also has seen an opportunity to expand in areas lacking coffee shops because of the pandemic or where starbucks stores closed during covid 19 there were a lot of coffee deserts and the competition is clearly much less than before wang said for example its first location opened at japanese retailer muji in portland in may 2021 after a previous coffee operator left due to labor shortages similarly jarvis made a home at stoneridge shopping center in pleasanton california in december 2021 because there was no coffee operator there because starbucks had exclusivity as the only coffee provider in some areas consumers had no other coffee options when it left ceo wang said this was the case in the stonestown galleria shopping center in san francisco where artly opened its location in august investment and future growth while the need and opportunities exist some startups are beginning to feel the squeeze inflation and recession fears this year have led to a stock market downturn dampened investor appetite for risk and led to a decrease in venture capital activity hardware picnic s area can be considered a risky investment wood said the current investment market is a challenge wood said we could go much faster in our product development and our market expansion if we were operating in a different market condition wood declined to comment on the company s fundraising but geekwire reported last year that picnic raised 20 5 million in early stage funding led by california based venture capital firm thursday ventures flying fish vulcan capital management and creative ventures also participated in the round by the end of 2021 investment activity slowed with fewer initial public offerings and stock market losses those factors have made the vc market significantly more conservative than in the prior several years wood said still with a modular hardware system picnic s robots are easy and cheap to build flying fish s harris said with a robotics as a service business model the standard full offering for operators is 4 500 a month on a 36 month contract artly s ceo wang said the company hasn t struggled with funding it closed a funding round of 8 5 million this year and a 1 5 million round last year both rounds were early stage investments both picnic and artly are still young startups and despite possible economic challenges both have plans to scale the business picnic has partnered again with moto to install a food prep station at the pizzeria s downtown location though the unveiling date is still unclear more partnerships are on the horizon according to wood and harris at artly when the barista bots becomes more stable and reliable in making coffee wang said the next step will be franchising though that goal is still some years ahead in 2023 the company plans to scale by adding between 15 and 20 locations

to many the recent virulent attacks and counter attacks by top nigerian journalists served a la carte to the world in the last two weeks are indications of an autumn for journalism practice in nigeria nigerians have thus been treated to a disgraceful brew of damaging and ignoble exchanges from these media warlords the public spat has made nigerians to call to question the integrity of their media practitioners to them the media space in the name of politics has become a hostile jungle revealing the patent biases of its practitioners in the coverage of society three warlords are at the centre of this spat they are bayo onanuga dele alake and nduka obaigbena except for obaigbena publisher of the thisday newspaper whose current political leaning is a subject of intense guess work the other two have apparently gone to thessalonica as biblical paul awaited execution he lamented how demas his friend and associate had forsaken him because he loves the things of this life and has gone to thessalonica thessalonica signifies the world of perfidy judging by its abhorrence of partisanship journalism profession seems to be shawled in lamentations today at the apostasy of these barons because they love the things of this life to be fair to both alake and onanuga they possess lofty pedigree of media practice after graduating in mass communication from the university of lagos in 1980 onanuga worked with the ogun state television where he began practice he moved to the guardian and thereafter to the national concord and african concord magazine before finally founding thenews tempo magazine as well as p m news in 2014 onanuga opted to contest the ogun east district senatorial ticket of the all progressives congress apc an ambition which got botched he thereafter became the dg of nan alake s media foray is not totally dissimilar from onanuga s after a degree in political science from the university of lagos and an internship with the ogun state broadcasting corporation ogbc he joined the lagos state broadcasting corporation lsbc as senior sub editor but in 1985 joined business mogul mko abiola s concord group of newspapers wherein in 1989 he was appointed editor of sunday concord and in 1995 editor of the national concord he held this post till june 1999 when then governor of lagos state bola tinubu appointed him information commissioner since then alake has literally gone to thessalonica away from journalism he is implicated in virtually every sub media construction deconstruction and misconstruction of the tinubu perspectives in the nigerian media in 2010 alake also made an attempt to contest the senatorial seat of his ekiti state home s central district but retreated in the heat of defeat staring him in the face onanuga and alake are today major sharks in the tinubu media ocean in his bid to clinch the nigerian presidency in the 2023 election having been appointed presidential campaign council s pcc director of media and publicity and director strategic communication respectively advertisement the two have escalated their defence of public angst and disgust at their principal tinubu s peremptory gaffes at public events locating these gaffes at the doorsteps of a claimed disaffection obaigbena and his media group have for tinubu while the gaffes and speech incoherence have made many to submit that tinubu either lacks the mythical depth attributed to him by his lieutenants over the years or is suffering from an unnamed mental disconnect onanuga and alake have pursued the narrative that tinubu is neither of both obaigbena s group has however doubled down in an overarching manner on the need for public scrutiny of both claims two journalists in the obaigbena arise television group highly respected reuben abati and oseni rufai have been held as culprits by the tinubu group common sense should have dictated that the path to walk was to address the fears that tinubu if elected would be a worse replica of nigeria s current infirmary bound president this view if they care to investigate is ten a dime on nigerian streets rather onanuga and alake have sought to make a victim of tinubu insisting that the arise group s invitation to him to attend a town hall debate it organized was designed to embarrass tinubu the result is that both onanuga and alake have gone very low in their pursuit of this mindset this they did by dwelling on what they claimed was obaigbena s crooked media dealings they have since vowed never to make available our candidate to validate a scheme which they said in the light of unassailable information at our disposal is nothing but a racket by the arise tv owner designed to embarrass our candidate apart from their gambit to criminalize scrutiny into tinubu s past and any demand for him to attend any presidential debate onanuga and alake s plan is to make obaigbena abati oseni and their thisday and arise tv media worthless to the public giving them the dan rather treatment before the 2023 election rather a cbs news icon in september 2004 fell to his own and foibles a few months to the presidential election of that year he had commented on some documents that were critical of president george bush s air national guard service the bush internet bloggers within minutes went into action and documents presented by rather as forged rather s thirty three year long career on cbs came crashing and his worth reduced to the basest advertisement in response to arise s demand of satisfactory answer to the circumstances surrounding the forfeiture of funds to the us government by tinubu in an alleged chicago drug dealing onanuga and alake went into the abyss of argumentative fallacies they regurgitated irrelevant traits alleged to be their opponents and attacking their personal matters for instance they claimed that the thisday founder owes taxes abroad and is a slave driver while i am yet to know whether their principal s media house is free of these charges i submit that these are different and irrelevant matters entirely to the riveting allegation that is expected of them to defend the truth is that the nigerian public is wary of an impending inclination to elect a drug peddler as president and needs clinical answers to queries on tinubu what to do methinks is to offer documentary unassailable evidence of tinubu being above board but as it is known with ad hominine arguments onanuga and alake chose to deal in the person of their victims again they committed what is called the strawman fallacy in argument when rather than provide irrefutable evidence that tinubu didn t do drugs they brought out a third party buruji kashamu who became their referent and his association with abati an apt response to the chicago drug allegation is abati running for the nigerian presidency is association immoral criminal or both so if every association is immoral how does one rate their own association with tinubu does it make them guilty of all moral criminal drawbacks that tinubu has been alleged to be complicit of one error made by the public is to see erstwhile practitioners of media in the same mould as when they were active in the profession these are persons who have entered into liaison with politically exposed persons yoruba call this the horrific error of viewing the dead same way as they were when alive the punishment for this error yoruba say of this error is a call on the gnome the ebora to de robe such ignoramus it is thus a great blunder to refer to the three main musketeers at the centre of the debate on the role of the media in these shameful exchanges as journalists dog tenders know that the moment a dog tastes blood it is ripe to be excised from tame animals onanuga alake and obaigbena can no longer be referred to as journalists in the true sense of it judging by their current preoccupation they can conveniently be referred to as merchants of news who merchandize and have a consumeric relationship with news and journalism at the least they are journal preneurs if there is anything so called i have always maintained that the moment a journalist columnist or even an activist bails out of active practice and mingles with politicians they most times lose their erstwhile objectivity the people who used to be their constituency are substituted for the politically exposed persons who are now their employers in this wise it would be tantamount to waiting for godot for society to expect such erstwhile media practitioners to preference the people at the expense of their principals advertisement in the tiff between onanuga and alake on one side and obaigbena on the other ordinary nigerian people are not in their consideration at all it is the warlords bellies businesses political principals and their projected political positions in the federal government that are at issue so when nigerians now obfuscate the issues as if journalism practice is on parade and is implicated it beats me hollow where they are today is comparable to that of a vulture which sees carcass from a purely gourmet point of view and not as a dying creation the exchanges nigerians read from these people are gourmand epistles as is the allegation onanuga and alake leveled against obaigbena most media houses in nigeria and even in other democracies of the world are explicitly linked to particular politicians these politicians are their friends and associates to many others due to economic interests and political association or affiliation of their publishers or owners they are forced to trade in politically tainted views in the process news and opinions reflect those political interests leanings and loyalties and facts are relegated to the background in a chapter in a book entitled reflections on a decade of democratization in nigeria 2010 a project of the german friedrich ebert stiftung foundation edited by prof lai olurode which we entitled a decade of democratization the nigerian press and ethno proprietorial influences authored by prof adigun agbaje and i we submitted that the nigerian media has always been a battleground of interests we looked at how the nigerian press of the first republic was not blameless in the fall of the first and second republic nigeria and how journalists pandering to proprietorial financial and ethnic interests have since the advent of the fourth republic been tossing nigeria right left and centre the strategy of shielding candidates from public scrutiny which alake and his pcc are attempting was same path they trod with buhari as presidential candidate buhari s health and depth limitations were shielded from the nigerian public through all manner of shenanigans by alake as media director in the muhammadu buhari campaign organization in 2014 in company with his colleagues nigerians will be making another huge mistake if they allow a reactivation and effectuation of same strategy it only led us to the buhari doom in our hands so if alake and onanuga feel that the arise tv of obaigbena are attempting to embarrass tinubu which is a valid fear let them bring their principal to the tvc which is public knowledge that he owns for an organized debate the debate must however be coordinated by respected nigerians as anchors tinubu must answer critical enquiries that will help voters evaluate his mental depth cohesion of thoughts and ability to govern nigeria nigerians must refuse to be cowed by onanuga and alake at all advertisement arisetv and thisday group must also proceed from zeroing in on tinubu alone into grilling atiku abubakar and peter obi as well we need to ask abubakar questions about scandals that rocked his time in office in 2007 the guardian of london reported that senators accused abubakar then sitting vice president of diverting more than 100m 51m of public funds into companies he was connected to his boss president oluesgun obasanjo was said to have petitioned the senate a senate inquiry according to the newspaper recommended that abubakar should be prosecuted abubakar office s reply was that the legislative body should not allow its name to be dragged into the mud by a few members who may be pursuing their own hidden agenda a plethora of other allegations especially one flowing from william jefferson and the petroleum trust development fund ptdf scandal which involved atiku abubakar and obasanjo must also be totally explained despite the senate indicting him and obasanjo in the ptdf scandal no action has been taken against them since 2007 it should be same for peter obi allegations of any fraud connected to him must be brought to the public space and he must be made to answer them these two too must be brought to the open by the arise thisday group and indeed on any nigerian media platform we cannot afford to have a country presided over by malefactors and journal preneurs in thessalonica who are prescribing and imposing on us their own brand of the nigerian moral code advertisement what did osun state buy with n407 billion when i was told that osun state s debt stock was n407billion i asked my friends from that state what they bought that sold them to that farm of bankruptcy i had reservations for the personality of the new governor of osun state senator ademola adeleke i felt that yorubaland does not deserve his kind of owambe carriage in leadership but as i wrote earlier i raised my hands up in surrender the day osun people s votes for him were announced to be in tomes it was my own way of showing deference to that ubiquitous mantra called the wishes of the people i however pray that i will someday come back to this platform to praise him and apologize for equating or assuming that pedigree matters in the task of bringing redemption to a beleaguered people advertisement last week however the governor went a step lower in my very unflattering rating of him he did well by talking tough as he assumed power lest anyone hoping to try his will mistake him for a sissy don t forget that the man he took over the mantel of governorship from had the reputation of one with the laudable management of the state s finance in spite of paucity of funds oyetola had announced to the world that he didn t borrow a dime and wasn t owing anyone in a world where we were tutored that indebtedness was a virtue that statement caught nigerians gaping no wonder that adeleke s dissembling arrow was to disorganize this parting kudos in a release issued by him that the press entitled osun is indebted to the tune of n407 32 billion governor adeleke the governor gave details of the debts he inherited he stated that with high sense of responsibility i am reporting to our people through our traditional rulers the total debt profile inherited by my administration from governor oyetola s administration advertisement i am pleased to present to you the official debt profile of osun state as at november 30th 2022 as submitted to me by the accountant general of osun state he said he then went ahead to itemize the debt one after the other and in closing the speech berated those he claimed had mortgaged the future of osun state with nothing to show for it this is definitely not acceptable i was as shocked as anyone that a poor state was that rich in debts what did it buy where are the projects that fetched that humongous debt figure however subsequent rebuttals from the oyetola administration got me thinking could the new governor be merely playing politics with this typecast in a release issued by bola oyebamiji the state s former commissioner for finance oyetola literally tore the governor s claims into shreds alleging that it was a reflection of adeleke s combative and vindictive posture and purely a campaign of calumny against a people centric government bit by bit oyetola repudiated every of adeleke s claim asking that his claim could be affirmed or disputed by the annual auditor general s report and the reports from the debt management office in osun and abuja what later came to the fore was that governor adeleke was pointing his finger at the wrong culprit in trying to put a lie to the allegation that governor oyetola accessed a loan facility of n18billion after losing the july 2022 gubernatorial election the ex commissioner for finance said that the adeleke government would have won an iota of credibility for itself if the details of the loan including the name of the creditor were mentioned that was a major challenge which adeleke should take up if there is any truth in it i am sure i am not the only one interested in getting more words on that from the new government what has not failed to strike the discerning world watching the drama in osun is that adeleke has apparently deliberately tried to whitewash the real judas in that state the questions that then come in are did he or didn t he know who borrowed the said money if he knew was he by that dramatic irony paying his own 30 pieces of silver to osun s judas iscariot by not shaming and naming the real culprits with the graphic picture presented by oyetola s ex finance commissioner about the debt portfolio of osun state including when each loan was taken it is obvious that if adeleke is serious about going after those he called out for mortgaging the future of osun state he only needs to take a trip to abuja not iragbiji the man with a queer administration model in osun rauf aregbesola is obviously the smelly shrew eku asin that adeleke apparently knew but failed to mention because they are now political bedmates facts presented thereafter have shown that aregbesola who was known to revel in inexplicable borrowings and who single handedly mortgaged the future of the state in the process should have been given the back of his tongue by adeleke however political expediency and the governor s iou to aregbesola for the support he gave during the last election made adeleke to speak tongue in cheek unbeknown to him what adeleke did by that gubernatorial inexactitude lest i call a governor a liar was that he helped oyetola to reach for the limelight yet again he afforded him an opportunity to explain his own role in the financial ruination of osun state at every forum i attended where the figures adeleke gave were discussed last week i heard people affirming that oyetola did well by not owing salaries or paying half salaries unlike aregbesola who got billions of naira as salary bailouts from buhari but refused to pay salaries now those diverted bailouts and budget support funds form the core content of the current debt stock of osun state i am one hundred percent in support of adeleke asking questions but the questions must be directed at the right culprits now adeleke should go after the people who by his own admittance sold the future of osun children unborn in a disastrous debt binge how could a barely surviving state like osun be owing that much as if it is delta while adeleke started well by availing the osun public with details of debts he met on ground it was sheer hypocrisy that he did not append the right culprit to it someone said if he had simply announced that the apc government owed that much it would not have raised any uproar i agree because aregbesola s queer penchant for debts when he was governor was legendary also now that adeleke has known the gravity of the debt and the real mastermind he must let the world know whether the procurement of the loans followed due process what it was deployed for and give his people a full disclosure as well as conducting forensic audit into the state s account in any case aregbesola was only yesterday quoted to have admitted taking those long term loan facilities from the federal government which all made up the legendary n407billion the man heartedly dismissed the huge loans as posing no threats to the state because the repayment periods spread over decades some as far as the year 2046 imagine that how many years from now is that generations of innocent children will pay debts which they know nothing about now that the right culprit has been found for the debts i hope to begin my growing fondness for adeleke this i will do when i hear him readdressing the state naming and shaming the debt baron and admitting his gaffe he should find out how the opon imo nonsense and other elephant projects constituted the serpentine journey of no return called the n407 billion debts he should ask aregbesola to explain what he did with the hundreds of billions from the federal government which constitute the bulk of the almost half a billion naira debt he should also say sorry to oyetola for calling him a name that belonged to rauf aregbesola i should also say that oyetola too should apologise to the people of osun state for spending his entire four years covering up the evil of his predecessor who mortgaged the fortune of the state or maybe what oyetola suffers today is the punishment for not speaking up and doing the right thing when he should and for not doing justice on the debts without fear or favour a lesson there for all

the dow s p 500 and nasdaq composite all plunged into a bear market in 2022 is an encore performance in the cards for the new year when the curtain officially closes on 2022 in two weeks there s little doubt this year will go down as one of the most challenging on record for investors the ageless dow jones industrial average dji 0 17 benchmark s p 500 gspc 0 21 and growth driven nasdaq composite ixic 0 12 have all tumbled into a bear market at some point this year with the s p 500 producing its worst first half return since richard nixon was president but just because wall street had a down year it doesn t mean an encore performance isn t in the cards although back to back years of underperformance have been rare for the broader market over the past quarter of a century there is a confluence of headwinds that threaten to push the dow s p 500 and nasdaq composite even lower in no particular order here are the seven biggest threats to the stock market in 2023 1 fed reactivity sinks wall street arguably the most front and center concern for wall street is the federal reserve s handling of historically high inflation after more than a decade of building up its balance sheet into the trillions of dollars and printing money like it was going out of style the nation s central bank has been left with no choice but to aggressively raise interest rates into a plunging stock market to tame inflation the well known issue with the fed is that it s a reactive data driven institution rather than one that proactively adjusts monetary policy since the data the fed utilizes is backward looking there s a tendency to overshoot to the upside and downside when it comes to rate hikes and reductions in other words we ll probably be looking back in hindsight at some point in the not too distant future and realize the fed was too aggressive with its rate hikes over too short a period if the nation s central bank holds true to its word of keeping rates elevated for much if not all of 2023 it wouldn t be a surprise to see corporate earnings take a sizable hit 2 history rhymes once again although history doesn t repeat on wall street it does have a tendency to rhyme quite a few indicators would suggest that while the dow jones s p 500 and nasdaq all entered respective bear markets the ultimate low has yet to be reached for instance two valuation based indicators portend additional downside in the s p 500 the s p shiller price to earnings p e ratio also known as the cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio or cape ratio has bottomed numerous times around a value of 22 during stock market corrections and bear markets over the past quarter of a century the s p shiller p e is currently at 29 and it didn t come anywhere close to 22 during the 2022 bear market likewise the forward p e ratio of the s p 500 is currently 17 3 there hasn t been a sizable correction crash or bear market since the beginning of 1999 that found its bottom at a forward p e ratio of higher than 14 in short valuation indicators would imply that equities are still pricey and have room to fall 3 the dreaded r word another significant risk for the stock market in 2023 is the growing likelihood of a u s or global recession the dreaded r word when the interest rate yield curve inverts and longer dated maturing bonds have lower yields than short term bonds the u s is at a heightened probability of entering a recession over the next six to 18 months recently the magnitude of inversion between the two year treasury bond yield and 10 year treasury bond yield widened to its largest difference in 40 years that s a telltale warning that a recession could be brewing just keep in mind that while a yield curve inversion has preceded every u s recession since world war ii a recession hasn t followed every yield curve inversion if a recession does materialize in the u s in 2023 you can be all but certain that corporate earnings are likely to fall wall street analysts have yet to fully price in the impact of aggressive fed rate hikes 4 home prices plummet a fourth plain as day risk for the stock market in 2023 is the housing market one of the biggest housing booms in history could give way to a truly epic bust in the new year investors don t have to look far to see why all facets of the housing industry could struggle after more than a decade of ultra favorable mortgage rates fed policy helped 30 year mortgage rates skyrocket to a 16 year high of nearly 7 in october to say that homebuyers have been spoiled with low borrowing rates would be an understatement with 30 year rates hovering around 7 and the likelihood of a recession growing homebuying activity should be minimal next year the bigger issue is that if home prices plunge 20 30 or perhaps even 40 in a number of previously overheated markets it might make financial sense for some buyers to simply walk away from their loan rather than pay a monthly mortgage on a property that s dramatically decreased in value if that happens a day of reckoning could be at hand for lenders 5 china the world s no 2 economy china also represents something of a no win situation for investors in 2023 on one hand china s zero covid strategy looks as if it ll be very difficult to maintain over a long period if covid 19 infection were to spread throughout china or if regulators dug in their heels and maintained the existing strategy for 2023 it would undoubtedly hurt the country s manufacturing capacity and growth this would lead to persistent supply chain problems for many of america s biggest businesses on the other hand if china relaxes its covid 19 policies and largely returns to normal we could see u s china trade war tensions reemerge let s not forget that in early september u s regulators banned u s semiconductor companies from shipping high powered artificial intelligence driven chips and graphic processing units to china 6 a commodity collapse energy stocks have represented one of the few safe haven investments of 2022 a globally broken energy supply chain that s been aided by years of underinvestment tied to the pandemic and russia s invasions of ukraine has elevated crude oil and natural gas prices to well above their historical average however commodities tend to perform very poorly during recessions and or economic slowdowns even though increasing the oil and natural gas supply is incredibly difficult at the moment due to the factors listed above west texas intermediate crude oil hit its lowest level in more than a year last week of 70 per barrel if a commodity collapse were to occur similar to what was witnessed in 2008 oil natural gas and even the precious metals could tumble over a short period and take the broader market with them 7 a crypto wash out event the seventh and final big threat to the stock market in 2023 is the potential for another cryptocurrency wash out event since hitting an all time high aggregate valuation of 3 trillion in november 2021 the combined value of more than 22 000 listed cryptocurrencies on coinmarketcap com has plunged more than 70 to 866 billion as of dec 14 2022 though the fed s monetary policy shift has played a role in the crypto bubble once again bursting a clear loss of confidence in digital currencies following a multitude of crypto blowups hasn t helped roughly six months ago the coin once known as terra which is now terraclassic imploded and evaporated nearly 60 billion in market value in a matter of days more recently the ftx cryptocurrency exchange scandal has come to light with former ceo and founder sam bankman fried facing a litany of criminal charges from the u s federal government the ftx token has completely crumbled in the wake of ftx s collapse if another shoe drops in the crypto space in 2023 all trust could be lost and the ripples could easily carry over into the equity markets
a few years ago a typical date night for david yarranton would often involve dinner and cocktails at a trendy restaurant but with the cost of living on the rise the 27 year old is getting creative he still enjoys a night out but is just as happy to whip up a meal at home or get outside for an afternoon of ice skating and hot chocolate i find that s equally effective for getting to know someone without necessarily breaking the bank said yarranton who lives in calgary the balancing act between impressing a potential sweetheart and staying on budget without coming across as cheap has always been a part of dating but with inflation on the rise it s getting trickier to strike taking a new love out for dinner costs about eight per cent more than it did last year according to october numbers from statistics canada extending the evening with drinks at the bar means coughing up about another four per cent relative to 2021 on top of the already higher everyday costs of rent and groceries that s left some putting off scheduling dates altogether while others are keeping their date nights simple by suggesting casual activities rather than elaborate ones according to recent user surveys from the dating platforms dating com plenty of fish and bumble casual dates gain popularity the trend away from fancy dates and toward more casual ones has shown up in bree woolard s dating life this year the 24 year old who recently moved from toronto to calgary is about 30 dates into a 50 first dates challenge a self imposed tiktok experiment intended to help her meet new people in the wake of a breakup bree woolard is in the midst of a self imposed tiktok experiment to go on 50 first dates paula duhatschek cbc whether it s due to rising inflation or the change in locale or a bit of both she s noticed the types of dates she s been invited on has shifted in recent months with fewer dinners out and a lot more hikes there have also been some awkward money moments along the way such as the time a date brought woolard to a fancy restaurant where she ended up unexpectedly footing the bill we still had a great time said woolard but i think going forward it s important more today than it used to be to have that conversation up front and say hey i m just on a budget or hey i m trying to save costs this month can we do something different a barometer for the consumer before ever setting foot on a date some budget conscious singles are also saving money by pulling back what they spend on dating apps and websites revenues at plenty of fish for example have been affected by deteriorating economic conditions according to a recent earnings letter from the company match group which also owns tinder hinge and a variety of other dating apps and websites other established brands like match and okcupid also saw declines this quarter the letter said some dating platforms have seen revenues dip as a result of current economic conditions istock getty images inflation has also affected some of these platforms à la carte offerings said the company s chief financial officer during a recent nasdaq investor conference in dating app lingo this could mean for example the option to pay money to boost one s dating profile and get it in front of more people people they read in the press about layoffs they read about recession they re getting more nervous and so we re seeing some pullback said gary swidler who is both the coo and cfo of match group and who said this is more common among some demographics such as younger users we are a barometer for the consumer to some extent bumble inc for its part has told investors it sees an opportunity in the current economic environment to position the app as way to find a potential match more cheaply than hitting a bar and hoping for the best our weekly boost subscription costs less than a beer at a new york city bar and the expense of going on multiple dates in a week really adds up quickly said ceo whitney wolfe herd on a recent third quarter earnings call we re leaning into this both from a product and marketing perspective talking money early one possible downside of dating on a budget is it can spell tension for couples if they aren t on the same page about it says adam galovan who studies couple relationships at the university of alberta in edmonton it can be challenging when you have certain expectations and when you have these costs and periods of inflation when maybe you re not going out to places that are quite as nice said galovan an associate professor of family science in the university s department of human ecology and while finances are a common area of tension in any relationship galovan noted it can be particularly tricky to navigate in the early stages adam galovan an associate professor of family science at the university of alberta says it can be tough to talk about money at the outset of a relationship when people are trying to put their best foot forward john ulan i m a big proponent of communicating and talking through things said galovan but in the dating scene sometimes you re trying to impress or put the best foot forward and so those conversations may be a little bit hard to have initially difficult conversations notwithstanding anthropologist helen fisher believes an openness toward inexpensive outings is to some degree a reflection of greater maturity on the part of daters and part of what she describes as a trend toward smart dating still courting but trimming back fisher who is also match s chief science advisor is part of an annual research project commissioned by the dating platform that surveys singles across the u s this year it found a greater share of respondents expressed a preference for casual dates and a vast majority listed similar attitudes about debt and spending as important traits in a partner a growing number said they were also more open to doing free activities on dates or going somewhere close to home to save money on gas compared to previous years a larger number said they were also taking video calls with potential suitors before spending money and energy on an in person date fisher said people are still courting but they are trimming back to save money no question about it said fisher who believes the trends in her study also apply to canada and other urbanized countries they re less interested in what you look like and more interested in whether you are financially stable a recent survey of u s singles commissioned by match com suggests financial stability is becoming more of a desired trait shutterstock monkey business being intentional as for bree woolard she s still got nearly 20 dates left to go but is taking a temporary breather to give her brain her heart and her wallet a bit of a break christmas is a lot of cost so i m focusing on where do i want to spend that it s mainly with friends and family she said i think you have to be in the right mindset to date so waiting till i feel that again yarranton for his part has started seeing someone more regularly and while part of the early relationship fun is in planning special trips and outings together he said these days he s taking care to plan and budget in advance i don t think should keep you from living your life he said you just have to be a bit more intentional about where you re putting your money

the stock has outperformed during the pandemic but there s one reason to be wary costco wholesale cost 0 32 has long been an investor favorite the retailer has an easy to understand business model a clear economic moat and a track record of success the warehouse retailer has also been a strong performer during the pandemic as it drew customers to its cavernous warehouses early in the lockdown era and has delivered strong results through much of this year as well however costco shares have slumped since the company issued a disappointing monthly sales report for november and its year to date performance only just matches the s p 500 index now is costco a buy heading into 2023 let s take a look at where the company stands today and what investors should expect next year costco today reliable results but signs of vulnerability in its recently released fiscal first quarter earnings report costco reported comparable sales growth of 7 1 adjusted for fuel and constant currency and a modest increase in earnings per share from 2 98 to 3 07 many of costco s peers especially in the discretionary retail sector are struggling facing higher inflation and a shift in consumer spending away from goods and toward services like restaurants and travel that consumers didn t get to spend on during the pandemic costco also has an advantage over the retail sector because its membership model insulates it from fluctuations in its retail business in fact costco makes most of its profits from its membership income bringing in 1 billion in profit in its most recent quarter or 73 of total net income membership trends at the company remain strong as well as it said on the earnings call renewal rates clocked in at 92 5 in north america or 90 4 globally paid membership increased 7 over the last year showing steady growth in customers and the company saw faster growth in executive members who pay double the fee and save an extra 2 when they shop at costco the company also hinted on the earnings call that it was likely to raise membership fees which it has historically done every five years by 5 what to expect in 2023 2023 is still a couple of weeks away but the new year looks set to get off to an inauspicious start for retailers like costco november retail sales fell more than expected down 0 6 from october and a number of retailers have said that consumer spending noticeably slowed through october and november those headwinds are also starting to show up in costco s own results as adjusted comparable sales rose 5 3 in november while that might sound good it s down from costco s earlier comparable sales growth and also below year over year inflation at 7 1 which could signal some margin compression as costco is likely paying more for the goods it sells with falling retail sales the federal reserve s latest interest rate hike and ample evidence that consumer demand is slowing 2023 is shaping up to be a tough year for retailers as the economy could sink into a recession while the company has some recession proof characteristics including its membership model and rock bottom prices the stock s recent slide shows that investors seem to be fearful of a recession costco s biggest risk going into a potential recession costco s biggest risk isn t a problem with the business but a problem with the stock s valuation at a price to earnings ratio of 35 costco is more expensive than nearly every other brick and mortar retailer and its slowing growth doesn t bode well for its premium valuation if performance continues to weaken costco s multiple is likely to compress and the stock could fall another 20 and still be considered expensive while the warehouse retailer has a rock solid business investors may want to wait for a pullback to buy the stock as shares are pricey right now especially considering the weakening economy

after scaling 40 year highs inflation in the united states has been slowly easing since summer yet the federal reserve seems decidedly unimpressed washington ap after scaling 40 year highs inflation in the united states has been slowly easing since summer yet the federal reserve seems decidedly unimpressed and unconvinced that its fight against accelerating prices is anywhere near over on thursday stock markets buckled on the growing realization that the fed may be willing to let the economy slide into recession if it decides that s what s needed to drive inflation back down to its 2 annual target the s p 500 stock index lost roughly 100 points 2 5 in its worst day since early november the losses came a day after the fed raised its benchmark interest rate for the seventh time this year the half point hike the fed announced to a range of 4 25 to 4 5 had been widely expected what spooked investors was wall street s growing understanding of how much further the fed seems willing to go to defeat high inflation in updated projections they issued wednesday the fed s policymakers forecast that they will ratchet up their key rate by an additional three quarters of a point to a hefty 5 to 5 25 and keep it there through 2023 some fed watchers had expected only an additional half point in rate hikes those higher rates will mean costlier borrowing costs for consumers and companies ranging from mortgages to auto and business loans the policymakers also downgraded their outlook for economic growth in 2023 from the 1 2 they had forecast in september to a puny 0 5 as near to a recession forecast as they were likely to make what s more they raised their expectation for the unemployment rate next year to 4 6 from 3 7 now all of which suggested that the officials expect or at least would accept an economic downturn as the price of taming inflation the message the fed was sending said ryan sweet chief u s economist at oxford economics was blunt we re going to break something we re going to break inflation or we re going to break the economy many investors had convinced themselves that with inflation pressures gradually easing the fed might soon declare some progress in their fight and perhaps even reverse course and cut rates sometime in 2023 there was seemingly reason for optimism consumer prices rose 7 1 last month from a year earlier down from 9 1 in june and the fifth straight drop even more encouragingly on a month to month basis prices inched up just 0 1 and core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy costs and which the fed tracks closely rose just 0 2 from october to november the mildest rise since august 2021 a slowing economy has eased pressure on supply chains which had previously been overwhelmed with customer orders causing shortages delays and higher prices oil prices too have plunged easing prices at the pump a gallon of unleaded gasoline cost an average 3 19 on thursday down from 5 02 in mid june according to aaa yet fed chair jerome powell who had been slow to recognize the inflation threat when it emerged in the spring of 2021 was in no mood to celebrate powell essentially shrugged off the signs of incremental progress two good monthly reports are very welcome he told reporters wednesday but we need to be honest with ourselves 12 month core inflation is 6 three times the fed s target it s good to see progress but let s just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability powell seemed to bat down hopes that the fed might end up cutting rates by late next year a move that typically acts like steroids for markets and the economy unless inflation had dropped significantly by then which he does not appear to expect the policymakers increased their inflation forecast for next year above what they were expecting back in september it suggested that they feel their anti inflation fight isn t having as much impact as they had hoped many economists were caught off guard by that change for next year the fed is projecting more rate hikes a slower economy and higher unemployment than it did three months ago all those things typically help tame inflation yet the fed s officials predict that their preferred inflation gauge will be 3 1 at the end of 2023 up from their 2 8 forecast in september that s above their 2 target and likely too high for them to feel they can cut rates the fed wasn t the only source of rising recession fears thursday the european central bank which is waging its own aggressive war against inflation signaled that it too might send rates higher than markets expected thereby raising the likelihood of a downturn in europe on thursday the u s government reported that americans slashed their spending at retailers in november that was disconcerting news in the midst of the holiday shopping season and the federal reserve banks of new york and philadelphia issued downbeat reports on manufacturing in their regions yields on long term treasurys fell a sign that bond investors are growing more concerned about a possible recession even the goods news out thursday a drop in the number of americans seeking unemployment benefits had a downside it reinforced the fed s concern that a strong and resilient job market is putting upward pressure on wages and overall inflation the fed is especially worried that a worker shortage in the labor intensive services sector everything from restaurants and hotels to airlines and entertainment venues could keep pay growth high and make inflation more intractable sweet of oxford economics said he suspects that the fed is overstating how strong inflation might be but he said he sympathized with its predicament powell and the other policymakers fear that a failure to curb high inflation even if it means a recession next year would lead to a central bank s nightmare scenario stagflation that s a worst of all worlds combination of weak growth high unemployment and persistent inflation it s a problem with no clear solution faced with that choice sweet said they ll do everything they can to prevent it ____ choe reported from new york ap economics writer christopher rugaber

by taylor schenker towns and cities all along the united states coasts are struggling to maintain spread out infrastructure at the same time rising sea levels and increasingly intense storms are shortening that infrastructure s lifecycle every year communities are devastated taxable properties are damaged and residents are left deciding whether or not to stay meanwhile municipalities struggle to recover with lower tax revenue than last year it s understandably overwhelming unless you have a plan let s begin with what we know a 2021 report released by the u s government accountability office gao revealed that although the federal emergency management agency fema has been collecting information about flood risks across america it has not used that knowledge to ensure more americans buy flood insurance as a result less than 4 of homeowners in the united states have flood insurance coverage so unsuspecting home buyers could likely lack awareness of their increased risk when fewer homeowners are insured the cost burden of disaster relief assistance falls to state and federal agencies as the frequency and intensity of disasters increase our limited recovery resources will provide little in the way of actual relief at the same time local governments are relying on a federal agency whose floodplain maps have not kept up with increasing risks after hurricane harvey made landfall in dickinson texas in the fall of 2017 50 of parcels filed an insurance claim of those parcels that filed insurance claims 27 2 were located outside fema s floodplain even worse despite legislation in 2012 that instructed fema to factor the changing climate into their maps and projections rob moore director of the water and climate team with the natural resources defense council shared that fema has only completed 8 000 flood maps since the legislation s passing and none of the maps include anything about climate projections don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free in other words relying on a federal agency to map every square foot of possible flooding in the united states is setting municipalities up for disaster many americans have been conditioned to believe that a presidential disaster declaration will unlock resources to rebuild their community after a catastrophic weather event while it is certainly true that homeowners whose primary residence is damaged during a disaster may get some financial assistance fema support is limited to 35 000 per household and does not cover second homes or rental properties alicia puente cackley director of financial markets and community investment for gao stated in a 2021 article for inside climate news that the assistance homeowners would get through a disaster declaration isn t as much as what they would get by having insurance even with insurance protection is not guaranteed after hurricanes katrina sandy and harvey hundreds of homeowners took legal action against insurance companies who used policy loopholes to avoid paying in the words of one trial litigation firm that sought relief for texas homeowners state farm one of the insurance companies sued by policyholders after katrina only covered wind damage in a hurricane and thus refused to offer relief for damages that seemed to be caused by storm surges or floods limited federal relief dollars may become available but the likelihood of a protracted and costly legal battle with insurance companies remains high for some residents the cost of those battles both financially and emotionally may be too high to justify moving back this suffocates a local government s ability to fund its own operations and basic services through property tax revenues a vicious circle that municipalities may not be able to reverse instead of hoping that gridlocked federal bureaucracies and self interested insurance companies will come to the rescue citizens businesses and local leaders need to act while they still can this begins by understanding how much taxable value and thereby property tax revenue exists in high risk areas local governments in coastal areas can start planning for citizen migration from riskier areas close to the coast take into account planning and zoning changes that may be needed to absorb large numbers of people in unexpected areas remember that gentrification and other second order effects may occur once localized climate migration begins if displacement is already a problem for some disadvantaged populations in your city changes in local development patterns in response to climate change will likely make the problem much worse use this as an opportunity to consider how to remake the safest parts of your community to be more compact walkable and financially productive in a way that allows citizens to get back to normal faster for city leaders financial continuity is critically important if you re like dickinson texas a small city in galveston county just outside of houston you re faced with rising costs of maintenance and recovery from increasing weather events and that money has to come from somewhere urban3 s climate analysis showed that 96 2 of taxable acres in galveston county or 90 6 of the city s taxable value is located within fema s 1 annual chance of flood zone we were not surprised to hear that dickinson city council had already voted 5 1 in 2019 to increase the tax rate from 40 88 to 44 38 center per 100 in home valuation in the hopes that it would be able to bring in the same amount of revenue as the following year the 3 5 cent increase comes from a formula that calculates the rate needed for the city to bring in roughly the same amount of property tax revenue as the year before while dickinson has struggled with other financial challenges it s important to note that the taxable value of property in the city has significantly changed following hurricane harvey in august 2017 we know the funds in your municipality may not be readily available for any number of reasons a tax base that has already begun to diminish low reserves or most commonly a weak political appetite for a tax increase if that s the case you should consider alternate funding sources for dickinson s city administrator chris heard boosting tax revenue was important to put the city in a position to provide matching funds when and if federal drainage money is available to be allocated to the city don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free there s billions of dollars available for flood mitigation and we need to make sure we have enough operating dollars to leverage federal funds that might come our way that require matching funds heard told the houston chronicle a tax increase in dickinson now will hopefully lead to fewer tax increases for future residents and makes it more likely that dickinson will have future residents leaders like heard already understand the magnitude of the choices they ll have to make financially and operationally to restore essential services when disaster strikes them does your community know what you need to do to afford essential services in the event of a flood hurricane or tornado what else do you need to leverage potential disaster dollars our advice do the math figure out now how much your municipality stands to lose if your most productive parcels slip under water prepare your community for hard choices so that you can withstand a climate stress test on your balance sheet and raising taxes can remain a last resort learn how to adapt land use and zoning requirements so that future city revenue is protected by designing and developing taxable real estate in low risk areas the u s government estimates that in 2021 climate related disasters cost the nation an estimated 145 billion and killed nearly 700 people these numbers are daunting and difficult to fathom in this case however as with most of urban3 s work knowledge is power allowing that knowledge to empower residents and leaders not scare them gives everyone a fighting chance to make their communities stronger and can be more financially resilient as disasters get more and more
