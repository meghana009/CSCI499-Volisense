surviving an onslaught of challenges last week stocks had digested commentary suggesting higher interest rates for longer from federal reserve chair jerome powell as well as stronger than expected

cappthesis founder wrote in a note to clients even when we receive a piece of highly anticipated news the long term outcome is predicated on factors that have yet to be revealed that being said simply getting a big something out of the way frequently provides short term relief and with tomorrow s mid term elections in the us finally upon us bullish traders are hoping for such a scenario he added cappelleri cited data from the stock trader s almanac which said that the day of and day after midterm elections have been bullish for stocks 69 and 83 of the time respectively it would come at an opportune time with the spx trying to fight back after last week s fomc meeting which prevented the index from overcoming the important 3 900 zone cappelleri said fred imbert palantir shares fall

investment strategist sam stovall the october consumer price index is slated for release on thursday morning and is expected to see a modest drop compared to the prior month that could help reverse the losses caused by the federal reserve s aggressive stance at last week s meeting the projected decline in year over year cpi growth to 7 9 from 8 2 in september and the 9 1 peak in june may allow investors to breathe a sigh of relief and resume the october rally in other words if the cpi should drop stocks may pop stovall wrote jesse pound morgan stanley s mike wilson says the bear market rally could hang around for longer if it survives this week the bear market rally could hang around for longer than investors expect if it makes it through this week according to morgan stanley s mike wilson the strategist said traders should stay bullish for now with some tight stops investors will have to get through another stacked week with the congressional midterm elections and the latest consumer inflation data after surviving an onslaught of challenges last week stocks had digested commentary suggesting higher interest rates for longer from federal reserve chair jerome powell as well as stronger than expected jobs data on friday in the end we think it survives again with the mid terms providing the catalyst for lower bond yields and higher equity prices watch 4 35 on 10 year ust yields and 3620 for s p 500 as stop out levels for the rally to end sooner than we expect he wrote in a monday note still investors should consider exiting bullish trades should the yield on the 10 year treasury climb to a new high of 4 35 as that will mean the odds of the stock rally climbing to highs greater than 3950 goes down considerably wilson said but the strategist said he does not expect markets will plunge to new lows as companies would have to further reduce 2023 earnings per share forecasts for that to happen something wilson does not expect until the fourth quarter

term effects of tuesday s midterm elections won t be known for a while just getting through an event like that could bring a short term boost for the market the market s search for certainty is a never ending quest the cappthesis founder wrote in a note to clients even when we receive a piece of highly anticipated news the long term outcome is predicated on factors that have yet to be revealed that being said simply getting a big something out of the way frequently provides short term relief and with tomorrow s mid term elections in the us finally upon us bullish traders are hoping for such a scenario he added cappelleri cited data from the stock trader s almanac which said that the day of and day after midterm elections have been bullish for stocks 69 and 83 of the time respectively it would come at an opportune time with the spx trying to fight back after last week s fomc meeting which prevented the index from overcoming the important 3 900 zone cappelleri said fred imbert palantir

looks at data that reflects what s currently happening rather than past trends as the central bank attempts to gauge inflation siegel specifically pointed to housing data which can be looked at through different indexes to get either forward estimates or past averages the university of pennsylvania finance professor said the fed should be using the former when making forward looking policy decisions like interest rate hikes they re looking at the wrong indicators siegel said on squawk box this could prompt a realization that it s time to pivot on interest rate hikes he said it s a realization of what is going on in the market siegel said adding that chair jerome powell will see the light but it is taking him a little longer alex harring goldman expects zero earnings growth next

a fairly painful recession baird s ross mayfield says baird s ross mayfield does not expect that the federal reserve will be able to raise the terminal rate to 5 25 as expectations of further rate hikes than originally anticipated grow on wall street he said the central bank could pivot after the rate hike in december i do not think they re going to be able to bring the funds rate to 5 25 which is roughly what the market s expecting right now frankly i think they re going to struggle to even bring it to 4 5 mayfield said in a friday note we think that if they take the fed funds rate all the way to 5 25 we d be talking about a fairly painful recession and quite possibly one that has credit market implications around the globe i don t think the fed can get there but chair powell might try

would propose an eu financial package this week of up to 1 5 billion a month totalling up to 18 billion to help cover ukraine s financing needs for 2023 according to a readout the support in the form of highly concessional long term loans with coverage of the interest costs would also work to support ukraine s reforms and its path towards eu membership according to the readout kakhovka dam above

plant in february of mining the dam and preparing to blow it up to create catastrophic flooding and slow down a ukrainian counteroffensive ukraine s environmental losses estimated at 37bn so far even this insane amount does not reflect the real picture the accounting chamber an audit body of the ukrainian parliament said on facebook as it estimated environmental losses at 1 35 trillion hryvnia 37

u s a ammoland com registering a firearm as an sbr is a pain in the ass between the 200 tax stamp and waiting months just to install a stock many shooters opt for a stabilizing brace instead but some guns either don t have a stabilizing brace available for them or simply don t look right with a brace installed and given the lengthy wait times deciding on which gun to sbr is no small decision and with so many guns available on the market today we ve narrowed down our list to just those chambered in pistol calibers so with that in mind here are my top 5 pistols to sbr uzi carbine 9mm by modern standards the original uzi is somewhat obsolete it is heavy lacks modularity and it doesn t even use glock magazines can you imagine but in its heyday the uzi was the gold standard for submachine guns durable reasonably accurate and incredibly reliable the uzi saw great success in service with the idf that s because the gun itself is built like a tank with the majority of it being built from steel the uzi is as strong as it is heavy but what makes the uzi such an excellent candidate for conversion into an sbr is how easy it is to convert basically there are two ways to convert a firearm to an sbr either you reduce the barrel length to under 16 inches or add a stock to a gun that already has a sufficiently short barrel with many designs this means having a gunsmith cut your firearm s barrel and thread it this is both costly and time consuming with the uzi replacing the barrel is so easy it doesn t even require tools simply depress the barrel ring retainer unscrew the barrel nut and pull the barrel free that s it so in essence shooters only need to buy a spare barrel once their tax stamp comes back easy plus the gun fires inexpensive 9mm ammo and feeds from very reliable reasonably affordable 32 round steel magazines and if nothing else anytime someone asks you what it is you can reply uzi 9mm and that s worth the cost of admission alone sig mpx 9mm when sig first announced they were producing a new submachine gun design back in 2013 more than a few people were caught totally off guard after all it was the age of the compact carbine pistol caliber carbines were being phased out for ultra compact rifle caliber weapons because of their increased ballistic efficacy but the traditional pistol caliber automatic weapon still had value with their reduced felt recoil inexpensive ammo and lightweight construction these guns are plenty effective within the confines of a building at that time nearly every prolific submachine gun in existence utilized a simple direct blow back action to reduce cost and increase reliability and while this method of operation does accomplish these goals it does so at the cost of extra weight and disproportionate felt recoil sig decided on another approach short stroke piston operation by utilizing a separate bolt carrier and piston the mpx has a light reciprocating mass which translates into less recoil additionally since the action features a locked breech the gun won t unlock until internal pressures have dropped sufficiently this makes it both soft shooting and better suited to use with a suppressor add to that the fact the mpx borrows heavily from the ar 15 in the ergonomics and modularity department and you ve got a recipe for the perfect sbr candidate what makes the mpx particularly well suited as an sbr is its combination of a compact receiver and collapsible stock that makes the entire package a perfectly balanced pseudo sub gun plus like the uzi above the mpx can readily swap out barrels though unlike the uzi the mpx requires an allen key to remove from the receiver the only downside to the mpx is cost both the gun itself and the magazines are a little pricey though thankfully shooters can find the previous generation mpx magazines for cheap if they shop around for more information check out www sigsauer com hk mp5 9mm from the sas siege on the iranian embassy to the fictional gunfight at nakatomi plaza the mp5 is the defacto good guy gun of the 1980s and while hollywood may have chosen the mp5 for its stellar looks the sas chose the stamped steel subgun for its peerless reliability and excellent accuracy based on the g3 rifle the mp5 is a roller delayed 9mm submachine gun the gun s use of rollers to delay the action makes for a very soft shooting little gun whose excess weight further soaks up what little recoil its 9mm rounds produce for those of us not drowning in disposable income semi automatic versions are available from a number of manufacturers some are crazy expensive others are only somewhat expensive but unfortunately none of them are cheap what makes the mp5 a good candidate for sbr conversion out of all the furniture options available for the mp5 none of them are as comfortable as the original polymer fixed stock yes the navy style collapsible models are excellent for transportation and the choate style mp5k stocks are neat too but the original is just about perfect and at this moment no company makes a brace that perfectly recreates the ergonomics of that stock plus shooters who own an mp5k clone will probably want the iconic vertical grip installed on it which is a big no no that runs afoul of the nfa as far as downsides the only real shortcomings on the mp5 deal with cost both initial cost and cost of ownership the latter not being terribly unexpected given that the mp5 is made by hk a company known for its pricey pieces but if you can spare the extra dough the mp5 makes an excellent sbr 10mm kriss vector the first gun on our list not chambered in 9mm parabellum is the 10mm kriss vector for the uninitiated the vector is a blow back operated firearm that utilizes the super v recoil mitigation system to achieve insane rates of fire without becoming uncontrollable in essence this recoil mitigation system redirects the reward recoil impulse downward dramatically reducing it i ve had the chance to run the 9mm and 45 acp versions in fully automatic modes and was able to easily keep the gun on target even during long bursts of automatic fire in fact the biggest reason i recommend this gun in 10mm is that it takes the normally stout recoil of 10mm auto and tames it 9mm levels essentially giving shooters an ultra controllable sbr with ballistic efficacy nearly on par with some 44 magnum loads in fact the only reason i would have suggested shooters not invest in the 10mm vector was recently solved by the engineers at kriss usa with their mag ex2 previously the largest magazine available for the 10mm vector held a scant 15 rounds of ammo but now kriss offers an extended 33 round magazine that gives shooters enough firepower to stop any threat but why should shooters make their vector an sbr for starters when in rifle configuration the vector becomes unwieldy and overly long and when configured as a pistol with a brace it lacks the ergonomic adjustability of an m4 style stock and the compact design of the side folding fixed vector stock the biggest downside of the 10mm vector is the price of keeping it fed 10mm auto ammo is not cheap but the cost if the round can be mitigated by investing in a reloading setup still if a shooter s goal is a cheap plinker the 10mm vector and any 10mm gun isn t the answer but if they re looking for a low recoil high power compact weapon with outstanding reliability and capacious magazines the vector is ideal 9mm ar 15 admittedly the inclusion of the ar 15 is a bit of a cop out that s because it is the most accurate most modular and most affordable firearm on the market today combine these benefits with the linear layout and direct impingement operation gives the ar 15 unbelievably low recoil and exceptional accuracy but until somewhat recently i didn t consider pistol caliber ar 15 pistols and carbines as ideal sbr candidates that s because unlike their rifle caliber brethren pistol caliber ar 15s tend to be direct blow back this method of operation negates two of the biggest advantages of the armalite low recoil and lightweight but thankfully the engineers at cmmg decided to take the path less traveled and develop their rotary delayed banshee series of ar 15s available in 9mm 45 acp and 10mm auto the banshee takes all the best features of the ar 15 and combines them with common affordable magazines and a recoil reducing method of operation what makes the ar a great sbr candidate is the same thing that lead to its ascension as america s favorite rifle namely modularity affordability and top tier ergonomics plus changing a pistol into an sbr is as easy as installing a buffer extension and stock once you have your tax stamp honorable mention given the massive number of pistol caliber carbines and large format pistols on the market there s no way to cover every single firearm that would make a great sbr a few that i would have liked to include but had to omit for the sake of brevity include the cz scorpion evo the psa akv and the mac series of handguns about jim grant jim is a freelance writer editor and videographer for dozens of publications who loves anything and everything guns while partial to modern military firearms and their civilian counterparts he holds a special place in his heart for the greatest battle implement ever devised and other ww2 rifles when he s not reviewing guns or shooting for fun and

news analysis for close to 47 million americans it was the best of times and it was the worst of times indeed the current cost of living crisis devastating millions of seniors nationwide has forced many to look back at the choices they made throughout their prime working years did they save and invest enough did they clock in enough hours during their career could they have put more money aside for a rainy day the last time inflation was this high dennis o connor an 82 year old retiree from temecula california says he and his peers were able to weather the storm of rising prices today however they have limited options when the last events occurred 40 years ago we were employed the overriding concern is we cannot plan retirement a second time he told the epoch times when you are younger and working you can recover retirees will never have that option before retirement o connor served as councilman and mayor for the city of oak forest he also worked as a senior executive for some of california s large infrastructure and environmental projects like most retirees we are from the silent and boomer generations and many are children of the greatest generation who experienced world war ii and the great depression he said we were told to save for retirement don t depend on social security as it may not be there contribute to a company s 401 k or put money away many retirees depend on a fixed income from their pension plans or social security checks and their investments and emergency reserves are being imbibed by inflation like most of america s retirees i am frightened o connor said noting that many seniors have no experience dealing with inflation and recession during retirement dennis o connor at his home in temecula calif on oct 12 2022 john fredricks the epoch times he s especially worried about women from his generation they had greater challenges because of lower wages lack of available retirement plans and the breakdown of the family in addition the stock and bond markets have had a rough year and it could be a while before investors see a recovery in their portfolios the bear market has led to investment valuations crumbling as much as 20 percent for o connor his aggressive funds have tumbled between 35 and 40 percent according to the center for retirement research at boston college americans lost 1 4 trillion in their 401 k accounts and an additional 2 trillion in their individual retirement accounts in the first half of this year now that the specter of recession clouds over the nation there is even more uncertainty for the markets sadly i and most retirees thought our futures would be comfortable but now that is in doubt o connor said back to work today s generation of retirees is now seeing every aspect of their lives dented by broad based and persistent inflation gas prices grocery store prices and electricity bills have all increased by double digits this year a recent survey by allianz found that more than half of americans are being forced to reduce or stop their contributions to their retirement savings forty three percent say they dipped into their savings while 72 percent of baby boomers are concerned that growing living costs will affect their retirement plans today s generation of retirees is now seeing every aspect of their lives dented by broad based and persistent inflation gas prices grocery store prices and electricity bills have all increased by double digits this year kt hundsen who chose to use a pseudonym to protect her identity lives in a suburb of minneapolis minnesota she and her husband of more than three decades have led responsible lives they pay their bills at the end of every month and refrain from carrying debt the couple paid off their mortgage last summer and saved money while never overspending we did the very best job we could to prepare for our senior years hundsen told the epoch times her household lives on a few income streams including social security her husband s pension and an annuity that he withdraws a certain amount from each year the issue is that the income has been less than they anticipated because a cost of living adjustment isn t attached to the pension her husband retired last summer but the inflationary economy has forced him to return to work as a janitor at church although he had intended to work only 8 to 10 hours per week he has doubled his hours to help cover the cost of his wife s 600 per month health insurance premium the concept of unretirement has gained popularity this year like her husband many older americans are returning to the workforce or abandoning the concept of retirement altogether according to data gathered by bayard advertising a recruitment advertising agency 64 percent of adults between 55 and 64 years of age returned to the workforce this past spring about one third of seniors think they will work through the age of 70 or never retire a study by blackrock discovered while the extra money has been of tremendous help to the hundsens they receive some other perks from the church if they have an extra gallon of milk he can bring it home and then i make cheese with it she said she also feels like she should be working but employment prospects with her credentials are hard to find meanwhile in response to growing food costs hundsen is making other changes especially after seeing the steady rise in prices at the supermarket she usually buys turkey meat but it was 11 99 a pound at the deli so i didn t buy it she is using her garden more often and canning certain items i m doing more of that than i have ever done before she said but there are limits to how many adjustments we can make doing everything right according to estimates from bloomberg economists inflation costs have added more than when property taxes increase gasoline prices go up and other month to month fixed costs continually climb everything starts to add up according to estimates from bloomberg economists inflation costs have added more than 5 000 a year to the typical family s budget i feel kind of because we thought we did everything right hundsen said we weren t extravagant we didn t buy too much we drove our cars for 15 or 20 years we didn t do anything fancy and i don t know it s kind of stunning but i m sure there are people who are much worse off than we are according to clara del villar director of senior initiatives at freedomworks foundation 40 percent of americans have no savings in their retirement so that means during these volatile times and during inflationary times they do have to go back to work she told the epoch times their skills may not be up to date so you do see them more in walmart or other big box retail stores while hundsen is hopeful conditions will get better she isn t optimistic about all the debt the u s government has saddled her two sons and their family with for years to come there s no good solution that will be painful hundsen said it s depressing to think how will we ever dig ourselves out of that hole the national debt recently topped 31 trillion while interest payments were approximately 400 billion last year in other words each taxpayer is on the hook for around 248 000 of the debt and each adult is responsible for nearly 14 000 of the total interest paid the forgotten americans although these stories are all too common o connor feels that retirees are the forgotten ones because their life challenges aren t understood by the news commentators editors policymakers and the social media crowd we have no spokesperson that understands the lack of control retirees are facing he said we have little margin for error and how do you put a price tag on so many emotional issues dennis o connor and his wife christy o connor at their home in temecula calif on oct 12 2022 john fredricks the epoch times it is unfortunate we have media and political leaders that show little interest in our value o connor added it s this bleak attitude and then some that s being felt throughout the country del villar adds i think there s more anger out there this being downplayed in the media she said i think the media is really downplaying how destructive this inflationary force can be social security recipients will receive a more than 8 percent increase in their benefits next year unfortunately according to del villar this will still fall short of helping seniors or retirees especially during the fall and winter months as overall energy costs are forecast to balloon by 20 percent year over year reassessing retirement this dire situation that has left too many seniors in the lurch could lead to a broader conversation about the state of retirement according to laurence kotlikoff a professor of economics at boston university and a new york times best selling author be it the tax impact on social security checks or the public failing to examine their employers 401 k program adequately it s been an experiment fiasco for far too many people considering that social security s cash reserves are projected to run dry by 2034 and that unfunded liabilities exceed 163 trillion that conversation might need to happen sooner rather than later inflation is embedded in nearly every component of the u s economy stocks are stuck in a bear market the post pandemic economy is slowing down and taxes are on the rise these features of the current economic landscape leave too many senior americans struggling to keep their heads above water what should be a time for millions of retirees to relax do things they love and spend time with their grandkids is now a time to head back to the workforce or squeeze every penny this isn t how older americans thought their golden years would be

two years ago hvc cigars began shipping the first vitola in a new limited release commemorating the 500th anniversary of the founding of havana cuba somewhat appropriately named 500 years anniversary the line is made up of nicaraguan tobaccos sourced from aganorsa a corojo 99 wrapper from jalapa a binder also from jalapa and criollo 98 and corojo 99 fillers grown in the estelí and jalapa regions of nicaragua that first size in the line was the hvc 500 years anniversary tesoros a 5 7 8 x 52 robusto extra that is the same size used for the cohiba siglo vi the 5 5 8 x 46 selectos vitola followed in may 2020 while 4 1 2 x 52 shorts size was added as an exclusive for privada cigar club that same year in april 2021 hvc announced that the 500 years anniversary would become a regular production line a fourth size was debuted during the 2022 pca convention tradeshow specifically a 6 3 4 x 56 salomon vitola priced at 13 50 per cigar that is packaged in 15 count boxes interestingly the salomon is being rolled at fábrica de tabacos hvc s a de reinier lorenzo hvc s new factory in estelí nicaragua instead of the aganorsa leaf s agricola ganadera norteña s a factory which is where the original 500 years and the two subsequent sizes have been made there are currently four different vitolas under the hvc 500 years anniversary line the hvc 500 years anniversary salomon was sold exclusively to retailers who placed orders during the 2022 pca convention trade show and boxes began shipping to stores in early september cigar reviewed hvc 500 years anniversary salomon hvc 500 years anniversary salomon country of origin nicaragua nicaragua factory fábrica de tabacos hvc s a de reinier lorenzo fábrica de tabacos hvc s a de reinier lorenzo wrapper nicaragua corojo 99 jalapa nicaragua corojo 99

box of 15 202 50 13 50 box of 15 202 50 release date september 2022 september 2022 number of cigars released regular production regular production number of cigars smoked for review 3 from both a visual and physical perspective the hvc 500 years salomon is quite imposing with its combination of torpedo cap tapered foot and close to seven inches in length the wrapper is a gorgeous reddish milk chocolate brown color that is fairly smooth to the touch while there is not much oil noticeable there is no lack of overt veins running up and down its length all three cigars are extremely firm when squeezed just short of rock hard and one has a small soft spot near the foot on the right hand side aroma from the wrapper is strong and sweet hay barnyard cedar cocoa nibs leather tack and generic sweetness the foot brings notes of creamy nuts dark chocolate freshly brewed coffee cedar earth and raisins after a dickman cut the cold draw is dominated by flavors of creamy hay and raisin sweetness with milk chocolate cashews earth espresso beans leather and very slight black pepper following behind while the draw is a bit tight in the first few puffs not all that unusual when it comes to perfecto vitolas it gets noticeably better after that allowing me to taste flavors of earth and hay as well as some distinct mineral saltiness on my lips both of those quickly recede to the background replaced by the main flavor combination of creamy cashews and aged cedar secondary notes include not only the aforementioned earth and hay but also leather cinnamon espresso beans cocoa nibs and a slight vegetal flavor that comes and goes there is also an abundance of black pepper on the retrohale but it is nicely balanced by a massive amount of cotton candy sweetness that does a great job of increasing the overall complexity of the profile flavor starts out with a bang at a solid medium while the body is at mild plus and the strength ends the first third at a point just under medium in terms of construction the draw is excellent on all three cigars after the burn line passes the nub is plenty of thick smoke and there are no issues with the burn lines cashew remains one of the main flavors in the profile during the second third of the cigar but the aged cedar note from the first third is replaced by a powdery cocoa nib flavor additional notes of cinnamon creamy hay gritty earth leather and ground coffee flit in and out at various points but the slight vegetal flavor that was present in the first third has totally disappeared by the halfway point the retrohale continues to be dominated by a combination of black pepper and cotton candy sweetness the latter of which seems to be getting stronger as the second third burns down and the mineral saltiness on my lips remains strong enough to make an impact on the overall profile flavor increases to just over medium the body increases to just under medium but the strength features a substantial increase to end at medium full construction wise the draw and smoke production continue along their excellent paths but one cigar needed two burn corrections to keep it on track while the flavors of powdery cocoa nibs and creamy cashews continue to top the profile the strength in the blend continues to increase until it breaks through the full mark halfway through the final third this aggressive strength causes some balance issues with the rest of the profile which also includes notes of toasted bread earth bitter espresso beans dry hay cinnamon and a slight citrus peel flavor unfortunately there is also an increase in the amount of black pepper on the retrohale as well as a noticeable decrease in the cotton candy sweetness which has a negative effect on the overall balance the body ends the cigar slightly over medium while the flavor hits at a point just under the full mark finally only one cigar needs a quick correction to stay on track but all three continue to exhibit close to perfect draws and copious amounts of smoke emanating from the foot final notes havana cuba is not only the inspiration for the name of the hvc brand the acronym stands for havana city but it is also the hometown of company founder reinier lorenzo the hvc 500 years anniversary tesoros took the 19th place in halfwheel s top 25 of 2019 while both the tesoros and the selectos were originally released with a edición limitada secondary band the salomon does not include it each of the cigars i smoked developed small cracks at some point but none of them became enough of an issue to affect the construction in any major way i would be very interested to see if the full strength hits in the final third of this cigar dissipates a bit over time to not only help with the overall balance but also to allow more of the cotton candy sweetness to emerge the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time for all three cigars averaged two hours and 29 minutes if you would like to purchase any of the hvc 500 years anniversary salomon cigars site sponsors atlantic cigar co and famous smoke shop has them in stock here 88 overall score after smoking my first hvc 500 years anniversary salomon i was more than a little surprised at the amount of strength that this vitola exhibits especially when compared with the other size i have smoked in the line having said that the first two thirds are full of distinct and complex flavors including creamy cashews cocoa nibs and cedar along with a wonderful cotton candy sweetness on the retrohale yes the strength becomes overwhelming in the final third which in turn throws off the balance but even with that being the case the first two thirds makes this one of the best blends i have smoked from hvc that i think will only get better with age
it sounds like an absurd superpower granted to a character in the marvel cinematic universe mcu but scientists have discovered a way for people to send messages from their brains to an iphone or ipad a company called synchron has been given the green light from the fda to conduct clinical trials the goal is to make it possible for those with a disease like als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis better known as lou gehrig s disease to communicate with others als prevents people from voluntarily moving their muscles eventually leaving them unable to breathe talk write walk or eat on their own but with the use of a brain implant and a device called the synchron switch those afflicted with the disease will can send messages to an iphone or ipad the device works with sensors called a stentrode which is inserted into the top of the brain using a blood vessel this can be done using a minimally invasive procedure instead of a more extensive neurosurgery operation just thinking about tapping his foot allows a synchron clinical trial patient to tap the screen of an ipad once inserted the sensors are controlled wirelessly using a device called the synchron switch which is placed on the patient s chest the parts made by synchron are expected to be permanent parts of the patient s body and so far four have had them installed for over a year without any problems overall synchron is testing this on six patients although retired software salesman rodney gorham in melbourne australia is the first to use it with an apple device for example while gorham suffers from als if he thinks about tapping his foot his ipad receives a signal as though he is tapping his finger on the tablet s touchscreen gillian hayes a professor of informatics at the university of california irvine says that synchron has come up with a big breakthrough what s really exciting about this project of course is that they ve done something really innovative and connected it into something that s standard professor hayes said tom oxley synchron s co founder and ceo said that he is excited about ios and apple products because they re so ubiquitous eventually patients unable to communicate due to als or some other kind of debilitating disease might be able to think about what they want to say and have the thought turn into a message on an iphone or ipad we are still several years away from making this a smooth seamless process synchron likens this to bluetooth for the brain synchron hopes to help those with als and other diseases communicate their thoughts at the very least scientists and engineers are on the right path as they hope to make life easier for those who have been hit by some of the cruelest diseases known to man als for example does not affect thinking or intelligence what it does is prevent a person from sharing or communicating their thoughts with others and that is why synchron s technology is a big deal recommended stories imagine being able to think but unable to share these thoughts because of a disease can you imagine how frustrating this would be in the future synchron s work might make it possible for patients to rid themselves of these feelings by allowing them to transmit their thoughts to an iphone or ipad the story was posted saturday by unilad a british internet company synchron is based in new york and owns 105 patents the company says that our vision is to restore lives by deciphering the neural code of the brain you can check out the company s website at synchron com or by tapping on this link at the moment the company is privately owned and does not have shares trading on a public stock exchange there is no word on whether an initial public offering ipo is in the company s future

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of

relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

in the press finding the top financial advisor in the united states means choosing between thousands of options whether you re looking for help with retirement wealth management or tax planning the u s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

peppers add pep to these 5 recipes from alabama cooks peppers are a great way to add color flavor and nutrition to a wide variety of foods says sheree taylor human sciences regional extension agent for the alabama cooperative extension system they are low in calories and burst in flavor she says peppers can be crisp sweet or spicy not to mention they come in green red orange or yellow colors and sometimes a bit of all four all colors of peppers have nutritional benefits taylor says but red peppers actually have higher antioxidant and phytonutrient levels because they are riper they also supply more potassium vitamin c and folate but all peppers are nutritious and easy to add to any meal people can slice them eat them raw grilled sautéed or roasted when preparing foods with peppers be mindful that boiling or cooking them may cause a loss of 50 of the nutrients taylor advises instead of boiling or steaming she recommends dry heat methods such as stir frying or roasting peppers can

rosuvastatin lowered ldl total cholesterol and serum triglycerides significantly more than placebo and six common over the counter dietary supplements with no supplement lowering ldl more than placebo researchers reported many of us cardiologists and primary care physicians see our patients medication lists littered with a variety of over the counter dietary supplements luke j laffin md co director of the center for blood pressure disorders at cleveland clinic told healio when we look at the data three quarters of americans take some form of dietary supplement and unfortunately almost 20 of those are doing so for so called heart health or cholesterol health in that vein we know there are not any peer reviewed data to support claims made about these supplements daily rosuvastatin lowered ldl total cholesterol and serum triglycerides significantly more than placebo and six common over the counter dietary supplements with no supplement lowering ldl more than placebo source adobe stock for the sport study presented at the american heart association scientific sessions researchers randomly assigned participants 5 mg daily of rosuvastatin placebo or one of six dietary supplements fish oil nature made cinnamon nutriflair garlic garlique turmeric bioschwartz plant sterols nature made cholestoff plus or red yeast rice arazo nutrition comparing supplements vs statin the eight arm randomized double blind investigator initiated study included 190 adults aged 40 to 75 years who had ldl between 70 and 189 mg dl no history of atherosclerotic cvd and an increased 10 year risk of ascvd mean age 64 years 59 women 89 white mean baseline ldl was 128 2 mg dl median high sensitivity c reactive protein was 1 4 mg l mean total cholesterol was 206 5 mg dl and median serum triglycerides were 87 5 mg dl luke j laffin we chose those criteria because in line with the current lipid guidelines those people should at least have a discussion about a statin laffin told healio after randomization the researchers measured fasting lipids conducted a complete metabolic panel and assessed high sensitivity c reactive protein at baseline and day 28 adherence was measured using pill counts from returned bottles the primary endpoint was percent change in ldl from baseline for rosuvastatin compared in a hierarchical order with placebo and each supplement after 28 days the percent ldl reduction with rosuvastatin was greater than all supplements and placebo p 001 mean percent decrease in ldl for rosuvastatin was 37 9 95 ci 42 1 to 33 6 the difference in ldl reduction with rosuvastatin compared with placebo was 35 2 95 ci 41 3 to 29 1 p 001 none of the dietary supplements demonstrated a significant decrease in ldl compared with placebo however garlic showed a significant increase in ldl of 7 8 95 ci 1 7 to 13 8 p 01 according to the results patients randomized to the low dose statin group had a 24 4 reduction in total cholesterol from baseline 95 ci 27 6 to 21 3 compared with placebo and all supplements p 001 for all comparisons the statin group also experienced significant serum triglyceride lowering from baseline 19 3 95 ci 27 6 to 9 9 which was greater than all comparators p 001 for all comparisons according to the results adverse event rates were similar across study groups there were no reports of musculoskeletal or neurological adverse events in the statin arm supplement data sobering what we saw was not necessarily surprising laffin told healio rosuvastatin lowered ldl by almost 38 and was vastly superior to any of the supplements and placebo additionally supplements did not lower ldl cholesterol inflammatory markers total cholesterol or triglycerides any more than placebo one of the surprising features was garlic actually increased cholesterol this was sobering and i m glad we have this data for the public laffin noted that sport was not a cv outcomes trial the lack of an impact on inflammatory biomarkers with rosuvastatin was likely due to the small sample size additionally the short study duration may not fully capture the impact of supplements on lipid and inflammatory biomarkers he said just because a supplement may be marketed as natural does not mean it is safe laffin told healio with these supplements we do have to worry about drug drug interactions the way these are metabolized they can interact with certain prescription drugs we know that fish oil does not improve cv outcomes but it may increase risk for atrial fibrillation these supplements still come in pill form they are not coming from a garden references

bloomberg china s party congress heightened policy risks that can push its stocks into a prolonged period of valuation compression said a co founder of a 22 year old asia focused hedge fund firm drawing analogies between china and japan in the 1990s indus capital partners byron gill said the company s 729 million pacific opportunities fund began to cut its exposure to china equities in the first quarter of 2021 and has spent much of this year net short the country when you combine a step change lower in the trajectory of economic growth with profound policy errors you inevitably get multiple compressions in the equity market said the san francisco based co founder of the firm that oversees 3 2 billion global investors including chase coleman s tiger global management are rushing to divest or reduce exposure to china fueled by concerns over president xi jinping s tightening grip on power a gauge of hong kong listed chinese companies has lost 33 this year making it one of the worst performing major stock index tracked by bloomberg globally gill honed his skills as an analyst of japanese stocks followed by an 18 month stint leading the tokyo office of soros fund management and heading indus s japan office for its first seven years since the end of 1989 japan s topix index dropped 33 in local currency terms while the msci world index more than quadrupled gill blamed it on japan wrongly timing the implementation of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies and procrastinating moves to rescue the financial industry in china today we have zero covid common prosperity and the unwinding of the property bubble having a similar effect he added by showing the door literally to politicians with a technocratic background and by elevating ideological allies who will promote xi s specific policy agenda the risk of policy error has indeed risen gill also cited risks of rising interest rates and an escalation of sino us tensions over taiwan the 184 billion teacher retirement system of texas is among investors who recently cut the long term target allocations to chinese stocks seeking to reduce the outsized china risks in its emerging markets portfolio the sustained valuation compression in japan hurt a generation of investors who picked growth stocks using bottom up analysis of company earnings indus whose oldest hedge fund focuses on japan is one of the survivors the fund has made 6 6 on an annualized basis from its 2000 inception to the end of september this year its pacific fund made money in all but two of its first nine years profits from both bullish and bearish bets in china pushed its fund return in 2022 to an estimated 1 6 by the end of october according to an investor update seen by bloomberg news that compares with the eurekahedge asia long short equities hedge fund index s 14 decline china is not doomed to follow japan s footsteps though gill said it will depend on policy choices that beijing makes on industries including property and banking indus will continue to find opportunities for bearish wagers among chinese companies listed on international exchanges while trying to identify gems in the yuan denominated domestic stock market as long term holdings 2022 bloomberg l p

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

stock market blackboard concept getty as contrarian income seekers we buy when yields are high and prices are low today we re going to explore a three pack of dividend funds that pays 8 5 this is retire in style income we put a million dollars in these plays and get paid 85 000 per year plus we keep our principal intact and wait there s more the cheapest of these three funds is currently trading for just 89 cents on the dollar yes that s an 11 discount to the value of its underlying holdings too good to be true or bottom fishing bargain let s explore my preferred dividend strategy and these three dividend machines my preferred asset for retirement investing the high yield haven in question is called preferred stock a lesser seen type of stock that some companies will issue when they want to raise money but for whatever reason don t want to issue more traditional stock nor bonds which is interesting because preferreds share characteristics of both on the one hand preferreds trade on an exchange and represent equity in the issuing company just like common stock but rather than trading violently up and down preferreds usually trade around a par value deliver a fixed amount of income and typically don t include voting rights just like bonds but what i love about preferreds are their unique perks preference the term preferred stock comes from the fact that the shares have preference over common stock that means preferred dividends actually must be paid out before dividends on common stocks most of this time it doesn t matter but it can act as a little extra protection from having your dividends cut or suspended when the company is struggling the term preferred stock comes from the fact that the shares have preference over common stock that means preferred dividends actually must be paid out before dividends on common stocks most of this time it doesn t matter but it can act as a little extra protection from having your dividends cut or suspended when the company is struggling cumulative dividends sometimes not always but sometimes they can pay cumulative dividends that means that if a company misses even a single dividend payment to preferred shareholders it must make up that payment before it pays any dividends on common stock again sometimes not always but sometimes they can pay cumulative dividends that means that if a company misses even a single dividend payment to preferred shareholders it must make up that payment before it pays any dividends on common stock again giant yields much more often than not preferred stock dividends will be far higher than their respective common stock for instance citigroup c c yields a decently high 4 5 but its series j preferreds yield well more than that at 6 9 more striking is conglomerate danaher dhr whose commons yield a paltry 0 4 while its series b preferreds dole out a respectable 3 6 so if preferreds are so great why are they eating asphalt because preferreds are so bond like namely their returns are all about yields they historically have been a lot more stable than common stock but that very same characteristic has allowed them to fall victim to an aggressive federal reserve with persistent rate hikes sending bonds and preferreds alike to the mat but eventually rates will top out we are heading into the most telegraphed recession in american history as the economy slows down money will come back to the bond market and preferred stock closed end funds cefs in particular will soar they trade like bonds but better when the rate winds are at our backs these cefs can really soar today the three we are going to discuss all yield 8 or more all three are trading for well below their net asset value nav which means we re buying these big dividends for as little as 89 cents on the dollar nuveen variable rate preferred income fund npfd distribution yield 8 4 we ll start with one of the freshest faced cefs on the market the nuveen variable rate preferred income fund npfd which came to life less than a year ago on dec 15 2021 thus the 9 3 discount as i write vs its historical discount of 8 2 doesn t mean as much but it s still a nearly 10 discount on preferred assets and an 8 plus yield so it s worth exploring npfd primarily invests in companies variable rate preferred securities and other variable rate income producing securities as should be no surprise those companies are predominantly financial sector firms the top four industries by exposure are diversified banks 28 insurance 14 regional banks 14 and capital markets 12 no 5 for contrast is oil gas and consumable fuels at a steep dropoff of 5 credit quality is quite high too with more than two thirds of the fund s assets allocated to investment grade preferreds another 27 are in the highest junk level bb leaving only about 4 in b and unrated securities but despite this high quality npfd manages a juicy yield of more than 8 by going all in on leverage 38 as of the most recent data so why variable rate preferreds well much like floating rate loans help reduce interest rate risk for business development companies bdcs variable rate preferreds help reduce interest rate risk in other words these preferreds shouldn t decline as much as their fixed rate brethren while the fed keeps the pedal down on rate hikes for example look at the global x variable rate preferred etf s pffv performance this year versus the ishares preferred and income securities etf pff pff which serves as the de facto benchmark for preferreds but while the variable nature of its holdings should reduce interest rate risk that s countered by the very same leverage that gives npfd its ample yield as i ve previously explained to my contrarian income report readers several cefs including preferred funds are being hampered by higher borrowing costs thanks to rising short term rates indeed not only has npfd underperformed pff and pffv but it s also lagging the two other cefs i m about to show you early days for npfd but other than the yield i m not seeing anything worth getting excited about cohen steers limited duration preferred and income fund ldp distribution yield 8 4 cohen steers limited duration preferred and income fund ldp is uncommon in that as the name suggests it s a limited duration fund many preferreds are perpetual in nature meaning they have no real duration but limited duration funds home in on those preferreds that do have tangible endpoints again in theory helping cut down on interest rate risk your typical duration fund will have a duration of six years or less at the moment ldp s duration is a hair under three years credit risk meanwhile is pretty much par for the course roughly half of the portfolio is invested in investment grade preferreds and another third or so is in bb rated issues a hair better overall than pff s portfolio quality despite these limited duration holdings ldp has a much higher yield than pff which it can chalk up to nearly 35 in debt leverage which again is not particularly helpful when rates are rising and preferreds are dropping but longer term that leverage has worked in ldp s favor so while ldp has been down on its luck of late a 6 3 discount versus a five year average discount of just 2 4 might be signaling an attractive entry point cohen steers tax advantaged preferred securities and income fund pta dividend yield 8 8 the biggest yield of the bunch can be found in another young fund the cohen steers tax advantaged preferred securities and income fund pta a covid era launch from october 2020 you can find the best performance of the bunch here too if you re reading the term tax advantaged in the name and are thinking municipal preferreds i completely understand tax advantaged is a very common fund nomenclature for municipal bonds but that s not the case here what pta is trying to do per the prospectus is achieve favorable after tax returns for its shareholders by seeking to minimize the u s federal income tax consequences on income generated by the fund and the fund has two ways of doing that invest in preferreds that pay qualified dividends this isn t difficult many already do achieve favorable tax treatment by holding longer this secures a better long term capital gains rate the result isn t some wildly divergent portfolio however it s pretty standard banking makes up 51 of assets followed by insurance 14 and utilities 8 top holdings include preferreds from jpmorgan chase jpm jpm charles schwab schw and bank of america bac bac if there s anything of particular note it s the geographic diversification you could rightly call this a global fund with just 63 of holdings from the u s the u k 7 france 6 and canada 5 are among 15 other countries represented like the other preferred funds here pta uses a high amount 38 of leverage which is certainly a weight but nodding to the chart above it s actually about neck and neck with pff hinting at some solid portfolio choices by this cohen steers management team also helping is that management does have the option of occasionally investing in stocks government bonds even munis to generate alpha again there s not much track record here but 2022 has been relatively encouraging an 11 1 discount to nav isn t precipitously cheaper than pta s 8 8 average in its short trading history but does represent a chance to snap up a nearly 9 yield while buying assets for 89 cents on the dollar brett owens is chief investment strategist for contrarian outlook for more great income ideas get your free copy his latest special report

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

signal this time around barclays says a pause from the federal reserve may not be the bullish signal that investors hope it will be according to barclays while a dovish pivot has historically been a positive sign for stocks barclays strategist venu krishna said in a monday note that it can be a bearish signal when it coincides with a recession that s already underway throughout the great moderation the fed has been able to pause its tightening campaign well before the onset of a recession often paving the way for new equity market highs before the eventual economic downturn krishna wrote however while reviewing data going back to the 1950s to find circumstances comparable to the current time period the strategist found that the lag between rate hikes and recession shrink and often overlap when the fed was combatting high inflation if a recession is at hand by the time the last hike of a cycle is pushed through the pause is typically a bearish signal not a bullish one

clear results on election night could create near term uncertainty investing strategist says ubiquitous use of mail in ballots and the possibility of run off elections could mean no clear answer as to

does not expect large market reaction if results are still coming in after the day of voting technically ends mail in ballots can cause delays in final tallies because some jurisdictions do not allow them to be counted before election day creating a backlog for poll workers the possibility of no immediate resolution on election night could lead to uncertainty in the nearterm but is unlikely to

fred imbert easing inflation could boost stocks later this week a big inflation report this week could remove a potential roadblock for stocks to build on the recent rally according to cfra chief investment strategist sam stovall the october consumer price index is slated for release on thursday morning and is expected to see a modest drop compared to the prior month that could help reverse the losses caused by the federal reserve s aggressive stance at last week s meeting the projected decline in year over year cpi growth to 7 9 from 8 2 in september and the 9 1 peak in june may allow investors to breathe a sigh of relief and resume the october rally in other words if the cpi should drop stocks may pop stovall wrote jesse pound morgan stanley s mike wilson says the bear market rally could hang around for longer if it survives this week the bear market rally could hang around for longer than investors expect if it makes it through this week according to morgan stanley s mike wilson the strategist said traders should stay bullish for now with some tight stops investors will have to get through another stacked week with the congressional midterm elections and the latest consumer inflation data after surviving an onslaught of challenges last week stocks had digested commentary suggesting higher interest rates for longer from federal reserve chair jerome powell as well as stronger than expected jobs data on friday in the end we think it survives again with the mid terms providing the catalyst for lower bond yields and higher equity prices watch 4 35 on 10 year ust yields and 3620 for s p 500 as stop out levels for the rally to end sooner than we expect he wrote in a monday note still investors should consider exiting bullish trades should the yield on the 10 year treasury climb to a new high of 4 35 as that will mean the odds of the stock rally climbing to highs greater than 3950 goes down considerably wilson said but the strategist said he does not expect markets will plunge to new lows as companies would have to further reduce 2023 earnings per share forecasts for that to happen something wilson does not expect until the fourth quarter reporting season in short the bear market rally is likely to hang around for longer than most expect if it can survive this week s test he wrote sarah min stocks open higher u s stocks rose monday as

term effects of tuesday s midterm elections won t be known for a while just getting through an event like that could bring a short term boost for the market the market s search for certainty is a never ending quest the cappthesis founder wrote in a note to clients even when we receive a piece of highly anticipated news the long term outcome is predicated on factors that have yet to be revealed that being said simply getting a big something out of the way frequently provides short term relief and with tomorrow s mid term elections in the us finally upon us bullish traders are hoping for such a scenario he added cappelleri cited data from the stock trader s almanac which said that the day of and day after midterm elections have been bullish for stocks 69 and 83 of the time respectively it would come at an opportune time with the spx trying to fight back after last week s fomc meeting which prevented the index from overcoming the important 3 900 zone cappelleri said fred imbert palantir

looks at data that reflects what s currently happening rather than past trends as the central bank attempts to gauge inflation siegel specifically pointed to housing data which can be looked at through different indexes to get either forward estimates or past averages the university of pennsylvania finance professor said the fed should be using the former when making forward looking policy decisions like interest rate hikes they re looking at the wrong indicators siegel said on squawk box this could prompt a realization that it s time to pivot on interest rate hikes he said it s a realization of what is going on in the market siegel said adding that chair jerome powell will see the light but it is taking him a little longer alex harring goldman expects zero earnings growth next

hikes than originally anticipated grow on wall street he said the central bank could pivot after the rate hike in december i do not think they re going to be able to bring the funds rate to 5 25 which is roughly what the market s expecting right now frankly i think they re going to struggle to even bring it to 4 5 mayfield said in a friday note we think that if they take the fed funds rate all the way to 5 25 we d be talking about a fairly painful recession and quite possibly one that has credit market implications around the globe i don t think the fed can get there but chair powell might try

editor s note china s whole process people s democracy which is democracy in its broadest most genuine and most effective form is the defining feature of socialist democracy it is a complete political system because unlike us style democracy which is a democracy of a few people and groups it is devoted to serving the chinese people at all levels and of all ethnic groups three experts share their views on whole process people s democracy with china daily ma xuejing china daily an article titled chinese democracy a true solution published in china daily in december 2021 said china holds direct election of deputies to the county and township level people s congresses the author chen yun charge d affaires chinese embassy in indonesia describes the chinese government system as an institutional foundation for protecting the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people this shows democracy should be for all the people not just for the wealthy and this is perhaps the simplest way of explaining why corruption is so high in the so called democratic governments in western countries during the past year a new saying has gained popularity on divisive social media platforms such as twitter in the west in china the government tells the billionaires what to do in the us the billionaires tell the government what to do the fact that this saying is true is disturbing it s an assault on the real meaning and application of democratic principles and it gives rise to questions such as isn t the multi billion dollar world of lobbying corporations and ngos in washington a legalized system of bribery that serves to cancel out and summarily eviscerate the importance of citizens votes what is happening is that leaders give you a nice ideologically driven feeling before you use your precious vote but the moment you walk out of the polling booth a corporation lobbyist hands over millions of dollars to the senator you just voted for asking him or her to support some new legislation they need to secure their corporate profits negating the value of your vote the saddest part is that you have no way of stopping it or knowing whether it benefits society or not a princeton university study in 2014 confirmed our worst fears that the united states government apparatus is either an oligarchy or plutocracy certainly not a democracy although some politicians at the time made feeble attempts to rebut the findings even eight years later no one would dare to deny the conclusion of the study since march 2020 apparently to respond to the covid 19 pandemic the us federal reserve according to reports has pumped close to 30 trillion directly into the hands of billionaires and bankers and before that previous president donald trump signed the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 saying corporations would invest the money thus saved in the country including in the much needed research and development sector and increase workers pay but did the corporations use the saved taxes to help the people before answering the question let s take a look at the findings of a national bureau of economic research study according to the bureau the wealthiest top 10 percent of the population owns 84 percent of public shareholder stocks although we do know that workers received about 1 billion of the trillions of dollars as added bonuses about 1 trillion was authorized for corporate stock buybacks as such high income households benefited the most about the tax cuts act bret wells a tax law professor at the university of houston had said it is largely the top 1 percent that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people in the world let us return to china china s description of socialist democracy with chinese characteristics is often mocked by some western pundits politicians and media outlets but in making their case they ignore the most important part of the story that is socialist democracy with chinese characteristics indeed helps improve the livelihoods of the chinese people look no further than to china s 14th five year plan 2021 25 to understand that the country s government is taking measures to meet the needs of the people the chinese government has always responded to the call of the people and endeavored to improve their lives and livelihoods one example of that is publicizing a draft bill to solicit public opinions before finalizing a piece of legislation martin jacques a british political analyst academic and author of when china rules the world explains the matter thus the west boasts that its style of democracy is innately superior to all other forms of governance but this is empty rhetoric the ultimate test is the ability to deliver to improve people s living standards that is what wins hearts and mind in the chinese government s application of democratic principles to improve people s lives and livelihoods we also find the use of quality governance to build a safe stable and secure society if that is not worthy of admiration what is mario cavolo is an american writer living in china and a senior fellow at the center for china and globalization the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily

completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

editor s note china s whole process people s democracy which is democracy in its broadest most genuine and most effective form is the defining feature of socialist democracy it is a complete political system because unlike us style democracy which is a democracy of a few people and groups it is devoted to serving the chinese people at all levels and of all ethnic groups three experts share their views on whole process people s democracy with china daily ma xuejing china daily an article titled chinese democracy a true solution published in china daily in december 2021 said china holds direct election of deputies to the county and township level people s congresses the author chen yun charge d affaires chinese embassy in indonesia describes the chinese government system as an institutional foundation for protecting the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people this shows democracy should be for all the people not just for the wealthy and this is perhaps the simplest way of explaining why corruption is so high in the so called democratic governments in western countries during the past year a new saying has gained popularity on divisive social media platforms such as twitter in the west in china the government tells the billionaires what to do in the us the billionaires tell the government what to do the fact that this saying is true is disturbing it s an assault on the real meaning and application of democratic principles and it gives rise to questions such as isn t the multi billion dollar world of lobbying corporations and ngos in washington a legalized system of bribery that serves to cancel out and summarily eviscerate the importance of citizens votes what is happening is that leaders give you a nice ideologically driven feeling before you use your precious vote but the moment you walk out of the polling booth a corporation lobbyist hands over millions of dollars to the senator you just voted for asking him or her to support some new legislation they need to secure their corporate profits negating the value of your vote the saddest part is that you have no way of stopping it or knowing whether it benefits society or not a princeton university study in 2014 confirmed our worst fears that the united states government apparatus is either an oligarchy or plutocracy certainly not a democracy although some politicians at the time made feeble attempts to rebut the findings even eight years later no one would dare to deny the conclusion of the study since march 2020 apparently to respond to the covid 19 pandemic the us federal reserve according to reports has pumped close to 30 trillion directly into the hands of billionaires and bankers and before that previous president donald trump signed the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 saying corporations would invest the money thus saved in the country including in the much needed research and development sector and increase workers pay but did the corporations use the saved taxes to help the people before answering the question let s take a look at the findings of a national bureau of economic research study according to the bureau the wealthiest top 10 percent of the population owns 84 percent of public shareholder stocks although we do know that workers received about 1 billion of the trillions of dollars as added bonuses about 1 trillion was authorized for corporate stock buybacks as such high income households benefited the most about the tax cuts act bret wells a tax law professor at the university of houston had said it is largely the top 1 percent that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people in the world let us return to china china s description of socialist democracy with chinese characteristics is often mocked by some western pundits politicians and media outlets but in making their case they ignore the most important part of the story that is socialist democracy with chinese characteristics indeed helps improve the livelihoods of the chinese people look no further than to china s 14th five year plan 2021 25 to understand that the country s government is taking measures to meet the needs of the people the chinese government has always responded to the call of the people and endeavored to improve their lives and livelihoods one example of that is publicizing a draft bill to solicit public opinions before finalizing a piece of legislation martin jacques a british political analyst academic and author of when china rules the world explains the matter thus the west boasts that its style of democracy is innately superior to all other forms of governance but this is empty rhetoric the ultimate test is the ability to deliver to improve people s living standards that is what wins hearts and mind in the chinese government s application of democratic principles to improve people s lives and livelihoods we also find the use of quality governance to build a safe stable and secure society if that is not worthy of admiration what is mario cavolo is an american writer living in china and a senior fellow at the center for china and globalization the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily

it conjures images of militants and conspiracy theorists residing on the fringes and on compounds armed to the teeth well it s time to reset your doomsday clock a worldwide community of preppers those who stockpile goods and skill up for extreme catastrophes is girding less for the end of days than for a disaster that calls for taking cover a climate emergency civil unrest the possibility of a dirty bomb to say nothing of a global pandemic that suddenly shuts down the world it was covid that turned abstract apocalyptic scenarios into a reality modern preppers come at it from all angles and for all kinds of reasons we went high and low talking to a few of the millions of americans who have joined the movement bradley garrett we re literally going over the edge of the mountain right now

mountain without using the highway and that s what we re doing right now jon wertheim what are we going ten miles an hour bradley garrett nine a former university professor garrett wrote a book two years ago about prepping then became a convert himself bradley garrett our country doesn t have the infrastructure anymore to be able to deal with emergencies in a meaningful way behind the wheel of his hybrid four by four he offroads not for kicks but to practice what preppers call bugging out getting out of dodge in the event of disaster steering clear of the masses bradley garrett we ll take these roads and make sure that you know they re not washed out and we can still use em jon wertheim just give it a dry run bradley garrett give laugh it a dry run yeah bradley garrett test running an escape route to the mojave desert sounds like overkill until it doesn t consider this days before our interview with garrett a wildfire forced him to put his bug out plan into action bradley garrett and it climbed the ridge jon wertheim i mean literally right behind us bradley garrett literally to right here my neighbor came and knocked on my door and he said i think it s time to evacuate there were helicopters pulling water from the lake and dumping it on the fire and we decided to go so we packed up the dogs and the guinea pigs and we were out the door jon wertheim how long it take you to pack bradley garrett thirty minutes the wildfire burned more than 1000 acres but didn t reach garrett s cabin still he used the close call to assess his readiness jon wertheim how do you think you did bradley garrett pretty well we fell down on documents birth certificates credit cards they were all over the house and i had stuff in filing cabinets it was a mess i wanna get it down to 15 jon wertheim fifteen minutes bradley garrett fifteen minutes out the door getting the dogs out is no problem the guinea pigs are a little harder to wrangle the act of gathering up animals in a natural disaster recalls the original prepper noah of course loaded them into an ark but in 2022 a d preppers still confront catastrophes of biblical proportions as varied as they are frequent in the last few months alone hurricane ian showed us the wrath of nature while vladimir putin showed us the wrath of man issuing a warning he might use nuclear weapons if and when disasters strike fema the overburdened federal agency charged with leading the responses has warned americans they should be ready to go it alone for several days john ramey is prepared to go it alone for two years ramey started his career in silicon valley and was an innovation adviser to the obama administration from his home in colorado he publishes a roundup of threats and how to prep for them best practices and bug out bag checklists his website the prepared is a leading voice for the measured segment of this growing community john ramey we think about 15 million americans are actively prepping right now in terms of percentage of households we are at or about to cross 10 of all households and just a few years ago that was 2 or 3 jon wertheim what happened to trigger this john ramey more and more people over the last decade that have accepted the reality of climate change and how that impacts the disasters and things that we go through almost every day now what s happened with our economy since the global financial crisis what s happened with political discourse and institutional failures broadly speaking more and more people realizing that they are their own first responder john ramey part of ramey s work entails reviewing the glut of supplies on the multibillion dollar prepping market got unsafe drinking water here s a 25 filter john ramey it will filter 100 000 gallons of water cell service down no problem for that old faithful ham radio john ramey you at least have the ability to communicate ramey says the uptick in prepping cuts across national divides politics economics region jon wertheim is there a typical prepper john ramey not anymore there used to be john ramey in the past the reality tv shows that would cover preppers they d find someone who had the most extreme fantastical concern like fascist alien zombies arriving on an asteroid that is so night and day from where we re at now in the foothills of tennessee s smoky mountains we met heidi keller in her vegetable garden a restaurant supply company worker by day she lives alone and calls herself a homestead prepper ready to hunker down or bug in in a crisis heidi keller you can put raw meat in here she recently acquired the hottest item for preppers a freeze dryer heidi keller that s a pound of ground beef heidi keller this is where i keep all of my canned goods heidi keller inside her pantry keller has canned freeze dried and stored enough food to get by for a year without leaving her property jon wertheim chicken meat roast beef and it doubles as protection from surging food prices after fires spread through nearby gatlinburg during a 2016 drought keller says she wanted a back up heidi keller when the fires came it made me rethink oh my gosh i can t have everything in my house because if something does happen and there is a fire and my house burns it can t be all in one location so the long term storage things i have someplace else jon wertheim where is that heidi keller in a secure location laugh it s not here jon wertheim fort knox heidi keller no jon wertheim how far from here heidi keller not far within five miles jon wertheim you give us more hints heidi keller why would i do that no you know i m not as a rule preppers don t like to reveal too much you might say they also have trust issues with the country s infrastructure and the ability of its institutions to deliver in a crisis jon wertheim if there s some kind of catastrophe to what extent do you trust the government heidi keller i m not gonna down the government i mean they do the best that they can but pretty much the government s not gonna take care of you not because they may not want to but because there s too much going on that s common sense jon wertheim you re prepared to go it alone heidi keller you have to be to some degree my biggest concern for two years it took me to get a wood stove i didn t have that and i m all electric so i was not prepared and finally when i got it it was like phew finally i m i feel more comfortable now i m okay the survival condo in central kansas if all it takes is a wood stove for heidi keller to feel comfortable when the sun rises on post apocalyptic america the monied class will find comfort here we drove to the belly of the country central kansas flat as a countertop hemmed by soybean and cornfields where we met larry hall a former defense contractor turned shall we say niche property developer jon wertheim who did you actually buy this from in 2008 he paid 300 000 for this decommissioned nuclear missile silo he and investors put in 22 million to refashion it as a luxury bunker the survival condo jon wertheim considerable thickness for a door to a residence inside the 16 000 pound doors an apartment building except this one is jammed 15 stories into the ground there s room for 75 people all but three of the 14 private units have been sold one three bedroom with tv screens posing as windows goes for 2 4 million cash jon wertheim who are your clients larry hall these are all self made people we don t have any lottery winners or old money we have retired doctors professional people jon wertheim do they share a particular ideology larry hall no they don t i know that there s independents and i know there s democrats and republican you ve got the whole mix here but what they have in common is they all wanna have a safe place for their family the end of the world as we know it they ll feel fine sitting poolside unless they d prefer to go rock climbing no one was living here full time when we visited but hall says the place was hopping at the onset of the pandemic larry hall the owners for the first time ever all came here at the same time all of em so 19 kids were here larry hall hall s sales pitch reduces to three words peace of mind and with dozens of strangers holed up together in a crisis larry hall here s our bar he hired a psychologist to consult on design to avoid a subterranean version of lord of the flies jon wertheim i did notice what looked like a jail cell larry hall we do have a jail cell that s because we also have a bar and a lounge and if you have a bad day or you drink too much you might get an adult time out a room inside the survival condo five different power sources keep it all humming there s a five year supply of stored food and hydroponics to grow more the survival condo also employs doormen that is armed guards at the gate jon wertheim to what extent are you worried this place could be overrun during an actual crisis larry hall this place was engineered to withstand a 20 kiloton nuclear warhead detonated within a half mile you know you can rant and rave and throw smoke bombs and molotov cocktails and you re gonna scratch my paint jon wertheim whoa hall is converting another silo half an hour away most bunkers worldwide are not fortified luxuries we get a vivid demonstration of their practicality as ukrainians take cover in australia one man made news when he emerged unscathed from his backyard bunker after a deadly bushfire here in the u s one personal bunker manufacturer told us he takes a new order every other day jon wertheim what do you make of the spike in bunker sales john ramey the vast majority of people should never get to the point of having a bunker and in fact i really dislike the bunker narratives because it takes away from the conversation that we should be having which is how do we make our existing homes and our existing communities more resilient rather than i m gonna quit society and go live in a decommissioned missile silo jon wertheim you say you would never build a bunker why not bradley garrett you can only stockpile so much in your bunker i can only withstand so much time in it i would be desperate to peek out laugh and see what s happening outside bradley garrett won t bunker down but he has doubled down on bugging out he keeps a second truck this 1972 gmc in his yard in case the lights go out for good taking out electronics and turning his hybrid escape vehicle into the equivalent of an expensive brick the specter of massive power grid failure the result of a nuclear attack or a solar storm preoccupies many preppers bradley garrett the current estimates from the government is it would take two years to rebuild the grid jon wertheim two years wifi goes down for five minutes and everybody panics bradley garrett exactly and and preppers say that it s 72 hours to animal jon wertheim meaning what bradley garrett meaning that it takes about three days for people to totally lose it preppers call this the s h t f scenario the proverbial s hitting the fan a breakdown of social norms john ramey says don t panic just get prepping john ramey if you have two weeks worth of food and water in your home a radio some basic supplies that alone that little bit of effort and cost covers you for the vast majority of scenarios that s that minimum threshold that everyone

editor s note china s whole process people s democracy which is democracy in its broadest most genuine and most effective form is the defining feature of socialist democracy it is a complete political system because unlike us style democracy which is a democracy of a few people and groups it is devoted to serving the chinese people at all levels and of all ethnic groups three experts share their views on whole process people s democracy with china daily ma xuejing china daily an article titled chinese democracy a true solution published in china daily in december 2021 said china holds direct election of deputies to the county and township level people s congresses the author chen yun charge d affaires chinese embassy in indonesia describes the chinese government system as an institutional foundation for protecting the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people this shows democracy should be for all the people not just for the wealthy and this is perhaps the simplest way of explaining why corruption is so high in the so called democratic governments in western countries during the past year a new saying has gained popularity on divisive social media platforms such as twitter in the west in china the government tells the billionaires what to do in the us the billionaires tell the government what to do the fact that this saying is true is disturbing it s an assault on the real meaning and application of democratic principles and it gives rise to questions such as isn t the multi billion dollar world of lobbying corporations and ngos in washington a legalized system of bribery that serves to cancel out and summarily eviscerate the importance of citizens votes what is happening is that leaders give you a nice ideologically driven feeling before you use your precious vote but the moment you walk out of the polling booth a corporation lobbyist hands over millions of dollars to the senator you just voted for asking him or her to support some new legislation they need to secure their corporate profits negating the value of your vote the saddest part is that you have no way of stopping it or knowing whether it benefits society or not a princeton university study in 2014 confirmed our worst fears that the united states government apparatus is either an oligarchy or plutocracy certainly not a democracy although some politicians at the time made feeble attempts to rebut the findings even eight years later no one would dare to deny the conclusion of the study since march 2020 apparently to respond to the covid 19 pandemic the us federal reserve according to reports has pumped close to 30 trillion directly into the hands of billionaires and bankers and before that previous president donald trump signed the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 saying corporations would invest the money thus saved in the country including in the much needed research and development sector and increase workers pay but did the corporations use the saved taxes to help the people before answering the question let s take a look at the findings of a national bureau of economic research study according to the bureau the wealthiest top 10 percent of the population owns 84 percent of public shareholder stocks although we do know that workers received about 1 billion of the trillions of dollars as added bonuses about 1 trillion was authorized for corporate stock buybacks as such high income households benefited the most about the tax cuts act bret wells a tax law professor at the university of houston had said it is largely the top 1 percent that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people in the world let us return to china china s description of socialist democracy with chinese characteristics is often mocked by some western pundits politicians and media outlets but in making their case they ignore the most important part of the story that is socialist democracy with chinese characteristics indeed helps improve the livelihoods of the chinese people look no further than to china s 14th five year plan 2021 25 to understand that the country s government is taking measures to meet the needs of the people the chinese government has always responded to the call of the people and endeavored to improve their lives and livelihoods one example of that is publicizing a draft bill to solicit public opinions before finalizing a piece of legislation martin jacques a british political analyst academic and author of when china rules the world explains the matter thus the west boasts that its style of democracy is innately superior to all other forms of governance but this is empty rhetoric the ultimate test is the ability to deliver to improve people s living standards that is what wins hearts and mind in the chinese government s application of democratic principles to improve people s lives and livelihoods we also find the use of quality governance to build a safe stable and secure society if that is not worthy of admiration what is mario cavolo is an american writer living in china and a senior fellow at the center for china and globalization the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily

biden feud with oil industry ratchets up just as world needs more us oil bloomberg as october drew to a close the white house saw another potential energy flash point on the horizon diesel and heating oil inventories in the us northeast were getting worryingly low officials swung into action organizing a series of calls between energy secretary jennifer granholm and several of the country s biggest oil refiners to discuss strategies to boost stockpiles the tone was cordial according to people with knowledge of the conversations but the very next working day the oil industry was blindsided at a hastily arranged press conference on oct 31 president joe biden castigated oil companies for handing outrageous profits to shareholders and executives rather than bringing down prices at the pump unless that changed he warned oil companies faced more taxes their profits are a windfall of war the windfall from the brutal conflict that s ravaging ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe he said it was just the kind of whiplash that has repeatedly sown mistrust and stoked tensions with the fossil fuel industry over the course of the biden administration according to multiple interviews with executives and lobbyists involved in oil and gas who declined to be identified because the meetings and conversations they described were private biden s team has been at odds with the industry since the 2020 election campaign but as global energy prices spiked this year following russia s invasion of ukraine the white house called on oil companies to help only to grow increasingly frustrated that it s holding back on production while reaping record earnings month after month these companies have posted record profits that they ve then used to pad shareholder pockets rather than boost production and lower gas prices said white house spokesman abdullah hasan month after month we ve offered them every opportunity and incentive to change their behavior conflicting policy priorities while they were never under any illusions about the president s green ambitions oil industry insiders say they ve become increasingly unhappy with a series of conflicting policy priorities for example moving within a matter of months from a halt on federal leasing for oil drilling to demanding more production and unrealistic requests such as spending billions of dollars to rapidly add more refining capacity unwilling to act as fall guys for surging household fuel bills in the run up to the midterm elections typically low profile industry figures are becoming more outspoken last week the chief executive officers of exxon mobil corp and chevron corp issued grave warnings about potential windfall taxes marshall mccrea co ceo of pipeline operator energy transfer lp said this week that us energy policy is so all over the map that it s becoming like a saturday night live skit it d be funny if it wasn t so tragically sad he added for its part the administration says it has approved 9 000 drilling permits released 180 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve and essentially provided a floor under the oil price with a commitment to repurchase crude at 70 a barrel if they don t like the carrots approach the president has made clear we can use sticks too hasan said we will do what we need to do to support american families the tensions come at a fraught moment for both the country and the rest of the world president vladimir putin s weaponization of russia s natural gas has left europe facing a perilous winter opec has been unwilling to ease a tight oil market instead last month it defied us wishes by agreeing with russia to reduce output recent history shows the us can play a vital role in ramping up oil production to ease prices and provide energy security after all the shale revolution added more crude to global markets than the entire production of iraq and iran combined from 2012 to 2020 making the us the biggest producer of both oil and gas but to repeat that growth spurt again would require the right investor and policy support as well as balancing increasingly ambitious us climate goals so far the signs of that happening aren t good a lot of senior executives are kind of throwing in the towel with this white house said stephen brown an energy consultant who formerly served as head of federal affairs for refiner andeavor when we talk to folks inside the administration we hear things that are conciliatory toward establishing a relationship and then you turn around and get hit between the eyes with a tweet on jan 20 2020 his first day in office biden revoked a presidential permit for the keystone xl pipeline which would have allowed more canadian crude to flow to gulf coast refineries days later he issued a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leasing later overturned in court executives in the shale patch were infuriated as some of the best well locations in the permian basin are on federal land in new mexico the message was clear biden and his progressive caucus would be no friend to the oil industry as gasoline crossed the 3 a gallon threshold in the middle of 2021 senior figures in the administration began paying more attention not only to the prices at the pump but also their role in pushing up inflation a critical moment came in november last year when biden accused the industry of anti consumer behavior and complained that gasoline prices remained high even though oil and gas companies costs are declining biden asked the federal trade commission to investigate potential illegal conduct the trust between industry and the administration has likely been deteriorating ever since said frank macchiarola senior vice president of policy at the american petroleum institute a group representing the energy industry there s a lack of understanding of fundamentals of energy markets war footing by the time russia invaded ukraine in february causing oil to spike to its highest since 2008 the white house had completed an about turn from the earliest days of the presidency and was demanding the production of more oil and gas rather than policies to curtail output we are on a war footing granholm told executives assembled for the ceraweek by s p global oil conference in houston in march but us producers still battle scarred from the height of the pandemic when energy prices collapsed were in no mood to cooperate after a decade of poor returns for investors a consensus had emerged on how to restore confidence stock prices hold production flat and return as much cash as possible to shareholders as inflation surged in the first half of 2022 it became clear that the white house had an economic crisis on its hands no us president has been re elected with gasoline prices above 4 a gallon in june the nationwide average touched 5 as analysts began pricing in record profits for big oil biden went on the attack we re going to make sure everyone knows exxon s profits he said at a press conference in los angeles exxon start investing and start paying your taxes thanks exxon responded by saying it was investing heavily in the us and was working on a major gulf coast refinery expansion but the narrative was now clear biden would be blaming big oil for high gasoline prices less than two weeks later biden summoned top oil executives to the department of energy in washington to discuss the issue for more than an hour the ceos talked with granholm about the barriers to higher fuel production and the policy moves that could help pare costs granholm assured them that the administration wanted to collaborate at one point wirth the chevron ceo walked through the economics logistics and constraints of us refining participants described the meeting as cordial and productive a kind of olive branch offered to the industry after biden s tongue lashing plot twist but it was a much different scene three months later when oil company officials met again with granholm national economic council director brian deese and amos hochstein a senior energy adviser at the state department the sept 30 session initially expected to take an hour and billed as a discussion of fuel supplies in the wake of hurricanes fiona and ian quickly devolved there was little talk of the storms one participant described it as a lecture from granholm administration officials berated the group for selling fuel overseas instead of storing more in us tanks and suggested that without voluntary industry action the government could force companies to stockpile more domestically at least one official blasted the companies for reaping high profits while failing to address low inventories as granholm and hochstein pressed the companies to curtail fuel exports and explain how they would work to lower prices the industry participants repeatedly raised objections insisting they couldn t divulge those details in front of competitors that kind of frank discussion could be a violation of us antitrust law they argued the meeting broke up less than half an hour after it began tensions between the us fossil fuel industry and a democratic president were probably always to be expected but the current clashes between both sides have been far more visible than when barack obama was president i don t think they were warm and embracing but they weren t bristly toward the industry dan eberhart a republican donor and ceo of an oilfield services company said of the obama administration with nationwide average gasoline prices on the rise again reaching 3 79 a gallon on nov 3 and midterm elections now just days away biden appears to be in no mood to back down i m working like hell to deal with the energy prices biden said friday i m going to have a little as they say come to the lord talk with the oil companies pretty soon
brighter days are likely coming even if it feels hopeless today the stock market can play tricks on your mind you feel invincible in a bull market but in a bear market you feel like you ll never make money again it s been a long fall for many growth stocks in 2022 but keep your head up historically wall street has always recovered and there isn t a reason why this would be any different the market will probably rebound at some point so now is a great time to start thinking about your top investment ideas for 2023 stocks like shopify shop 0 19 workday wday 0 75 and sea limited se 6 94 were losers in 2022 but here s why they could be big winners in 2023 and beyond stock up on this e commerce stock will healy shopify most long term shopify investors probably want to forget 2022 this time last year it had flirted with all time highs however the bear market hit this one time high flyer hard since reaching its high shopify has lost almost 80 of its value admittedly the stock price had probably moved ahead of its growth rate also e commerce growth slowed as consumers emerged from lockdowns making its price unsustainable however the case for shopify stock may have improved during that time from a competitive standpoint it has built an ecosystem to address the direct needs and many of the indirect needs of e commerce businesses shopify plus its software package designed to attract large and high growth businesses continues to gain traction on the q3 2022 earnings call shopify president harley finkelstein revealed that plus claimed 35 of all point of sale pro sales in q3 up from 14 in the year ago quarter additionally the shopify fulfillment network sfn facilitates order fulfillment and returns for customers with shopify s purchase of deliverr complete it can now serve as a one stop shop for all logistics needs the fact that amazon is its only competitor in this area will help shopify stand out above software oriented peers still shopify has returned to losses as the cost of building the fulfillment network weighs on the bottom line also while q3 revenue of 1 4 billion rose 22 that lagged the three year compound annual growth rate for revenue of 52 nonetheless for the remainder of 2022 the company predicted slowing operating expense growth and a higher percentage of merchant solutions revenue merchant solutions the segment that includes sfn and other business management services accounted for 72 of company revenue in q3 shopify s revenue also rose 26 year over year beating the overall average moreover its stock sells for just 9 times sales a massive reduction from the 45 p s ratio it reached one year ago with the company positioned for increased growth shopify stock should experience a recovery in 2023 shares of this workforce management company could bounce back in 2023 jake lerch workday if you think 2023 can be a bounce back year for the stock market and i do it s worth pondering which stocks would benefit the most for me workday is a name that jumps off the page the company is a leading provider of cloud based workplace solutions it serves over 50 of fortune 500 companies supplying cloud enterprise solutions for human resources financial planning and analytics like many tech stocks workday has been hit hard in 2022 with its share price falling 48 year to date however the company s fundamentals remain solid workday reported strong second quarter earnings back in august and is due to report third quarter earnings in mid november revenue continues to grow over 20 on a year over year basis and now stands at 5 7 billion over the last 12 months of that 5 7 billion 5 billion comes from subscription revenue what s more back in august management reiterated its long term goal to reach 10 billion in annual sales workday continues to grow its customer base and has recently achieved fedramp authorized status meaning the company can now sell its products to u s government agencies it all adds up to a great environment for workday in 2023 if the broader economy can get its act together next year the federal reserve is likely to pivot away from the massive interest rate hikes that have become the norm in 2022 meanwhile double digit inflation will eventually moderate relieving some pressure that has held back tech stocks this year and that s why i think workday is poised to benefit it s a name investors should get to know now before next year s catalysts take its stock significantly higher this internet company is cutting costs and gearing up for a big 2023 justin pope sea limited e commerce payments and gaming company sea limited was among the big winners during the pandemic soaring to a peak of roughly 1 000 from its pre pandemic share price but as they say easy come easy go the stock has given up virtually all of those gains throughout 2022 wall street can be irrational sometimes which means it can overshoot to both the upside and downside you saw the example of the upside when the stock ballooned to a price to sales ratio p s of 30 a valuation showing how much the share price outran the business s growth during the pandemic but today you re seeing the opposite the stock is trading at its lowest valuation ever which might give someone the impression that sea limited is a struggling company however the data primarily disputes that sea limited is generating more revenue than ever the business saw a surge of growth during the pandemic including 158 year over year revenue growth in q2 of last year but instead of declining after such a big leap revenue increased another 29 in the second quarter of this year some may frown at what s technically a slower growth rate but it signals that the covid 19 boost was no fluke one might even see growth pick back up next year as those tough growth comparables from 2021 pass the company isn t profitable but invests heavily to fund growth fortunately management has recognized the need to cut back some and did pull back on some of its expansion efforts in latin america sea limited is well funded with 7 8 billion in cash so the company is on solid financial footing sea s seen some bumps in the road but the car is still on the tracks investors can revisit this thought if the company burns through its cash reserves without making considerable progress toward turning a profit it burned 1 4 billion over the past year so that 7 4 billion should buy it time assuming sea limited can continue growing while it reduces its cash burn the dire valuation leaves room for an upside move once market sentiment improves

election of deputies to the county and township level people s congresses the author chen yun charge d affaires chinese embassy in indonesia describes the chinese government system as an institutional foundation for protecting the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people this shows democracy should be for all the people not just for the wealthy and this is perhaps the simplest way of explaining why corruption is so high in the so called democratic governments in western countries during the past year a new saying has gained popularity on divisive social media platforms such as twitter in the west in china the government tells the billionaires what to do in the us the billionaires tell the government what to do the fact that this saying is true is disturbing it s an assault on the real meaning and application of democratic principles and it gives rise to questions such as isn t the multi billion dollar world of lobbying corporations and ngos in washington a legalized system of bribery that serves to cancel out and summarily eviscerate the importance of citizens votes what is happening is that leaders give you a nice ideologically driven feeling before you use your precious vote but the moment you walk out of the polling booth a corporation lobbyist hands over millions of dollars to the senator you just voted for asking him or her to support some new legislation they need to secure their corporate profits negating the value of your vote the saddest part is that you have no way of stopping it or knowing whether it benefits society or not a princeton university study in 2014 confirmed our worst fears that the united states government apparatus is either an oligarchy or plutocracy certainly not a democracy although some politicians at the time made feeble attempts to rebut the findings even eight years later no one would dare to deny the conclusion of the study since march 2020 apparently to respond to the covid 19 pandemic the us federal reserve according to reports has pumped close to 30 trillion directly into the hands of billionaires and bankers and before that previous president donald trump signed the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 saying corporations would invest the money thus saved in the country including in the much needed research and development sector and increase workers pay but did the corporations use the saved taxes to help the people before answering the question let s take a look at the findings of a national bureau of economic research study according to the bureau the wealthiest top 10 percent of the population owns 84 percent of public shareholder stocks although we do know that workers received about 1 billion of the trillions of dollars as added bonuses about 1 trillion was authorized for corporate stock buybacks as such high income households benefited the most about the tax cuts act bret wells a tax law professor at the university of houston had said it is largely the top 1 percent that will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest people in the world let us return to china china s description of socialist democracy with chinese characteristics is often mocked by some western pundits politicians and media outlets but in making their case they ignore the most important part of the story that is socialist democracy with chinese characteristics indeed helps improve the livelihoods of the chinese people look no further than to china s 14th five year plan 2021 25 to understand that the country s government is taking measures to meet the needs of the people the chinese government has always responded to the call of the people and endeavored to improve their lives and livelihoods one example of that is publicizing a draft bill to solicit public opinions before finalizing a piece of legislation martin jacques a british political analyst academic and author of when china rules the world explains the matter thus the west boasts that its style of democracy is innately superior to all other forms of governance but this is empty rhetoric the ultimate test is the ability to deliver to improve people s living standards that is what wins hearts and mind in the chinese government s application of democratic principles to improve people s lives and livelihoods we also find the use of quality governance to build a safe stable and secure society if that is not worthy of admiration what is mario cavolo is an american writer living in china and a senior fellow at the center for china and globalization the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily

models and the minimed 780g model medtronic is currently seeking regulatory approval for the minimed 780g model which uses an advanced hybrid closed loop system during the class period medtronic repeatedly assured investors that the minimed 780g model was on track for approval by the u s food and drug administration fda and would provide medtronic with the edge it needed to close a growing gap with its competitors in the diabetes market medtronic made these representations despite known issues with the minimed 600 series models indeed in november 2019 the company issued a warning that certain minimed 600 series insulin pumps might have damaged pump retainer rings which could cause the system to release too much insulin and instructed customers with damaged rings to contact the company for replacements on february 7 2020 the fda classified medtronic s november 2019 notification as a class i recall the most serious type of recall problems with the minimed 600 series mushroomed in october 2021 when the company expanded its recall to all minimed model 630g and 670g insulin pump systems whether or not any retainer ring damage was actually visible despite these serious issues with the 600 series medtronic assured investors that they expected the minimed 780g to drive growth consistent with these optimistic statements medtronic again assured investors that fda approval of the minimed 780g was imminent investors began to learn the truth about the company s minimed operations on december 15 2021 when medtronic revealed that it had received a warning

continued to surface on may 26 2022 when medtronic reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 and provided guidance for fiscal year 2023 notably medtronic disclosed that as a result of the company s need to improve its quality control system and its expectation that the minimed 780g model which defendants had repeatedly identified as crucial to future growth would not be approved in 2023 the company expected revenues from its diabetes group to decline between 6 and 7 in fiscal year 2023 on this news the price of medtronic common stock fell 6 10 per

biden feud with oil industry ratchets up just as world needs more us oil bloomberg as october drew to a close the white house saw another potential energy flash point on the horizon diesel and heating oil inventories in the us northeast were getting worryingly low officials swung into action organizing a series of calls between energy secretary jennifer granholm and several of the country s biggest oil refiners to discuss strategies to boost stockpiles the tone was cordial according to people with knowledge of the conversations but the very next working day the oil industry was blindsided at a hastily arranged press conference on oct 31 president joe biden castigated oil companies for handing outrageous profits to shareholders and executives rather than bringing down prices at the pump unless that changed he warned oil companies faced more taxes their profits are a windfall of war the windfall from the brutal conflict that s ravaging ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe he said it was just the kind of whiplash that has repeatedly sown mistrust and stoked tensions with the fossil fuel industry over the course of the biden administration according to multiple interviews with executives and lobbyists involved in oil and gas who declined to be identified because the meetings and conversations they described were private biden s team has been at odds with the industry since the 2020 election campaign but as global energy prices spiked this year following russia s invasion of ukraine the white house called on oil companies to help only to grow increasingly frustrated that it s holding back on production while reaping record earnings month after month these companies have posted record profits that they ve then used to pad shareholder pockets rather than boost production and lower gas prices said white house spokesman abdullah hasan month after month we ve offered them every opportunity and incentive to change their behavior conflicting policy priorities while they were never under any illusions about the president s green ambitions oil industry insiders say they ve become increasingly unhappy with a series of conflicting policy priorities for example moving within a matter of months from a halt on federal leasing for oil drilling to demanding more production and unrealistic requests such as spending billions of dollars to rapidly add more refining capacity unwilling to act as fall guys for surging household fuel bills in the run up to the midterm elections typically low profile industry figures are becoming more outspoken last week the chief executive officers of exxon mobil corp and chevron corp issued grave warnings about potential windfall taxes marshall mccrea co ceo of pipeline operator energy transfer lp said this week that us energy policy is so all over the map that it s becoming like a saturday night live skit it d be funny if it wasn t so tragically sad he added for its part the administration says it has approved 9 000 drilling permits released 180 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve and essentially provided a floor under the oil price with a commitment to repurchase crude at 70 a barrel if they don t like the carrots approach the president has made clear we can use sticks too hasan said we will do what we need to do to support american families the tensions come at a fraught moment for both the country and the rest of the world president vladimir putin s weaponization of russia s natural gas has left europe facing a perilous winter opec has been unwilling to ease a tight oil market instead last month it defied us wishes by agreeing with russia to reduce output recent history shows the us can play a vital role in ramping up oil production to ease prices and provide energy security after all the shale revolution added more crude to global markets than the entire production of iraq and iran combined from 2012 to 2020 making the us the biggest producer of both oil and gas but to repeat that growth spurt again would require the right investor and policy support as well as balancing increasingly ambitious us climate goals so far the signs of that happening aren t good a lot of senior executives are kind of throwing in the towel with this white house said stephen brown an energy consultant who formerly served as head of federal affairs for refiner andeavor when we talk to folks inside the administration we hear things that are conciliatory toward establishing a relationship and then you turn around and get hit between the eyes with a tweet on jan 20 2020 his first day in office biden revoked a presidential permit for the keystone xl pipeline which would have allowed more canadian crude to flow to gulf coast refineries days later he issued a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leasing later overturned in court executives in the shale patch were infuriated as some of the best well locations in the permian basin are on federal land in new mexico the message was clear biden and his progressive caucus would be no friend to the oil industry as gasoline crossed the 3 a gallon threshold in the middle of 2021 senior figures in the administration began paying more attention not only to the prices at the pump but also their role in pushing up inflation a critical moment came in november last year when biden accused the industry of anti consumer behavior and complained that gasoline prices remained high even though oil and gas companies costs are declining biden asked the federal trade commission to investigate potential illegal conduct the trust between industry and the administration has likely been deteriorating ever since said frank macchiarola senior vice president of policy at the american petroleum institute a group representing the energy industry there s a lack of understanding of fundamentals of energy markets war footing by the time russia invaded ukraine in february causing oil to spike to its highest since 2008 the white house had completed an about turn from the earliest days of the presidency and was demanding the production of more oil and gas rather than policies to curtail output we are on a war footing granholm told executives assembled for the ceraweek by s p global oil conference in houston in march but us producers still battle scarred from the height of the pandemic when energy prices collapsed were in no mood to cooperate after a decade of poor returns for investors a consensus had emerged on how to restore confidence stock prices hold production flat and return as much cash as possible to shareholders as inflation surged in the first half of 2022 it became clear that the white house had an economic crisis on its hands no us president has been re elected with gasoline prices above 4 a gallon in june the nationwide average touched 5 as analysts began pricing in record profits for big oil biden went on the attack we re going to make sure everyone knows exxon s profits he said at a press conference in los angeles exxon start investing and start paying your taxes thanks exxon responded by saying it was investing heavily in the us and was working on a major gulf coast refinery expansion but the narrative was now clear biden would be blaming big oil for high gasoline prices less than two weeks later biden summoned top oil executives to the department of energy in washington to discuss the issue for more than an hour the ceos talked with granholm about the barriers to higher fuel production and the policy moves that could help pare costs granholm assured them that the administration wanted to collaborate at one point wirth the chevron ceo walked through the economics logistics and constraints of us refining participants described the meeting as cordial and productive a kind of olive branch offered to the industry after biden s tongue lashing plot twist but it was a much different scene three months later when oil company officials met again with granholm national economic council director brian deese and amos hochstein a senior energy adviser at the state department the sept 30 session initially expected to take an hour and billed as a discussion of fuel supplies in the wake of hurricanes fiona and ian quickly devolved there was little talk of the storms one participant described it as a lecture from granholm administration officials berated the group for selling fuel overseas instead of storing more in us tanks and suggested that without voluntary industry action the government could force companies to stockpile more domestically at least one official blasted the companies for reaping high profits while failing to address low inventories as granholm and hochstein pressed the companies to curtail fuel exports and explain how they would work to lower prices the industry participants repeatedly raised objections insisting they couldn t divulge those details in front of competitors that kind of frank discussion could be a violation of us antitrust law they argued the meeting broke up less than half an hour after it began tensions between the us fossil fuel industry and a democratic president were probably always to be expected but the current clashes between both sides have been far more visible than when barack obama was president i don t think they were warm and embracing but they weren t bristly toward the industry dan eberhart a republican donor and ceo of an oilfield services company said of the obama administration with nationwide average gasoline prices on the rise again reaching 3 79 a gallon on nov 3 and midterm elections now just days away biden appears to be in no mood to back down i m working like hell to deal with the energy prices biden

yvon chouinard the founder and ceo of outdoor apparel company patagonia has recently announced that he will be giving away his 3 billion company with the intention that all future profits will help fight climate change and protect undeveloped land this act is not simply a donation chouinard and his family will be ceding all ownership of the corporation giving a newly formed nonprofit named the holdfast collective all control of its common shares and profits with the rest 2 percent going to the patagonia purpose trust while unusual this decision does not come as a surprise to those who know the company s history of energy efficient production and anti consumerist marketing you may have heard of their famous don t buy this jacket black friday advertisement chouinard has stated that he hopes this move to give the company away will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people with the intention of away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet while chouinard s optimism is certainly refreshing it may be a bit naive wealth inequality has continued to increase in spite of rising billionaire philanthropy and many view capitalism as the cause of our climate catastrophe rather than the solution although it would be unfair to say that chouinard s generosity will have no positive impact on our planet such donations do nothing to challenge the very systems which got us here in the first place patagonia s business practices have been undeniably ethical in comparison to most companies of a similar scale in 2019 baptist world aid australia published an ethical fashion report which investigated the environmental management and workers protection systems of various corporations within the fashion industry giving each brand a score on a scale of a to f some of the lowest scoring brands featured were also some of the most popular including abercrombie and fitch and forever 21 both of which received a d however patagonia was given an a overall with an a in environmental management and it s not difficult to see why patagonia leads a number of pro sustainability programs such as worn wear an online store that sells second hand patagonia products action works a website dedicated to environmental activism and 1 for the planet a network of corporations who have pledged to give 1 percent of their annual revenue directly to grassroots environmental groups while patagonia may be doing exceptional work in an industry otherwise dominated by fast fashion and hyper consumerism it is important to remember that they are just that an exception chouinard s personal dedication to protecting the planet is admirable but not the norm the capitalist system is set up in a way that prioritizes immediate profit over everything else in fact even chouinard himself agrees even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short term gain at the expense of long term vitality and responsibility stated chouinard explaining why the company opted not to go public as he explains companies simply don t have the proper incentives to care about the environment and their moral compasses don t seem to have a significant impact on their business models in fact while chouinard may hope that his current generosity will inspire more capitalists to protect the environment it was chouinard s very rejection of typical capitalist practices his refusal to go public or sell his company that made him the environmentalist and philanthropist he is today the man who once said he had no respect for the stock market wishes to inspire a new form of capitalism as if environmental destruction is a side effect of capitalism and not its very nature the man who once said he had no respect for the stock market wishes to inspire a new form of capitalism as if environmental destruction is a side effect of capitalism and not its very nature now i hear you asking what about the philanthropy industry there s no shortage of stories about the generosity of the world s wealthiest families and individuals however billionaire charity isn t all it s cracked up to be instead of giving their money directly to nonprofit on the ground organizations many billionaires give their money to their own private foundations or donor advised funds the largest being fidelity charitable in fact over a quarter of charitable donations go to such organizations on the surface it seems wonderful that the nation s ultra wealthy are willing to set up their own charitable foundations in order to streamline the donation process the problem private foundations are only required to give away 5 percent of their assets per year and donor advised funds aren t required to give away anything at all this means that billionaires can give money to these foundations and tell everyone that they ve been very generous all while taking a massive tax cut as their money collects dust in a fund which they control at their worst private foundations can be deliberately used for nefarious purposes the most famous example in recent memory is the now dissolved donald j trump foundation whose funds were used to among other things settle lawsuits against the former president as well as aid him on his 2016 campaign though obviously an outlier these practices represent the worst of a system designed to benefit the wealthy without much impact on the amount of actual charitable giving even if philanthropists choose to skip the billionaire run intermediaries donations can have an unexpected and sinister effect as the nation s wealthiest individuals continue to give more and more money to education healthcare and other systems for which governments should be responsible their political influence may balloon to alarming proportions relying on wealthy donors to fund schools and hospitals can make politicians even more susceptible to caving to billionaires personal whims the global policy forum an independent policy watchdog has cautioned international governments about the dangers of philanthropic foundations for this exact reason warning they should analyze the intended and unintended risks and side effects of their activities we ve certainly seen this play out in the united states one example can be found in philadelphia s public school system which has faced significant budget cuts over the last few years wealthy donors have stepped in to fund charter schools for local children however they do so with strings attached as stated by author david callahan they want the schools to change in certain ways is that any way to run a city education system that you give power to billionaires in exchange for money that the taxpayers won t put forward themselves it is bad enough that billion dollar donations do nothing to confront the systems that perpetuate inequality and environmental destruction but they may also be inadvertently or intentionally allowing the wealthy to side step the traditional channels of democracy this is not to say that billionaire philanthropy does not have a positive influence but it is worth considering what other influences it may have as well of course there are billionaires who have made it their mission to distribute their wealth mackenzie scott the ex wife of billionaire jeff bezos became the richest woman in the world following her divorce from the amazon founder since then she has dedicated herself to giving away as much of her wealth as possible as of april 2022 she has donated an unprecedented 12 5 billion to more than 1 250 organizations what sets scott apart from the rest besides how quickly she has managed to give her money away is the fact that the organizations which receive her donations from small grassroots organizations to large nonprofits can do whatever they wish with the money they receive while scott will have no say in what her donations are used for while incredibly generous scott s donations don t seem to be inspiring widespread change to where and how the money of other american billionaires has been given though chouinard s desire to influence a new form of capitalism is admirable giving away billions may not have the impact the patagonia ceo is counting on if scott s unfollowed lead is any indication the fundamental issue with billionaire philanthropy is that it does nothing to challenge the economic political and social institutions that have created the problems these billionaires are trying to solve throwing money at the nonprofit sector won t change corporations fundamental goal to fill the pockets of their shareholders giving away one apparel company won t change the fact that there are thousands more who are eager to perpetuate a culture of hyper consumerism at the expense of our planet chouinard s decision to turn over his company is undeniably selfless but we cannot let it lull us into a complicit slumber we can congratulate chouinard for his kindness without pretending that it will solve the climate crisis progress should be celebrated but the steps forward must not be ignored it is important now more than ever that we remain vigilant
i mean are we watching the people who truly were the threat to democracy begin to dissolve in real time ho lee smokes it s starting to look like it a bit of grim sunday news large scale layoffs at meta start next week possibly wednesday jeff horwitz jeffhorwitz november 6 2022 advertisement according to the report which just broke in the wall street journal the cuts are going to be substantial across the meta verse the layoffs are expected to affect many thousands of employees and an announcement is planned to come as soon as wednesday according to the people meta reported more than 87 000 employees at the end of september company officials already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week the people said the planned layoffs would be the first broad head count reductions to occur in the company s 18 year history while smaller on a percentage basis than the cuts at twitter inc this past week which hit about half of that company s staff the number of meta employees expected to lose their jobs could be the largest to date at a major technology corporation in a year that has seen a tech industry retrenchment as elon musk found when he got inside the twitter building it turns out there were quite a few expendable employees at facebook meta too now that the lizard king meta chief executive mark zuckerberg no longer needs tens of thousands of employees to manipulate personal facebook pages or suppress the flow of information to do the biden administration s unconstitutional bidding it s off with their well compensated heads in the employment sense the cuts expected to be announced this week follow several months of more targeted staffing reductions in which employees were managed out or saw their roles eliminated realistically there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn t be here mr zuckerberg told employees at a companywide meeting at the end of june advertisement ya think it sure must have been lucrative while it lasted to be able to hire so many misinformation overseers so fast tracking american citizens every move parsing their thoughts and making sure they only received government approved narratives takes resources and tons of eyeballs shareholders otoh have not been happy with zuckerberg s stewardship in the least with the stock having lost over 70 of it s value this year and have been rumbling for the machetes to come out last month investment firm altimeter capital said in an open letter to mr zuckerberg that meta should slash staff and pare back its metaverse ambitions reflecting the rising discontent among shareholders that s a whale of a company performance chart for the boy genius there facebook changed its name to meta on this day one year ago since then the company s market value has declined by 622 billion pic twitter com dscc84asci jon erlichman jonerlichman october 28 2022 and frankly the environment just isn t friendly for information tracking nazis government stooges anymore there s the fact the public is aware of what they ve been doing and every bit of information that comes out about it is more egregious more damning than the last and which friends are always in facebook jail the ones who put up conservative memes people notice that stuff advertisement dozens of federal officials across multiple agencies within the biden administration communicated extensively with social media companies to coordinate censorship of information according to internal documents released by republican attorneys general eric schmitt of missouri and jeff landry of louisiana officials within the department of homeland security and the department of health and human services sent emails to employees at facebook and twitter to flag instances of alleged misinformation and provide talking points to counter allegedly false narratives spreading on the platforms government officials would occasionally initiate this activity with one message from a centers for disease control and prevention official requesting monthly meetings with facebook to plan debunking strategies and a white house official requesting the removal of a parody anthony fauci account one collection of emails shows facebook staff collaborating closely with staff at the the department of health and human services to remove facebook groups with one message describing the collaboration as critical meta has competition now something it didn t have for the longest time and some firms like apple are allowing customers to just flat out opt in vice being trapped on a platform that tracks them with no recourse americans are on to these guys in a big way and they are over it advertisement meta is the s p 500 s worst performer of 2022 as losses near 75 pic twitter

review and preview employers added 261 000 nonfarm jobs more than expected and in line with the previous month s 263 000 the unemployment rate edged higher to 3 7 up from 3 5 in september hourly pay remained brisk rising at 4 7 year over year matching september october s jobs report solid making fed s inflation fight harder november 4 2022 since 1942 there have been 20 midterm elections us stocks climbed higher in the next 12 months after every single one stephen mcbride risk hedge report should you sell your stocks ahead of tuesday s big election november 3 2022 we are back to the state of five retrograde planets following the turn of mars on october 31 this on top of the potent t square between the sun venus in scorpio opposing uranus in taurus and square saturn in aquarius november 5 11 now in its orb of influence and this is in addition to the lunar eclipse on november 8 right in the middle of the t square and also the date of the u s mid term elections the good news is that the geocosmic hurricane tsunami season for financial markets and geopolitics ends after that for now financial markets are starting off every bit as wild as these cosmic signatures suggested they would on wednesday the djia reached 33 071 its highest level since august 26 and up over 4400 points since its yearly low of three weeks ago by the next day thursday november 3 it had dropped to 31 727 a swing of 1344 points in one day the next day friday it was back up over 400 points it makes one wonder what will happen now that both venus and the sun will oppose uranus november 5 9 with saturn square to each through november 11 the pattern was similar in many world indices that is most have rallied since their yearly lows of september 28 october 3 or october 13 to highs last week followed by quick sharp declines into thursday and a rally on friday in europe the rally into friday was most significant for the german dax and london ftse indices which soared to their highest levels since september 13 14 in asia and the pacific rim the pattern was similar for the nikkei and the australian asx both continued to make new cycle highs into november 2 since their lows of october 3 then both sold off into thursday friday in india the nifty also made a new cycle high on november 2 but didn t sell off much before recovering on friday the high of november 2 was its highest mark since january 18 for china and hong kong it was a little different the shanghai composite in china made a double bottom on october 31 as mars turned retrograde to its yearly low of april 27 then rallied sharply into friday the hang seng of hong kong dropped to a new multi year low also on october 31 and then like the sse rallied sharply into friday it appears the chinese markets are coming out of their long slumber which would bode well for the rest of the world s stock markets there was greater excitement in precious metals last week gold fell to a new yearly low of 1618 on thursday but by friday it was back up above 1680 to its highest price in three weeks silver fell to 18 80 on thursday well above its recent lows and then blasted off on friday to a high of 20 96 this fits well with our forecast based on cycle studies which suggest we could see 30 silver soon if 21 50 can be exceeded bitcoin and ethereum are showing renewed life as well both rallied to their highest prices since september 13 if they can avoid a major selloff this week both may be the early stages of a new bullish run with jupiter returning to pisces on october 28 crude oil prices are also rising smartly soaring to a new multi week high of 92 87 on friday making president biden s trade of drawing down the strategic petroleum reserves when the price was in the low 80 s to their lowest price since the 1980 s while publicly announcing he would buy back at 70 75 a questionable decision involving national security and speculative use of taxpayers monies for possibly political reasons the timing appears to be an unsuccessful and costly attempt to drive down oil prices going into the mid term elections why would he announce his trading plan publicly at the time or at any time in a matter related to national security short term geocosmics and longer term thoughts the oil industry has not met its commitment to invest in america and support the american people biden said they re not just making a fair return he said they re making profits so high it is hard to believe i think it s outrageous if they passed those profits on to consumers gasoline prices would be down about 50 cents reuters biden calls on oil gas companies to stop war profiteering threatens windfall tax november 1 2022 i m not sure understand the argument for a windfall profits tax on energy companies summers said on twitter tuesday morning if you reduce profitability you will discourage investment which is the opposite of our objective larry summers as reported by matt egan biden s oil windfall tax would backfire warns larry summers november 1 2022 the windfall tax proposal repudiates everything mr biden says about wanting lower energy prices wall street journal editors energy policy for dummies november 2 2022 we are not big fans of fossil fuel drilling and oil companies making huge profits in a time that inflation is affecting large segments of the population but we are concerned about the existential threat involved in national security with jupiter set to return to aries in mid december therefore we still need to produce oil and gas while at the same time continuing to grow the alternative and renewable energy markets just as the state of oklahoma is doing as reported in oklahoma s energy balancing act by alex irwin hunt at www fdiinteligence com september 23 2022 our focus in this column pertains to the education of geocosmic signatures related to movements in financial markets in this case rising energy prices correlate with the return of jupiter into pisces october 28 december 20 2022 for the week ahead we have the lunar eclipse in taurus sun in scorpio on tuesday a lunar eclipse is when the shadow of the earth blocks out the view of the moon the earth is in between the sun and moon this makes it a special full moon in the sense that the opposition implied by the full moon is intensified it s a time of conflict in the study of astrology which can be transitioned into a period of heightened awareness the challenge is to resolve the conflict whatever it is between the past emotional moon and the future vitality sun in other words you can t advance cleanly into the future as wished until the emotional issues of the past sometimes referred to as karma are confronted and resolved once resolved a big weight is removed and a lightness of being is created in relationships with the lunar eclipse taurus people want security stability comfort and safety the moon is exalted in taurus but the sun in scorpio likes to court danger and taboo while the moon in taurus is also conjoined with uranus the moon is not likely to get its wish for comfort and safety through diplomacy or just being nice for uranus is the planet of disruption disagreement refusal to acquiesce and often the result of an urge to get attention even if via shock thus we need to be prepared for a shock of some sort whether in the geopolitical or financial realm or via nature also the time frame in which a lunar eclipse is operative seems to be about three weeks before and after the actual cosmic event although the peak of energy of course is during the moment of the event itself

with subway accounting for approximately 20 of those locations by the first quarter of 2022 the company s active locations had grown to approximately 82 000 a 19 increase over the prior year the truth emerged on august 11 2022 when the company announced disappointing results for the second quarter of 2022 lowering revenue guidance and reporting that its active location count remained flat at 82 000 the company explained that it was impacted by the loss of 2 500 subway locations due to subway choosing to implement direct integration with marketplaces and that the company expected the remaining

class period february 3 2021 february 1 2022 lead plaintiff deadline december 5 2022 the paypal class action lawsuit alleges that paypal throughout the class period touted the growth in its net new active accounts nnas and instructed investors to value the high growth in this metric as one of the most important indicators of how paypal was performing but as the paypal class action lawsuit alleges while touting its nna growth paypal failed to disclose that many of the additional users acquired through its cash account creation incentive campaigns were illusory because those incentive campaigns were easily susceptible to fraud specifically paypal failed to disclose that its cash incentive campaigns significantly increased paypal s susceptibility to bot farms that were able to systematically take advantage of paypal s 10 00 account opening by creating millions of illegitimate accounts which ultimately generated no future revenue for paypal in addition the paypal class action lawsuit alleges that investors were unaware of the lengths paypal was going to keep inactive customers and fake bot accounts on the platform to prevent churn and inflate its nna guidance which would have provided a more realistic view of the true demand for paypal s platform on february 1 2022 paypal revealed that its nnas were only 49 million for 2021 less than the guidance of 50 million it initially provided in february 2021 in doing so paypal admitted that in connection with the increased use of incentive campaigns throughout 2021 identified 4 5 million accounts that believe were illegitimately created and that as a result paypal changed course on some of its customer acquisition strategies including incentive led campaigns in the fourth quarter further because paypal was evolving its customer acquisition and engagement strategy paypal now expected only 15 20 million net new customer accounts for 2022 and that paypal no longer believe that the 750 million medium term

abstract europe s economic problems are already affecting the u s economy an expanding european crisis could affect the u s through the financial sector reduced demand for u s exports disruption of global supply chains and political disruption in europe the u s can best help europe by pursuing sound economic policies at home starting with pulling back from the approaching fiscal cliff the u s should also encourage european states to implement policies that foster free markets lower their tax rates and reform their unsustainable welfare systems many countries in the eurozone are on the brink of financial insolvency large global european banks could fail the eurozone could break up any of these potential negative outcomes would be felt well beyond the borders of europe a european economic crisis could affect the u s economy through several channels current effects the u s is already affected by lower demand for exports and higher uncertainty in europe the u s is already affected by lower demand for exports and higher uncertainty in europe the financial sector the financial sector is the channel most likely to transmit europe s recession to the u s european banks are at risk because of their extensive holdings of government debt the financial sector is the channel most likely to transmit europe s recession to the u s european banks are at risk because of their

from the eurozone could disrupt global supply chains and could hurt short run growth in the u s in the long run europe needs to liberalize its markets in order to contribute to global growth political effects europeans are not immune to electing bad leaders elections in europe could damage cooperation on a variety of fronts from nato to trade policy without reform europe s future looks bleak in the short term american policymakers should address the fiscal cliff which poses great risks to the u s economy stability in america would ease europe s path out of its own crisis for the long term america should emphasize how free markets low tax rates and welfare reform have allowed the u s to maintain its income advantage over europe current effects there is no need to wonder whether the prospect of european economic problems will affect america s economy it is already affecting economic decisions however europe s uncertainty is not the primary cause for the slow u s economic recovery since 2009 overregulation ballooning deficits and looming tax increases in 2013 are larger and more direct drags on american growth currently the crisis unfolding across most of europe affects the u s economy in four distinct ways the current economic slowdown in europe reduces demand for u s exports consumption in the eurozone has grown at an annual rate of 1 0 percent since the beginning of 2008 compared with 3 6 percent annually over the previous four years even worse eurozone imports have declined from a 2007 high consumption in the eurozone has grown at an annual rate of 1 0 percent since the beginning of 2008 compared with 3 6 percent annually over the previous four years even worse eurozone imports have declined from a 2007 high the european divisions of u s multinationals such as ford and general motors have lost money as sales have declined u s goods exports to europe dropped 20 percent from a high in 2008 to a low in 2009 and then recovered rapidly over the next two years u s exports to europe grew 11 percent from 2010 to 2011 much faster than the overall economy however year over year growth slowed to less than 2 percent in the first six months of 2012 uncertainty about the euro s future has kept the dollar expensive making u s exports less competitive although how expensive the dollar would be in the absence of european uncertainty is unknown risk averse investors fleeing euro denominated assets have driven up the price of the dollar although many factors affect exchange rates the uncertainty about the eurozone has probably driven the yearlong increase in the price of the dollar although how expensive the dollar would be in the absence of european uncertainty is unknown risk averse investors fleeing euro denominated assets have driven up the price of the dollar although many factors affect exchange rates the uncertainty about the eurozone has probably driven the yearlong increase in the price of the dollar uncertainty about the health of european banks has led u s money market funds to disengage fear of a european banking collapse compels u s investors to eschew potentially profitable investments in european money markets thus americans retirement funds mutual funds and other investments are slightly less profitable than they would be if european banks were on firm footing fear of a european banking collapse compels u s investors to eschew potentially profitable investments in european money markets thus americans retirement funds mutual funds and other investments are slightly less profitable than they would be if european banks were on firm footing political and economic uncertainties dissuade risk taking uncertainty about europe s future and the extent of future crisis transmission make u s investors more cautious and less innovative slowing growth and technological progress long term economic growth is driven by lowering the costs of production and increasing the product varieties available to consumers entrepreneurs managers and venture capitalists are less likely to take the risks that increase productivity when the future markets for their products are uncertain financial sector effects the financial sector in europe has been on doubtful footing since the 2008 crash a european financial panic of any variety could have significant global repercussions and the financial sector is the most important transmission mechanism from europe to the u s government debt european banks are more deeply connected to their respective governments than american banks are to the federal and state governments despite the common currency eurozone banks hold large shares of their own governments debt in greece and germany domestic banks hold around 20 percent of domestic government debt and spanish banks hold almost 30 percent of spain s debt other domestic institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies hold even more domestic debt the interconnectedness or codependency of government and banks means that a crisis in one can cripple the other for instance if the risk of sovereign default rises domestic banks would find that their assets are much less valuable and would face the nasty choice of refusing to roll over government debt which would precipitate a crisis or agreeing to lend the government the funds needed to pay back the banks further entangling the two sides most european banks have chosen the second option digging furiously to escape the hole in which they are trapped government risk or failure can affect banks in other ways in greece the fear of a euro exit and forced conversion of greek bank deposits into drachmae has led many depositors to withdraw their savings from greek banks and move their money abroad on the other side if banks fail first the government s best bond market customers are bankrupt with diminished demand for government bonds not to mention the recession that often coincides with bank failure yields on government debt would rise with fewer customers for more debt a government with a relatively healthy debt to gdp ratio can suddenly find itself at risk of defaulting spain exemplifies contagion moving from banks to government spain s banks were loaded with mortgages that went bad when the country s housing bubble popped despite modest debt and budget surpluses in six of the seven years preceding the crisis the bank crisis caused the government to lose control of its financing regrettably the codependency does not stop at national borders as of march 2012 french banks owned almost half of the 722 billion of italian debt held by foreign banks and more than half of the 79 billion of greek debt spanish and portuguese banks were mutually entangled the u k and belgium owned too much irish debt and the netherlands owned a significant amount of spanish debt the good news for americans is that the u s is relatively insulated from the european tangle of banks and government debt as of march 2012 american banks owned only 132 billion of debt issued by european countries that are currently in crisis even if that debt loses a large portion of its value due to default their total exposure is modest money markets a primary form of international financial integration is the world of money market funds these are low risk low return funds that allow investors to earn modest returns on liquid assets money market funds purchase low risk commercial and government bonds because corporations tend to maintain working relationships with specific funds losses in a fund can affect not only money market investors in that fund but also corporations that rely on that fund to market their debt economists have found evidence that when a fund needs to shrink its asset base its usual borrowers find it more difficult to issue new debt sergey chernenko and adi sunderam have documented that american prime money market funds rapidly divested from european banks during the summer of 2011 the slow motion run on european banks reduced u s money market exposure from 453 billion 27 percent of all prime money market funds to 287 billion in august 2011 and 154 billion at the end of 2011 as investors withdrew money from money market funds with heavy euro exposure american corporations that usually financed through those funds decreased their issuance of new debt u s money market investment in europe stabilized during the first half of 2012 ending in may at 199 billion 14 percent of all prime money market funds hopefully given the robust attention that investors give to this form of european exposure the risk and return of euro invested money market funds are at a desirable level for american investors although the failure of one or more major european banks would hurt american money market investors money markets have already had time to divest from the riskiest banks at worst a european bank collapse could lead to another money market run on european banks and a slowdown in corporate borrowing albeit a less severe run than occurred in 2011 credit default swaps as americans learned when the subprime mortgage bubble burst credit default swaps cds are an impressive financial lever swaps leverage investment allowing more investment with a given amount of capital but can also multiply the damage of a financial collapse the main trouble with swaps is that they lack transparency they are often difficult to price the market for swaps disappeared once the u s housing bubble burst and a similar paralysis could result if a major european government or bank fails if so those who own swaps would be stuck with an illiquid asset of questionable value the bank for international settlements bis reports that u s banks had 638 billion in other potential exposures including cds and similar instruments to portugal ireland italy greece and spain piigs as of march 2012 this potential exposure dwarfs the direct exposure of u s banks to piigs debt which stood at only 132 billion furthermore other u s financial entities such as mutual funds union pension funds and hedge funds have additional exposure not counted by the bis although their exposure is probably much smaller likewise potential exposure to french and dutch debt derivatives is as large as potential piigs exposure it is difficult to put an upper limit on the amount of american investment at risk if the crisis compounds with failures in the eurozone s core the good news is that investors are more aware of the issues surrounding cds than they were in 2008 as the european debt crisis drags on month after month financial institutions have the time to evaluate their holdings properly and rebalance as necessary u s policymakers can lay a foundation for sober preparation by making it crystal clear that the federal government will not bail out banks or funds that lose money from european fallout when managers know they must live with the consequences of their decisions they tend to invest more prudently corporate bond contagion economists at the federal reserve bank of san francisco estimate that bond yields in the u s and europe move together using a narrative econometric approach they find that when european corporations experience a 100 basis point increase in the cost of borrowing due to european economic uncertainty the cost of borrowing for american corporations increases by 44 to 85 basis points this effect is driven by international linkages in borrowing costs for highly rated financial firms and low rated nonfinancial firms this evidence suggests not only that investors believe that the largest and usually safest u s financials are the most globally integrated but also that fiscally weak u s nonfinancial companies have the most to lose from a european recession the existence of yield contagion directly contradicts the hopeful or cynical hypothesis that weak financial markets in europe make more lending available in the u s instead the opposite is true in the private sector for federal government borrowing any such gains would come through lower interest rates since rates are already near zero there is little room for improvement demand effects even as eurozone leaders take necessary steps to avoid a worst case scenario see text box how a european recession could affect u s growth ihs global insight forecast parts of europe are already in recession the eu reported negative growth in 2011 for greece portugal and slovenia and the european central bank projects that the eurozone is already in a recession that will last into 2013 as noted europe is a key market for american exports with slowed growth europeans are poorer and demand fewer american goods increased uncertainty in europe will also translate into a stronger u s dollar against foreign currencies when the dollar is more expensive american exports are less competitive and european uncertainty hurts american exports around the world while a stronger dollar and slower growth in foreign economies diminish u s exports reduced european demand for basic commodities fuel and chinese goods could lower the prices of major u s imports thus lower import prices would partially offset the effects of a recession in europe any further downturn in europe and any continued collateral damage to other world economies especially major u s trading partners would translate into lower demand for u s exports and overall growth expectations this channel of economic contagion is powerful but limited almost nothing can be done to avoid negative spillovers from a recession certainly ginning up demand with government spending would be counterproductive in both the short run and the long run because it would increase the risk that the u s would follow europe into debt crisis and austerity a severe eu recession might decrease u s exports to europe as much or more than the 50 billion drop from 2008 to 2009 although that amount is large decreased imports would dynamically offset some of it and 50 billion represents only 0 03 percent of the u s economy the best silver lining to a european recession would be for european voters and leaders finally to decide to scrap the static model of economic activity on which socialist economic policies are based static economic models assume that jobs exist by fiat and can be molded and distributed as politicians desire dynamic economic models recognize that jobs are created and destroyed following market incentives not political wishes the global economy needs a dynamic growing europe employing 95 percent of its labor force and inventing investing creating and consuming how a european recession could affect u s growth ihs global insight forecast how would a european recession affect u s growth analysts at ihs global insight using a large scale macroeconomic model forecasted the likely impact on the u s economy of a pessimistic scenario in the eurozone this pessimistic scenario assumes an abrupt and disorderly greek exit from the euro with significant damage to the european economy a disorderly greek exit would incorporate many of the transmission channels discussed in this paper the baseline forecast scenario incorporates an orderly greek exit which has little effect on the u s in the pessimistic economic outlook there would be a dramatic reduction in economic growth expectations in the eurozone and other world economies the weaker growth in major u s trading partners would reduce u s exports by about 34 billion instead of the baseline prediction of a 109 billion increase in exports leading to slower u s growth in 2013 according the ihs global insight august 2012 pessimistic scenario forecast u s gdp would contract 2 40 percent in 2013 relative to the baseline see table 1 supply effects a mild recession in the eurozone would have benign supply effects on the u s but a breakup of the eurozone or a european depression would transmit negative supply effects a recession in europe would have both positive and negative supply effects on the u s economy prices would fall due to decreased european demand for oil and other resources benefiting u s consumers and firms cheaper inputs for u s producers would increase profitability enabling them to hire more workers and pass savings on to consumers on the negative side some european companies that supply intermediate goods to american producers would go out of business forcing american producers to find higher cost suppliers furthermore as outlined above tighter credit conditions can prevent american companies from investing in capital and labor thereby slowing their growth negative supply shocks can create a recession in the short run if a severe european crisis emerges americans should expect a u s recession negative gdp growth as well a major crisis in europe would cause european producers to fail and spark a sharp drop in european imports from the rest of the world in particular a breakup of the eurozone would disrupt trade within europe because businesses would need to adjust to a new money regime on the fly many would likely adjust by contracting specifically by closing plants in countries that lost stability or competitiveness in the crisis supply chains in many industries are thoroughly globalized american producers rely on particular suppliers to make specialized parts likewise many american manufacturers make parts that end up in final goods produced in europe for instance the economist recently reported that 40 percent of the value of each airplane built by airbus originates in the u s if european firms fail or contract their american suppliers and producers will suffer the u s exported 268 billion to the eu in 2011 amounting to 1 8 percent of u s gdp and imported a similar amount much of that trade is in intermediate goods and between companies disrupting these links would slow production at some u s firms and lead to plant closures however the worst supply effects are those felt in the long run worldwide technological innovation and increasing efficiency drive material improvement in modern life if europe experiences an extended depression many of its entrepreneurs inventors and innovators will fall idle as bad as the current trough is the lost potential of the past few years pales in comparison with the potential that will be lost if europe remains on its current uninspiring growth path since the 1970s europe has offered a clinic in bad economic policy decreased labor freedom and an expanding welfare state ended europeans postwar convergence with u s living standards instead europe settled into a below potential growth path well behind the u s unemployment rose and labor force participation stagnated depriving the world of the economic contributions of many europeans continuing the rotten policies of the past into a severe crisis would make them even more destructive during times of economic transition market inflexibility will keep more people out of work longer and reward companies with political connections instead of companies with efficient innovations future american consumers would be poorer in a world with less european innovation political action or inaction without far reaching liberalization europe s economies cannot grow and thrive the anti competitive restrictions in most european economies will prevent rapid growth regardless of the euro s fate euro exit the most obvious potential political action would be the breakup of the eurozone this may occur in many different ways most likely leaving behind a core of western european countries that continue to use the currency in some versions the weakest economies and most troubled governments will drop out or be kicked out first greece then others from among ireland italy portugal and spain in other versions the most competitive economies germany and finland jump ship and the remainder try to muddle through together possibly failing and splintering further it is not known how sharp a crisis would be caused by a country s leaving the euro see text box how a european recession could affect u s growth ihs global insight forecast an orderly exit might look most like currency revaluations as when greece replaced the second modern drachma with the third modern drachma in 1954 exchanging 1 000 old drachmae for one new drachma such a transition is an inconvenience but not a catastrophe regrettably that is a best case scenario revaluations usually occur when the government wants to close the door on an era of inflation and people expect stability however an exit from the euro would likely be much messier for two reasons first residents may expect less stability outside the euro not more stability second residents will initially want to hold on to their euros and may eschew the unproven currency greeks have already withdrawn millions of euros from greek banks preferring to hold cash or invest in foreign banks where there is no risk of having their savings forcibly converted into drachmae and less risk of bank failure anders åslund compares a potential breakup of the euro with the messy breakup of the ruble zone and the divorce of the czech and slovak koruna in 1992 large devaluations have followed currency breakups both from inflation and from currency runs in neither case does åslund find evidence that the devaluation helps to alleviate underlying economic weakness as some have suggested while eurozone members may find it desirable or necessary to exit only fundamental reform not currency manipulation can solve the underlying problems uncertain politics how european voters will respond to economic distress remains to be seen in recent greek elections communist and neofascist parties together won more than 11 percent of the vote syriza a hard line socialist coalition vaulted from obscurity to become the second largest party in greece with 27 percent of the vote european voters are not immune to voting for destructive political leaders and european leaders are not immune to making decisions that harm themselves and their allies if europe suffers a steep economic decline everything is in play some countries might abandon nato eastern european countries could elect russian oriented leaders or anti immigrant parties might close borders and further curtail religious freedom countries that leave the euro for valid reasons might later hyperinflate their currencies to perpetuate high government spending instead of cutting subsidies and freeing trade european leaders could increase subsidies to politically important industries and raise barriers to trade any of these actions would harm u s interests and diminish european stability inaction on reform a country with sound policies can ride out a crisis for example estonia sustained a massive drop in gdp in 2009 and bounced back to strong growth reelecting the government in the process however most european countries lack competitive policies and instead hamper businesses and workers with myriad restrictions the wall street journal s tour of italy s restrictions on starting and growing a business illustrates the anti competitive anti growth regulations that plague european labor markets in addition to labor rigidities restrictions like zoning codes environmental regulations and agricultural subsidies conspire to reduce investment and raise prices europeans have access to the same technologies as americans but they produce only 71 percent as much output per person the same as in the 1980s with mounting debt and aging populations europeans can no longer afford to delay reform as explained in the heritage foundation s primer on sovereign debt economic growth is the only way to escape debts of this scale europe needs growth but its current policies are preventing it policy conclusions in the long run both the united states and europe need flexible and competitive policies that free people to pursue their ambitions u s policies the u s can best help europe by pursuing sound economic policies at home for 2012 this means pulling back from the fiscal cliff by making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent over the next few years it means reforming entitlements to preserve medicare and social security for the next generation just as a strong european economy lifts the united states a strong u s economy lifts europe the u s government should encourage europe s leaders to pursue long run strategies that will instill confidence the obama administration has actively worked against the best interests of europeans and americans by encouraging european leaders to spend money on discredited short term keynesian stimulus instead u s leaders should highlight the successful american experience with welfare reform and push for trade deals to eliminate costly agricultural and industrial subsidies on both sides of the atlantic reforms in europe european leaders are focused on building a bridge to the other side of the ongoing crisis this is a mistake as bad as the present situation is the long term prospects for european growth are even worse without a foundation for long run growth on the other side no bridge will deliver europe safely across its current troubles the policies that foster long run growth are well known even the european commission s own economists understand that improving long run growth will require structural reform although the details differ from place to place leaders in each european country should cut taxes and government spending taxes and government spending end welfare as europeans know it welfare as europeans know it stop regulating workplaces so harshly that 10 percent to 30 percent of the economy goes underground workplaces so harshly that 10 percent to 30 percent of the economy goes underground promote competition instead of coddling iconic corporations competition instead of coddling iconic corporations allow employers to fire workers so that they can risk hiring young and inexperienced workers employers to fire workers so that they can risk hiring young and inexperienced workers liberalize zoning restrictions in cities where the high cost of rent pushes workers away from the most productive locations and discourages child bearing zoning restrictions in cities where the high cost of rent pushes workers away from the most productive locations and discourages child bearing encourage immigration of skilled workers and immigration of skilled workers and end agricultural subsidies and trade barriers free people working in free markets are the only path to long term growth and prosperity if europe can implement the right policies for the long run the short run will look a lot shorter and more manageable salim furth phd is

with strong political support in both nations and with great britain no longer a member of the european union the united states and britain are working hard to negotiate a free trade area these negotiations were regrettably delayed by britain s drawn out brexit but the negotiations are now proceeding and britain is showing its determination to develop the free trading policy merited by its position as an independent nation with the world s fifth largest economy in the years and indeed the decades before the 2016 referendum that led to brexit the establishment voices of business in britain often gave strong if not unthinking and unconditional support for britain s eu membership in the run up to the referendum it became clear that opinion in british business was more diverse than the establishment allowed and that many british businesses did not support the european project but by and large the major british business organizations continued to view brexit with a skeptical eye more recently however business organizations on both sides of the atlantic have begun to realize the opportunities that brexit offers most significantly an alliance of major british and american business organizations in the financial sector recently announced their support for deep and broad financial regulatory cooperation between the u s and the u k within the context of an u s u k free trade agreement the u s and britain must take advantage of this constructive initiative and build on it as they negotiate an ambitious u s u k free trade area diverse british business opinions on brexit any generalization about british business s views on brexit is dangerous because business in britain as in any developed nation is exceptionally diverse that fact was regularly elided in britain by the dominance of the established business organizations including in particular the confederation of british industry cbi which is dominated by large highly visible multi national corporations that export heavily to the eu the cbi has supported deeper british participation in the european project for decades ref publications that purportedly spoke with britain s business community in mind also leaned strongly if not credulously in favor of britain s eu membership the economist for example argued in 2012 that membership is not an affair of the heart but an accounting exercise ref thereby simultaneously minimizing the financial burdens of eu membership and completely ignoring the argument that britain should be free as a sovereign nation to govern itself of course big businesses have the right to advocate for their interests but the purported opposition of british business to brexit in reality represented only the views of a selective and self interested minority of large businesses that were heavily invested in maintaining a familiar status quo in the run up to the 2016 referendum it became obvious that opinion in british business was more diverse than the establishment allowed the business for britain group played a major role in leave s victory in the referendum and polling in organizations of smaller british businesses showed this large community was narrowly split between leave and remain ref since the referendum the establishment british business organizations have largely focused on opposing a british departure from the eu without an agreed exit arrangement the so called no deal brexit while maintaining an undercurrent of skepticism about the entire idea of brexit at times this opposition has verged on the comic as for example when the cbi unhappily described a no deal brexit as the biggest change in terms of trade this country has faced since the mid 19th century ref that was when britain adopted free trade in food one of the greatest reforms and advances in consumer welfare in british history the cbi s argument points out that large businesses tend to be conservative not in their politics but in their preference for a status quo that benefits them and makes it hard for competitors to emerge private sector support for u s u k financial regulatory cooperation until recently business organizations have tended to present brexit as a problem to be overcome or minimized rather than an opportunity to be exploited but in late september the british american finance alliance bafa a coalition of 21 british and american trade associations and industry bodies representing both financial and professional services took an important step forward by presenting significant proposals for anglo american financial regulatory cooperation within the context of an ambitious u s u k free trade agreement the bafa contains some of the most important business groups on both sides of the atlantic including british american business the city of london corporation the law society of england and wales thecityuk the securities industry financial markets association the u s chamber of commerce and uk finance bafa s proposals seek to build on the success of the u k u s financial regulatory working group frwg representing britain s treasury and the u s s treasury department according to bafa a u s u k free trade agreement should include provisions establishing a framework to continue the existing u k u s frwg or a similar u k u s regulatory forum ref bafa argues that the frwg is too informal and that the u s and britain should improve transparency and stakeholder access and should have an ambitious agenda including developing mechanisms for ensuring regulated data flows across borders collaboration on financial technology cybersecurity cooperation and market access issues ideally the new forum would complement a u s u k free trade agreement that would protect cross border data flows prohibit data localization facilitate investment include investor protection feature an ambitious digital trade chapter and provide for an effective dispute resolution system ref finally bafa hopes the forum would consider international issues in other words issues that go beyond anglo american bilateral relations such as improving global financial stability reducing market fragmentation caused by differing regulations encouraging the emergence of a level playing field globally and developing u s u k cooperation in international standard setting bodies ref assessing the bafa initiative the bafa and its member organizations are to be commended for taking a positive and constructive step by putting forward realistic proposals for improving u k u s financial regulatory cooperation even if the proposals are not accepted by either side exactly as the bafa has presented them the bafa has done a service by setting out the issues at stake the need for improvements in anglo american cooperation in this sector and the value of placing them in the context of an ambitious u s u k free trade agreement bafa has taken a significant step away from the largely negative approach of too many business organizations toward brexit by presenting an ambitious agenda for collaboration that goes well beyond brexit bafa framework the overall framework of the bafa proposals is one that as the bafa notes seeks to find an approach that does not limit the sovereignty of national regulators and that emphasizes agreed standards where possible and mutual recognition of standards when this approach is more productive ref this is the correct approach the value of mutual recognition rests partly in the political reality that the u s and the u k are independent sovereign democracies and that neither nation will be willing rightly to cede control of its regulatory apparatus to the other but it also rests in the fact that harmonization of rules the eu s preferred approach is bad for competition because it tends to lock in the market power of today s businesses which will have an outsized impact on the creation of those harmonized rules mutual recognition is both better politics and better economics because it is less corporatist and more competitive a few hiccups on occasion bafa s proposals appear to be at odds with these sound principles the bafa s call for the u k and the u s to promote the global creation of a level playing field for example is cautiously framed as a way to combat the unilateral and uncoordinated implementation and extraterritorial application of rules ref but in fact a completely level playing field is incompatible with mutual recognition of national standards because even if those standards have the same ends and are comparable in effect the fact that they are not identical could be held and would be held by the eu for example to be an offense against the creation of a level playing field it would have been preferable if the bafa had avoided the concept of the level playing field entirely and had instead emphasized the value of implementing widely accepted rules effectively and in ways that do not defeat the intent of the rules what the u s and the u k must do in order to make a rapid success of the negotiations for a free trade agreement between the u s and britain which will soon start their fifth round both governments must encourage private sector input as the bafa initiative has illustrated the private sector has much to contribute to the successful negotiation of an ambitious u s u k free trade agreement before the negotiations between britain and the u s began both governments sought input from the private sector ref but given the fact that the u s s negotiating objectives with the u k are almost identical to its objectives for negotiations with the european union it is not clear that these consultations made a significant difference to the u s s position as it entered negotiations with the u k ref the u s and the u k should encourage private sector organizations beyond the financial sector to offer substantive and detailed input while remaining committed to their goal of negotiating a free trade agreement that promotes competition and benefits consumers remain committed to the principle of mutual recognition the bafa has rightly emphasized the value of the principle of mutual recognition to the conclusion of an ambitious u s u k free trade agreement in its negotiations with the eu the u k has been clear that it will not become a client state by locking itself into the eu s regulatory framework ref a significant part of the value of a u s u k free trade agreement rests in the value it can have as an alternative to the restrictive vision of the eu the eu s regulatory imperialism is sometimes defended as a way to create a level playing field which is then framed as a contribution to freer trade on the grounds that it is easier to trade when the field is level this is incorrect regulations like tariffs impose costs and those costs do not disappear just because they weigh equally heavily on both parties ref the u s and britain have an opportunity to offer a new model for trade between sovereign democracies which lends their negotiations a much wider significance consider announcing an agreement in principle ultimately for a u s u k free trade agreement to take effect it will have to be negotiated and approved by the national legislatures as a complete package but as the successful negotiations for a free trade agreement between the u k and japan illustrate it is possible to announce an agreement in principle between negotiating parties another approach recommended by trade expert shanker singham is to agree to so called early harvest measures in particular sectors some of which in the u s could be completed by the executive branch without need for legislative approval ref britain and the u s should consider demonstrating the momentum behind the negotiations by announcing an over arching agreement in principle and or sectoral agreements as soon as possible conclusion the support the bafa has demonstrated for an ambitious free trade agreement between the u s and the u k is a valuable illustration of the approach that the private sector should take toward brexit and toward britain s development of an independent trade policy instead of complaining about the outcome of the 2016 referendum the private sector should welcome the fact that britain a top five world economy is clearly committed to a policy of free trade the private sector and in particular large established firms that are heavily invested in today s status quo will always be nervous about change but the fundamental fact is that as long as international trade continues on its present trajectory of slow growth or even decline the world will miss out on growth and businesses will miss out on profits that both could otherwise have enjoyed a commitment to free trade is the best way to alter that trajectory and right now britain is the major world economy pursuing a policy of free trade most energetically both for the sake of their own bilateral relations and prosperity and because of the lead it can give to the rest of the world the u s and britain should move as rapidly as possible toward concluding an ambitious free trade agreement the steps both parties have taken so far have moved them toward this goal to reach it they must work together to keep up the momentum that will bring them to an agreement ted r bromund is senior research fellow in anglo american relations in the margaret thatcher center for freedom of the kathryn and shelby cullom davis institute for national security and foreign policy at the heritage foundation

twitter is absolutely haemorrhaging cash after elon musk took over the company the world s richest man confirmed the company s money woes writing twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists extremely messed up they re trying to destroy free speech in america the microblogging social media site makes most of its revenue from advertising but major advertisers have put their spending on hold while they evaluate the company s content moderation policies following musk s 68 billion us 44 billion takeover according to angelo carusone the president of non profit media watchdog media matters for america twitter generally sells about us 600 900 million in ads upfront at the showcase event newfronts each year elon musk has taken over social media platform twitter photo herald montage ap getty images but this year buyers were hesitant and twitter s presentation imploded and ended shockingly early twitter from what i understand basically sold almost nothing and locked in extremely little 2023 revenue carusone wrote this means that instead of heading into 2023 with 15 20 per cent of 2023 already secured as they typically would have twitter heads into next year with almost none of that all because of musk s red pilled edgelord approach carusone added musk had months to address these concerns or even learn about them but instead he insisted on antagonising the very businesses and people that sustain twitter back in may the groups and companies weren t calling for a boycott they were asking basic questions carusone said cbs news reports there was an immediate visible and measurable spike in hate speech after musk took over the company citing new research there was a marked increase in vulgar and hostile rhetoric aimed at people based on their race religion ethnicity and orientation there was also a spike in the usage of the n word k word and f word twitter s head of safety and security yoel roth confirmed the company was battling a surge in hateful conduct on twitter and was making measurable progress removing more than 1500 accounts and reducing impressions on this content to nearly zero musk wrote twitter s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged in fact we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline below our prior norms contrary to what you may read in the press musk took over the company promising to ensure freedom of speech at the service which famously banned then us president donald trump following the january 6 united states capitol attack citing the risk of further incitement of violence there has been major push back to musk s takeover from users on twitter who largely lean to the left politically the site has been flooded with pledges from heavy twitter users and people with large followings stating they will no longer use the service mountains of debt banks including morgan stanley bank of america and barclays lent musk 20 billion us 13 billion for the acquisition however they will have to be repaid by the san francisco company not by the entrepreneur personally according to a calculation made by afp twitter will have to disburse a little less than us 1 billion from the first year as interest and principal a high amount for a group whose turnover reached only us 5 billion in 2021 that debt is tricky when you re losing money so there ll be a lot of pressure to cut costs and increase revenue so that they can make debt payments steven kaplan of the university of chicago booth school of business said otherwise musk will need to find funds to avoid bankruptcy the company has been losing about 6 million us 4 million a day musk wrote as he justified firing workers the entrepreneur on friday laid off about half of twitter s employees and is seeking new sources of revenue including an optional subscription fee of 8 per month for those wanting a verified account further development of twitter may require an infusion of capital more difficult to raise in theory by an unlisted company i don t think you can raise any more debt erik gordon an entrepreneurship expert at the university of michigan ross school of business said but in this case there is a musk factor you tweet a few times and you know bring in the money radical changes most such deals are initiated either by a financial logic or an industrial logic whereas elon musk didn t have one gordon said he just was unhappy with the way twitter was treating free speech and concluded that he could manage it better as a general rule an exit from the market is followed by radical changes at a company sreedhar bharath professor of finance at arizona state university said and those changes may not be readily apparent because the company no longer has an obligation to communicate publicly the company is shielded from the punishment meted out by financial markets if they do not like the changes he said some might say the markets have an excessive focus on the next quarter results and managers of newly privatised firms can pursue long term goals without fretting about the short term but with the high public profile of twitter key decisions are likely to become public noted jagadeesh sivadasan of the university of michigan s ross school of business this was evident for the post acquisition decisions regarding firing of key officers risk of bankruptcy a study published in 2019 by two researchers at california state polytechnic university that looked at nearly 500 deals between 1980 and 2006 found that about 20 per cent of large companies undergoing leveraged buyouts filed for bankruptcy within 10 years compared with 2 per cent for a sample of other companies most of them have done better than public companies gordon added but they don t get a lot of publicity the big failures get a lot of attention and create this idea that the debt kills the company most of the time it works which is why people keep doing it musk is one of the most creative people on the planet able to build three totally different companies paypal tesla and spacex all of which have reached more than 100 billion in valuation kaplan said he s a talent magnet he s going to attract real talent that hasn t been there for a while i wouldn t bet against him andrew backhouse news com au

rockville m d and suzhou china nov 6 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the results of a phase 3 clinical study credit 1 of tafolecimab ibi306 a recombinant fully human anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody in chinese patients with non familial hypercholesterolemia non fh were presented at the american heart association aha scientific sessions 2022 as an e poster vp173 cardiovascular disease is currently the leading cause of death in china and hypercholesterolemia is one of the most important risk factors leading to cardiovascular disease chinese guidelines for the prevention and treatment of dyslipidemia in adults recommend the use of statin therapy for lipid control however most patients especially those who are at high or very high cardiovascular risk with hypercholesterolemia still need additional non statin therapy to achieve lipid lowering goals in recent years pcsk9 inhibitors have shown significant lipid lowering efficacy and provided new treatment options for these patients tafolecimab is an innovative pcsk9 monoclonal antibody developed by innovent it is also the first pcsk9 inhibitor that performed a large scale randomized phase 3 clinical study in china credit 1 is a randomized double blind placebo controlled phase 3 clinical study clinicaltrials gov nct04289285 to assess the efficacy and safety of tafolecimab in chinese subjects with non familial hypercholesterolemia patients on stable lipid lowering therapies for at least 4 weeks were randomized 2 2 1 1 to receive subcutaneous tafolecimab 450 mg every 4 weeks q4w tafolecimab 600 mg every 6 weeks q6w placebo q4w or placebo q6w for 48 weeks the primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 48 in ldl c levels a total of 618 subjects baseline ldl c level 2 85mmol l were enrolled and 614 received at least one dose of the study treatment results show that both regimens of tafolecimab treatment induced significant reductions in ldl c levels compared with placebo the treatment difference of mean change in ldl c level from baseline to week 48 was 65 0 with tafolecimab 450 mg q4w group and 57 3 with tafolecimab 600 mg q6w group both p 0 0001 about the 450mg q4w of the tafolecimab group 87 8 of subjects receiving tafolecimab achieved 50 reduction from baseline to week 48 in ldl c levels 91 7 of subjects receiving tafolecimab achieved ldl c 1 8 mmol l 83 4 of subjects receiving tafolecimab achieved ldl c 1 4 mmol l about the 600mg q6w of the tafolecimab group 82 1 of subjects receiving tafolecimab achieved ldl c 1 8 mmol l 68 7 of subjects receiving tafolecimab achieved ldl c 1 4 mmol l meanwhile significant reductions in non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c apolipoprotein b apob and lipoprotein a lp a levels were achieved with both dose regimens of tafolecimab versus placebo at week 48 tafolecimab was well tolerated and the safety profile was similar to those of other pcsk9 monoclonal antibodies to conclude tafolecimab administered at either 450 mg q4w or 600 mg q6w yielded significant and durable reductions in ldl c levels and showed a favorable safety profile in chinese patients with non familial hypercholesterolemia in june 2022 the china s national medical products administration nmpa has formally accepted the new drug application nda for tafolecimab injection for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia tafolecimab will potentially be the first approved locally developed pcsk9 monoclonal antibody in china prof yong huo principal investigator of the credit 1 study peking university first hospital stated credit 1 is the large scale phase 3 trial in china to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pcsk 9 inhibitors in chinese patients with non familial hypercholesterolemia the results of this study demonstrated that long dosing intervals q4w or q6w treatment of tafolecimab significantly reduced ldl c levels and improved other lipid parameters significant therapeutic benefits and favorable safety were found in chinese patients with non fh who received tafolecimab treatment i am very confident in the clinical application of tafolecimab and looking forward to its approval and launch to market earlier next year bringing significant efficacy good safety more friendly and accessible treatment options for chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia dr lei qian vice president of innovent stated in credit 1 tafolecimab showed significant efficacy and favorable safety in chinese patients with non familial hypercholesterolemia tafolecimab is a pioneer of local pcsk9 inhibitors independently developed in china the credit 1 study as the first pivotal study of pcsk9 inhibitors in china to appear on the international academic stage shows the excellent scientific research level of chinese researchers as well as the solid research and development capabilities of innovent meanwhile the new drug application for tafolecimab has been officially accepted by the cde and is currently under review we hope that this high quality biological drug will benefit the majority of patients with hypercholesterolemia in china early next year about hypercholesterolemia in recent years the blood lipid level of the chinese population has gradually increased and the prevalence of dyslipidemia has increased significantly with an overall prevalence of 40 4 in chinese adults the increase in serum cholesterol levels in the population will lead to an increase of about 9 2 million cardiovascular disease events in china from 2010 to 2030 at present the management of hyperlipidemia in china is not optimistic according to the 2020 china cardiovascular health and disease report the diagnostic treatment and control rate of dyslipidemia in chinese adults remain low the anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody can effectively reduce ldl c levels which is expected to provide a better treatment option for chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia about ibi306 pcsk 9 inhibitor ibi306 developed by innovent is an lgg2 fully human monoclonal antibody that can specifically bind to pcsk 9 and reduce ldl c level by inhibiting pcsk 9 mediated low density lipoprotein receptor ldlr endocytosis subsequently enhancing the clearance of ldl c resulting in a reduction in ldl c level as of now three ibi306 pivotal trials have been finished the results from phase 1 and 2 clinical studies have been published in jacc asia an internationally renowned journal of cardiology the results of the credit 2 phase 3 study have been accepted and presented as a poster at the american cardiology association annual congress 2022 acc
