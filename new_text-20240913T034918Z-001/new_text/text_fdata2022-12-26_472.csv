here are the highlights of events related to the war in ukraine over the past 24 hours putin russia is ready to negotiate on ukraine but kyiv and its western backers refuse russia is ready to negotiate with all parties involved in the war in ukraine but kyiv and its western backers refuse to participate in talks said russian president vladimir putin in an interview broadcast today reuters reported the russian invasion of ukraine on february 24 of this year sparked europe s deadliest conflict since world war ii and is the biggest confrontation between moscow and the west since the 1962 cuban missile crisis the agency noted and so far the end of the current conflict is not in sight the kremlin says it will fight until it achieves all its goals while kyiv has said it will not rest until it expels every single russian soldier from its territory including crimea which russia annexed in 2014 we are ready to negotiate with anyone on acceptable terms but it depends on them we do not refuse to negotiate they refuse putin said in an interview with russia 1 tv cia chief william burns said earlier this month that most conflicts end with negotiations but the agency s assessment is that russia is not yet serious about genuine negotiations to end the war an adviser to the ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky meanwhile said today that putin needs to come back to reality and admit that it is russia that does not want any negotiations russia unilaterally attacked ukraine and killed its people russia does not want negotiations but is trying to escape responsibility mykhailo podoliak wrote on twitter putin said russia was acting in the right direction in ukraine as the west led by the united states sought to tear russia apart washington denies that it aims for the collapse of russia i think we are acting in the right direction we are protecting our national interests the interests of our citizens our people and we have no choice but to protect our citizens the russian president said asked if the geopolitical conflict with the west was approaching dangerous levels putin replied i don t think it s too dangerous putin said the west had started the conflict in ukraine in 2014 by ousting the pro russian president during massive protests soon after russia annexed crimea from ukraine and russian backed separatist forces began fighting ukrainian armed forces in eastern ukraine in fact the fundamental thing here is the policy of our geopolitical opponents which aims to tear apart russia historical russia putin said the pope denounced the war in his traditional vatican mass pope francis denounced the wars that are being waged around the world during his traditional christmas eve liturgy in st peter s basilica which is also the first of his christmas services dpa reported the people of the world who are hungry for power and money devour even their neighbors their brothers and sisters how many wars there are and in how many places today dignity and freedom are still being trampled the holy father was outraged although not to specifically name russia s war against ukraine notes bta st peter s basilica was packed during the service for the first time since the pandemic began with 7 000 guests attending and another 3 000 following outside from st peter s square pope francis called the weak and the poor the main victims of human greed and this christmas humanity insatiably pursuing money power and pleasure does not make room for the little ones for the many unborn poor forgotten people just as it was with jesus i think especially of the children who are swallowed up from war poverty and injustice the holy father also said the pope presided over the mass but mostly served it from a seated position at the altar because of the condition of his knee he noted that jesus was born without luxuries and comforts but thanks to this the real richness of life came to light namely interpersonal relationships of course it is not easy to leave the comfortable warmth of worldly life to enter the harsh beauty of the bethlehem cave francis said but we must remember that without the poor there is no real christmas even without them we celebrate christmas but not the christmas of jesus he added brothers sisters at christmas god is poor let charity flourish again urged the holy father zelensky on the eve of christmas slavery has an even higher price than freedom freedom comes at a high price but slavery comes at an even higher price said ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky in a defiant speech late saturday he called on his people to resist russian attacks as they celebrate christmas the bbc reported russia s missile and drone attacks have left millions of ukrainians without electricity heating and running water on december 24 russian airstrikes killed 10 people in the southern city of kherson ukrainian authorities said 68 people were injured and urged local residents to urgently donate blood describing russia as a terrorist country zelensky accused russian troops of killing for the purpose of intimidation and pleasure in a post on social media the ukrainian president showed photos of streets littered with bodies and burning cars saying the world needs to see and understand what absolute evil we are fighting against kherson the only regional capital captured by russia since it launched its full scale invasion on february 24 was liberated from ukraine last month since then it has been frequently attacked by russian forces stationed on the east bank of the dnieper river the kremlin has repeatedly denied that its attacks were aimed at civilians however russian president vladimir putin recently admitted that russian forces had struck energy facilities important to ukraine three ukrainians died during mine clearing operations in the kherson region three ukrainian emergency services workers were killed yesterday in a mine explosion while demining parts of the kherson region reuters reported all three selflessly served in the emergency rescue squad of the special purpose unit in zhytomyr region and carried out the task of demining territories in kherson region freed from the enemy says the zhytomyr emergency service which included the dead on the page is on facebook bta informs zhytomyr oblast is located west of kyiv in northern ukraine russia which invaded ukraine 10 months ago controls most but not all of kherson oblast in mid november ukrainian forces retook control of the city of kherson the administrative center of the region and a number of settlements in the region explosives experts have been working there since then after president volodymyr zelensky said russian forces had detonated much of the buildings and sites there they have done this in many other areas that ukraine has been able to recapture according to reuters the us state department estimated in early december that about 100 000 square miles 160 000 square kilometers of ukrainian land needed to be screened for explosive hazards this is almost half the area of germany reuters compares we expect this to be one of the largest challenges with available landmines and unexploded ordnance since world war ii the state department said in a briefing posted on its website on saturday ukrainian authorities said a russian strike in the city of kherson killed at least 10 people and moscow blamed ukrainian forces for the attack reuters recalls russian political scientist we will go to war with kazakhstan russia will go to war with kazakhstan this was predicted by the russian political scientist yevgeny satanovsky during an appearance on the state television russia 1 we don t even mention the military biological laboratories in ukraine which are more than enough and where americans englishmen and germans work we also forget about the laboratories in kazakhstan i used to laugh at this idea kazakhstan and america how military labs however satanovsky not only convinced himself that there are laboratories supported by the west in the central asian country but also indicated their exact number two therefore in my opinion there will certainly be a clash with kazakhstan assured the expert there are american biolabs in kazakhstan that we forgot about pic twitter com scmyvsocz9 anton gerashchenko gerashchenko_en december 23 2022 for the second month in a row a russian specialist dares to comment on the air about the possibility of a conflict with astana on november 22 russian political scientist dmitry drobnitsky called for kazakhstan to be de nazified during a guest appearance on vladimir solovyov s propaganda show he proposed other arguments in support of a possible invasion nazi trials can also begin there as in ukraine and our longest border is there soloviev joined in the fantasizing and there are many russians there as well as nuclear fuel for our entire rosatom drobnitsky added russian soldiers have exported the production of a cognac factory in ukraine the russian military looted a ukrainian brandy factory tavria in the temporarily occupied nova kakhovka kherson region this was announced by the mayor of the city alexander kovalenko to radio freedom the russian military initially in the summer deployed a field hospital at the plant they declared it municipal property and threatened to shoot the workers if even one bottle of cognac disappeared in september however they themselves began looting the plant they dismantled and took away two new cognac bottling lines looted the alcohol aging workshop and all the finished products in the warehouses the enterprises had and still have a unique workshop for aging alcohol the pride of both the management of the enterprise and the city itself because there were spirits that were aged for decades 30 35 years each unique types of cognac are collectible unfortunately this alcoholic material these stocks as far as i know were taken either to the crimea or to the krasnodar territory explains kovalenko of course this was not enough for the russians they also destroyed the company s vineyards and much of the company s real estate in addition a significant portion of the company s real estate and vineyards have been destroyed as a result of the hostilities he added kovalenko said that russian military personnel are still occasionally on the premises of the enterprise this allowed the armed forces of ukraine to recently strike effectively against them according to him it is currently impossible to calculate the damage to the enterprise but it is tens and hundreds of millions of hryvnias it s not going to be easy to restore all this what is it like for alcohol to sit for 25 30 35 years in warehouses it can t be measured simply in money because it s a damage of such a technological nature and it s much more difficult because it takes time and considerable time notes kovalenko china s foreign minister signaled deepening ties with russia chinese foreign minister wang yi today defended his country s position on the war in ukraine and signaled that china will deepen ties with russia next year the associated press reported wang speaking via video link at a conference in the chinese capital also blamed america for the deterioration of relations between the world s two largest economies saying china firmly rejects the wrong policy of the united states toward china beijing has hit back at western pressure on trade technology human rights and its claims to a vast swath of the western pacific accusing the us of bullying china s refusal to condemn the invasion of ukraine and join other countries in imposing sanctions on russia has further soured ties with washington and fueled a nascent rift with much of europe wang said china will deepen strategic mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation with russia regarding the ukraine crisis we consistently uphold the basic principles of objectivity and impartiality without favoring one side or the other without adding fuel to the fire much less seeking selfish benefits from the situation the chinese foreign minister said at the same time wang yi said that china will seek to return relations with the us to normal saying that they have deteriorated because the united states stubbornly continues to view china as its main competitor and engage in a clear blockade suppression and provocations against china the eu has delivered 1 000 generators to ukraine the countries of the european union have already provided over 1000 power generators to ukraine this was announced on twitter by the eu commissioner for crisis management janez lenarcic according to him the program of the civil protection mechanism of the european union has already made it possible to deliver more than 78 thousand tons of such aid to the country according to him they are intended for residential homes and hospitals previously the united arab emirates announced that it was sending 2 500 generators with capacities from 3 5 to 8 kilowatts the first 1 200 of which will be sent through warsaw today the rest in january ukraine is in urgent need of generators due to the heavy damage russian strikes have caused to the country s energy infrastructure since october 10 a donation campaign for them gained momentum in bulgaria as well follow novinite com on twitter and facebook write to us at editors

i appreciate this opportunity to speak to you today about one of the most important opportunities that america has faced in several decades the north american free trade agreement which adds mexico to the current free trade area with canada will create the largest free trade zone in the world with a population of 370 million and a gross domestic product of 7 trillion most of the arguments in favor of nafta have focused on the short term economic benefits to the u s mexico s tariffs on american goods average about ten percent while america s tariffs on mexican products average only about three percent consequently when nafta eliminates these tariffs america gains greater access to mexico s market than mexico gains to america s under nafta mexico will allow american enterprises to provide banking securities insurance and other services in its market all serious scholarly studies of the effects of the agreement find net new jobs created in the u s the only open question is how many with all of these benefits it is curious that some conservatives actually oppose nafta on a few points their concerns are valid but their conclusions about the actual effects of nafta are mistaken the environmental and labor commissions established by the nafta side agreements for example are unneeded but they do not give more power to radical american environmental groups they do not endanger american sovereignty and they do not offset the benefits that will result from freer trade today i want to give you ten reasons why all americans who want a prosperous growing country and conservatives in particular who favor less government control of the economy and more freedom for individuals should favor nafta reason 1 nafta originated as part of the vision of one of the most outstanding conservatives in this country s history ronald reagan in the late 1970s ronald reagan was setting forth his vision of america a vision that won him the white house and a vision which when translated into economic policy led to this country s longest period of economic expansion part of that vision was a free trade area in this hemisphere stretching from the yukon in the arctic to the straits of magellan in south america the reagan administration negotiated the country s first free trade area in 1985 with israel next followed the fta with canada nafta is the next step in the reagan vision of a free trade hemisphere reason 2 conservatives stand for the freedom of individuals not for the power of governments nafta restores sovereignty to individuals too often we speak of free trade as for example between mexico and the u s but what do we mean by mexico and the u s do we mean the governments of these countries do we mean the physical territory in point of fact mexico and the u s do not trade anything individual americans and individual mexicans are the actual merchants and customers nafta removes the current restrictions of the mexican and u s governments on the freedom of their citizens to trade with one another nafta removes power from the hands of governments and restores freedom to the sovereign individual some critics have complained that somehow by allowing the economies of mexico and the u s to become more interdependent nafta robs america of its sovereignty but to these critics i say that it is not your economy to begin with conservatives reject the premise that a country s wealth is collective or communal the american economy belongs to millions of individual private property owners who should be free to use and dispose of their property as they see fit this freedom includes the right to buy from and sell to mexicans reason 3 conservatives respect the lessons of history one of these lessons is that free trade leads to a prosperous world another is that protectionism leads to poverty to paraphrase my friend thomas sowell i don t have faith in free trade i have evidence freer trade leads to greater prosperity in the 19th century britain became the dominant economic power why did britain a small island rise to economic dominance in part it was because britain progressively opened its markets to imports it realized that it makes little sense to waste manpower raw materials land and capital to produce goods and services that can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere it is better to allow the individuals who are most efficient in producing any given good or service to do so and to allow them to trade with others for the things they cannot produce as efficiently even countries that kept their markets more closed than britain to the outside world in fact prospered through trade liberalization germany for example was only united as a country under the leadership of prussia in 1871 but that union was the culmination of a process of eliminating trade barriers between the numerous small german principalities the efficiency that resulted from the free trade area between these german states helped what became unified germany to grow and prosper the u s kept trade barriers relatively high in the 19th century as well but much of the american national enterprise in that century was settling the vast territory of the west america was a huge european size continental free trade area stretching from the atlantic to the pacific the same distance as between madrid and moscow nafta will apply this lesson that freer trade means greater prosperity history also shows us the follies of protectionism during the 1920s the u s progressively raised its trade barriers to other countries of course that meant that other countries could not earn the dollars necessary to purchase u s products so the u s government through the newly created federal reserve system expanded credit and encouraged lending to other countries when the stock market crashed in october 1929 because of these policies policy makers and the public assumed the country was in a temporary recession by early 1930 the economy was beginning to rebound but in that year president hoover changed a recession into a depression by raising taxes twice first he raised taxes on personal and business income and second he raised taxes on purchases from overseas under the infamous smoot hawley tariff act britain followed suit at the 1930 ottawa conference by establishing the imperial preference system to favor trade within its empire and discourage trade outside of it similarly france tried to restrict within its empire fascist italy already was trying to keep out foreign goods and investments and when germany went fascist it followed a similar policy unlike a trading bloc nafta does not establish significant new barriers to non nafta members rather it opens markets and it is hoped will lead to more free trade areas reason 4 conservatives understand the need for institutional checks on government abuses of freedom nafta provides such a check to explain this point i call your attention to one of the principal reasons why mexico wants nafta the mexican government over the past seven years has taken major steps to convert its socialist economy into a free market economy it has joined the general agreement on tariffs and trade and as a result already lowered many of its trade barriers it has controlled the runaway inflation of its currency it has sold off many government owned enterprises but the free market advocates in mexico understand that these reforms could be undone by a future government and the leftist opposition in mexico that might control or influence such a government is indeed anti american and anti free market two leftist critics of the government of mexican president carlos salinas for example recently suggested that in place of nafta mexico levy a 100 percent tariff on american imports while allowing japanese and european imports into the country duty free thus to make it difficult or impossible for a future government to scrap the free market reforms mexican reformers understand the need to integrate their country s economy with the economy of a relatively prosperous more free market country for mexico the obvious candidate for economic partnership is the u s if mexico is more integrated with america s economy what would happen for example if the government of mexico decided to nationalize and run enterprises that belong in the private sector naturally such companies would run inefficiently but with a free trade area american firms would provide alternatives to the high cost low quality government goods or services the mexican government enterprises would lose millions of dollars and require massive government bailouts even larger than those normally required by such enterprises mexico would have a very hard time affording such an economically irrational policy in a nafta with the u s and canada but the same controlling effect on government can work on america from closer economic ties with mexico for example many of america s environmental laws have little or nothing to do with protecting the public health and safety and everything to do with empowering bureaucrats with nafta the u s will have a strong incentive to replace these senseless laws with a more efficient and just form of environmental protection based on private property rights america would have a strong incentive to clean up its own competitiveness act reason 5 conservatives examine new arrangements closely and base their decisions on facts conservatives know well not to trust the words and assurances of governments when they propose new policies this does not means that conservatives oppose all change only change that limits freedom and expands government power some conservatives fear that the labor commissions and especially the environmental commissions set up by the nafta side agreements might take away american sovereignty or give radical environmentalists in america more power these concerns are legitimate and reflect the kind of care and attention to the potential dangers of new government bodies that is a hallmark of conservatives but i m happy to report that while the commissions are unnecessary they do not pose a danger to americans let me review briefly what the commissions can and cannot do the first function of the commissions is fact finding each commission consists of representatives of the three nafta governments and a secretariat the secretariat of the environmental commission is empowered to investigate cases called to its attention of a country s failure to enforce its own laws the commissions cannot search for cases on their own further the commissions have no subpoena powers for collecting evidence what the commissions can do in the end after an arduous process that weeds out nuisance complaints is issue reports of their findings these reports like other reports by international bodies might be informative or they might be useless but they have no effect whatsoever on the power of the american people to conduct policy as they see fit the second function of the commission is dispute resolution if a nafta member government believes that another member is engaging in a persistent pattern of failure to effectively enforce its own environmental or labor laws where a tradeable good or service is involved it can request consultations and on the agreement of the other nafta member have a dispute resolution panel convened but if a country is found to be engaging in such a pattern its sovereign powers still cannot to overridden by the panel if the guilty country does not agree to change its practices the panel can levy a fine of no more than 20 million if the country refuses to pay the fine the worst the panel can do is allow the aggrieved country to restore certain limited tariffs to pre nafta levels to collect the fine this is similar to retaliation under gatt it does not limit sovereignty it is critical to note that nothing in nafta prohibits a country from changing its own laws often critics cite article 1114 of the accord which states that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health safety or environmental standards but nafta contains no mechanism by which member governments can act against an alleged violator the lip service paid by nafta to these standards does not confer upon any international body legal authority over u s domestic affairs the u n charter for example calls for the peaceful solution of all international disputes has this produced world peace has an american weapons manufacturer found itself answering to an international tribunal for violating such policies the environmental agreement makes clear that while nafta countries are urged not to reduce environmental standards they still retain the right to make their own policies beginning the side agreement is a preamble reaffirming the sovereign right of states to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and development policies article 3 of the side agreement while calling for high levels of environmental protection does so while recognizing the right of each party to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection and environmental development policies and priorities and to adopt or modify accordingly its environmental laws and regulations free market advocates need not fear that american special interest groups will use the commissions to impose more regulations on the u s economy according to article 2021 of nafta private parties do not have a right of action in u s courts based on commission findings reason 6 conservatives understand that free trade areas breed more free trade areas that nafta is a means to spread economic liberty throughout the hemisphere and the world the u s often complains about trade barriers in other countries american firms face restrictions when they try to sell computers in brazil or rice in japan of course the u s has many trade barriers as well the u s government often uses the threat of trade retaliation as a means to force other countries to remove trade barriers this approach does not work very well but consider the economic dynamics set up by a free trade area brazilian firms for example want to compete with american firms selling products in mexico but under nafta american products enter mexico duty free brazilian products however are subject to an average ten percent duty how can brazil make up for this disadvantage by raising trade barriers on mexican or american products no such an approach would not make their goods more competitive in mexico brazil would have a strong incentive to follow the strategy if you can t beat em join em only by seeking membership in the free trade area could a country place itself again on an equal footing with their competition this phenomenon in fact is already occurring the japanese for example were concerned about the u s canada fta and are now concerned about nafta nafta gives the u s more leverage to open the markets of japan and europe reason 7 conservatives understand that only through free exchange can american living standards continue to rise nafta expands such exchange rising material living standards result from rising productivity to be more productive american businesses must produce more goods and services with given amounts of labor capital land and raw materials the only way workers can trade their labor for more real purchasing power is if their labor is more valuable that is if they produce more goods and services but to prosper we cannot simply produce more of the same old things the history of economic development over the past two centuries is one of creating new goods and services never before dreamt of this development included introduction and or mass production of everything from trains planes and automobiles to skyscrapers and assembly lines to penicillin anesthetics heart transplants to telephones radios and televisions microchips and personal computers the world s leading industrial countries are those that pioneer the new products how can we assure ourselves that america will remain on the economic cutting edge how can we give american entrepreneurs the strongest incentive to continue in our pioneer economic spirit how can we make america competitive in the future simple allow americans to compete by creating a huge free trade zone nafta will allow for a more efficient division of labor mexicans and americans respectively will put more resources into the production of goods and services at which they are most efficient the combination of greater competition and a larger market will help guarantee that america will remain the world s most productive economy reason 8 conservatives are optimists who seek to expand economic opportunity and not cower behind trade barriers the motivation of many opponents of nafta seems to be simply fear while none can demonstrate exactly what the dangers of freer trade are from nafta they want us to take their emotions as a reason to deny freedom of commerce to americans it is embarrassing to hear americans fear that they just can t compete but america is the one country in the world built on the attitude of optimism and the expectation of opportunity this country was settled by pioneers who risked everything to move to a new land faced physical dangers left countries that offered no avenues of advancement for a country that offered absolutely no guarantees but one the guarantee that every american be free from repressive government that every american be free to rise to whatever level they could through his own hard work and efforts and to trade freely based on mutual consent the result was the most prosperous country in the world again while some concerns about nafta are legitimate some fears manifestly are not nafta opponents should not fear free trade when america has the most productive economy in the world nafta opponents should not fear free trade when america is the largest exporter in the world nafta opponents should not fear free trade with a country whose economy is only one twentieth the size of america s nafta opponents should not fear free trade when the history of american enterprise when unshackled from government taxes and regulations is one of meeting and winning every economic challenge reason 9 conservatives understand that if this country abandons free trade and free markets it could indeed become a second rate power it is instructive to consider the example of argentina earlier in this century argentina was one of the top ten richest countries in the world its living standards were comparable to those in europe it is a country blessed with incredible natural resources for example the pampas which is one of the most fertile wheat and cattle producing parts of the world and its own oil reserves british investors built what was then a state of the art railroad it had power plants factories and other facilities but in the 1940s it followed the anti free trade anti foreign investment pro central planning approach of juan peron it closed its markets and over the decades it joined the ranks of less developed countries today argentina is engaged in a great national struggle to transform its economy and to rejoin the world market reason 10 conservatives understand that with nafta america can enter the 21st century as the preeminent economic power in an economically expanding hemisphere i conclude my talk by observing that america truly has the opportunity to enter the 21st century as the preeminent economic power in an economically expanding hemisphere nafta is an agreement that is good for america but it is an agreement that especially should be favored by conservatives nafta reflects the optimism that is basic to the american character and the search for opportunity that made america great and will make it greater still in the future if we abandon nafta republicans run the risk of ceding the intellectual high ground of free trade and allowing pat buchanan and ross perot to put a stamp of protectionism on the party but this party stands for ideas for individual freedom and for economic opportunity when reagan followed this formula the result was seven years of economic growth and prosperity we cannot abandon our principles and a winning formula for the purposes of an apparent political expediency that will politically damage our party and our country in the future 1995 persimmon it inc

per diluted share profitability in both our csi solar and global energy businesses improved meaningfully as we continued to focus on solidifying our leadership position and driving profitable growth our team executed across the board and made q3 one of our strongest quarters since the beginning of covid as always yan ismael and huifeng will go through our performance in more detail before that let me highlight some key messages please turn to slide 4 first we made significant progress in our battery storage business across all our verticals this includes csi solar s utility scale and residential battery storage product teams and our global energy s battery storage project development fees our csi solar side we continue to be pleased with the level of engagement of our solbank products for utility scale storage applications which we launched a few months ago yesterday we announced a new 2 6 gigawatt hour multiyear supply agreement this underscores the very healthy demand we are seeing and our favorable competitive position we will continue to provide updates for our contracted pipeline as we move forward i m also very pleased with the positive customer response to csi solar s residential energy storage product the epq this was showcased during the re conference in the us and we expect this to be a multiyear contributor for our sales our global energy team supported by our csi energy storage team made significant progress in competing one of the largest battery storage project in the world with 1 4 gigawatt hour crimson project i m very pleased to report that the global energy team continued to expand the storage pipeline reaching 40 gigawatt hour at the end of q3 when you take a step back you can clearly see that battery storage has become a very strong growth driver for our business our customers are excited about the of battery storage solutions and we are excited about the growth opportunity behind of us second the us remains one of our core markets and we are strongly committed to service our customers and the passengers there we believe the us will remain as one of the most important and attractive clean energy market in the world efforts in the us to decarbonize and the passing of the inflation reduction act have provided important lessons for other countries in our common fight against climate change with that in mind we are planning on investing in us domestic manufacturing across the solar supply chain we have expanded our us fleet in preparation and are now in the final stages of our site selection process well there are many challenges we know the market well we are proud of our 20 years of market leadership we are confident in our ability to build upon our long term track record and expand the level of support to our customers and partners in the us even further with the planned us domestic manufacturing activity lastly please turn to the next slide after a short procedural path csi solar s carve out ipo is back on track and is awaiting the completion of the registration with the china securities regulatory commission while the process has taken longer than we initially expected we are on track and working to complete the carve out within q4 or in q1 next year with that let me now turn over to yan who will provide details on our csi solar business yan please go ahead yan zhuang thank you shawn please turn to slide six in q3 the csi solar division delivered six gigawatts of solar module shipments and 570 megawatt hour of battery storage shipments of which 300 megawatt hour were to our own projects total revenue reached close to 2 billion and importantly our gross margin continued to improve reaching 17 3 in q3 this was up 140 basis points quarter over quarter and from an absolute standpoint doubled year over year to 341 million several factors contributed to our improved performance first our manufacturing costs declined further in q3 led by an increased contribution from the expanded upstream ingot wafer and cell capacity with a higher degree of vertical integration and greater control over our costs and supply chain we ve been able to improve our cost structure and profitability this is in line with the strategy we previously outlined and while we did a great job controlling what is within our control input costs remained a headwind in q3 in fact average polysilicon pricing remained at elevated levels and was flat or even slightly higher than the previous quarter as you can see on slide 7 so the improvement was mostly organic we believe polysilicon prices have finally reached a peak and we expect input costs may start to come down over the next few weeks although we won t really see a benefit until probably next year given the strength in end market demand we still believe input costs will only come down gradually second our gross margin benefited from currency fluctuations led by the strong us dollar relative to the rmb with a large part of our costs being rmb relative to a large part of our revenues in us dollar our costs depreciated relative to our revenues however this was partially offset by the weakness in most other currencies relative to the us dollar net net the asps of all our non usd markets were lower sequentially which had an impact on our aggregate revenue number third unit shipping costs came down further in q3 as we said before there is significant room for logistic costs to come down which we started to see in q2 we believe there is further room for improvement given we re still above historical normal levels and there is no reason to believe that logistics costs are structurally higher than pre covid times please note that logistics costs do not impact gross margin and are recorded in selling and distribution expenses all of these factors combined helped drive a tripling of our operating profit year over year to 97 million q3 was a record quarter for csi solar which showed the strength of our brand and resilience of our business despite the top market environment please turn to slide 8 on the technology front we re making significant progress on our latest n type topcon cell technology as you know we ve been working on several n type pilot lines covering both heterojunction and topcon technologies we believe the time is right for mass production and therefore all of the new cell capacity we re now adding will use our topcon technology the first topcon products will be delivered early next year we believe our product is best in class and will have approximately 1 5 percentage points of higher conversion efficiency than the average mainstream product in the market today topcon will also be margin accretive once we start production it was developed to contribute positively to our pricing power due to its ability to lower our customers levelized cost of electricity meanwhile our growth is for manufacturing costs for topcon to be similar to our current mainstream product even though the power wattage will be much higher we expect n type topcon cell products to account for roughly 30 of our 2023 solar module shipments please turn to slide 9 in terms of battery storage we re on track to achieve our full year target of 1 8 to 1 9 gigawatt hours our new utility scale solbank product is gaining significant traction with customers we recently signed a 2 6 gigawatt hour multiyear supply agreement with ubs for the us market with solbank product this gives us significant visibility over our long term growth beyond just one or two years we ve also been expanding our market offering across more geographies expanding from the us into uk canada and china with more markets currently under expansion one of our key competitive advantages is our strong partnerships with upstream battery cell producers which helps ensure long term security of supply for our customers with that our csi solar s battery storage turnkey pipeline more than doubled quarter over quarter at nearly 25 gigawatt hour globally as of the end of q3 while certain projects in this pipeline overlap with global energy storage development pipeline the value creation and services provided by the two storage teams are distinct and separate and therefore the two storage pipelines should be viewed independently on the residential ep cube product reception from the customers during the re conference was overwhelmingly positive and the initial shipments to the us market are already underway we re confident that ep cube is one of the best easiest to install products in the market we are excited about this product and believe it will be highly competitive residential solution now let me pass it on to ismael for an overview of the global energy business ismael please go ahead ismael guerrero thanks yan please turn to slide 10 in q3 we achieved 101 million in revenue with a 47 in gross margin making this a highly profitable quarter for us we sold around 890 megawatts of projects in japan the us and brazil which were mostly preconstruction and earlier stage projects which meant relatively lower revenues at higher profitability recently we had two major project completion milestones which i m incredibly proud of please turn to slide 11 the first one is the commercial operation of our landmark 1 4 gigawatt hours standalone battery storage project in california the crimson project we completed this project in a very challenging environment of a stringent covid restrictions which affected shipping schedules and led to project delays however we cooperated closely with our csi solar energy storage colleagues to bring this project to fruition which is a testament of the synergies created among our business divisions the crimson project will provide critical reliability services to the california grid and allow the local grid to absorb more clean energy we monetized 80 of the project to a long term investment partner and retained a 20 long term ownership meanwhile we will continue to provide the operations and maintenance of the battery storage power plant we are also expanding our capability in energy trading through this project which we believe will be a key area of growth in the future please turn to slide 12 the other major project completion is the commercial operation of our other flagship project in japan the azuma kofuji 100 megawatt solar power plant the project is under jpy 36 fit roughly equivalent to us 0 24 per kilowatt hour based on current exchange rates making it one of the world s most valuable projects however what i m most proud of is that the project will contribute meaningfully to reinvigorate the local community and economy which was devastated by the earthquake in 2011 this project is still fully owned by canadian solar i highlight these two projects not to emphasize the uniqueness but to show canadian solar s unparalleled track record in executing complex solar and battery storage projects across the world we have one of the world s largest and strongest development platforms and our goal is to develop more battery storage projects like crimson and more solar projects like azuma kofuji turning to slide 13 as of september 30 2022 we had a total solar project pipeline of 25 gigawatts and a total battery storage pipeline of 40 gigawatts hours this is the largest solar and battery storage pipeline in the world importantly around half of our total pipeline has interconnection secured which gives us significant confidence of our future ability to create value and growth that said you ll also notice that our solar pipeline declined slightly quarter over quarter as you know canadian solar is more than just size we prioritize the quality and profitability of the pipeline we are building we are selective on the projects that we decide to move ahead with and we are not afraid of walk away from projects with less attractive risk return profile specifically the combination of high inflation and high interest rates over the past few quarters related in adverse environment in some geographies thus we invested of certain assets early and recovered our capital to set the stage to invest and grow in geographies with stronger fundamentals it is important to note that we have delivered strong results through the challenging backdrop which shows the residence and strong performance of global energy s world class platform please turn to slide 14 lastly our strategy to increase the share of recurring income remains on track on the operations and maintenance or o m strategy we now manage over 3 6 gigawatts of operational projects under long term o m agreements we also have an additional 2 2 gigawatts of contracted projects expected to reach commercial operations soon this makes us one of the largest project operators in the world in both solar and battery storage and we will continue to grow this business we will also continue to retain minority ownership in assets that we developed now let me turn the call over to our cfo who will go through the financial results in more detail huifeng please go ahead see also 12 best performing dividend stocks and 12 most advanced countries in science huifeng chang thank you ismael please turn to slide 15 in q3 we delivered 1 93 billion in revenue up 57 year over year gross margin was 18 8 well ahead of our guidance of 15 to 16 5 q3 benefited from lower manufacturing costs a net foreign exchange benefit from the strength of the us dollar relative to most other currencies and higher margin project sales selling and distribution expenses were up 5 sequentially primarily due to higher shipping expenses from the increase in shipping volume however unit shipping costs decreased and we expect further decreases in the coming quarters general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a nonrecurring 30 million impairment of certain aged manufacturing assets net interest income in the third quarter was 4 million up from net interest expense of 15 million in the prior quarter the change was mainly driven by a onetime interest benefit of 17 million which we received as interest income generated by antidumping and conveying duty deposit refunds the net foreign exchange and a derivative gain was 39 million compared to 6 million in q2 the benefit was driven by the strong us dollar relative to most other currencies but mainly related to r d total net income was 102 million and a net income attributable to canadian solar shareholders was 78 million this translates to base eps of 1 22 and a diluted eps of 1 12 the variance is primarily due to the adjustment for the dilutive effect of our outstanding convertible notes now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet next slide please in q3 the net capex payment was approximately 110 million making it approximately 320 million for the first nine months of 2022 given the delay in the ipo process we are reducing our full year 2022 capex expectations to 650 million from 850 million please note that this does not imply any changes to our capacity expansion projects but rather an adjustment in the time line and the pace of implementation of these projects we ended q3 with a total cash balance of nearly 2 billion and remain well positioned to capture future growth total debt was a large unchanged at 2 7 billion but the share of our long term debt increased to 45 from 40 this time last year 12 months trailing net debt to ebitda excluding restrict cash continued to decline this quarter to 2 7 times from 2 9 times the prior quarter now let me turn the call back to shawn who will conclude with our guidance and the business outlook shawn please go ahead shawn qu thanks huifeng let s turn to slide 17 for the fourth quarter of 2022 we expect total revenue to be in the range of 1 8 billion to 1 9 billion gross margin is expected to be between 16 to 18 this reflects the elevated import costs in q4 partially offset by benefit from manufacturing cost reductions continued foreign exchange volatility may affect pricing and margin also for q4 solar module shipment recognized in revenue by csi solar are expected to be in a range of 6 to 6 3 gigawatts including approximately 290 megawatt through our own projects for the full year of 2022 we expect csi solar s total battery storage shipment to be in the range of 1 8 to 1 9 gigawatt hours including approximately 300 megawatt hour through the company s own projects global energy project sales are expected to be in the range of 2 2 to 2 3 gigawatt we are also introducing solar module shipment guideline for next year for 2023 we expect solar module shipments to be in the range of 30 to 35 gigawatts which represents approximately 56 year over year growth at the midpoint canadian solar s strategy of profitable growth is one of our key differentiators or continue to prioritize investing in long term growth which is positioning our business in strategic areas such as battery storage and leading in the deployment of technology innovation this differentiates our products at value for our customers and partners and is a key driver for our brand equity worldwide all in all we re continuing to focus on what we can control and on building our long term competitive mode to create lasting value for our shareholders with that i would now like to open the call to your questions operator q a session follow canadian solar inc nasdaq csiq follow canadian solar inc nasdaq csiq or subscribe with google we may use your email to send marketing emails about our services click here to read our privacy policy operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from the line of brian lee with goldman sachs please proceed with your question brian lee hey guys thanks for taking the questions i guess i had a couple just around the guidance shawn huifeng you mentioned that gross margins the guidance for q4 implies a little bit of sequential decline it sounded like input costs logistics polysilicon all of that is sort of trending in the right direction so could you kind of walk us through what specifically is changing quarter on quarter to drive a little bit of a margin decline into the fourth quarter and then also how you re thinking about that translating into sort of the early part of 2023 what trends we should expect on the gross margin line shawn qu brian i would like to first of all i d like to mention that our q4 gross margin guidance is higher than our q3 gross margin guidance however we did a wonderful spectacular q3 we achieved 18 8 and we now guided 16 to 18 gross margin for q4 so in terms of guidance our forecast our q4 actually is we are guiding higher than our q3 guidance i just wanted to mention that now i would like yan to provide more color right yan zhuang hey brian it s yan first of all i want to say that in terms of net growth i mean gross margin i m talking about price minus manufacturing costs and yes q4 is not anything less than q3 so that is stable it s more like we believe there s for example we do not expect a similar level of currency gain for q4 so that s one of that so shawn want to have more comments brian lee well that s helpful color i can take that question offline and maybe we ll dive more into the moving pieces maybe on that same topic though pricing is the first time i think in a while where module asps look like they have come down a little bit and i think you mentioned that in your commentary as well can you kind of talk about your quoting activity are you starting to lower prices on modules and what s your sort of view on module asps through 4q as well as into 2023 yan zhuang yeah so brian actually for q4 our asp is quite stable comparing to q4 we do not see any material price reduction from q3 to q4 there might be for some customers some order in some markets we see some minor reduction but it s not significant in terms of 2023 we re already signing a lot of orders for next year we also see some price reduction on some long term orders but it s not significant it s 0 01 or 0 02 lower than what it is today so that s the current price situation but moving forward we still believe the price production moving into 2023 it s going to be more moderate and smooth in the longer transition period so the reason for that is as we do we all know that the end market is still growing rapidly
the history of computer memory early data storage part 1 by dr david maddison one of the most critical technological advances driving the widespread adoption of computers has been smaller faster higher capacity memory chips it didn t start with semiconductors and ics though memory has been around in various forms for a long time this two part series will investigate how it started and grew into what we have today emory is one of the most m important and commonly discussed elements of a computer these days computer memory size is measured in gigabytes or even terabytes while huge cheap memory capacities are taken for granted early computers had tiny memories because integrated circuit technology had not yet been developed and storing even one byte was expensive and complicated for one byte eight zero or one values need to be stored so something had to be duplicated eight times without integrated circuits whatever was used to store that information was expensive and big note that there are and have been systems that use bytes with fewer or more than eight bits but eight is the most common number in this two part series we will focus mainly on primary memory the working memory of the computer 12 silicon chip for temporary storage rather than secondary memory used for long term storage such as hard disks however the distinction wasn t always clear in early computers which also lacked convenient input and output systems hence we will discuss technologies like punched cards and paper tape that were used for both primary and secondary storage secondary storage may be the subject of another article bits and bytes one byte is the unit of digital information typically used to encode a character such as the ascii 1977 character set members which includes the letters and numerals a z a z 0 9 punctuation and special characters ascii is a 7 bit encoding scheme that represents 128 printing and non printing characters australia s electronics magazine extended ascii not an official name uses 8 bits and has 256 characters with extended foreign language characters symbols line drawing characters etc the exact set of symbols depends on various proprietary implementations or standards like iso iec 8859 that has largely been supplanted now by unicode see panel still with this system one character is stored in one byte five bits is the minimum amount of storage necessary to represent the alphabet however with just five bits all 26 letters could be represented in one case upper or lower but not all numbers so most 5 bit character code sets could switch between letters ltrs and numbers figs allowing 60 letters characters and other codes to be used see table 1 today a byte usually consists of eight bits represented by 0 or 1 and siliconchip com au in the range 0 decimal or 00000000 binary to 255 decimal or 11111111 binary however past computers have used fewer such as 6 bit codes to represent 64 characters other byte sizes are also used for addresses and number representation in modern computers in cpus or gpus graphics processing units such as 16 32 64 128 256 bits and beyond these architectures usually still group data in multiples of 8 bit bytes you might have noticed a discrepancy between the stated size of a disk drive and the size reported by the computer operating system that depends upon if the size is counted in decimal or binary one kilobyte is 1000 bytes in decimal notation or 1024 bytes 210 in binary notation while one gigabyte is one billion bytes 1 000 000 000 in decimal notation or 1 073 741 824 bytes 230 in binary notation this represents a difference of 7 3 for gigabytes or 10 for terabytes it is done this way because for a computer indexing into a large file is much more easily done in power oftwo chunks like 1024 than decimal sizes like 1000 this discrepancy has resulted in new terms such as kibibyte kib 1024 bytes mebibyte mib 1 048 576 bytes gibibyte gib 1 073 741 824 bytes etc while it might seem more confusing at the moment the introduction of these terms is an attempt to reduce confusion about memory sizes memory devices the idea of using some device to input or store data or instructions of a variable nature is not new and has its origins in the form of punched paper tape or cards as follows 1725 weaving looms were controlled using paper tape programs with punched holes a system developed by basile bouchon of lyon france 1804 joseph marie jacquard also of lyon developed a loom control system using punched cards 1832 semyon korsakov st petersburg russia proposed using punched cards for information search and retrieval 1837 charles babbage london uk proposed using punched cards for inputting data and instructions to his never completed by him analytical engine the

smaller cards specify the mathematical operations to be performed while the larger cards hold numerical variables source cc by 2 0 computer it was mechanical rather than electronic since electronic technology was still in its infancy it still contained all the elements of a modern computer see fig 1 ibm punch ed cards for over half a century the world s most common medium for information storage was the once ubiquitous ibm punched card they have a fascinating and long history but we do not have space to cover it all here so we will just mention the highlights punched cards were not developed for computers which did not yet exist but for machines that tabulated data the ibm card originated with herman hollerith new york usa in the 1880s and 1890s who used them in mechanical tabulating machines these electromechanical machines were used to summarise information encoded on punched cards such as census data see figs 2 3 hollerith s company eventually became part of ibm and the machine became a core product the tabulating machine was not a computer but it could perform some the unicode standard unicode is an international character set with 149 186 characters and symbols as of version 15 0 in current use before unicode every different language required a distinct code page making mixing different languages virtually impossible and leading to much confusion unicode solves this by bringing all the characters needed for human languages together in one set clearly you can t encode that many characters in a single byte therefore in modern computer memory systems characters are generally encoded as variable length byte strings providing backward compatibility with existing single byte character sets like ascii there are several valid unicode encoding schemes probably the most common is utf 8 where a unicode character that s also part of the ascii set is encoded as a single byte with its top bit as 0 other characters or symbols are encoded as multiple bytes up to four where the first byte has its top bit set to 1 other schemes that are part of the standard include utf16 utf 32 and bom australia s electronics magazine january 2023 13 fig 2 a replica of an 1890 model hollerith punched card tabulating machine used to process data from the 1890 us census source ccby 2 0 mathematical operations group data and print results the first ibm card had 22 columns and eight rows punch positions by 1900 they had 24 columns and 10 rows and by the late 1920s 45 columns and 12 rows in 1928 a new version of the card was introduced with 80 columns and 10 rows see fig 4 they moved to 12 rows in 1930 those punched cards are the likely reason that early alphanumeric computer monitors had 80 columns the cards measured 7 ⅜ inches by 3 ¼ inches or 187 3mm 82 5mm these dimensions were that of us paper currency from 1862 1923 the ibm card had many incidental uses besides computers they were often used for taking notes and making dot points for presentations as they fitted the inside pocket of a suit jacket ibm was not the only manufacturer of punched cards or equipment to read and write them but they became known by that name people may laugh at punched cards today but like books if stored correctly the data will be readable with the naked eye far into the future however data stored on cds magnetic disks and the like may deteriorate over time disc rot or become unreadable due to a lack of software and hardware support punched paper tape fig 3 a hollerith punched card from about 1895 the predecessor of the ibm card source public domain fig 4 an ibm

similar to cards but can be kept on long rolls sometimes formed into a loop rather than on individual cards it was invented in 1725 by basile bouchon to control looms but that was impractical at the time like punched cards punched paper tape was used for various applications in the 19th and 20th centuries such as programmable looms telegraphy systems cnc machine tools and computer data input and storage from the 1940s including military code breaking during ww2 see fig 5 through to the early 1970s data stored on tape was also used as read only memory rom for computers tougher versions of the tape for industrial use were made with mylar like cards paper tape has the advantage of being able to be read by eye and is long lasting if used and stored correctly paper tape was usually 0 1mm thick

could store 10 characters per inch 25 4mm a standard teletype roll was 1000 feet long 305m so it could store up to 120kbytes but most tapes were much shorter than that as many contemporary computers couldn t handle that much data several different encoding schemes were used starting with baudot s from the 1870s it was developed for telegraphs and used five holes five bits in 1901 the baudot scheme was modified to create the murray code that included carriage return cr and line feed lf see fig 6 western union used that until the 1950s they modified it by adding control codes a space and a bell bel symbol to ring a bell 1924 the western union code was used by the international telecommunications union ccit as the basis of the international telegraph alphabet no 2 ita2 a version of which was adopted by the usa and called tty tty was used until 1963 all of the former systems used 5 bit codes after which 7 bit ascii was adopted there were also some encoding schemes that used six bits the ibm selective sequence electronic calculator was an electromechanical machine that operated from 1948 to 1952 see fig 7 it used uncut ibm card stock to create tapes that were 7 375 inches 18 73cm wide and the length of an ibm punched card joined end to end each of the 80 columns could contain a signed 19 digit number with parity bits plus two rows for side sprockets the tape s typically contained large mathematical tables with multiple readers and up to 36 tapes they could be searched in about one second there were another 30 readers for program data the rolls could be continuous or looped a full roll weighed 400lb 181kg about 400 000 characters could be stored on the tapes the machine also used ibm punched cards it gave ibm excellent publicity and was the basis for many

memory of unknown capacity above it source gnu fdl jordan filed a patent entitled improvements in ionic relays and received british patent 148 582 in 1920 see fig 8 siliconchip au link abhs while not intended for computer memory electronic computers had not yet been invented it was to become the basis of later computer memory it comprised two valves vacuum tubes that could exist together in one of two stable states it was originally called the eccles jordan trigger circuit the trigger circuit or a multi vibrator but today it is known as a flip flop the ability for a flip flop to exist in either of two stable states representing a 0 or 1 is the basis of some computer memory today such as sram static random access memory see the 1963 entry later and cpu registers 1932 austrian gustav tauschek invented magnetic drum memory in 1932 which became a widely used form of primary computer memory ram in the 1950s and 1960s how was this device invented before the first programmable digital computer it was initially devised to record data from punched card machines and then was adopted for early computers tauschek s original device from 1932 had a capacity of 500 000 bits or 62 5kbytes as the name implies drum memory consists of a drum coated with magnetic material several read and write heads are mounted along the length of the drum drum memory initially displaced crt and delay line memory see below because it was more reliable magnetic core memory gradually replaced drum memory for primary storage keyboard drum decimal to binary conversion drum capacitor counter drum decimal card reader carry over drum motor drum memory was also used for secondary semi permanent storage and in this role drums were eventually replaced by floppy disk drives starting in the early 1970s one of the latest known uses of drum memory is in us minuteman icbm launch site computers until the mid 1990s fig 9 shows drum memory from the 1953 swedish besk computer and magnetic core memory from the

this was the first computer to use regenerative capacitor drum memory not to be confused with tauschek s drum memory mentioned above regenerative capacitor memory uses individual capacitors to store memory bits they are either charged or discharged to represent a 1 or 0 because capacitors discharge with time they constantly need to be refreshed much like some other forms of memory such as dram to be discussed next month the abc computer had two drums that stored 1500 bits each thirty 50 bit numbers which rotated at 60 rpm the capacitors were refreshed on every rotation the abc computer if it is accepted as such was the first computing machine to use flip flop memory of the type described above by eccles and jordan you can see a fascinating video about how the abc works on youtube the atanasoff berry computer in operation yyxgibtms9e 1943 the british colossus code breaking computer is regarded as the world s first programmable digital computer see fig 5 it was the first device universally accepted as a computer to use the flip flop design from eccles and jordan the flip flops were implemented with vacuum tubes as transistors had not yet been invented they were used for counting and logical operations as the computer had no memory except the paper tape loop mentioned earlier 1945 the first programmable general purpose digital computer was eniac used for artillery calculations by the us military it started with 20 words of system memory or about 80 bytes in the form of accumulators extra data was stored on ibm punched cards a 100 word magnetic core memory unit was added in 1953 words are of variable size for different computers for eniac a word was ten binary coded decimal digits in length at a time before eight bit bytes were standardised most modern

counter comprises a system of flip flops and a shift register with the output of the last flip flop fed to the first to make a ring a pm p for positive and m for negative counter circuit was also used to store the sign of the number one pm counter and 10 ring counters made up an accumulator 1946 development work on the selectron tube fig 11 fig 12 was started by jan a rajchman at rca this vacuum tube stored digital memory data in the form of electrostatic charges similar to the williams kilburn tube discussed next the original design was for 4096 bits but that was too difficult to build so a 256 bit form was made the device was never a commercial success both it and the williams kilburn were superseded by magnetic core memory which was more reliable cheaper and easier to manufacture australia s electronics magazine the basic principle of operation is shown in fig 12 electrons are emitted from the heated cathodes at the top of the diagram like an electron gun but not a point source each cathode is surrounded by four selection bars two each running in one direction and two at right angles to those the selection bars adjacent to the cathode corresponding to the selected bit are activated to address a particular bit electrons move from the cathode through the collector plate and toward the storage area which consists of eyelets like those on some shoes but much smaller embedded in a sheet of insulating mica with a metal backing called the writing plate the eyelets are insulated by the mica sheet but capacitively coupled to the writing plate by pulsing or not the writing plate at the same time as electrons are moving toward the selected eyelet storage location as determined by the selection bars the eyelet can either be charged or not thus writing the data to be stored if the pulse is the same potential january 2023 17 fig 13 a williams kilburn tube from an ibm 701 at the computer history museum in mountain view california usa source wiki 5xrf cc by sa 3 0

as the collector plate electrons will pass through the collector plate and charge the eyelet downward facing arrows on the left of the diagram if the potential is the same as the cathode electrons will be blocked and not charge the eyelet thus the eyelet can be in one of two states for reading the data out electrons from the cathodes will either pass through an eyelet or be inhibited from passing through to the reading plate depending on its charge state by selecting an eyelet using the selection bars and pulsing the reading plate the signal from the output grid will indicate whether it is charged after passing through the reading plate electrons go through holes in a faraday cage and strike a phosphor screen this causes the phosphor to glow indicating the contents of individual

tube was patented in the uk and us in late 1946 1947 and 1949 it was the first fully electronic and thus high speed memory using a crt cathode ray tube for storage the fact that crts were used this way was mentioned briefly in our article on display technology in the september 2022 issue page 18 middle column siliconchip au article 15458 this type of memory was first used to run a computer program in 1948 simply put a williams kilburn tube fig 13 stores memory on a crt by writing a dot pattern representing the data to be stored fig 14 as with any crt the image has a certain persistence but eventually fades away therefore it must constantly be refreshed by each bit being periodically read and re written similar to dram a small charge of static electricity appears above each dot which fades over a fraction of a second it is this charge that gives the tube persistent storage so writing a one to the display involves steering the electron beam to a specific position and delivering electrons from the gun to allow the charge to build up to write a zero the charge at the dot must be neutralised this is done by drawing a second adjacent dot or line australia s electronics magazine because a negative halo is generated around each dot this eliminates the positive charge of the first dot nearby reading the state of a bit is done with the aid of a thin metal plate on top of the viewing screen the electron beam is steered to that location and energised just like writing a one if a one was already present there is no change in the charge at that location so no current flows through that metal plate but if there was previously a zero writing the one will cause a detectable current to flow the williams kilburn tube was susceptible to external influences mainly from electric fields so frequent adjustments were required for error free operation some notable uses of the tube were the ibm 701 ibm s first electronic digital computer from 1952 it had 72 3 inch williams kilburn tubes each having a capacity of 1024 bits giving a total memory of 2048 words each having 36 bits the memory could optionally be expanded to 4096 words another use was maniac i mathematical analyzer numerical integrator and automatic computer model i fig 15 at the los alamos national laboratory which used 40 2 inch tubes to store 1024 40 bit numbers for hydrogen bomb calculations and it became fully operational in 1952 1947 frederick viehe filed for us patent 2 992 414 for magnetic core memory fig 16 in 1947 although it wasn t awarded until much later in 1961 he filed another related patent in 1962 us3264713 awarded in 1966 magnetic core memory was the dominant form of computer memory from about 1955 to 1975 incredibly viehe was a los angeles pavement inspector who played with magnetics as a hobby he was not a professional scientist or engineer ibm eventually purchased his patents core memory uses tiny toroids of magnetic material wired as simple transformers by passing a current through wires that go through the toroid it can be magnetised in one direction or the other thus storing a bit of information a sense wire passing through the core detects if the toroid has changed state reading the data magnetic polarity is a destructive process causing the bit to be set to zero to read a bit of data an attempt is made to flip a siliconchip com au bit nothing happens if it is a zero if it is a one the toroid changes polarity inducing a pulse in the sense line the information is retained even when the power is turned off a piece of magnetic core memory is one of the most desirable items in any collection of electronic ephemera they are fine examples of delicate manual construction and are almost works of art other claimants to this invention were an wang 1949 us patent 2 708 722 awarded in 1955 jan rajchman 1950 and jay forrester 1951 there were many intellectual property disputes over it in 1964 ibm paid mit where jay forrester worked us 13 million for his patent a substantial amount of money at the time core memory eventually obtained a volumetric density of about 900 bits per litre and the cost went down from about 1 per bit to 1c per bit the beginning of the end for core memory was when intel introduced the 1103 dram ic in 1970 costing 1c per bit while core memory is obsolete computer memory is sometimes still referred to as core a file containing the contents of memory from when a program was running is still often referred to as a core dump 1947 j p eckert and j w mauchly applied for us patent 2 629 827 for the mercury delay line and other forms of delay line in 1947 awarded in 1953 the mercury delay line is a member of various delay line based memory devices delay line memories work by sending acoustic electrical or light pulses representing one bit along a path when a pulse gets to the end of the path it has to be refreshed by reshaping and amplifying it it is then recirculated such memory is accessed by waiting for the desired bit in the pulse train to arrive at the read mechanism at a predictable time the memory capacity is therefore determined by the length of the mechanism the length of pulses and the speed of sound or similar in the medium mercury metal a liquid at room temperature was a common medium used in early computers the resulting devices had a memory capacity of a few thousand bits j p eckert originally developed mercury delay lines to reduce clutter in radar return signals during ww2 siliconchip com au fig 15 the aptly named maniac i computer from 1952 the

impedance is similar to that of piezoelectric quartz acoustic transducers thus minimising energy loss the speed of sound is also very high in mercury compared to certain other media meaning there is less time to wait for a pulse to arrive mercury delay lines were challenging to design due to the need to ensure there were no stray reflections they were tricky to set up and maintain as they required very tight tolerances the univac i computer mentioned below was an early computer that used mercury delay lines 1949 csirac was australia s first programmable digital computer and the fifth in the world it is the oldest preserved first generation computer its primary memory was a mercury delay line with a capacity of 768 20 bit words and a supplemental disk like device of 4096 word capacity some of the delay lines were 10mm in diameter 150cm long and a pulse took 960µs to go from one end to the other fig 17 you can see the computer on display at scienceworks in melbourne

version of the era 1101 computer later renamed the univac 1101 was the first computer to store and run programs from electronically accessible memory as opposed to instructions that were hard wired or read from tape or cards the military version was known as the era atlas 1951 magnetic tape drives on computers were first used on the univac i computer fig 18 the drive unit was the remington rand uniservo i fig 19 which used half inch wide metal tape 12 7mm in 1200ft 366m lengths the metal tape and reels weighed 25lbs 11 3kg the tape had six data channels plus one for parity and another for timing and had a density of 128 bits per inch each tape could hold 1 440 000 seven bit characters later versions of these drives used plastic mylar tape which became the industry standard the ibm

ferroelectricity is a property of certain materials with an electric polarisation state that can be reversed by applying an electric field the state is kept even without the continued application of the electric field the two states can be used to store binary information 1952 the ibm 726 computer was introduced it was the first computer to use magnetic particle coated plastic tape for storage see fig 20 and visit siliconchip au link abhu it could read or write 12 500 characters per second and each tape had a capacity of two million characters the tape was about half an inch 12 7mm wide and

the storage density was 100 bits per inch and tapes were up to 1200ft 366m long 1953 the first transistor computer originated at the university of manchester there were several experimental designs from 1953 culminating with a commercial design in 1956 by a manchester company with the computer called the metrovick 950 only a small number were built early transistor computers may have used valves for the clock and other functions possibly the first fully transistor computer was the harwell cadet from 1955 but there were several other early claimants philco shipped commercial transistor computers the s 1000 and s 2000 in 1958 the rca 501 and the ibm 7070 are also from 1958 the tradic for transistor digital computer or transistorized airborne digital computer was an early us transistor based computer used on the b 52 bomber it had 684 bell labs type 1734 type a cartridge transistors and 10 358 germanium point contact diodes it also used one valve in the power supply early transistor computers used drum memory or magnetic core memory not transistor circuits as memory elements however transistors were used as registers for cpus and amplifiers for magnetic core memory diodes were used in arrays as a form of rom read only memory 1955 the konrad zuse z22 was the first commercial computer to use magnetic core memory 14 words of 38 bits as well as magnetic drum memory 8192 38 bit words it also used paper tape and had 600 vacuum tubes 1957 bell labs introduced twistor memory in 1957 first used in 1965 it comprised a piece of magnetic tape wrapped around a current carrying wire and was similar in operation to magnetic core memory it saw limited use however the ideas were incorporated into bubble memory described next month 1958 the ferranti sirius magnetostrictive delay line was introduced see fig 21 it used the magnetostrictive effect whereby a material changes its shape in response to a magnetic field a long coil of magnetostrictive material

the world s leading economists spent most of 2022 convincing themselves that if the global economy was not already in a recession it was about to fall into one but with the year s end the global slump has been postponed to 2023 clearly the reports that the united states was in recession during the first half of the year were premature especially given how tight the us labor market is and despite the confidence with which many again proclaim the inevitability of a downturn the chances of one in the coming year are well below 100 percent but owing to the rapid interest rate hikes by the us federal reserve and other major central banks there is something like a 50 percent chance of a recession in 2023 and a 75 percent chance of it happening at some point during the next two years europe hit hard by soaring energy prices is more likely to head into a recession which conventional wisdom defines as two consecutive quarters of gross domestic product decline china however seems to be in even worse shape it has the same problems as europe plus a collapsing property sector and a surge in covid 19 cases owing to the chinese government s recent decision to reopen the economy without a sufficient vaccination push while china s growth next year is expected to be far slower than the historic pace it has become accustomed to over the past four decades it is unlikely that its gdp will contract for two quarters after all even an 8 percentage point decrease in chinese gdp growth during the peak of the 2008 global financial crisis was not enough to cause its domestic output to shrink in absolute terms this is yet another example of the flaws in defining recession by the rule of two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth moreover many countries current economic woes are self inflicted owing to policy errors that have been as harmful as they were predictable between 2011 and 2021 for example europe needlessly deepened its dependence on russian natural gas leaving it exceedingly vulnerable when the kremlin launched its war against ukraine likewise china s draconian zero covid policy came at a high economic cost while the absence of a plan for how to ease pandemic restrictions meant that china s containment strategy merely postponed covid 19 mortalities the us for its part has made numerous mistakes including willingly relinquishing its leadership of the liberal international order and ignoring the world trade organization and the trade frameworks that its members had negotiated over many years former president donald trump s tariffs were wrong yet president joe biden has done little to reverse them in fact the buy american provisions in his otherwise laudable inflation reduction act flout wto rules while the expected adverse effects of higher interest rates are not yet evident there are signs that the everything bubble has finally burst us stock prices peaked in january 2021 and have been trending downward since bonds real estate and emerging market assets are all down for the year as well in july 2021 i argued that there was a 90 percent chance that the asset bubbles dominating financial markets would burst historically high valuations relative to dividends earnings or incomes were an obvious indicator although real and even nominal interest rates were zero or negative this time last year a low discount rate meant that virtually any asset price level could be rationalized as the present discounted value of future income this year began with four kinds of assets more clearly screaming i am a bubble meme stocks like gamestop cryptocurrencies non fungible tokens and special purpose acquisition companies each was innovative although not necessarily in a good way and all collapsed by the end of the year but should savvy investors see these declines as opportunities and buy the dip given that stock prices are not yet back to where they were three years ago on the eve of the pandemic it is reasonable to assume that they might fall further before they are in line with economic fundamentals the same might be said of cryptocurrencies which have no fundamental value whatever while next year will be rough for the world economy the coming slump probably should not qualify as a recession even considering that the criterion of two consecutive quarters is too narrow global growth in the postwar period has seldom fallen below zero for a single quarter let alone two by that measure the severe oil shock induced downturns of 1974 and 1981 do not qualify as global recessions even in times of apparent recession positive growth among emerging and developing economies tends to outweigh advanced economies negative growth the two notable exceptions being the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 covid 19 crisis while the organization for economic cooperation and development and international monetary fund expect global growth to plunge to 2 2 2 7 percent in 2023 from 6 1 percent in 2021 that still leaves the world economy unlikely to shrink for consecutive quarters even if we adopt less strict measures of defining a global recession such as a decline of gdp growth below 2 5 percent a 2023 global recession is hardly a foregone conclusion is it possible of course but it is also entirely avoidable jeffrey frankel jeffrey frankel a professor of capital formation and growth at harvard

rental reality arkansas tenants still burdened with rising costs after covid 10 shutdown december 26 january 1 2023 as the rising mortgage prices delay new home buyers from entering the housing market low income and working families in arkansas and across the u s are also facing similar high costs in the rental space according to an american community survey aca report by the u s census bureau over 19 million u s renter households spent more than 30 of their income on housing costs in 2021 that report which is culled from u s census estimates over the past fives years considers households as cost burdened when they spend more than 30 of their income on rent mortgage and other housing needs the burden was especially high in some of the nation s largest counties where housing is more expensive or in areas where incomes are low including over 30 counties in arkansas where renters spend more than 30 of their income on their monthly housing needs for example lee county in the arkansas delta has the highest cost burden in the state with a median housing cost ratio for renters is 50 aca data shows one of the least populated counties in arkansas lee county has only 776 rental units out of the 2767 housing dwellings over the past decade the number of residents residing in the county has declined to just 9 000 from 10 500 according to 2020 census data by comparison there are 65 432 units in pulaski county where the median monthly housing ratio for the average renter is 29 2 there are nearly 165 000 housing residences for the nearly 400 000 people that now live in the state s largest county including over 65 000 units for rent according to aca data compiled by the u s census bureau in its recent dec 8 report the aca said it collected a variety of housing cost information for renters including monthly rent and utility bills for homeowners the census bureau research group compiles its data from homeowners mortgage principal and interest real estate taxes insurance utilities mobile home costs second mortgage payments and condominium fees if applicable and now after the federal reserve s open market committee fomc raised the federal funds rate to the range of 4 25 4 5 earlier this month many economists are predicting a mild recession in 2023 as the housing market hits the breaks until mortgage prices are more affordable the fed hikes mark the seventh consecutive rate hike this year and takes interest rates back to levels not seen since late 2007 and early 2008 nine months ago rates were still at a rock bottom level of near 0 new wall street projections show that many economists are predicting that the fomc will raise interest rates to well beyond 5 in 2023 that federal fund rate is the interest rate that banks charge other institutions for lending excess cash to them from their reserve balances on an overnight basis since the rate hike on dec 14 most u s banks have raised their prime interest rates to 7 5 which will increase the credit and interest costs for small business loans lines of credit car loans mortgages and credit cards lawrence yun chief economist and senior vice president of research for the national association of realtors forecasts that 4 78 million existing homes will be sold prices will remain stable and atlanta will be the top real estate market to watch in 2023 and beyond yun unveiled the forecast for the nation s largest trade and most influential trade group on dec 13 during nar s fourth annual year end real estate forecast summit yun predicts home sales will decline by 6 8 compared to 2022 5 13 million and the median home price will reach 385 800 an increase of just 0 3 from this year 384 500 half of the country may experience small price gains while the other half may see slight price declines yun said however markets in california may be the exception with san francisco for example likely to register price drops of 10 15 post pandemic rental crisis easing but prices still up concerning rental prices yun expects prices to increase by 5 in 2023 following a 7 spike in 2022 according to the highly watched waller weeks and johnson rental index by florida atlantic university and two other schools more of the nation s largest metropolitan areas posted monthly declines in rent through october further proof that the rental crisis is easing across the nation in october 70 housing markets had smaller average rental rates up from 38 in september springfield mass austin texas seattle and new york are among the metros where rents are falling the u s average rental rate was 2 040 down 0 9 percent from september it seems that an increase in supply helped relieve the pricing pressure on rental units around the country and that s exactly what had to happen said ken johnson ph d an economist in fau s college of business the added supply appears to have come from delivery of units under construction an increase in unit density and the conversion of many airbnb type units to long term rentals despite the slowdown rental rates remain elevated in some markets particularly in florida and other southern states cape coral fort myers led the u s in both the largest year over year rental increase 17 16 and the largest premium at 17 37 a premium is the amount above the long term leasing trend that renters must pay rents typically increase only 3 to 5 a year in little rock which the fau cites as the 34th most affordable market in the u s the average rent is 1 140 25 per month that rental rate is up 6 25 from a year ago but still a 7 45 discount to what the price should be bennie waller ph d of the university of alabama s culverhouse college of business said the national data reveals that much of the large rental increases are coming from six and 12 months ago the waller weeks johnson rental index which covers the entire stock of homes and apartments uses easing data from zillow s observed rental index to determine existing rents and statistically model historical trends from 2014 within the past month or two rents are slowing and returning to a more normal year over year trend he said it s clear that much of the country is starting to shake off these large increases which have been so devastating to consumer budgets despite the slowing prices arkansas renters have seen some of the nation s highest increases during the height of the pandemic and well into 2022 through november arkansas renters are paying on average about 989 per month which is up 17 from 821 a year ago likewise the so called fair market rent fmr compiled by the u s department of housing and urban development hud is also going up the fmr is not the price the average renter pays but the amount hud considers is needed to lease privately owned housing of modest means with suitable amenities and is decent safe and sanitary in arkansas the fmr ranges from 509 for a studio apartment to 1 100 for a four room apartment for a working class family in the little rock metro area the fmr ranges from 790 for an efficiency apartment to 1 468 for a four bedroom rental space in september hud released its fair market prices for fiscal 2023 according to hud officials fmrs will increase by an average of approximately 10 which ironically will enable more households with housing vouchers to access affordable stable housing for 2023 hud used private sector data to estimate changes in fmrs to address a temporary data availability challenge and to align with market conditions one of the reasons that housing voucher holders are unable to use those vouchers is because the value of their vouchers has not kept up with rapid rent increases said hud secretary marcia fudge these new fmrs will make it easier for voucher holders facing this challenge to access affordable housing in most housing markets while expanding the range of housing opportunities available to households the new fmrs reflect the reality of housing unaffordability for many households while supporting our efforts to improve affordability and accessibility for all americans meanwhile the u s census bureau data shows that out of the 44 million renter households the vast majority 41 million paid rent and had household income in 239 or 7 6 of the nation s 3 143 counties more than half of renter households that paid rent and had a household income faced housing cost burdens among them are some of the most populous u s counties like harris county texas and los angeles county california over 15 8 million renters roughly one third of all renter households in the nation lived in these 239 counties in contrast to the prevalence of burden faced by renters the median housing cost ratio for homeowners rarely topped 30 and homeowners with and without a mortgage frequently had lower overall housing costs than renters homeowners in only 18 counties less than half a percent of all counties had a higher housing cost ratio than renters in fact there were only two counties where the median housing cost ratio for homeowners with a mortgage was above 30 were taliaferro county ga and trinity county calif nearly half of the counties where renters had the highest median housing cost ratios were in the south florida louisiana texas and mississippi were among the states with the largest number of counties where renters median housing costs exceeded 30 of their income the rising rental costs could be highlighted again when the arkansas 94th general assembly convenes in little rock on jan 9 in each of the past three general sessions legislation to revise arkansas tenant landlord law has died in committee or failed to advance to the house or senate floor for a vote in arkansas a landlord is not obligated for providing a habitable living space arkansas

andrew limbong host the house select committee investigating the january 6 attack on the u s capitol released its final report this past thursday and the big top line is that former president donald trump should be prosecuted by the department of justice on four charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the u s by assisting those involved in an insurrection the report is thorough it s more than 800 pages and it offers suggestions for how to protect the american democratic system from possible interference in the future but whatever action comes next could be a question of not just the law but also politics like will the doj actually pursue charges against the former president who is currently running for office again or will they pass to avoid the appearance of partisanship and does the appointment of special counsel jack smith change that calculus at all here to help us think this through is harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he currently hosts the talking feds podcast harry litman welcome back to all things considered harry litman thanks very good to be here merry christmas to everyone limbong yeah merry christmas to you too all right so you ve had a couple days to digest the report right now for those of us who haven t had a chance to get through all 800 pages you know or so is there something in particular that sticks out to you from this report that we didn t you know necessarily get from the multiple hearings the committee held litman so a few things that really struck me first the length of the overall conspiracy so it s clear from the report that before the election they had decided on the big lie strategy and you have some very vivid and profane quotes from roger stone and steve bannon f it we re just going to say we won and you know screw you that s before even the election and then after there s part really of the conspiracy that has to be considered the fundraising that trump did off it where it turns out that was kind of a big grift as the report says he mainly used the money for himself so that was one thing that really struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me as if donald trump s stock is you know it hasn t plunged but it s waning of course he s still a serious candidate but i m looking as a citizen and just an observer to see how much the republican house will really try to make a big deal of the big lie and the kinds of charges against the january 6 committee or the whole investigations in doj and georgia that at least they were doing as of a few months ago limbong that was harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he s the host and executive producer of the talking feds podcast harry

struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me as if donald trump s stock is you know it hasn t plunged but it s waning of course he s still a serious candidate but i m looking as a citizen and just an observer to see how much the republican house will really try to make a big deal of the big lie and the kinds of charges against the january 6 committee or the whole investigations in doj and georgia that at least they were doing as of a few months ago limbong that was harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he s the host and executive producer of the talking feds podcast harry

i ve said it time and again reckless abundant use of gold or golden paint and decorations on most vehicles makes said machines at least to these eyes look bling and therefore cheap which is probably the opposite effect of what its makers intended in the first place there are instances though when gold or golden hues may fit a project just right and there s no other type of vehicle we can think of better suited for this approach than chicano style motorcycles having emerged in the u s back in the 1940s this customization approach is both a nod to the mexican american way of life and a testimony of what talented custom builders can come up with when they put their minds to it there are several defining traits these builds usually have they are very close to the ground lowered in such a manner as to make the imposing body parts usually fitted on them especially the two fenders stand out even more then the front wheel is generally much larger than both the rear one and what we usually get on other modified bikes almost always the exhaust system ends in fishtail tailpipes and last but not least the paintjobs are more often than not nothing less than works of art the bike we have here checks all those boxes it s called venom and was originally born a harley davidson softail it now wears all the telltale signs of chicano builds but also tons of gold paint on the fenders fuel tank and panels and it looks just right responsible for the conversion is swiss bundnerbike and the motorcycle is one of their more recent projects described by the crew as a gold mexican heritage poison dart whatever that means the softail was modified a lot beyond paint we ll start with the wheels which in this case are multi spoke rims sized 23 inches at the front and 18 inches at the rear they are both protected from the elements by large and styled fenders in sheet metal properly painted and decorated the venom still has harley davidson grips and footpegs albeit aftermarket ones but the fuel tank front and rear panels and saddle are all of bundnerbike make led light indicators have also been fitted the chassis has been modified a bit although the exact changes made are not disclosed the engine is the stock one now gifted with a custom exhaust ending in fishtails while stopping power is ensured by bundnerbike supplied hardware the few details the swiss provide about the ride are not accompanied by any indication of how much it might have cost to build one can even consider the venom a one off because as the shop says every customer is individual and the ideas should be implemented accordingly
andrew limbong host the house select committee investigating the january 6 attack on the u s capitol released its final report this past thursday and the big top line is that former president donald trump should be prosecuted by the department of justice on four charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the u s by assisting those involved in an insurrection the report is thorough it s more than 800 pages and it offers suggestions for how to protect the american democratic system from possible interference in the future but whatever action comes next could be a question of not just the law but also politics like will the doj actually pursue charges against the former president who is currently running for office again or will they pass to avoid the appearance of partisanship and does the appointment of special counsel jack smith change that calculus at all here to help us think this through is harry litman he s the former deputy assistant

drifting might be big in the west but it was first initiated in japan in the 1970s there s something so satisfying about going through corners with that extra slide and while the bimmers reign in the drifting world in the west the drift car of choice in japan is almost always a nissan drifting might be a motoring discipline but it s first an art it involves braking while making a turn brake pedal or emergency brake forcing the rear end to lose grip and swing forward and outward before downshifting and sending it to full throttle while keeping the car in balance it might sound simple in theory but behind the wheel the moves need to run in quick succession to avoid spinning out of control that said it takes a lot of practice and skill to pull off a drift stunt to perfection some of the best drifting cars in the world include the nissan s chassis series bmw 3 series e30 bmw 540i e39 the toyota chaser toyota ae86 initial d toyota soarer the mazda rx 8 among other legends well hoonigan recently featured arisa mizuhara a visiting japanese pro drifter racer with her jdm spec s13 nissan silvia coupe arisa is both a rally and pro drift racer in japan in her most recent drifting competition she drove a 2jz swapped toyota yaris actually if you compare the yaris to the silvia the yaris has a longer wheelbase she pointed out arisa shipped her nissan silvia s13 to the u s as part of a tour of the american drift scene under the hood arisa s nissan silvia coupe packs the legendary 2 liter four cylinder notchtop sr20det engine s14 modded for 300 hp 304 ps it s a stock engine running an hks turbo tomei exhaust manifold and apexi intake stock the notchtop sr20det on the s14 nissan silvia produced 217 hp 220 ps and 205 lb ft 278 nm of torque at 4 800 rpm on the exterior it dons an instant gentleman s13 body kit and a g corporation rear spoiler type 2 arisa is the girl who rides her nissan s13 silvia like a rodeo cowboy her 300 hp 304 ps s13 ripped some insane drifts on the hoonigan burnyard she unfortunately blew the power steering system on her silvia in the end due to her wild drifts i think it sounds really cool but you have to set up an sr right to make it sound that good hert of hoonigan said so this car the way it s set up from what i am assuming 300 horsepower small turbo it s peaky so it s got like a good torque band he added she also got to sample some v8 power from an ls swapped bmw at the hoonigan studios it was a walk in the park but she admitted it needed some getting used to in case you are itching to see how raw this japanese pro drifting racer s skills are we recommend watching the video below

umesh cs yadav professor special centre for molecular medicine jnu covid has returned yet again in a new variant called bf 7 it is a sub variant of omicron which had affected the majority of our population earlier this year the central and state governments have started assessing the situation through high level meetings and cautioned people to follow covid appropriate measures in the wake of increasing covid cases globally especially in china japan south korea and some latin american countries but the question on everyone s mind is whether india be worried about this new variant in india the omicron variant has already caused the third wave which began at the end of last year and lasted till early this year the government had advised everyone to get the precaution dose or booster shot to protect oneself from the omicron variant according to the government records nearly 30 per cent people have already taken the precaution dose the majority of the population has taken the first two shots and others have some level of immunity against the virus variants through natural infection this situation is hugely different from that in march 2020 when the pandemic had begun and we had no idea what to do since then india has attained herd immunity or hybrid immunity which is acquired from vaccination as well as exposure to the virus the third wave was not as severe as was feared most of the cases were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and severity was mostly limited to the people with comorbidities and compromised immunity it appears that although the omicron had nearly 70 times higher infectivity rate than the previous strain delta which drove the second wave in india it did not cause much severity in mid january as observed through genome sequencing the omicron variant was found in more than 90 per cent of the covid samples tested in delhi this shows that our population has already got exposed to the omicron variant and thus is equipped better against the bf 7 sub lineage of omicron the question is why it is causing havoc in china the reason is china s zero covid policy which restricted people from moving out by imposing a strict lockdown in cities where even a single case was reported the chinese government had imposed measures like contact tracing mass testing of population in a given locality quarantine and lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus researchers have suggested that china s indigenous vaccine sinovac produced by sinopharm which was administered to chinese people gave low protection against the new variants the combined effect of these measures resulted in low overall immunity of the chinese population against the new sub lineage of omicron bf 7 how has the virus mutated and progressed in the past nearly three years the original virus was identified in china in december 2019 which mutated and gave rise to alpha mutant in 2020 in the uk later the beta b 1 135 variant was identified in october 2020 in south africa the gamma variant known as p 1 was first detected by japan s national institute of infectious diseases on january 6 2021 in a few people who had travelled to brazil the delta variant b 1 617 2 was first detected in india in late 2020 and caused havoc during the second wave in india in the summer of 2021 this virus strain had high transmissibility and spread quickly around the globe next came the omicron variant b 1 1 529 named as ba 1 for simplicity which was first identified in botswana and quickly spread to become the predominant variant globally it developed several sub variants like ba 2 ba 3 ba 4 ba 5 etc the ba 5 had developed two sub variants namely bq 1 and bq 1 1 in october 2022 the latest sub variant bf 7 is of ba 5 lineage all these variants and sub variants develop due to mutation a process where the bases in their genome change due to an error during replication this change leads to alteration in the spike protein against which antibodies have been made by our system to kill the virus effectively but the mutation led change in the virus protein decreases the efficacy of the antibodies and virus escapes the immune system and infects more and more people furthermore a new intranasal covid vaccine incovacc made by bharat biotech has also been approved it is a non invasive and needle free vaccine and is available on the cowin app since the omicron sub variants are mostly localised in the upper respiratory system this nasal vaccine will be very effective in preventing the infection and its spread the bf 7 variant was identified in india in september 2022 in gujarat and odisha and despite the laxity in covid related guidelines at that time these cases remained isolated and got cured even if sub variant bf 7 spreads in our population its impact is likely to remain low owing to the hybrid immunity acquired from natural infection and full vaccination the lancet recently reported that hybrid immunity against covid has been able to diminish hospitalisation and deaths despite having herd immunity and a majority of the population vaccinated including the booster dose in one third of the population we cannot be complacent experience from the past waves tells us that we should be vigilant and should not lower our guard at the individual level one should use good quality masks that properly cover the nose and the mouth avoid large gatherings and get the booster dose watch out for symptoms such as runny nose sore throat fever cough vomiting diarrhoea body pain lethargy and exhaustion if having these signs one should get tested and isolate oneself or take proper hospital care in the guidance of a doctor the authorities have alerted the people that the pandemic is not over as yet and covid appropriate behaviour is necessary to prevent it from spreading the government should reassess the oxygen stock and the availability of the medicines and hospital beds after assessing the situation covid appropriate guidelines should be enforced random testing of travellers especially those from the affected countries is now being done on arrival the government has also ordered genome sequencing of covid positive cases to assess the spread of bf 7 witnessing the upsurge in china the centre and state governments have swiftly come into action it shows that the authorities are now better prepared which is a good omen

christmas to everyone limbong yeah merry christmas to you too all right so you ve had a couple days to digest the report right now for those of us who haven t had a chance to get through all 800 pages you know or so is there something in particular that sticks out to you from this report that we didn t you know necessarily get from the multiple hearings the committee held litman so a few things

profane quotes from roger stone and steve bannon f it we re just going to say we won and you know screw you that s before even the election and then after there s part really of the conspiracy that has to be considered the fundraising that trump did off it where it turns out that was kind of a big grift as the report says he mainly used the money for himself so that was one thing that really struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me

kuala lumpur dec 26 at the beginning of 2022 the outlook for both the ringgit and bursa malaysia looked promising as pandemic threats had shrunk advertisement the local currency stood at rm4 1715 to the us dollar while the benchmark ftse bursa malaysia klci fbm klci was at 1 549 05 when the new year s first trading day jan 3 ended even with the emergence of the war in ukraine in late february the ringgit and local bourse continued to thrive until the markets upended as united states us policy tightening headlines propped the greenback the responses to external shocks were broadly in line with the situation abroad which saw capital flights occurring globally advertisement when inflation is catastrophic the ringgit fell to a historic low of rm4 7465 against the us dollar on nov 4 2022 as inflation started to cut a swathe across the globe and at home this was its worst level since the currency recorded rm4 7125 on jan 9 1998 as a result of the asian financial crisis the pound euro and yen were among the major currencies also hitting fresh all time lows advertisement the biggest currency market rout has put pressure on central banks to hike rates as prices surged including in malaysia bank islam malaysia bhd chief economist firdaos rosli said that aside from being hit by bets on further rate hikes by the us federal reserve fed in its bid to tame inflation the local note has been pressured by the widening interest rate differential between the federal funds rate ffr and overnight policy rate opr the fed has raised its policy rate by 425 basis points bps since march this year compared with a 100 bps increase in the opr this scenario has resulted in the ffr range now at 4 25 4 50 per cent being higher than the opr at 2 75 per cent thus far and the fed remains committed to reining in inflation which has stayed elevated despite easing since july 2022 firdaos said the reduced foreign portfolio investments into malaysia of late have put the ringgit under pressure as well foreign funds flows were negative from september to november 2022 in both the bond and equity markets he said although the foreign funds flow into equities for the first 11 months of 2022 was positive at rm5 68 billion foreign investors sold their malaysian bond holdings worth rm12 35 billion during the period currencies of emerging countries will continue to be under pressure as the fed has yet to indicate its desire to pivot as long as us inflation continues to trend way above its 2 00 per cent target rate he told bernama year to date the ringgit has lost 6 0 per cent of its value against the us dollar while bursa malaysia was 4 8 per cent down as of dec 23 2022 nevertheless he reckoned that the ringgit has recovered some losses since the second week of november 2022 hence he said the local unit could end the year within the range of rm4 46 rm4 49 against the greenback not all doom and gloom citing the ringgit s performance as of dec 19 firdaos said that while the ringgit had depreciated against the hong kong dollar 6 1 per cent singapore dollar 5 4 per cent and thai baht 1 4 per cent it had strengthened against other major currencies such as the euro 0 9 per cent chinese yuan 3 4 per cent british pound 4 9 per cent and japanese yen 11 9 per cent we see a similar trend with other currency pairs such as the australian dollar 2 1 per cent indonesian rupiah 3 0 per cent south korean won 3 1 per cent and indian rupee 4 4 per cent he said firdaos also said that the weaker ringgit could be a catalyst for boosting malaysia s net export growth as import growth decelerates on a year on year basis export growth caught up with import growth for the first time this year in november 2022 both up by 15 6 per cent suggesting favourable trade balance growth in the immediate term he said this could lend support to the gross domestic product gdp for the fourth quarter of 2022 and subsequently full year 2022 for which he forecast an 8 1 per cent growth we are penciling in malaysia s gdp growth to come in at 4 5 per cent in 2023 and 4 7 per cent in 2024 should the reopening of china s economy intensify it could give the necessary buffer for the positive outlook of the ringgit for the end of this year he noted meanwhile he reckoned that the fbm klci could end 2022 at around the 1 560 level the country also saw a smooth government transition led by 10th prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim after the 15th general election the unity government a broad coalition government consisting of various political parties was formed as a result of a hung parliament a first in the history of the country in the long term a coalition government could mean more consultative policies and more checks and balances which would be market positive he added 2023 outlook juwai iqi chief economist shan saeed projected that the ringgit will maintain its structural stability in 2023 as the us dollar goes into depreciation mode the ringgit should be between rm4 10 and rm4 37 in 2023 based on the premise that higher oil prices economic stability and above all depreciating us dollar come back into the market we at juwai iqi expect the local unit to be one of the top currencies along with the vietnamese dong indonesian rupiah thai baht brazilian real south african rand and philippine peso in 2023 as the fed commences quantitative easing qe5 with lowering rates by october november 2023 as the us economy goes into severe l shaped deep recession shan explained he said the ringgit has been appreciating 8 14 per cent in the last five weeks against the us dollar meanwhile cgs cimb securities sdn bhd expected the fbm klci to gain eight per cent to end 2023 at 1 633 amid the potential return of foreign funds merger and acquisition activities and clarity on the new government policies bernama

the more than three centuries long dispute between spain and the united kingdom over the status of gibraltar has been heating up again the united states has interests at stake in the dispute the u s benefits from its close relationship with gibraltar as a british overseas territory in a way that would not be possible if gibraltar was under the control of spain the anglo american special relationship means that the u s enjoys access to british overseas military bases unlike any other country in the world from america s first overseas military intervention in 1801 against the barbary states to the most recent military overseas intervention in 2011 against muammar qadhafi s regime in libya the u s has often used gibraltar s military facilities to achieve its objectives an important part of the gibraltar dispute between the u k and spain is the right of self determination of the gibraltarians a right on which america was founded in 1776 and a right that spain regularly ignores spain is an important nato ally and home to several u s military installations and its disregard for the wishes of the gibraltarians is unbecoming of a nato ally spain s behavior in the region has a direct impact on the effectiveness of the u s military operating in the mediterranean the u s should support the gibraltarians right to self determination and should cooperate with the u k to ensure that the american armed forces continue to have access to the military facilities there finally the u s should condemn spain s intimidation of the citizens of gibraltar the rock british for more than 300 years gibraltar is one of 14 british overseas territories like all other british overseas territories gibraltar has chosen to be self governing while maintaining the british monarch as its head of state gibraltar is economically self supporting the sole exception being its defense which is provided by britain there is a local defense force the royal gibraltar regiment which has even deployed troops to afghanistan and iraq alongside u s forces gibraltar commonly referred to simply as the rock is a rocky headland covering just over 2 7 square miles on the southern coast of the iberian peninsula it has a small land border with spain and is strategically located at the western entrance to the mediterranean where the strait between europe and africa spans a mere 7 7 nautical miles at its narrowest point its 30 000 inhabitants the overwhelming majority of whom are british citizens do not want to be part of spain they are british subjects and travel with british passports gibraltar has been under british control for more than 300 years many parties have long considered gibraltar militarily important and the possession of the rock has changed hands on a number of occasions since it was first fortified and captured by moors from north africa in the eighth century as part of the war of the spanish succession in 1704 a joint anglo dutch force captured gibraltar from the spanish under the terms of article 10 of the 1713 treaty of utrecht which ended the war spain handed over gibraltar to the british the first paragraph of article 10 states the catholic king does hereby for himself his heirs and successors yield to the crown of great britain the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of gibraltar together with the port fortifications and forts thereunto belonging and he gives up the said propriety to be held and enjoyed absolutely with all manner of right for ever without any exception or impediment whatsoever it is worth pointing out that britain s claim on gibraltar was subsequently reconfirmed in the 1729 treaty of seville the 1731 treaty of vienna the 1756 treaty of aix le chapelle the 1763 treaty of paris and the 1783 treaty of versailles according to the u s state department the u s recognizes gibraltar as an overseas territory of the united kingdom based on the 1713 treaty of utrecht although the treaty of utrecht did not specify who owns the waters around gibraltar at the time that the treaty was agreed the cannon shot rule was customary practice therefore the waters around gibraltar within the range of british artillery were tacitly yielded at the same time as gibraltar s land was given to the british under the treaty of utrecht by the end of the napoleonic wars in europe the cannon shot rule evolved to mean three nautical miles of territorial sea during the 1970s some coastal states began to claim a territorial sea of 12 nautical miles in breadth which later became the new international standard maximum breadth as codified in the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos today british gibraltar territorial waters bgtw officially extends three nautical miles from the coast of gibraltar the british government has said that it reserves the right to extend the bgtw to 12 nautical miles if it so chooses since losing gibraltar in 1704 the spanish have used a combination of military diplomatic economic and plain harassing tactics in an attempt to retake gibraltar from the british the spanish also laid siege to gibraltar on three separate occasions 1704 1705 1727 and 1779 1783 known as the great siege since none of these sieges were successful in removing british control of the rock the spanish have used economic and diplomatic pressure too after the gibraltarians approved a new constitution in 1969 spain s fascist dictator francesco franco closed the land border and blocked telecommunications between spain and gibraltar until the border was reopened in 1985 the closure had a devastating impact on the local economies of gibraltar and la línea de la concepción the spanish city just across the border during this period thousands of spaniards who worked in gibraltar were denied their source of employment families consisting of gibraltarians and spaniards were separated forcing family members to communicate through the fence erected by spain during this time although there was no military aspect to the border closure under franco many gibraltarians consider the border closure from 1969 to 1985 to be another spanish siege in the late 1980s spain even went so far as to reclaim land from the sea that is clearly inside bgtw in order to expand a marina today part of spain s la alcaidesa marina is located partially inside bgtw see map 1 while the historical background of gibraltar is important and the treaty of utrecht is clear about who rightfully possesses gibraltar today ultimately those facts are secondary to the inherent right of the gibraltarians to decide how they want to be governed and to whom they owe their allegiance the citizens of gibraltar have expressed their desire to remain british on two separate occasions first in 1967 when 99 6 percent of gibraltarians voted in a popular referendum to remain british most recently in 2002 the gibraltarians held a second sovereignty referendum in this case 98 48 percent of voters rejected the idea of spanish sovereignty the right to self determination is guaranteed by the united nations charter and the international covenant on civil and political rights and spain is a party to both spain s strategy distraction through intimidation to this day spain has not given up on its claim to gibraltar many observers see spain s increasingly aggressive stance on gibraltar as being more about a struggling government reeling from economic woes and a brewing political scandal than about gibraltar being british spanish prime minister mariano rajoy is currently embroiled in a scandal in which he and senior members of his popular party are accused of accepting kickback payments from construction companies although rajoy denies receipt of any kickbacks a recent poll found that 72 percent of spaniards believe rajoy is not telling the truth adding to rajoy s political problems are spain s economic woes the 2008 global economic crisis hit spain hard and the country is still feeling the effects although spain has finally emerged from its double dip recession growth remains stagnant madrid already received a multibillion euro bailout last year from the european union and the international monetary fund unemployment for october 2013 stood at 26 7 percent overall and 57 4 percent for those under age 25 needless to say gibraltar offers a convenient distraction from both the political and economic problems facing the government in madrid lately spain s behavior toward gibraltar has been nothing short of harassment and is unbecoming of a nato ally in 21st century europe the most recent confrontation between spain and gibraltar stems from gibraltar extending an artificial reef system inside its territorial waters the reef was extended by dropping concrete blocks into an area where spanish fishing vessels were fishing illegally spanish fishermen complained that the concrete blocks were ripping their fishing nets as british foreign secretary william hague pointed out he creation of the reef was legal and is part of the government of gibraltar s long term marine environmental management plan designed to improve fish stocks and regenerate habitat the use of inert concrete blocks to create artificial reefs is consistent with international best practice and with the government of spain s own approach to artificial reefs spain has long been vocal in its disdain for british control over territory it considers to be spanish worryingly spain has turned this rhetoric into action and has demonstrated a complete disregard for gibraltar s sovereignty there have been hundreds of incursions into gibraltar s territorial waters by spanish naval and law enforcement ships in 2013 alone there were 446 unlawful incursions by spanish state vessels by comparison there were fewer than half nearly 200 in 2012 23 in 2011 and 67 in 2010 in fact many recent actions taken by the rajoy government have seemed reminiscent of franco s spain in june 2013 the guardia civil vessel rio cedena chased after a gibraltarian jet skier in bgtw while spanish police fired shots at him in july 2013 spanish air force jets allegedly violated gibraltarian airspace causing a delay to a british airways flight to london in august 2013 long delays at the gibraltar spain border of up to seven hours become a renewed problem due to disproportionate checks introduced by the spanish authorities on vehicles leaving and entering gibraltar the waiting time for pedestrians to cross the border regularly reaches 90 minutes this has had a severe impact on the 7 000 spaniards who commute to jobs in gibraltar in september 2013 spain announced that it will sell 16 mirage fighter jets to argentina this is a concern for the u k in light of recent saber rattling from buenos aires regarding future sovereignty over the falkland islands on october 31 2013 the spanish guardia civil s rio tormes and a gibraltarian police boat collided while a royal navy tanker was conducting resupplying operations in bgtw in november 2013 a spanish surveying ship illegally entered bgtw for 20 hours at one point getting as close as 250 meters from the entrance to the port of gibraltar this violation of british sovereignty resulted in an emergency debate in the house of commons and the british foreign office summoning the spanish ambassador in november 2013 spanish police opened a british diplomatic bag at the border in direct violation of 1961 vienna convention on diplomatic relations selective sovereignty claims it is also worth pointing out that spanish disdain for britain s control over gibraltar is hypocritical for example spain has two similar sovereign enclaves ceuta and melilla bordering morocco ceuta is a city of 79 000 people roughly twice the size of gibraltar melilla is a city of 73 000 and is also larger than gibraltar both cities are located in north africa in the same way gibraltar is located on the iberian peninsula they are legally part of spain and ceuta and melilla are the only two eu cities located in mainland africa they are also part of the schengen agreement and the eurozone according to a 2007 poll 87 9 percent of spaniards view ceuta and melilla as part of spain while 50 percent said that they did not understand the claim morocco has on the two cities in addition to ceuta and melilla spain also controls three smaller areas called the plazas de soberanía places of sovereignty in or just off the coast of morocco see map 2 the legality or righteousness of spain s numerous possessions in morocco is not a topic for this backgrounder but spain s disdain toward gibraltar is based on a double standard when viewed through the wider lens of spanish possessions in morocco separate from these three plazas de soberanía is the small but contested perejil island a mere 820 feet from the moroccan mainland this island was the scene of an armed though bloodless confrontation in 2002 spanish commandos were sent to liberate the island from moroccan naval cadets who had seized the island on behalf of the moroccan government peace was brokered by then u s secretary of state colin powell after both sides agreed to return to the status quo ante it appears that some spaniards do recognize the double standard recently declassified documents from 1983 from the british foreign office claim that king juan carlos of spain admitted privately to the british ambassador sir richard parsons that it was not in spain s interest to recover gibraltar in the near future the spanish king reportedly added that if spain did gain sovereignty over gibraltar morocco s king hassan would immediately reactivate the moroccan claim to ceuta and melilla yes gibraltar matters to the united states for the united states there is even more at stake than the principles of sovereignty and self determination a serious concern for the united states relates to gibraltar s role in regional security one of the benefits of the anglo american special relationship is the use of british military facilities around the world by the u s armed forces in fact this particular aspect of the relationship was mentioned by winston churchill during his sinews of peace speech delivered in fulton missouri in 1946 churchill said about the u s u k military relationship it should carry with it the continuance of the present facilities for mutual security by the joint use of all naval and air force bases in the possession of either country all over the world this would perhaps double the mobility of the american navy and air force it would greatly expand that of the british empire forces and it might well lead if and as the world calms down to important financial savings the u s has greatly benefited from access to british military installations around the world perhaps the best example is gibraltar where the u s has a long history of accessing the port and airfield gibraltar s utility as a military base derives principally from its geographical location and topography sir john jackie fisher former admiral of the fleet of the royal navy described gibraltar in 1904 as one of the five keys that lock up the world all maritime vessels entering or leaving the mediterranean from the atlantic ocean must pass through the strait of gibraltar gibraltar is one of the u k s permanent joint operating bases and serves as an important forward operating base for the british military which affords a supply location for aircraft and ships destined for africa and the middle east for the u k and her allies the port of gibraltar provides a secure docking area for nuclear powered submarines the deepwater harbor provides vast amounts of safe anchorage the topography of gibraltar makes intelligence gathering a core function the u s navy made use of gibraltar for the first time during the first barbary war between 1801 and 1805 where it was the u s navy s first port of call in the mediterranean to prepare for its operations off the cost of north africa against the barbary states gibraltar was used throughout the campaign as a staging and resupply point according to a plaque located today in gibraltar at the american war memorial marking this historic event the first documented gun salute fired by the u s navy in the mediterranean was to lieutenant general o hara governor of gibraltar other early examples of the u s using the military facilities at gibraltar are in 1818 during the second barbary war against the regency of algiers another u s navy task force was assembled at gibraltar under the command of commodore stephen decatur in 1899 u s admiral george dewey stopped in gibraltar to resupply his ships after his defeat of the spanish in the battle of manila bay which was part of the spanish american war in 1909 the great white fleet made its final stop in gibraltar to resupply coal before heading back to the u s during its famous around the world trip each ship required between 1 200 and 1 600 tons of coal to make it home during this last leg of its journey therefore gibraltar s location at the mouth of the mediterranean sea proved to be very useful it was not until world war i that the use of gibraltar really demonstrated its strategic value for the united states the royal navy used gibraltar as a base for its mediterranean operations from the beginning of the war and continued when the u s entered the war in 1917 gibraltar was a meeting point for many allied convoys before crossing the atlantic the u s navy and the u s coast guard joined british forces at gibraltar and operated together as part of the so called gibraltar barrage the gibraltar barrage was an anglo american naval squadron tasked with keeping german submarines from passing from the mediterranean to the atlantic after the surrender of austria and turkey gibraltar was also used as a location to refit and resupply u s navy and coast guard ships throughout the war during world war ii gibraltar played an even more important role for the united states and united kingdom during the war the rock became an impregnable fortress more than 16 000 civilians living in gibraltar were relocated an airfield was constructed the port was filled with allied ships and at its peak 37 000 american and british troops were based there gibraltar s proximity to the strait leading to and from the mediterranean frustrated german and italian naval operations in the region the harbor continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the mediterranean until 1945 most important general dwight eisenhower used gibraltar as his headquarters to plan operation torch the 1942 allied invasion of north africa in his book crusade in europe eisenhower best explains gibraltar s importance to the overall war effort there was no other place to use in november 1942 the allied nations possessed except for the gibraltar fortress not a single spot of ground in all the region of western europe and in the mediterranean area nothing west of malta britain s gibraltar made possible the invasion of northwest africa without it the vital air cover would not have been quickly established on the north african fields in the early phases of the invasion the small airdrome there had necessarily to serve both as an operational field and as a staging point for aircraft making the passage from england to the african mainland even several weeks before d day it became jammed with fighter aircraft every inch was taken up by either a spitfire or a can of gasoline the use of gibraltar during world war ii was only possible because it was not under spanish control spanish dictator francisco franco proclaimed spain to be neutral however during the war british intelligence uncovered numerous examples of spanish cooperation with germans and italians to carry out espionage and sabotage against allied interests in gibraltar spain s neutrality was also questioned by general eisenhower all this was exposed to the enemy s reconnaissance planes and not even an attempt at camouflage could be made worse the airfield itself lay on the spanish border separated from spanish territory only by a barbed wire fence politically spain was leaning toward the axis and almost physically leaning against the barbed wire fence were any number of axis agents every day we expected a major attack by hostile bombers as each day went by without such an attack we went to bed puzzled even astonished without british control over gibraltar the invasion of north africa would likely have been more difficult and allied maritime and convoy operations in the region would surely have been more dangerous during the cold war and into the 21st century gibraltar s strategic position continued to provide an important facility for the royal navy and britain s allies recent use of gibraltar by the u s has included operation el dorado canyon the 1986 u s air strikes on libya u s navy assets supporting the operations used the port at gibraltar in 1990 and 1991 an estimated 193 u s navy ships used bgtw in support of operations desert storm and desert shield crucially gibraltar was used by the u s ready reserve fleet to refuel en route to the middle east u s nuclear submarines frequently visited the z berths at gibraltar if there was a situation involving repair work on a u s submarine gibraltar was the best place in the mediterranean for the work to be carried out the recent intervention in libya when the two u s attack submarines uss florida and uss providence were resupplied at gibraltar after launching their cruise missiles against libyan targets as north africa becomes more of a security issue for the u s due to a growing terrorist presence gibraltar will become increasingly important anglo american defense cooperation in gibraltar is not a matter that falls within the constitutional competence of the gibraltarian government it is a matter decided by the british government in london nevertheless the chief minister of gibraltar fabian picardo has made it clear that he welcomes the presence of u s military forces all vessels of the royal navy and of allied powers invited into british gibraltar territorial waters by her majesty s government are very welcome on the rock from a purely military point of view it is in america s interest that gibraltar remains under british control in 2002 when prime minister tony blair s government came very close to agreeing to joint sovereignty with the spanish over gibraltar officials in the united states were concerned about what this would mean for future use of gibraltar by the u s military in particular u s navy submarines this issue goes back to 1976 when the u s nuclear powered submarines permanently based at rota spain were sent back to the u s due to spanish opposition this prohibition does not prevent u s nuclear powered submarines from visiting rota on a temporary basis but gibraltar remains the most accessible and available port for u s nuclear powered submarines in the mediterranean due to burdensome security and administrative requirements in spain the mission and location of america s nuclear powered submarines is highly classified information at gibraltar u s submarines can dock with little or no prior notice conversely u s submarines can only dock at the spanish bases with prior notice which requires sharing sensitive classified information gibraltar has other advantages for the u s navy too the u s and the u k have a mutual understanding about what is required to operate nuclear powered submarines because unlike spain both countries do so gibraltar has a type of intermediate fuel oil that is required for some u s navy ships and is not available in rota obtaining permission for contractor access to gibraltar is less cumbersome than in spain and the harbor at rota is not deep enough for some u s navy vessels furthermore there are geographical advantages for u s navy assets operating in the mediterranean to use gibraltar instead of rota depending on the security threat gibraltar is in the mediterranean sea rota is outside the mediterranean sea every time a u s navy asset goes to rota it has first to transit the narrow strait of gibraltar transiting such a narrow body of water requires a high level of force protection for the ship to ensure its safe passage the threat is real from terrorist attacks against u s ships operating in narrow waterways in 2000 al qaeda members killed 17 u s sailors and wounded 39 by ramming a boat laden with explosives into the uss cole while in the port of aden in 2002 a plot by al qaeda to attack u s and u k naval ships in the strait of gibraltar using the same tactics as with the uss cole attack was foiled by moroccan security forces over the past few decades the u s use of gibraltar has been an area of contention in spanish american relations spanish authorities have pressured the u s to send its submarines and other naval vessels to rota instead of to gibraltar in some cases spain has been successful in 2004 the uss mcfaul was due to call at gibraltar during the celebration marking the 300th anniversary of the capture of gibraltar but the u s cancelled the visit at the last minute similarly last year which marked the 300th anniversary of the treaty of utrecht the u s did not send a single u s submarine to gibraltar it should be a matter for the u s to decide in close cooperation with the british government when and how it uses gibraltar the spanish government should have no say in the matter and its concerns should be secondary to u s national security requirements although spain is a member of nato the spanish government places restrictions on u s and other nato military assets visiting gibraltar u s navy ships that visit gibraltar are not allowed to call into a spanish port without first stopping somewhere else the same is true for aircraft for example a u s military aircraft flying between rota and gibraltar has to detour either to faro in portugal or to tangier in morocco first in fact this provision was formalized in nato when spain ensured that nato standardized agreement 1100 which sets out the procedures for visits to nato and non nato ports by naval ships of nato nations contains a reservation that prevents visits by nato ships to or from gibraltar directly to or from spanish ports any request by military aircraft from nato members that arrives or departs the gibraltar airfield and overflies or lands in spain is routinely denied by spanish authorities in 2011 media reports stated that these spanish restrictions were also placed in a 2011 defense cooperation agreement between spain and the u s according to media reports the text of the so called gibraltar clause in the u s spain defense cooperation agreement states aircraft departing from or heading to gibraltar are forbidden to overfly spanish airspace or to land in spain they cannot even file a flight plan which includes a spanish airport as their alternative destination the only exception are humanitarian missions which have been previously authorized and emergencies there have also been cases of intimidation and hostile behavior from spanish police boats toward u s navy vessels accessing the port of gibraltar this was the case when an american submarine the uss providence entered the port at gibraltar after launching cruise missiles into libya as the providence transited bgtw an unauthorized spanish guardia civil boat approached so close to the submarine that the royal navy was forced to issue a radio warning and block the passage of the guardia civil boat the u s military is very active in the mediterranean and operates from a string of naval bases between the strait of gibraltar and the suez canal the u s presence in the region is more important now due to deteriorating security in north africa spain like other southern european members of nato benefits greatly from the security offered by the presence of the u s navy and air force in the region therefore madrid should remove anachronistic restrictions of the movement of u s military assets acting in america s interest not spain s spain is an important ally in nato it has sent troops to iraq and afghanistan it played a role albeit a minor one during the 2011 nato operation in libya spain is home to several u s military bases including the future home of four u s navy aegis class destroyers that will play an important role in nato s ballistic missile defense system nevertheless spain s conduct toward the residents of gibraltar and america s top ally the united kingdom is unbecoming of a nato partner the u s should support policies that advance american interests in the region by recognizing british sovereignty over gibraltar the united states should acknowledge the wishes of the rock s almost 30 000 inhabitants and officially recognize british sovereignty over gibraltar since 1801 british sovereignty has greatly benefited the u s by helping it achieve its regional security aims in southern europe and the mediterranean the united states should acknowledge the wishes of the rock s almost 30 000 inhabitants and officially recognize british sovereignty over gibraltar since 1801 british sovereignty has greatly benefited the u s by helping it achieve its regional security aims in southern europe and the mediterranean continuing to use the port facilities at gibraltar the hassle free use of gibraltar for u s navy assets especially nuclear powered submarines offers huge advantages to the u s

the united kingdom in a way it would not be possible with a gibraltar under control of the spanish as a british overseas territory u s access to the military facilities at gibraltar is all but guaranteed while the historical background to gibraltar is important and the 1713 treaty of utrecht is clear on who possesses gibraltar today it is ultimately secondary to the inherent right of the gibraltarians to decide how they wish to be governed and to whom they owe their allegiance the u s was founded in 1776 on an assertion of just such a right it should live up to this heritage by condemning spain s recent behavior by recognizing the gibraltarians right to choose their own government the gibraltar issue is above all a matter of self determination just as it is for the residents of the falkland islands vis à vis argentina and the u s is wrong not to support their choice of allegiance to the u k the u s should not double down on this fault by doing the same regarding the

greenback some of the world s biggest economies are exploring ways to circumvent the us currency smaller nations including at least a dozen in asia are also experimenting with de dollarisation and corporates around the world are selling an unprecedented portion of their debt in local currencies wary of further dollar strength no one is saying the greenback will be dethroned anytime soon from its reign as the principal medium of exchange calls for peak dollar have many times proven premature but not too long ago it was almost unthinkable for countries to explore payment mechanisms that bypassed the us currency or the swift network that underpins the global financial system now the sheer strength of the dollar its use under president joe biden to enforce sanctions on russia this year and new technological innovations are together encouraging nations to start chipping away at its hegemony treasury officials declined to comment on these developments this will simply intensify the efforts in russia and china to try to manage their part of the world economy without the dollar said paul tucker a former deputy governor of the bank of england in a bloomberg podcast writing in a newsletter last week john mauldin an investment strategist and president of millennium wave advisors with more than three decades of markets experience said the biden administration made an error in weaponising the us dollar and the global payment system that will force non us investors and nations to diversify their holdings outside of the traditional safe haven of the us said mauldin plans already underway in russia and china to promote their currencies for international payments including through the use of blockchain technologies accelerated rapidly after the invasion of ukraine russia for example began seeking remuneration for energy supplies in rubles soon the likes of bangladesh kazakhstan and laos were also stepping up negotiations with china to boost their use of the yuan india began talking up more loudly the internationalisation of the rupee and just this month started securing a bilateral payment mechanism with the united arab emirates progress however appears to be slow yuan accounts haven t gained traction in bangladesh for example due to the nation s wide trade deficit with china bangladesh has tried to pursue de dollarisation in trade with china but the flow is almost one sided said salim afzal shawon head of research at dhaka based brac epl stock brokerage ltd a major driver of those plans was the move by the us and europe to cut off russia from the global financial messaging system known as swift the action described as a financial nuclear weapon by the french left most major russian banks estranged from a network that facilitates tens of millions of transactions every day forcing them to lean on their own much smaller version instead that had two implications first the us sanctions on russia stoked concern that the dollar could more permanently become an overt political tool a concern shared especially by china but also beyond beijing and moscow india for example has been developing its own homegrown payments system that would partly mimic swift second the us decision to use the currency as part of a more aggressive form of economic statecraft puts extra pressure on economies in asia to choose sides without any alternative payments system they d run the risk of being compelled into compliance with or enforcement of sanctions they may not agree with and losing out on trade with key partners the complicating factor in this cycle is the wave of sanctions and seizures on usd holdings said taimur baig managing director and chief economist at dbs group research in singapore given this backdrop regional steps to reduce usd reliance are unsurprising just as officials across asia are loath to pick a winner in us china tussles and would prefer to keep relations with both the us penalties on russia are pushing governments to go their own way sometimes the action takes a political or nationalist tone including resentment of western pressure to adopt sanctions on russia moscow looked to convince india to use an alternative system to keep transactions moving myanmar s junta spokesman said the dollar was being used to to bully smaller nations and southeast asian countries pointed to the episode as a reason to trade more in local currencies sanctions make it more difficult by design for countries and companies to remain neutral in geopolitical confrontations said jonathan wood head of global risk

and other conflicting pressures it s not just the sanctions helping to accelerate the de dollarisation trend the us currency s rampant gains have also made asian officials more aggressive in their attempts at diversification the dollar has strengthened about 7 this year on track for its biggest annual advance since 2015 according to a bloomberg index of the dollar the gauge reached a record high in september as dollar appreciation sent everything from the british pound to the indian rupee to historic lows the dollar s strength is a huge headache for asian nations who ve seen prices of food purchases soar debt repayment burdens worsen and poverty deepen sri lanka is a case in point defaulting on its dollar debt for the first time ever as a soaring greenback crippled the nation s ability to pay up vietnamese officials at one point blamed dollar appreciation for fuel supply struggles hence moves such as india s deal with the uae which accelerates a long running campaign to transact more in the rupee and to set up trade settlement agreements that bypass the us currency meanwhile dollar denominated bond sales by non financial companies have dropped to a record low 37 of the global total in 2022 they ve accounted for more than 50 of debt sold in any one year on several occasions in the past decade while all these measures may have a limited market impact short term the end result may be an eventual weakening of demand for the dollar the canadian dollar and chinese yuan s shares of all currency trades for instance are already slowly edging higher technological progress is another factor facilitating efforts at moving away from the greenback several economies are chipping away at dollar use as a by product of efforts to build new payment networks a campaign that pre dates the surging greenback malaysia indonesia singapore and thailand have set up systems for transactions between each another in their local currencies rather than the dollar taiwanese can pay with a qr code system that s linked with japan all in the efforts are driving momentum further away from a west led system that s been the bedrock for global finance for more than half a century what s emerging is a three tier structure with the dollar still very much on top but increasing bilateral payment routes and alternative spheres such as the yuan that seek to seize on any potential us overreach and for all the agitation and action afoot it s unlikely the dollar s dominant position will be challenged anytime soon the strength and size of the us economy remains unchallenged treasuries are still one of the safest ways to store capital and the dollar makes up the lion s share of foreign exchange reserves the renminbi s share of all foreign exchange trades for example may have climbed to 7 but the dollar still makes up one side of 88 of such transactions it s very hard to compete on the fiat front we have the russians doing that by forcing the use of rubles and there s wariness with the yuan as well said george boubouras three decade markets veteran and head of research at hedge fund k2 asset management in melbourne at the end of the day investors still prefer liquid assets and in this sense nothing can replace the dollar nevertheless the combination of moves away from the dollar are a challenge to what then french finance minister valéry giscard d estaing famously described as the exorbitant privilege enjoyed by the us the term which he coined in the 1960s describes how the greenback s hegemony shields the us from exchange rate risk and projects the nation s economic might and they may ultimately test the entire bretton woods model a system that established the dollar as a leader in the monetary order which was negotiated at a hotel in a sleepy new hampshire town at the close of world war ii the latest efforts do indicate that the global trade and settlement platform that we ve been using for decades may be beginning to fracture said homin lee asia macro strategist at lombard odier in hong kong whose firm oversees the equivalent of 66 billion this entire network that was born out of the bretton woods system the eurodollar market in the 1970s and then the financial deregulation and the floating rates regime in the 1980s this platform that we have developed so far may be beginning to shift in a more fundamental sense lee said the net result king dollar may still reign supreme for decades to come but the building momentum for transactions in alternate currencies shows no sign of slowing particularly if geopolitical wild cards continue to convince officials to go their own way and the us government s willingness to use its currency in geopolitical fights could ironically weaken its ability to pursue such methods as effectively in the future the war in ukraine and the sanctions on russia will provide a very valuable lesson indonesian finance minister sri mulyani indrawati said last month at the bloomberg ceo forum on the sidelines of the g 20 meetings in bali many countries feel they can do transactions directly bilaterally using their local currencies which i think is good for the world to have a much more balanced use of currencies and payment systems

andrew limbong host the house select committee investigating the january 6 attack on the u s capitol released its final report this past thursday and the big top line is that former president donald trump should be prosecuted by the department of justice on four charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the u s by assisting those involved in an insurrection the report is thorough it s more than 800 pages and it offers suggestions for how to protect the american democratic system from possible interference in the future but whatever action comes next could be a question of not just the law but also politics like will the doj actually pursue charges against the former president who is currently running for office again or will they pass to avoid the appearance of partisanship and does the appointment of special counsel jack smith change that calculus at all here to help us think this through is harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he currently hosts the talking feds podcast harry litman welcome back to all things considered harry litman thanks very good to be here merry christmas to everyone limbong yeah merry christmas to you too all right so you ve had a couple days to digest the report right now for those of us who haven t had a chance to get through all 800 pages you know or so is there something in particular that sticks out to you from this report that we didn t you know necessarily get from the multiple hearings the committee held litman so a few things that really struck me first the length of the overall conspiracy so it s clear from the report that before the election they had decided on the big lie strategy and you have some very vivid and profane quotes from roger stone and steve bannon f it we re just going to say we won and you know screw you that s before even the election and then after there s part really of the conspiracy that has to be considered the fundraising that trump did off it where it turns out that was kind of a big grift as the report says he mainly used the money for himself so that was one thing that really struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me as if donald trump s stock is you know it hasn t plunged but it s waning of course he s still a serious candidate but i m looking as a citizen and just an observer to see how much the republican house will really try to make a big deal of the big lie and the kinds of charges against the january 6 committee or the whole investigations in doj and georgia that at least they were doing as of a few months ago limbong that was harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he s the host and executive producer of the talking feds podcast harry

andrew limbong host the house select committee investigating the january 6 attack on the u s capitol released its final report this past thursday and the big top line is that former president donald trump should be prosecuted by the department of justice on four charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the u s by assisting those involved in an insurrection the report is thorough it s more than 800 pages and it offers suggestions for how to protect the american democratic system from possible interference in the future but whatever action comes next could be a question of not just the law but also politics like will the doj actually pursue charges against the former president who is currently running for office again or will they pass to avoid the appearance of partisanship and does the appointment of special counsel jack smith change that calculus at all here to help us think this through is harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he currently hosts the talking feds podcast harry litman welcome back to all things considered harry litman thanks very good to be here merry christmas to everyone limbong yeah merry christmas to you too all right so you ve had a couple days to digest the report right now for those of us who haven t had a chance to get through all 800 pages you know or so is there something in particular that sticks out to you from this report that we didn t you know necessarily get from the multiple hearings the committee held litman so a few things that really struck me first the length of the overall conspiracy so it s clear from the report that before the election they had decided on the big lie strategy and you have some very vivid and profane quotes from roger stone and steve bannon f it we re just going to say we won and you know screw you that s before even the election and then after there s part really of the conspiracy that has to be considered the fundraising that trump did off it where it turns out that was kind of a big grift as the report says he mainly used the money for himself so that was one thing that really struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me as if donald trump s stock is you know it hasn t plunged but it s waning of course he s still a serious candidate but i m looking as a citizen and just an observer to see how much the republican house will really try to make a big deal of the big lie and the kinds of charges against the january 6 committee or the whole investigations in doj and georgia that at least they were doing as of a few months ago limbong that was harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he s the host and executive producer of the talking feds podcast harry

the scranton area bank directed by landfill magnate louis a denaples has handed out the biggest loan yet for 50 million from a taxpayer backed program to help mid sized businesses during the coronavirus pandemic the recipient the mount airy casino resort owned by trusts for denaples children and grandchildren denaples had to relinquish his own ownership to resolve charges that he d concealed his ties to organized crime fncb bank s loan to the casino could throw an unflattering light on the federal government s strategy of deputizing banks to write loans under its 600 billion main street lending program which was authorized this spring over fears that lenders might cease supporting even thriving businesses small banks such as dunmore based fncb don t typically make such large loans and aren t equipped to evaluate repayment risks and other potential perils that come with issuing the large amounts of debt permitted by the federal program analysts said if borrowers default it s mostly the public s money not the bank s that runs the risk of not being repaid this particular case could draw special scrutiny because of the family ties between fncb and the mount airy casino where revenue from gambling had flattened even before the coronavirus stopped its roulette wheels and slots and now threatens to upend the entire gaming industry denaples 79 is chairman of fncb and its biggest shareholder with a 9 2 stake in the bank as of april 3 according to regulatory filings his son louis a denaples jr is also on the board as the bank s vice chairman with a 1 3 stake and is the beneficiary of one of the seven trusts that share ownership of the mount airy casino another board member is denaples nephew joseph l denaples while his brother dominick l denaples is a former chairman who continues to advise the company as director emeritus the loan may not have been possible but for a decision by the federal reserve and the treasury department to exempt the main street program from longstanding rules barring banks from making taxpayer backed loans to businesses owned by their directors but it may still trigger the federal restrictions on insider lending that cover all activity by regulated banks known as regulation o said braden perry a lawyer who specializes in banking compliance if you see a 50 million loan of your money going to an insider or a family member of an insider it certainly raises some concerns said perry who formerly tried cases for a federal financial regulatory agency some critics of the trump administration s response to the coronavirus meanwhile cast the loan as another case of rescue money being channeled away from those who need it most less than a 10th of a percent of the cash available through the fund has been lent while businesses throughout the country could not qualify under the program s relative narrow guidelines or are too beaten down to consider taking on more debt this money was meant to help main street businesses not casinos owned by families with alleged mafia connections said kyle herrig president of left of center watchdog group accountable us the federal reserve which runs the program with cash from the treasury department said in a statement that it is unable to comment on specific transactions there are rules in place against making loans that favor businesses owned by bank officers or owners of a significant interest in the bank it said we expect banks making main street loans or any other loans to follow these rules fncb president jerry a champi said that the bank handles all insider transactions properly but declined to discuss specific steps taken to ensure the mount airy loan s compliance he also said his bank was fully capable of evaluating any risks associated with the large loan not all of us have worked for community banks our whole careers so we have a lot of exposure to the credit underwriting process he said credit is credit casino officials declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that the loan will be used to improve the strength of our business which was deeply impacted by the covid 19 pandemic these funds will be used to secure the jobs of nearly 1 000 pennsylvanians employed by mount airy it said a message left for denaples at his auto parts business was not returned mixing bank business with directors other ventures led to trouble for the bank seven years ago when it paid 5 million to shareholders and their lawyers to settle a lawsuit alleging that it tanked the company s stock price by lending millions of dollars to insiders who then defaulted on the loans one such insider was a bank director michael conahan the onetime luzerne county president judge convicted in the kids for cash scheme during the early 2000s under which the judges sent children to for profit jails and received payoffs federal prosecutors said conahan used the fncb loan to buy a florida condominium used to launder the kickbacks shareholders also faulted the bank in their complaint for abruptly refocusing its lending on land subdivisions and solid waste landfills among the business of denaples and dominick license granted denaples whose sprawling northeastern pennsylvania commercial empire also includes auto salvage yards heavy equipment sales and towing services moved to get into the casino business in 2005 by applying for one of the slot licenses that were newly being awarded in the state he aimed to redevelop the poconos storied mount airy lodge into a gaming resort as a generous political donor and philanthropist with strong ties to business and governmental leaders across the state denaples was seen as a likely licensee common cause pennsylvania a good government advocacy group tallied his contributions to pennsylvania office seekers at 403 125 from 2002 to 07 denaples did have on his record a 1978 no contest plea to charges that he and three others bilked the federal government out of recovery funds following tropical storm agnes but that did not disqualify him thanks to a provision that had been written into pennsylvania s gaming regulations letting applicants off the hook for criminal convictions that occurred more than 15 years in the past louis denaples tosses the ceremonial dice at a craps table at mount airy casino resort in paradise township in 2010 for the start of table gaming his daughter lisa denaples left watches him he was granted his casino license in late 2006 and opened his 412 million resort about a year later by early 2008 however he had been indicted on perjury charges in part for allegedly lying about his relationships to mobsters including william d elia a former leader of the crime family of northeastern pennsylvania kingpin russell bufalino played by joe pesci in the 2019 film the irishman those charges were eventually dropped in a deal that required denaples to pass control of the casino to his adult daughter lisa denaples but louis denaples was allowed to continue advising the casino ownership of the casino s parent company mount airy 1 llc was later divided equally among seven trusts in the names of denaples children and grandchildren records show still louis denaples appears to have remained in the casino s orbit last september fncb sold the casino 2 2 acres of land at the corner of state route 611 and woodland road about a mile southwest of the casino for 375 000 county records show over the years denaples has also repeatedly petitioned state gaming regulators to allow businesses he owns to provide services such as waste disposal or vehicle repairs to the mount airy resort those requests have been rejected under the argument that his deal to hand off the casino barred him from profiting in any way from the resort pennsylvania gaming control board spokesman doug harbach declined to address whether granting the loan might have also violated those terms and what sanctions would apply if it did denaples also joined a ceremony at the casino last year to mark the completion of a 40 million expansion project there the businessman standing between his daughter lisa and state sen mario scavello a republican whose district includes the casino cut the ribbon at the event seen in an online video by the pocono record newspaper a spokesperson for scavello did not return a phone message while it was completing the renovations mount airy had also been mapping out a now lapsed plan to build and operate a separate mini casino about 300 miles to the west in beaver county under the state s 2017 gambling expansion law that allows gaming businesses to apply to open smaller satellite casinos late last year however the gaming board declined to award mount airy a permit for what was to have been called mount airy pittsburgh ruling that the operator had utterly failed to produce any evidence that it can satisfy the financial fitness requirements for this project because no bank would back the 50 million plus project as the gaming market in pennsylvania matures with revenues for mount airy and some other pennsylvania casinos stabilizing mount airy s desire to establish a second casino in western pennsylvania is untenable in the eyes of financiers gaming board chairman david m barasch wrote in the agency s denial notice lending rules relaxed the main street lending program was devised as part of financial rescue legislation in the spring to help businesses that are too big to qualify for the better known paycheck protection program but too small to benefit from the fed s big purchases of corporate debt unlike the ppp program s forgivable loans funds from the main street program must be repaid loan standards are also more selective requiring participants to have been in solid financial shape with a manageable existing debt load before the pandemic banks write loans under the program but are then able to hand 95 of that debt off to the fed so they have fewer of their own assets at risk the idea was to make banks less nervous about lending during what was expected to be a long period of tight credit despite that opportunity to offload risk few banks have so far signed up to participate in the program nationwide only 497 million in main street loans had been made as of aug 19 although details of only the first 92 2 million of that cash accounting for 13 transactions have so far been disclosed the mount airy loan is one of only two in the country that are for more than 5 5 million it appears in county property records as a mortgage on the poconos property against which an affiliate of fortress investment group the new york private equity firm owned by japan s softbank group already had a 170 million loan the fortress loan was increased by 20 million july 13 the same day the casino closed on the 50 million main street loan giving the resort an infusion of 70 million the main street loan is listed as a second lien meaning that fortress would have first dibs on casino assets should the resort be foreclosed on chris marinac who analyzes banks as a research director with financial adviser janney montgomery scott llc said it was extreme for a bank of fncb s size to be making a 50 million loan even if only 2 5 million of that was staying on its books banks tend to make loans of no more than around 1 5 of their asset value so only a little of their capital is tied up in any one venture marinac said for fncb with 1 4 billion in assets that works out to 21 million another potential issue for regulators may be the relationship between the bank s board and the casino s ownership especially louis denaples jr s overlapping ownership interests small business administration regulations that have long governed loans made by banks using federal funds include a provision prohibiting banks from lending to other businesses owned by their directors including ones such as denaples jr who are not also executives the government based its rules for disbursing coronavirus relief funds on those sba regulations but the prohibition on bankers lending to their non executive directors businesses was dropped for ppp since ppp loans are made under the same terms for all borrowers there was no chance of favoring insiders the agency reasoned when the main street loans started up officials largely adopted the modified sba rules for that program as well including the relaxation of insider lending rules designed around ppp the mount airy loan may however be covered by more general regulation o banking rules regarding insiders said perry the banking compliance lawyer the rules set limits on how much a bank can lend to insiders including non executive directors or to their other businesses the rules also require banks to document that loans to insiders don t include preferential terms or are especially risky having louis denaples jr as both a board member and beneficiary of one of the seven trusts that own the casino appears to be the sort of connection the rules would cover perry said it does not look good from an outsider s point of view and is a disservice to the taxpayer if the proper underwriting and vetting procedures were not followed he said

andrew limbong host the house select committee investigating the january 6 attack on the u s capitol released its final report this past thursday and the big top line is that former president donald trump should be prosecuted by the department of justice on four charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the u s by assisting those involved in an insurrection the report is thorough it s more than 800 pages and it offers suggestions for how to protect the american democratic system from possible interference in the future but whatever action comes next could be a question of not just the law but also politics like will the doj actually pursue charges against the former president who is currently running for office again or will they pass to avoid the appearance of partisanship and does the appointment of special counsel jack smith change that calculus at all here to help us think this through is harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he currently hosts the talking feds podcast harry litman welcome back to all things considered harry litman thanks very good to be here merry christmas to everyone limbong yeah merry christmas to you too all right so you ve had a couple days to digest the report right now for those of us who haven t had a chance to get through all 800 pages you know or so is there something in particular that sticks out to you from this report that we didn t you know necessarily get from the multiple hearings the committee held litman so a few things that really struck me first the length of the overall conspiracy so it s clear from the report that before the election they had decided on the big lie strategy and you have some very vivid and profane quotes from roger stone and steve bannon f it we re just going to say we won and you know screw you that s before even the election and then after there s part really of the conspiracy that has to be considered the fundraising that trump did off it where it turns out that was kind of a big grift as the report says he mainly used the money for himself so that was one thing that really struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me as if donald trump s stock is you know it hasn t plunged but it s waning of course he s still a serious candidate but i m looking as a citizen and just an observer to see how much the republican house will really try to make a big deal of the big lie and the kinds of charges against the january 6 committee or the whole investigations in doj and georgia that at least they were doing as of a few months ago limbong that was harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he s the host and executive producer of the talking feds podcast harry

this article was first published on 25th july 2022 the issue and implications of vaccine mandates are far from over cracks in the south african government s duplicitous decision to pass on the implementation of vaccine mandates to big business are starting to show in this article by veteran sa journalist brian pottinger he describes the deal made between big business and the government as a perilous faustian pact whereby big business accepted the outrageous and no doubt also unlawful extension of vaccine mandates to all employees in exchange for the government s promise to end the state of disaster and return south africa to normality this faustian pact referring to faust a german astronomer and necromancer reputed to have sold his soul to the devil is now plaguing big business as increasing studies relating to covid 19 vaccine injuries and deaths are surfacing around the globe those companies that implemented vaccine mandates may eventually have to face up to their accountability for sequential injury and even possible death resulting from these mandates as pottinger puts it no wonder the corporates are jumpy nadya swart questions for big business after its skelm covid 19 vaccine deal with government by brian pottinger standard bank s preemptively smart decision to end mandatory covid 19 vaccines and offer re employment to the dismissed staff who refused the jab opens a pandora s box for south africa s employers the bank s decision was no doubt partly driven by the recent findings of commissioner richard byrne of the commission for conciliation mediation and arbitration ccma that only legislated authority not employers can impose a mandatory vaccine policy and discriminate against those who refuse to do so is unconstitutional and unfair brian pottinger this decision despite two contradictory ones from previous ccma tribunals argued on different facts aligns with the recent united states supreme court judgment and will no doubt accord with a raft of other decisions now imminent in our own and multiple jurisdictions around the world the fact that the unions have also just woken up to the injustice and perhaps harm done to some of their members by enforced vaccination also does not help the employers cause nor a recent south african human rights commission sahrc statement that vaccine mandates by employers in the absence of national legislation are in breach of section 36 of the constitution the ccma decision is unlikely to be taken on review by big business it does not want the issue of its mandatory vaccines vented in the high court or the constitutional court after all its lobby group business unity south africa busa quietly withdrew in march this year its sensible bid for a constitutional court declaratory ruling instead it did a deal with the government a skelm one in exchange for accepting the outrageous and no doubt also unlawful extension to all employees everywhere of the provisions of section 43 of the occupational health and safety act 1993 meant to deal with workplace handling of hazardous biological agents the government as quid pro quo promised to end the state of disaster and return south africa to normality we wish faced with the choice of confronting the government in court over the irrationality and unconstitutionality of its anti covid 19 regime or folding big business folded but the deal has turned out to be a perilous faustian pact the employers have in effect become the implementers of enforced vaccinations on behalf of government and executors of pogroms against dissenting employees now it unravels byrne s judgment reads in part the state has not unfairly discriminated against anyone in terms of vaccine policies no legislation has been passed requiring all employees to be vaccinated there is the rub big business is left holding the syringe while the government shambles left off stage absorbed by its multiple internal and external challenges leaving behind only a set of deeply flawed and highly challengeable regulations issued in terms of the health act the byrne decision also makes clear that employers in any case cannot apply blanket vaccine mandates without specifying why the business cannot function without them that is a huge ask the empirical and scientific evidence makes clear that the so called vaccines do not stop infection or re infection natural immunity is at least equal to or better than vaccine induced immunity and the treatments cannot halt transmission claims that the treatments reduce fatalities infections and severity are meanwhile hugely contested in the scientific community not least because most of the supporting tests egregiously fail to control for the naturally diminishing pathogenic intensity of sarscov2 the most recent swatch of credible research on the omicron variant of sarscov2 indicates the treatments are at best equal to the old style anti flu jab is a quarterly anti flu jab now to become an employment requirement in south africa the proof needed by employers to justify their stance is thus dematerialising before their eyes worse the story has moved on to the big question what is the reason for the huge global increase in non covid 19 deaths which began parallel to the roll out of the mass vaccination programmes in 2020 the one s so enthusiastically supported by companies such as standard bank here must lie all corporates greatest concern in the united kingdom non covid 19 excess deaths deaths in excess of what can normally be expected primarily myocardial and cancer fatalities are alarmingly high amongst young people from 16 39 and those over 60 years of age overall the deaths are 15 9 higher than the five year average of which private home deaths are up 31 5 hospitals 12 1 care homes 10 3 and other 10 1 non covid 19 excess deaths are running nine to one against covid 19 excess deaths and these ostensibly inexplicable total excess deaths are at levels not seen since the height of the sarscov2 outbreak similar patterns are being recorded around the world there are of course the usual suspects the catastrophic decline in national health of countries like the usa and the uk because of lifestyles the withdrawal of health cover during the panic to make space for covid 19 patients who never pitched lowered national immunities from the lockdowns and fatigue poverty and depression consequent on the social psychological and economic impact of the fearsomely misguided anti covid 19 measures but there is an additional obvious villain the covid 19 treatments themselves recent work by danish researchers as only one example tentatively indicates that covid 19 benefits from mrna treatments may in fact be outweighed by negative health effects elsewhere early days sure but that these findings are published at all is remarkable given the obliteration of the reputations and jobs of scientists who dared challenge even the slightest element of the now imploded orthodoxy an intellectual pogrom history will judge to rival the inquisition at the very least this mounting body of measured research is challenging the vaccine manufacturers placatory assurances about adverse effects 1 291 such possible effects for the pfizer mrna treatment alone according to the data a us court forced the pharmaceutical to release in march this year despite its attempts to keep the details secret for 75 years yet these early warning signs have long been submerged in the flood of alternative preprinter research i e not reviewed or critiqued from aggregators of biomedical research content on digital platforms like google overwhelmingly these reports focus on the so called efficacy of the available vaccines in limiting the impact of breakthrough covid 19 infections i e reinfections and mitigating severe infection here is a typical disclaimer from one of them we publish preliminary scientific reports that are not peer reviewed and therefore should not be regarded as conclusive guide clinical practice health related behaviour or treated as established information huh who funds research that even its publishers warn us should not be treated as real information and why do the digital platforms publish it in such endless succession the first is easy to answer the pharmaceutical companies have thrown a fortune in support of this research and there is of course the limitless fund created by bill gates the latter day howard hughes arguably the only man in history other than a god king who has been able to translate his private fetishes and neuroses about germs into game changing consequences for all of us but that perhaps says more about the nature of our crazy era than about bill gates why digital media platforms publish biomedical dreck while ignoring countervailing information is easier to answer purely by example sequoia venture capital is an astonishingly successful silicon valley umbrella company an early and prescient investor in nearly all the major online media and commerce businesses with 1 4 trillion in funds and backing companies with control of 22 of nasdaq one does not have to be a conspiracy theorist to assume it has a major presence and influence in online media platforms in 2021 its two biggest investments were guess what healthcare robinhood and delivery services and e commerce grocery shopping klarna the businesses coincidentally massively benefitting from the covid 19 terror narrative and the lockdowns amazon s net income trebled between 2019 and 2021 google s doubled no conspiracy here just good business bad science has been with us forever the us office of research integrity investigated clinical tests between 1990 and 2003 and found the conclusions in 40 percent of the reports were totally wrong or significantly incorrect other research suggested 80 percent of content found in popular media was either withdrawn disproved or never followed up a recent research paper in the journal trials published in june this year found that 62 percent of randomised biomedical trials were at high risk of bias 30 were unclear and only eight percent low risk in short the bulk were not worth the money thrown at them this wonky biomedical research and the digital media s propagation of it has exacted a fearful price in terms of public trust the latest prestigious reuters institute digital news report produced every year to test consumer attitude observes a depressing loss of trust in digital media and a truly alarming public disengagement from media altogether respondents reported seeing more false information about covid 19 on these controlled online media platforms than even about politics which says it all yet it is on this weak and in some cases malicious biomedical science relentlessly and indeed almost exclusively propounded by mainstream and digital media that south african employers have bet the shareholders silver two principles of law come to mind first the duty of care and second ignorance is no defence did the big corporates with their vast resources make any attempt to penetrate the veil of pandemonium erected by biomedical self interest corporate profit governmental power grabs corruption and swivel eyed twitterati did they properly evaluate the countervailing and easily available early scientific opinions before embarking on the draconian step of mass injecting uncertain content into their employees why did they not just send sick colleagues home to get well after all it has been done that way throughout modern history when a truly bad coronavirus is about and a last consideration the south african government through its investment in the biovac consortium is about to enter the business of manufacturing pfizer biontech mrna and new generation covid 19 vaccines despite the sarscov2 virus now being endemic and only ever having a global infection fatality rate ifr of 0 15 no worse than the very severe flu outbreaks of 1957 and 1968 problem there are no takers for the product less than two out of five south africans are double vaccinated and only five per cent boosted the principle that once bitten twice shy clearly prevails the continental record is even worse did corporate south africa know when it took on the role of vaccine enforcer on behalf of government that it was also serving this presidential prestige project and boy does the president need prestige now that it s partner in the faustian pact was conflicted itself an investor in future generation covid 19 treatments and that it was desperate for customers willing or not by any means necessary the answers are critical it moves the quantum of employer accountability in this extraordinary saga this medieval moment beyond technicalities of labour law and

manufacturers face the possibility of a contracting market photo duc thanh in recent months it has become apparent that foreign organisations have increased their growth estimates for 2022 while simultaneously adjusting their growth forecasts for vietnam s economy in 2023 a few days ago hsbc increased its growth projection for vietnam in 2022 from 7 6 per cent to 8 1 per cent in addition to describing 2022 as a year of rapid economic recovery and stating that vietnam remains one of asia s leading growth economies hsbc raised concerns about the economy s risks therefore this bank predicts that vietnam s economic growth will decrease to 5 8 per cent in 2023 rather than the previously predicted 6 per cent similarly the asian development bank adb raised vietnam s growth prediction for this year to 7 5 per cent much higher than the 6 5 per cent number given in september 2022 while lowering its growth forecast for 2023 by 0 4 percentage points to 6 3 per cent explaining the revision of vietnam s growth prediction for 2023 hsbc said that growing trade barriers would pose hurdles to vietnam s economic development in 2020 according to hsbc export growth slowed significantly in october 2022 after increasing by more than 17 per cent annually over the first three quarters of 2022 even november saw a considerable reduction in the past two years compared to the same month the previous year according to the ministry of planning and investment mpi the country s import export turnover declined by 7 8 per cent in november compared to the same month in the previous year when exports fell by 8 4 per cent the primary cause is the contracting export market orders for textiles footwear electronics and furniture fell even during the christmas shopping season input prices are high and input supply is in limited supply said tran quoc phuong deputy minister of planning and investment as a result of declining exports industrial output has shown symptoms of stalling in november the index of industrial output climbed by just 5 3 per cent less than the growth rate in october and less than half the pace in september this highlights why vietnam s manufacturing industry s purchasing managers index achieved 47 4 points in november 2022 down from 50 6 points in october the world bank has raised concern as exports and domestic consumption two key development drivers for vietnam have slowed mpi is likewise concerned about this particularly when cash flow and liquidity issues make it impossible for companies to operate moreover according to mpi reducing labour and working hours is reappearing particularly in labour intensive industries and key exports such as textiles footwear wood processing electronics food services and tourism negatively impacting people s income and quality of life the primary cause is that businesses must scale down production and operations due to a lack of orders and rising input prices conquering headwinds vietnam s economy faces several dangers and obstacles particularly considering that the global economy is expected to become tougher in the next year since the us is vietnam s largest export market the american recession could significantly impact on the nation s economy while there are no strong indications that china may reopen its economy in the near future vietnam s other main economic partner japan has recently had inflation at a 40 year high the economy of europe is also experiencing challenges this situation poses a significant problem for vietnam since the miracle of exporting more than 700 billion in 2022 is likely to be disrupted vietnam must also prepare for the hibernation of exports hsbc said according to andrew jeffries director of the southeast asia energy division of adb vietnam headwinds will emerge in 2023 notably monetary tightening a decline in global demand for vietnamese exports and bond market anomalies vietnam s policy measures must balance reducing inflation and preserving economic development while safeguarding the operation of the financial system last week tran tuan anh chairman of the central economic commission also talked about this during the 5th vietnam economic forum tuan anh said the worldwide downturn in trade and investment is having severe effects on economies particularly emerging nations like vietnam tuan anh cited difficulties such as the instability of the real estate market the capital market and the resistance to shocks as internal economic challenges that vietnam must address andrea coppola chief economist for the wb in vietnam also said that china europe and the united states were experiencing a time of weakness because monetary policy tightening exacerbates headwinds for emerging markets and developing economies the headwinds seem to be increasing in strength the question is how vietnam will overcome the headwinds of 2023 vietnam s policy actions must find a compromise between containing inflation and preserving economic development while guaranteeing the proper operation of the financial system jeffries said in the meantime coppola advised vietnam to manage the currency rate flexibly unify monetary and fiscal policy and address liquidity issues in the banking and real estate sectors the nation must enhance its oversight and debt settlement regulatory frameworks to decrease risks and restore investor confidence budget resolutions set plan for 2023 vietnam s state budget performance is expected to see a deficit of billions of us dollars this year with such a landscape fixed for next year with warnings sounded about

nastassia samal the past two years have been busier from an m a standpoint in the precious metals space but we ve seen a marked slowdown in activity over the past year in fact after two massive deals and several small deals from q4 2020 to q4 2021 kirkland lake saracen roxgold jerritt canyon teranga great bear tmac pretium premier bateman corvus in the producer developer space it s been a relatively quiet year the only real deals of significance among producers and developers were the acquisitions of golden star orca and kupol a slew of non core asset sales boto rosebel mercedes chirano karma crown sterling and gold fields gfi offer to acquire yamana gold auy some gold fields shareholders weren t elated with the latter and some yamana shareholders considered it a bit of a take under and not the best fit however the recent major development was agnico eagle aem and pan american s nyse paas creative deal to come over the top of gold fields with a superior offer 15 premium to the implied price of gfi offer that would give shareholders currency in the world s lowest cost senior producer cash and shares in pan american meanwhile the deal is more straightforward with only 50 01 of paas shareholders required to vote in favor no vote required from aem shareholders and the same 66 7 of votes needed by yamana shareholders as the gold fields deal but no review under the investment canada act with all three being canadian companies i ve already discussed the deal in length for agnico eagle and in this update we ll look at how this deal looks for pan american silver and why i think it s positive for the company yamana gold pour yamana presentation a closer look at the deal for those unfamiliar with the deal agnico eagle will be acquiring 50 of canadian malartic wasamac and three non core exploration properties as part of the superior yamana offer and the company is paying a slight premium to net asset for these assets given their excellent fit in agnico s portfolio meanwhile pan american will be acquiring its latin american portfolio which includes multiple operating mines jacobina cerro moro minera florida el penon a 56 interest in a major copper gold development project in argentina a development stage gold project also in argentina suyai and a 57 interest in jeronimo part of the agua de la falda joint venture in chile let s take a closer look below yamana operating assets company presentation as shown in the image above the primary rationale for the acquisition is to add an operating mine in a region where pan american already operates cerro moro in southern argentina while adding three other gold mines in neighboring countries to a large portion of its production profile in bolivia and peru these three mines are jacobina brazil minera florida chile and el penon chile while they may not be in the same country as pan american s assets pan american will see synergies from regional procurement plus no need for two corporate offices in canada yamana and pan american based on the most recent presentation pan american estimates post tax synergies of 400 to 600 million over ten years yamana reserves yamana presentation looking closer at yamana s assets above pan american will add 8 4 million ounces of gold reserves at operating mines and 5 1 million ounces of reserves at non operating assets in addition it will add 55 million ounces of silver at operating assets and 57 million ounces of silver at non operating assets 56 interest in mara this will place pan american well ahead of its peers in terms of total silver reserves largely due to escobal in guatemala which is currently in care maintenance and home to over 260 million ounces of silver the hope is to restart escobal a mine whose license was suspended years ago under tahoe if successful it would produce up to 20 million ounces of silver per annum for pan american moving over to the gold business pan american will see a healthy increase in its gold reserve base improving from 3 6 million ounces to 12 0 million ounces which doesn t include non operating assets non operating assets like its mara interest and jeronimo given that its mara is a large and capex heavy project being added to an already significant pipeline pan american s escobal la arena sulphides and la colorada skarn the company may look at divesting one of these projects given that it can t possibly develop this massive pipeline which includes jacobina complex on its own any time this decade combined capex for mara la colorada skarn la arena sulphides likely to come in well over 4 0 billion the new pan american silver assuming the deal closes the new pan american silver will look much different and will see a meaningful improvement in diversification from the addition of yamana s operating assets the chart below shows that these assets all have respectable production profiles with 20 000 to 55 000 gold equivalent ounces per quarter or roughly 700 000 geos per annum ex canadian malartic if we look at the second chart below we can see what the combined company would have looked like in q2 and q3 2022 assuming these assets were in pan american s portfolio as we can see this creates a more diversified miner that will also benefit from a lower cost profile yamana gold quarterly production by mine company filings author s chart pan american silver quarterly production by mine q2 2022 q3 2022 if yamana assets were in portfolio company filings author s chart based on the above production profile pan american would have eleven operating assets placing it in a similar position to agnico eagle and gold fields in terms of diversification albeit these are obviously much less productive assets on a per ounce basis evidenced by pan american s smaller production profile still when operating in some non tier 1 jurisdictions diversification is certainly a key attribute if pan american can bring one of its development projects or escobal online later this decade this number would increase to 12 or higher making pan american one of the most diversified producers sector wide it s also worth noting that there is considerable upside at existing assets meaning that pan american would not need to increase its number of assets to grow production this includes a massive boost to the production of the la colorada mine if the nearby la colorada skarn is green lighted pea due 2023 plus steady organic growth at jacobina if this asset heads toward an ultimate goal of 15 000 tonnes per day 350 000 ounces per annum the below chart shows how jacobina s production profile could progress if pan american approves an expansion to jacobina with the potential to produce up to 90 000 ounces per quarter in the back half of this decade once fully ramped up jacobina production profile long term potential company presentation meanwhile taking a quick look at la colorada skarn this is an incredible asset for pan american silver the recent project update highlights a polymetallic resource of 244 million tonnes with a rock value north of 130 tonne if the company chose sub level caving as the optimal mining method assuming a throughput rate of 18 000 tonnes per day 6 5 million tonnes per annum and depending on recoveries payability this looks like it could be a 20 million ounce per annum operation on a silver equivalent basis making this one of the most attractive silver development projects in north america from a scale standpoint it s also worth noting that recent drill results have extended the high grade silver zone since the resource update with a highlight intercept of 194 meters at 48 grams per tonne of silver 0 21 copper 2 97 lead and 4 26 zinc or a rock value of 390 tonne for this intercept as it stands it s tough to pin down how this project could look if it is green lighted given that much more work needs to be done to determine the best way to mine this project however in the most recent conference call pan american s coo steve busby noted that the high grade zone could provide the opportunity to use long hole stoping in the earlier years which would have a lower throughput rate than sub level caving but benefit from significantly higher grades to summarize pan american already had a very impressive pipeline it wasn t getting much credit for la arena sulphides escobal restart la colorada skarn and this development pipeline has seen a further boost with the addition of yamana s development assets putting it all together if we put these production profiles together and look at potential 2023 production pan american should see annual production of 28 million ounces of silver and 1 08 million ounces of gold moving it into the million ounce producer space on a gold basis with a hefty silver component as well while the company may appear to have shed its silver status with the significant growth in gold production it s worth noting that escobal alone could push pan american s long term silver production above 45 million ounces and la colorada skarn would also provide a very significant boost to production hence unlike fortuna silver fsm which is overdue for a name change with less than 20 of revenue from silver once seguela reaches commercial production paas silver percentage of revenue may have dropped to nearly 25 still its pipeline could lead to a meaningful improvement in this ratio pan american silver annual gold silver production 2023 potential company filings author s chart estimates meanwhile from a jurisdictional standpoint pan american will have a much more significant presence in central and south america which would grow further assuming jacobina phase 4 is approved and escobal comes online however it will continue to have a meaningful production profile in north america with its largest silver producer la colorada the potential development of la colorada skarn dolores and its timmins operation in canada the result is that pan american will be very well rounded from a diversification standpoint with multiple countries and assets significantly reducing the impact of any potential issues at a single operation let s take a look at the valuation future portfolio jurisdictional profile company presentation valuation based on 364 million shares and a share price of us 16 80 pan american will have a market cap of 6 12 billion assuming the deal goes through a very reasonable valuation for a producer with a production profile of 1 5 million gold equivalent ounces this is especially true given that pan american would have a phenomenal pipeline that isn t reflected in its current production that would include a controlling interest in the massive mara project argentina the la colorada skarn polymetallic deposit mexico the la arena sulphides gold copper project peru the 20 million ounce per annum escobal mine bolivia an enviable organic growth profile at the low cost jacobina mine brazil lastly it s important to note that these are brownfields assets or already built escobal and jacobina that benefit from existing infrastructure making them much more attractive than other undeveloped assets globally comparing this market cap figure to an estimated net asset value of 6 9 billion 10 discount rate for escobal and 5 for other assets leaves pan american trading at a discount to its net asset value based on what i believe to be a fair multiple of 1 20x p nav to reflect its strong gold assets and silver exposure partially offset by limited exposure to top 10 jurisdictions i see a fair value for pan american of 8 3 billion or a fair value of us 22 80 per share if we measure from a current share price of us 16 80 this translates to a 36 upside from current levels despite the recent rally in the stock given that i require a minimum 35 discount to fair value to justify starting new positions in large cap precious metals names pan american silver is not in a low risk buy zone currently with the low risk buy zone coming in at us 14 80 or lower hence i am not long the stock currently and have chosen to focus on other names for the time being with deeper discounts to fair value such as sandstorm gold royalties sand which trades at a similar p nav multiple to pan american despite a lower risk business model higher margins inflation resistant superior diversification that said if pan american were to pull back toward its november lows i would strongly consider starting a new position in the stock summary while i believe that agnico eagle got the better part of the auy deal and will see less post acquisition hangover given that it is consolidating an existing asset with minimal share dilution and no added complexity this is a transformational deal for pan american in fact i can t think of a better choice from an acquisition standpoint with a fair price paid to acquire solid assets that provide it with improved diversification an increase in its net asset value and margin expansion additionally pan american could reduce its leverage ratio by divesting mara given that it has a lot on its plate from a capex standpoint with four monster projects in the wings and a significant expansion at jacobina to summarize i see this as an intelligent move by pan american that will elevate the company to the upper ranks of the million ounce producer space by 2026 and right near northern star otcpk nesrf and endeavour on a geo basis with further growth to nearly 2 0 million geos if escobal can move back online so with improved diversification a more respectable margin profile an improved sg profile due to yamana s relatively low greenhouse gas emissions and a very impressive pipeline i would expect any sharp pullbacks below us 14 80 in paas to provide buying opportunities

andrew limbong host the house select committee investigating the january 6 attack on the u s capitol released its final report this past thursday and the big top line is that former president donald trump should be prosecuted by the department of justice on four charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the u s by assisting those involved in an insurrection the report is thorough it s more than 800 pages and it offers suggestions for how to protect the american democratic system from possible interference in the future but whatever action comes next could be a question of not just the law but also politics like will the doj actually pursue charges against the former president who is currently running for office again or will they pass to avoid the appearance of partisanship and does the appointment of special counsel jack smith change that calculus at all here to help us think this through is harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he currently hosts the talking feds podcast harry litman welcome back to all things considered harry litman thanks very good to be here merry christmas to everyone limbong yeah merry christmas to you too all right so you ve had a couple days to digest the report right now for those of us who haven t had a chance to get through all 800 pages you know or so is there something in particular that sticks out to you from this report that we didn t you know necessarily get from the multiple hearings the committee held litman so a few things that really struck me first the length of the overall conspiracy so it s clear from the report that before the election they had decided on the big lie strategy and you have some very vivid and profane quotes from roger stone and steve bannon f it we re just going to say we won and you know screw you that s before even the election and then after there s part really of the conspiracy that has to be considered the fundraising that trump did off it where it turns out that was kind of a big grift as the report says he mainly used the money for himself so that was one thing that really struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me as if donald trump s stock is you know it hasn t plunged but it s waning of course he s still a serious candidate but i m looking as a citizen and just an observer to see how much the republican house will really try to make a big deal of the big lie and the kinds of charges against the january 6 committee or the whole investigations in doj and georgia that at least they were doing as of a few months ago limbong that was harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he s the host and executive producer of the talking feds podcast harry litman thanks a lot for sharing your insights with us litman really good to be here thank you soundbite of music transcript provided by npr copyright npr

percentage point its seventh increase in 2022 the latest move lifted the fed s target rate into a range between 4 25 percent and 4 5 percentâ the highest level in 15 years the half percentage point

there was an ominous momentum to british politics in 2022 this truly epic period in british politics saw two conservative leadership contests two monarchs three prime ministers four chancellors six fiscal events and it all culminated in considerable market turmoil factor in the ongoing complexities over brexit the debilitating legacy of covid lockdowns a surge of small boats crossing the channel putin s brutal invasion of ukraine and a global cost of everything crisis and you get a year of sobering crippling uncertainty the unrelenting pace of british politics created a sense of permanent crisis or permacrisis as collins dictionary s word of the year would have it in some senses a 2022 year in review is an impossible task the cascading pace of politics over the past 365 days makes any attempt to weave a neat narrative through events difficult indeed there is also the unavoidable fact that britain s incessant turmoil developed alongside an increasingly intricate international picture how do you make sense of britain s domestic doom loop against the background of deep geopolitical fragility redefined by the ukraine war in the end it is the causally separate but savagely simultaneous nature of our political problems that gives meaning to britain s permacrisis the feeling of lurching from one distinct crisis to the next is all too familiar as is the sense of dread developed in wondering how events will unravel next this brings us to the final problem of a 2022 year in review for britain s permacrisis is far from over unprecedented industrial action grips britain in a way the country has not experienced since the 70s and with both the unions and the government digging in there is little sign of this crisis subsiding in short 2022 was a year where the only certainty was chaos we begin with boris boris johnson s three p s the tone of 2022 s political drama was arguably set in january by the drip drip of stories around rule breaking gatherings in downing street after a string of denials through the latter parts of 2021 boris johnson offered his heartfelt apologies to the house of commons chamber on the 12th it came after reports emerged that the prime minister had attended a drinks reception on 20 may 2020 an initial report from everyone s favourite secret whitehall mandarin sue gray followed with the full publication delayed until after the metropolitan police concluded its own investigation the force eventually issued 126 fixed penalty notices to 83 people including the prime minister his wife carrie and the chancellor rishi sunak sue gray s final report in may summed up and broke down more than 300 photos of alleged wrongdoings alongside the details of mass illegality within number 10 gray issued a damning judgement the events that i investigated were attended by leaders in government many of these events should not have been allowed to happen it is also the case that some of the more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders the senior leadership at the centre both political and official must bear responsibility for this culture with the political winds blowing against the prime minister operation save big dog was launched a shadowy whipping operation by number 10 designed to win over conservative mps as the revelations piled up not only was the operation unsuccessful but the appointment of chris pincher as deputy chief whip would create further problems down the line on june 6 enough letters had been submitted to 1922 backbench committee chair sir graham brady to trigger a confidence election it saw 41 of conservative mps vote against johnson a worse result than thatcher in 1990 major in 1995 and may in 2018 the prime minister insisted that this was a positive conclusive decisive result but he was fatally wounded how could he pitch to the electorate that he was the best pm for the job when 41 of his own mps disagreed on june 23 the conservative party lost two by elections wakefield a red wall constituency went back to labour with an 8 6 swing and tiverton and honiton a true blue rural seat went to the liberal democrats with a 38 swing both sides of johnson s 2019 winning coalition were being ripped apart oliver dowden resigned as party chairman and the conservative party s grumbling grew louder still the final straw was the chris pincher affair pincher appointed deputy chief whip in february resigned from his position after allegations emerged that he had harassed a young conservative researcher at a private members club pincher denies the allegations johnson s response was familiar he denied that he had been made aware of alleged wrongdoings prior to pincher s appointment as deputy chief whip and sent out ministers junior and senior to affirm as much in a media circus but ministers who had swallowed the government line were quickly undermined by a bombshell letter from the former head of the foreign office simon mcdonald which revealed that johnson had been told of previous allegations before pincher s appointment after patersongate at the end of 2021 partygate through 2022 and now the pincher affair ministers had finally had enough sajid javid the then health secretary channelled geoffrey howe in his resignation and subsequent commons address in the end over 60 ministers resigned from the government in a bid to force johnson out after much self important dither and delay the prime minister eventually resigned at the eleventh hour on 7 july in his final speech as prime minister delivered on the steps of downing street johnson said when the herd moves it moves in truth it had been a stampede conservative leadership contest 1 0 after johnson s defenestration came the summer 2022 leadership contest conservative mps from all corners of the party lined up as potential predecessors the runners and riders including kemi badenoch suella braverman jeremy hunt rishi sunak penny mordaunt liz truss tom tugenhat nadim zahawi sajid javid grant shapps and who can forget rehman chishti as rishi sunak ploughed ahead with mp endorsements a battle emerged on the party right over who would be the candidate to challenge him in the final round of voting the votes of badenoch and braverman fell behind liz truss giving her enough backers to overtake mordaunt and take on sunak in a ballot of the membership the two final leadership contenders clashed in a series of unedifying bouts at hustings and on tv debates the key divide was over taxes and fiscal policy truss economic proposals were dismissed as fantasy economics by sunak dominic raab who emerged as sunak s chief attack dog rubbished the plans as an electoral suicide note but sunak s attacks did not stop truss from winning 57 4 of the conservative members vote a less than expected but still decisive margin of victory the trussonomics interregnum two days after taking office truss stood in the house of commons to announce her energy support package she said her tax cutting plan for growth would follow a few days later but when the prime minister sat down she was passed a note informing her the queen was on her deathbed the monarch died several hours later the 10 day mourning period that followed is thought to have focussed minds considerably in number 10 an inner circle including truss and chancellor kwasi kwarteng began to draw up proposals significantly more radical than anything aired in the leadership contest the cap on bankers bonuses was to be scrapped so too the 45 per cent top tax rate on earnings of over 150 000 a series of reforms dubbed operation rolling thunder covering issues as diverse as financial services childcare and farming were sounded but ultimately put on hold whitehall was working overtime to deliver on truss timetable kwarteng s fiscal event coined the mini budget was announced in a statement to the commons on 23 september it was intended to mark a clear moment of departure for britain no longer would any concession be made to fears about public finances or concerns about opinion polls there would be no more apologetic compromise conservatism but the plans were met with an almost instantaneous rejection by the financial markets and global currency traders the pound dropped to a low of 1 05 interest rates spiked pension funds teetered on the edge and the bank of england began buying bonds to prop up the british economy the world watched in awe as the invisible hand of the market strangled truss economic dream at its birth a rapid ragged retreat followed truss worked to re embed the very same treasury orthodoxy she had so consummately opposed over the summer kwarteng was summoned back from an imf meeting in washington to attend his own political execution truss dream of turning britain into a small state low tax beacon of free enterprise had not even made it out of the pit lane jeremy hunt who had stood in the summer contest on a platform of cuts even more drastic than that delivered in the mini budget was tasked with ruthlessly piecing fiscal orthodoxy back together as the new chancellor but it was too late for truss after confusion broke out over whether a commons vote on fracking was a vote of confidence in the government the prime minister s position became untenable a fed up charles walker provided an appropriate summary i really shouldn t say this but i hope that all those people that put liz truss in number 10 i hope it was worth it i hope it was worth it for the ministerial red box i hope it was worth it to sit around the cabinet table because the damage they have done to our party is extraordinary on the evening of the 24th of october the prime minister had a meeting with executioner in chief sir graham brady she announced her resignation the next day conservative leadership contest 2 0 2022 s second conservative leadership contest took place over the space of four days a stark contrast to the months long battles between truss and sunak in the summer in retrospect it is easy to forget just how close both penny mordaunt and boris johnson came to entering re entering downing street a galvanised johnson newly returned from his holiday retreat in the caribbean took to gathering parliamentary support brady has since confirmed that johnson had the 100 plus backers needed to trigger a membership ballot conversely penny mordaunt is thought to have gathered the support of around 90 mps had either candidate to faced sunak in a ballot of the membership polls suggested they would have won however both johnson and mordaunt dropped out before the close of nominations and sunak was coronated as conservative leader and hence prime minister on 25 october sunak was now locked on a course dictated by the very economic establishment that truss wanted to knock down retaining hunt as chancellor the autumn statement delivered on november 14th was the most austere economic plan since george osborne s emergency budget in 2011 it was a dramatic about turn from the heady days of trussonomics with the new revenue raising measures increasing the tax burden to the highest level since wwii the permacrisis continues despite this surreal route to the top sunak arrived at number 10 with the promise that he would draw a line under conservative anarchy and restore orderly government to britain but sunak s premiership while still in its early stages has not been easy going gavin williamson was forced to resign as a cabinet minister over a bullying scandal two weeks after his appointment this followed a heated debate over suella braverman s reappointment who had resigned as home secretary after a breach of ministerial rules under truss then there were two significant u turns over central housebuilding targets and onshore wind further proof that sunak was not yet strong enough to stand up to backbench criticism and now we have a new wave of strikes continued from the summer but greater in number and more targeted all this is evidence that the manic mayhem at the apex of politics seen through the violent swings in the fortunes of conservative

andrew limbong host the house select committee investigating the january 6 attack on the u s capitol released its final report this past thursday and the big top line is that former president donald trump should be prosecuted by the department of justice on four charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the u s by assisting those involved in an insurrection the report is thorough it s more than 800 pages and it offers suggestions for how to protect the american democratic system from possible interference in the future but whatever action comes next could be a question of not just the law but also politics like will the doj actually pursue charges against the former president who is currently running for office again or will they pass to avoid the appearance of partisanship and does the appointment of special counsel jack smith change that calculus at all here to help us think this through is harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he currently hosts the talking feds podcast harry litman welcome back to all things considered harry litman thanks very good to be here merry christmas to everyone limbong yeah merry christmas to you too all right so you ve had a couple days to digest the report right now for those of us who haven t had a chance to get through all 800 pages you know or so is there something in particular that sticks out to you from this report that we didn t you know necessarily get from the multiple hearings the committee held litman so a few things that really struck me first the length of the overall conspiracy so it s clear from the report that before the election they had decided on the big lie strategy and you have some very vivid and profane quotes from roger stone and steve bannon f it we re just going to say we won and you know screw you that s before even the election and then after there s part really of the conspiracy that has to be considered the fundraising that trump did off it where it turns out that was kind of a big grift as the report says he mainly used the money for himself so that was one thing that really struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me as if donald trump s stock is you know it hasn t plunged but it s waning of course he s still a serious candidate but i m looking as a citizen and just an observer to see how much the republican house will really try to make a big deal of the big lie and the kinds of charges against the january 6 committee or the whole investigations in doj and georgia that at least they were doing as of a few months ago limbong that was harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he s the host and executive producer of the talking feds podcast harry litman thanks a lot for sharing your insights with us litman really good to be here thank you soundbite of music transcript provided by npr copyright npr

the geostrategic importance of the caribbean he launch ed a bold caribbean basin initiative or cbi as it generally is known to forge a partnership with the private sector to pour billions of dollars and much human energy into resolving the region s pressing economic political social and security problems young americans indeed even fought and died for the freedom of grenada the new u s relationship with the nations of the caribbean promised a glowing future for the region yet today the caribbean s future seems barely brighter than it did six years ag o the u s gains in central america including blunting a communist takeover of el salvador and taming nicaragua s aggression have not been matched by similar successes in the broad two million square mile caribbean area with its more than one dozen isl a nd nations economic problems have not been alleviated despite massive amounts of u s aid cuban soviet and even libyan efforts to destabilize the caribbean are increasing and the strength of their leftist allies in the english speaking islands is gro wing as a result the cbi is widely labeled a failure caribbean the time has come for reappraising u s policy toward the doing so should prompt a number of actions 1 flaws in u s development assistance programs must be corrected with greater emphasi s on structural economic reforms and development based on ma ster plans instead of a piecemeal approach among them 2 congress should remove remaining u s barriers to caribbean imports and should offer tax incentives to private u s firms investing in t h e region 3 to check the caribbean network of pro soviet revolutionaries caribbean nations police forces must be upgraded and strengthened 4 perhaps most important the u s must emphasize to its caribbean friends that no amount of financial aid will b ring economic revitalization unless they are willing to adopt fully free market economic principles the caribbean s importance to the u s the appearance of a soviet satellite regime in cuba in the early 1960s followed in the next dozen years by britain s withdrawal from the west indies gradually awakened u s policy makers to their new responsibilities in the region thirteen new nations have emerged in the caribbean nearly equalling in number the older independent countries of latin america these fle d gling caribbean democracies were vulnerable to communist destabilization because of economic and social weaknesses coups d etat brought soviet allied regimes to power in grenada and nicaragua while leftist governments emerged in jamaica guyana suriname and elsewhere recognizing that stable democracies and unrestricted economic growth represent the best obstacle to communist expansion the reagan administration took an active role in promoting the transition from dictatorship to democracy in central am erica and the caribbean economic support and developmental assistance to the region reached unprecedented levels topping 1 billion in fiscal year 1985 while security assistance was provided to defeat soviet subsidized revolutionaries the u s joined seven caribbean democracies jamaica barbados antigua st lucia dominica st vincent and st kitts nevis to restore order and pluralism to grenada and eradicate a strategically important soviet cuban bas e the administration s most important vehicle for transformation of the region was the caribbean basin economic recovery act of 1983 which codified the cbi conceived as a means of coupling increased economic aid with giving most caribbean exports unimpeded access to most important u s economic policies comparable to the 1934 reciprocal trade agreements act and the 1947 general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt within the cbi context the reagan administration sought to stimulate private investment in the caribbean via tax breaks and risk insurance provided by the overseas private investment corporation opic u s markets the cbi had the potential of being one of this century s 2the caribbean today despite such efforts the economic and security situa t ion has improved very little for the majority of caribbean iations has not sparked significant growth in the anglophone islands of the cbi jamaica grenada st vincent and their neighbors in the eastern caribbean foreign direct investment has been slig ht pro u s governments moreover are in serious political trouble and the far left remains a potent force economic problems during the nearly three years that the cbi has been in effect the value of exports from cbi designated nations has declined sign ificantly overall expprts to the u s from the caribbean region fell 23 percent last year unemployment now averages between 15 and 25 percent of the caribbean basin s work force constant dollar per capita income has fallen and regional debt has mounte d to stave off economic collapse many island states are dependent on u s economic support funds esf and multilateral loans yet latin america and the caribbean are now repaying the u s for previous development assistance loans at a level that exceeds new u s loans to the region this means that as far as loans go more dollars are leaving the region than arriving inflation throughout the islands is rampant and imported goods are so expensive relative to average income that purchasers of automobile s in some countries need 15 years to pay for them taking out loans similar to u s real estate mortgages in jamaica nearly 1 billion of u s assistance has made little this has embarrassed the white house since jamaican economic impact prime minister edward seaga boasted that his nation was the bept example of what the caribbean basin initiative can ac omplish the government bureaucracy is such an impediment to legitimate businessmen that according to the jamaican chamber of commerce the undergroy nd economy now accounts for over half of the island s total economy grenada another country designated as a model of the triumph of the free market over

textiles and garments petroleum products canned tuna frozen citrus juices and leather goods such as footware and luggage heavy lobbying by the afl cio moreover blocked reagan s proposal for a 10 percent tax credit for new u s investments in the region among them although union concerns about the possible loss of u s jobs to caribbean based competitors are understandable the data indicate that u s domestic employment and industrial production actually might benefit from an undiluted cbi in fact the region s deteriorating economy has ied to a decrease in demand for u s goods for example a 300 million decline in u s expoorts to the caribbean costs the u s economy some ten thousand jobs total production of the caribbean basin is equivalent to only about 2 percent of the u s gross

sic infrastructure development for essential services such as water and electricity rather than on less vital projects such as the highway program in grenada the large number of relatively costly and unproductive feasibility studies funded for individual projects throughout the region also should be reduced in favor of single development master plans such as the one proposed for belize by that country s prime minister manuel esquivel and the u s firm of j bruce hildebrand and associates master plans wo u ld allow the governments of developing nations to make timely better informed decisions in an integrated rather than piecemeal way such plans could save millions of dollars now spent unnecessarily because they would prioritize projects and make sure t hey were done at the right time in the right place and for the right price i the u s also should insist much more than it has that u s economic support be contingent on recipient governmentsi efforts to adopt free market policy and institutional refo rms to ease the region s enormous debt burden the u s should consider writing off alliance for progress and later loans under the proviso that at least half of the funds be invested

the fault of caribbean leaders who refuse to abandon the statist policies that sti fle economic growth even without cbi ca ribbean nations could accomplish a great deal by making structural changes among them tax reform although jamaica has cut some taxes to spur investment rates remain high in most other countries of the region th e tax collection system in most countries is so antiquated that little revenue is actually collected leading countries such as grenada to replace income taxes with an unusually heavy 20 percent value added tax vat the vat has hurt small consumers and co n tributed very little to government revenues for business activity has moved underground vat rates should be reduced to between 5 and 10 percent so that the cost of paying the tax becomes less than the cost of avoiding it this would dramatically improve collections another approach could be a flat tax in the 15 to 20 percent range applicable to all incomes above a certain level state owned enterprises even in such vocally pro free market countries as jamaica and grenada while not many local businessme n have the capital to buy such enterprises as oil refineries and electric power plants from the state public offerings of shares in these assets could be made on a new regional stock exchange would open new sources of capital caribbean governments also s hould remove obstacles to foreign investors who wish to purchase divested assets the policy of debt equity swapping forgiving debt in exchange for shares in businesses now being practiced by other developing nations could serve to reduce foreign debt whi l e easing the sale of nonessential state enterprises privatization of parastatals the region has privatized few this reaulation although most governments have created special agencies to facilitate foreign direct investment most of these agencies seem t o compound the problems of an unwieldy bureaucracy review of proposals haggling over investment incentives and granting of licenses may take months predictably causing some frustrated investors to abandon their projects the cbi countries should stream line investment promotion agencies and give them greater autonomy the overall level of regulation also should be reduced throughout the caribbean 7trade jamaican prime minister seaga is asking the u s to increase substantially the amount of textiles th a t the caribbean is allowed to export to the u s under the multi fiber agreement extra allotment would offset the decrease in asian textile exports to the u s mandated by the latest version of the agreement an expansion of free trade throughout the regi o n meanwhile would open additional markets for u s producers of raw materials both the u s and caribbean governments also should consider creating a caribbean common market encompassing central america and the caribbean rim countries of colombia and venezuela liberalized trade policies would spur investment by contributing to the free flow of capital throughout the region this conclusion the caribbean is far more than a region of struggling young democracies and fragile economies of little importanc e to americans except as exotic vacation spots in a very real sense the region is the united states fourth border history has demonstrated that a great power s ability to maintain its global strength can be achieved only by ensuring the security of its borders the well being of the u s is therefore inextricably linked with the economic growth and political stability of the caribbean for this reason it is vital for the cbi to be restored to its

diversity is needed to make business smarter says ceo fiona frick wants to build bridges between the financial industry sustainability and academia showmedialive women remain few and far between in top positions in the world of finance fiona frick ceo of asset management company unigestion is an exception swi swissinfo ch spoke to the geneva executive one of the most influential women in european finance who is standing down as ceo at the end of the year 7 minutes swi swissinfo ch you climbed the career ladder at unigestion whereas in your native france top graduates from the elite institutions start in high level positions which is the better model fiona frick i favour a mix of career profiles in our field team members should come from all sorts of career backgrounds engineers historians people who have done a practical apprenticeship and yes people from elite institutions as in france i believe that this diversity is needed to make businesses smarter swi the world of finance is still very male was it a struggle for you to get to where you are f f the world of finance has been very male but it is changing and you find more and more female ceos i have never had a struggle to make my way at unigestion because the company s leadership has always made decisions on the basis of merit commitment to the company and enthusiasm at work it is interesting to note that in finance as well as other industries leadership has developed with the greatest diversity at the ceo level there are now several kinds of corporate leadership including one that is more collaborative and empathic and allows people to be vulnerable more more swiss women make inroads in executive positions this content was published on the share of women in management positions at corporations listed on the swiss market index reached 19 or nearly one in five in 2021 read more swiss women make inroads in executive positions swi the financial industry doesn t exactly have a brilliant reputation how do you find meaning in the work you do f f yes unfortunately finance has a bad image due to the excesses of the past this being so i aspire to develop a positive role for finance in society that is as a meeting point between investors who need to make money and businesses which need capital at a time when the challenges about climate change are huge the financial industry can do its bit by channelling capital investment to projects that humanity needs and that also make money for our customers swi unigestion employs some 200 people and manages about 19 billion chf17 6 billion worth of assets you also say that you serve about 427 customers what kinds of customers and where are they geographically f f 95 of our customer base consists of institutional investors mostly pension funds insurance companies and financial institutions we also cater to some wealthy families geographically 13 of our customers are based in switzerland while 60 are elsewhere in europe britain included the rest 20 are in north america and a few other parts of the world swi unigestion calls itself an independent asset manager independent of what f f we call ourselves independent because we are not a publicly traded company and our ownership has always been private our main owner with a 55 share is the famsa foundation which was set up by bernard sabrier the founder and president of unigestion less than a quarter is then held by about 30 employees while a similar amount is held by a few institutional partners thanks to this structure of ownership we can afford to have a long term vision and we are not under the usual stock market pressures this is important because in our business cycles are long and it takes 18 to 24 months to secure a new customer finally our colleagues definitely appreciate the philanthropic aims of the famsa foundation swi your firm has an international presence with ten offices in europe north america and asia what do these offices do f f all our offices around the world have two tasks they are management centres and are staffed by financial analysts and portfolio managers they are also responsible for customer relations at the local level swi it is said that research is in unigestion s dna how do you collaborate with the academic world f f i would say that today s research is tomorrow s performance in this context building bridges between applied finance and academic research is particularly important we work with masters or doctoral students who are completing their theses we agree on topics of common interest for example the role of machine learning in investment management it is not uncommon for us to take some of these students on board once they have completed their degrees furthermore we organise conferences at the federal institute of technology lausanne epfl and imperial college london swi when it comes to quantitative risk management do you rely more on mathematical models than on human decision making f f both mathematical models are useful for dealing with a large quantity of data based on past experience on the other hand human decision making is needed to make future projections and to integrate new data such as a pandemic or a war in ukraine swi to make good investments is privileged access to corporate leaders also required f f it is very important to combine the analysis of facts and figures with a dialogue with corporate leaders what these leaders have to say about the future needs to be listened to seriously of course any trading of privileged information is out of the question as that would be illegal swi when you invest in a company do you have a minimum degree of participation in order to have real influence on environmental social and governance issues f f what we do is focus on a shared commitment for example we are involved in climateaction 100 external link the goal of this initiative supported by a large number of investors is to ensure that the world s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take steps to combat climate change only if we adopt these common positions and unite our forces can we have a real impact swi why did you decide to resign as ceo f f after 32 years with unigestion i wanted to give myself time to pursue other professional interests that have been close to my heart for some time swi what are your plans for the future f f i have always enjoyed talking to our institutional clients about the macroeconomic environment and its impact on financial markets and asset allocations in addition for the past 20 years i have been passionate about the potential contribution of finance to sustainability and a more environmentally friendly energy transition thus my future activity will focus on assignments as a board member and consultant on investment allocation and sustainability issues finally i also want to spend time building bridges between the financial industry sustainability and academia fiona frick fiona

two procurement lessons learned from the ukraine war were the stockpiles of weapons built up in case there is a war tend to be much lower than needed to make matters worse production capacity for additional munitions is usually neglected that means when you discover your war reserves were too small you find that production facilities to remedy the problem are also lacking this is not a new problem for democracies because peacetime politicians back spending on items popular with voters war reserve munitions stockpiles and production facilities are expensive and unpopular with most voters that changed temporarily because of the experience in ukraine while ukrainians did all the fighting nato nations mainly the united states supplied most of the munitions and many of the weapons ukraine needed to stop the russians and to push russian forces out of ukraine the most common nato artillery munition was the 155mm shell the ukrainians found these to be more reliable and effective than the russian designed 152mm shell they were still using when equipped with 155mm artillery and ammunition the ukrainians found they could match the russian artillery the crucial ukrainian artillery innovation was locally developed and built uavs locating the russian artillery using new ukrainian developed communications and fire control software this was able to immediately provide ukrainian artillery with the target locations even unguided 155mm shells could destroy or disable russian guns especially if they were firing in large groups from the same location as russian tactics dictate more importantly the new ukrainian tactics dramatically facilitated almost instant use of massed fire on newly identified targets by any artillery piece in range this is similar to uber and lyft software for sharing vehicle rides between drivers and users such immediate massed fire by two ukrainian artillery brigades stopped the russian attack on kiev early in the war the ukrainians went further and used their superior battlefield surveillance capabilities some of them supplied by nato to locate the russian artillery munitions storage sites these stockpiles supplied russian artillery firing on the ukrainians these storage sites were increasingly found and destroyed the best the russians could do was move these storage sites further away from the front line because of the ukrainian gmlrs guided rockets with a max range of 85 kilometers that meant russia had to move their storage sites to locations more than 80 kilometers from the russian artillery this required more trucks to transport the munitions over longer distances the ukrainians identified and destroyed a lot of these trucks during their long journey what this all meant that was after a few months russia had lost its artillery advantage and often the ukrainians had the edge when it came to artillery support so far the u s has sent over 800 000 155mm shells to ukraine and there is not much left but the u s war reserve for possible conflicts in korea or the middle east south korea had larger stocks of 155mm shells and sold 100 000 of these to the americans to maintain their war reserve south korea stipulated that none of these could be transferred to ukraine at this point the ukrainians were able to use all the 155mm shells they could get by then the united states and other nato nations had sent most of what 155mm ammo they had all nato nations were producing as much as they could but production capabilities were only sufficient for building a small war reserve of shells with a shelf life of at least a decade and often more like 15 or 20 years this persuaded american politicians to allocate over half a billion dollars to expand 155mm shell production capabilities from 14 000 shells a month to 20 000 by 2025 the u s will be producing 40 000 shells a month ukrainian forces normally go through that in less than two weeks other nato nations are also increasing production capabilities because the next time it will probably be nato troops doing the fighting and dying nato standard 155mm shells each weigh 45 kg 100 pounds and have about 9 1 kg 20 pounds of explosives this makes for a bigger bang than hellfire or tow missiles but much less than smart bombs there s also the 227 mm gmlrs guided rocket but this carries over 68 kg 150 pounds of explosives about half the bang of a 500 pound jdam the gps guided 155mm shell and mlrs rocket each cost over 50 000 each there are also gps guided 155mm shells which are expensive but popular because these gps artillery munitions are available to the troops 24 7 and the need for fewer rounds per mission means there are fewer problems with running out or low on supplies a more affordable 12 000 each alternative to the excalibur gps guided shell is available using the atk fuze which is screwed into the front of an unguided 155mm shell the atk approach is somewhat less accurate than excalibur shells but that has been found acceptable in combat situations this was most recently during 2017 in syria where a lot of akt equipped 155mm shells were used to support kurdish troops taking the city of raqqa from isil islamic state in iraq and the levant forces while the atk fuze is cheaper it is still a complex bit of tech and production facilities are not available to build a lot of them in a hurry excalibur stockpiles were larger and these are being sent to ukraine one of the problems russia has is that the shelf life of most munitions varies from 5 20 years depending on the component shell fuze electronics batteries or propellant artillery shells and rockets use various types of explosives notably as propellants that degrade over time western nations spend a lot of money to remove elderly munitions by recycling them this is expensive but it is a major reason why western munitions are more reliable and less dangerous for users russia takes a different approach they know from experience that their 152mm shells gradually become less reliable after ten or twenty years stored in a warehouse older shells don t function as designed that means more shells that are inaccurate or don t detonate that means more duds for shells older than 20 years there is greater risk of a shell exploding in the gun or shortly after fired the causes death or injury to the gun crew and anyone else nearby senior russian commanders consider this an acceptable risk in order to win

100 clean energy by 2045 cities have made similar commitments including boise which aims to be carbon free by 2035 peter richardson chairman of idaho energy freedom said renewables have been unfairly maligned in the state other states in the region are moving more quickly to eliminate carbon from their energy grids and richardson pointed out idahoans benefit from renewable energy in a number of ways from their local tax base to their cost of energy richardson outlined a lot of folks misunderstand that renewable energy is an inexpensive and often times least expensive alternative to central station gigantic fossil fuel plants richardson added the fight over net metering is evidence idahoans want more renewables under idaho power s current net metering rules people who produce solar power on their roofs and send surplus energy back to the utility are paid at a certain rate richardson noted idaho power s attempt to lower the rate has been met with backlash there s a tremendous pent up

by allison schrager bloomberg opinion certain events change the course of history or at least the trajectory of the global economy to name a few the black death the invention of the steam engine and world war ii and now the scourge of covid 19 it s been nearly three years since the world health organization declared a global pandemic that changed the world as we knew it you can t pause economic and social activity for more than a year and go back to normal it s hard to know in the moment or even a decade later what will change for good in 2020 people thought they might never go to the office again or leave home without a mask or that they d finally maintain their sourdough starter now many of our pre pandemic behaviors have returned but we re also starting to see what s unlikely to ever go back to the way it was lingering changes that probably won t last much longer some of our habits are still different from before the pandemic but they may eventually revert for example americans and brits aren t eating in restaurants as much as they did in 2019 that may be because they still fear disease or inflation has made it too expensive or people have just rediscovered the joys of home cooking but eating out which had been trending upward over the years will probably come back people enjoy it too much to stop how we work also is still different americans have never had so much power in the labor market between the great resignation and quiet quitting and an ongoing labor shortage workers are demanding more including more flexibility in where they do their jobs moving so many people out of the office to their homes during the pandemic did change work before covid about 5 percent of workdays were at home during the pandemic it shot up to 60 percent and it s now leveled off to 30 percent in the fall of 2022 about 29 2 percent of all full time employees were working from home part of the time and 13 3 percent were fully remote right now this seems to be a permanent change maybe even as monumental as when workers moved off the home farm and to the factory a change that had a major impact on our society culture and economy so in some ways it seems natural that we are moving work back home but many bosses don t love the idea they ve built company culture and training regimes that are dependent on personal interaction their preferences are going up against workers who are putting a big premium on flexibility and demanding more of it and this tension is why work from home may not stick around once the labor market tightens in the next few years and workers have less power longer term as technology begins to do more of our jobs even white collar ones the premium put on in person high touch skills will be even higher if you can do your job at home not only can someone probably do it in another country for cheaper odds are soon that a computer will be able to do it too showing up in the office and contributing in other ways like mentoring less experienced staffers will matter even more the result will increase pressure to be in the office and the more often you show up the better one change that may be permanent is that your boss will have more tolerance for people working from home when they need to to be present for a repairman for example or when they need to be home to care for a sick child changes that will be with us for a long time we buy more online e commerce has been trending up for years but before the pandemic it accounted for only about 11 9 percent of total sales it jumped to 16 4 percent in 2020 and has only fallen to 14 8 percent since then many people have become accustomed to the convenience of online shopping where more goods are available even as shipping rates rise odds are this habit will stick and that eventually will mean no more drugstores on every corner and less brick and mortar retail another major change is inflation the pandemic awoke inflation and it will be very hard to get rid of it the rate of inflation is starting to fall and in the next year it will probably drop further but there is a good chance the sub 2 percent inflation we ve taken for granted for years won t be back for a long time people are now getting used to higher inflation which means they ve started to include it in their behavior and expectations longer term the world s population is aging and countries are less open to trade and both of those trends will put upward pressure on inflation that some economists are now arguing 4 percent is a better target for the federal reserve suggests we re already giving up on a 2 percent inflation world higher inflation and less trade following the pandemic also mean higher interest rates the fed only has so much control over interest rates longer term rates are set in the global market a pullback on globalization would mean foreigners will buy fewer u s bonds to manage their currencies reducing demand and increasing rates and a period of higher inflation with more uncertainty around the future will also increase rates because fixed income investors need to be compensated for inflation and inflation risk this all adds up to higher rates so say goodbye to cheap mortgages and very cheap financing on the goods we buy many pandemic effects remain to be seen including how much wages and equality will be hurt from depriving so many children of proper schooling for so long past evidence suggests it may mean lower wages well into adulthood especially for poor children one more big change is our awareness of risk americans have spent the last 40 years in blissful ignorance pandemics were something from medieval times monetary policy could engineer low stable inflation and interest rates and even if the stock market fell it would always recover within a year or two anything we wanted to buy at the store was always available now we face a different future one where we understand that risk is ever present in our lives and that the economy is constantly changing and offers no guarantees allison schrager is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering economics
andrew limbong host the house select committee investigating the january 6 attack on the u s capitol released its final report this past thursday and the big top line is that former president donald trump should be prosecuted by the department of justice on four charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the u s by assisting those involved in an insurrection the report is thorough it s more than 800 pages and it offers suggestions for how to protect the american democratic system from possible interference in the future but whatever action comes next could be a question of not just the law but also politics like will the doj actually pursue charges against the former president who is currently running for office again or will they pass to avoid the appearance of partisanship and does the appointment of special counsel jack smith change that calculus at all here to help us think this through is harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he currently hosts the talking feds podcast harry litman welcome back to all things considered harry litman thanks very good to be here merry christmas to everyone limbong yeah merry christmas to you too all right so you ve had a couple days to digest the report right now for those of us who haven t had a chance to get through all 800 pages you know or so is there something in particular that sticks out to you from this report that we didn t you know necessarily get from the multiple hearings the committee held litman so a few things that really struck me first the length of the overall conspiracy so it s clear from the report that before the election they had decided on the big lie strategy and you have some very vivid and profane quotes from roger stone and steve bannon f it we re just going to say we won and you know screw you that s before even the election and then after there s part really of the conspiracy that has to be considered the fundraising that trump did off it where it turns out that was kind of a big grift as the report says he mainly used the money for himself so that was one thing that really struck me another thing that really struck me is the breadth of the contacts we knew about the strongarm call to brad raffensperger in georgia it turns out there were about 200 of these contacts with state officials and phony electors many from trump himself that really drove home the kind of magnitude that i hadn t realized from just seeing the committee hearings and then there are you know a few dozen of little stray snippets and startling facts that also came through but those were this kind of top line new revelations to me limbong i know you can t speak for anyone at the department of justice but given what you know about the department and its attorney general merrick garland how do you think he s approaching this you know in regards to the criminal charges recommended by the committee you know it seems to be just as much a question about politics as much as it is law right litman no you know it s really true i ve worked with him shoulder to shoulder he will filter out the politics he is filtering out the politics it ll be about the facts and the law maybe maybe at the end of the day after a decision s been reached there s some room for consideration of politics but not in a crass way but you know best interests of the country but i m very confident that and this is especially true of jack smith who has an extra layer of political insulation but they will do their darndest and i think successfully to just go on facts and the law one foot in front of the other the sort of same approach doj would take to any case even though this is arguably the most extraordinary set of cases in doj history limbong yeah i was going to ask how did adding the special counsel change anything litman first and foremost and this goes to what i was just saying it was a legal requirement so it wasn t simply garland saying oh this could be a good idea there s a regulation for when you appoint it and in his view and you can understand it it was triggered when trump became a candidate that really did complicate the whole formula and made it look like their extraordinary circumstances may be a conflict of interest because you re prosecuting or investigating the guy who s running against your boss and so that s you know first and foremost for him and the department it was required under law but it changed things because the special counsel is designed when you have a politically fraught situation as you surely do here to give some measure of extra assurance to the public that everything really is on the up and up and politics aren t driving the decision limbong so what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks you know especially as there s about to be a change to take place in the makeup of congress litman it s really more the coming months i have to say the january 6 cases are still really complicated there s all kinds of evidence for the department now to try to develop and even sort of you know filter and process from congress try to get other people to cooperate but it s a it really is people need to you know understand no charges are going to be filed there any time soon then finally it seems to me the air is leaking out of the tires on the whole big lie we had the midterms pass with just one person kari lake really doing the old refrain and she definitively lost is it really going to happen when the congress turns to republican control that they re going to be pressing this button again and again and again you know it doesn t seem to me to be in their political interest it s it also seems to me as if donald trump s stock is you know it hasn t plunged but it s waning of course he s still a serious candidate but i m looking as a citizen and just an observer to see how much the republican house will really try to make a big deal of the big lie and the kinds of charges against the january 6 committee or the whole investigations in doj and georgia that at least they were doing as of a few months ago limbong that was harry litman he s the former deputy assistant attorney general at the department of justice and he s the host and executive producer of the talking feds podcast harry litman thanks a lot for sharing your insights with us litman really good to be here thank you soundbite of music transcript provided by npr copyright npr

diversity is needed to make business smarter says ceo fiona frick wants to build bridges between the financial industry sustainability and academia showmedialive women remain few and far between in top positions in the world of finance fiona frick ceo of asset management company unigestion is an exception swi swissinfo ch spoke to the geneva executive one of the most influential women in european finance who is standing down as ceo at the end of the year 7 minutes swi swissinfo ch you climbed the career ladder at unigestion whereas in your native france top graduates from the elite institutions start in high level positions which is the better model fiona frick i favour a mix of career profiles in our field team members should come from all sorts of career backgrounds engineers historians people who have done a practical apprenticeship and yes people from elite institutions as in france i believe that this diversity is needed to make businesses smarter swi the world of finance is still very male was it a struggle for you to get to where you are f f the world of finance has been very male but it is changing and you find more and more female ceos i have never had a struggle to make my way at unigestion because the company s leadership has always made decisions on the basis of merit commitment to the company and enthusiasm at work it is interesting to note that in finance as well as other industries leadership has developed with the greatest diversity at the ceo level there are now several kinds of corporate leadership including one that is more collaborative and empathic and allows people to be vulnerable more more swiss women make inroads in executive positions this content was published on the share of women in management positions at corporations listed on the swiss market index reached 19 or nearly one in five in 2021 read more swiss women make inroads in executive positions swi the financial industry doesn t exactly have a brilliant reputation how do you find meaning in the work you do f f yes unfortunately finance has a bad image due to the excesses of the past this being so i aspire to develop a positive role for finance in society that is as a meeting point between investors who need to make money and businesses which need capital at a time when the challenges about climate change are huge the financial industry can do its bit by channelling capital investment to projects that humanity needs and that also make money for our customers swi unigestion employs some 200 people and manages about 19 billion chf17 6 billion worth of assets you also say that you serve about 427 customers what kinds of customers and where are they geographically f f 95 of our customer base consists of institutional investors mostly pension funds insurance companies and financial institutions we also cater to some wealthy families geographically 13 of our customers are based in switzerland while 60 are elsewhere in europe britain included the rest 20 are in north america and a few other parts of the world swi unigestion calls itself an independent asset manager independent of what f f we call ourselves independent because we are not a publicly traded company and our ownership has always been private our main owner with a 55 share is the famsa foundation which was set up by bernard sabrier the founder and president of unigestion less than a quarter is then held by about 30 employees while a similar amount is held by a few institutional partners thanks to this structure of ownership we can afford to have a long term vision and we are not under the usual stock market pressures this is important because in our business cycles are long and it takes 18 to 24 months to secure a new customer finally our colleagues definitely appreciate the philanthropic aims of the famsa foundation swi your firm has an international presence with ten offices in europe north america and asia what do these offices do f f all our offices around the world have two tasks they are management centres and are staffed by financial analysts and portfolio managers they are also responsible for customer relations at the local level swi it is said that research is in unigestion s dna how do you collaborate with the academic world f f i would say that today s research is tomorrow s performance in this context building bridges between applied finance and academic research is particularly important we work with masters or doctoral students who are completing their theses we agree on topics of common interest for example the role of machine learning in investment management it is not uncommon for us to take some of these students on board once they have completed their degrees furthermore we organise conferences at the federal institute of technology lausanne epfl and imperial college london swi when it comes to quantitative risk management do you rely more on mathematical models than on human decision making f f both mathematical models are useful for dealing with a large quantity of data based on past experience on the other hand human decision making is needed to make future projections and to integrate new data such as a pandemic or a war in ukraine swi to make good investments is privileged access to corporate leaders also required f f it is very important to combine the analysis of facts and figures with a dialogue with corporate leaders what these leaders have to say about the future needs to be listened to seriously of course any trading of privileged information is out of the question as that would be illegal swi when you invest in a company do you have a minimum degree of participation in order to have real influence on environmental social and governance issues f f what we do is focus on a shared commitment for example we are involved in climateaction 100 external link the goal of this initiative supported by a large number of investors is to ensure that the world s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take steps to combat climate change only if we adopt these common positions and unite our forces can we have a real impact swi why did you decide to resign as ceo f f after 32 years with unigestion i wanted to give myself time to pursue other professional interests that have been close to my heart for some time swi what are your plans for the future f f i have always enjoyed talking to our institutional clients about the macroeconomic environment and its impact on financial markets and asset allocations in addition for the past 20 years i have been passionate about the potential contribution of finance to sustainability and a more environmentally friendly energy transition thus my future activity will focus on assignments as a board member and consultant on investment allocation and sustainability issues finally i also want to spend time building bridges between the financial industry sustainability and academia fiona frick fiona
