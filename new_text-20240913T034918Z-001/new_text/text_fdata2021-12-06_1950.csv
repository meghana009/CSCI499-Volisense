investors fears about omicron faded several high priced tech shares that began the day in the red turned green craig erlam senior market analyst at oanda urged investors to stay cautious until more data can provide more cause for optimism reports of the omicron symptoms being less severe are boosting risk appetite but it s too soon to get carried away he said in a note for one we ve seen this repeatedly since the initial news broke a little over a week ago markets have been very headline driven and this is just the latest rally on the back of some positive reports erlam also warned that the rest of this week could prove to be as volatile as the last while this may be the first in a slew of positive data around the new variant it could also be the anomaly and what follows could explain why world leaders and various agencies have been so anxious he said weeks like this the economic data would always play second fiddle but as it turns out it s looking a little thin on that

flagship ark innovation fund fell more than 5 on friday and all of the fund s holdings entered a bear market apart from two stocks but it was comments from the fed that unnerved markets late last week not fears about the omicron variant according to tom essaye author of the sevens report last week chair jerome powell signaled the fed s focus is inflation even with the new variant emerging that led investors to rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth essaye called the market behavior a sort of taper tantrum 2 0 as markets react to a more hawkish fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates the central bank is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to 30 billion a month at its meeting next week cnbc s steve liesman reported monday based on comments by fed officials initial discussions could also begin as soon as the december meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year tom hainlin of u s bank wealth management said investors are also focused on what the terminal interest rate will be and that he expects it to be lower that what investors are pricing in the long term growth rate is challenged by factors that are changing demographics productivity and longer term growth in the labor force and drive the economy in the long term he told cnbc we still think those are muted relative to history so the idea that the federal reserve would raise rates up until up to a rate that we ve historically seen we think that it s not likely to get up to that level bitcoin traded around 57 000 on friday morning but by saturday had plunged to around 43 000 by monday the world s largest cryptocurrency had clawed back some of its losses last trading at around 49 297 08 according to coin metrics hainlin declined to comment directly on cryptocurrency markets but said the weekend s crash was consistent with what s happening in the broader markets any speculative growth portions of the market are the ones that are trading off the most and that s perhaps due to accelerated fed tapering and fed rate increases he said if you raise interest rates that decreases the value of those long term cash flows for those long term growth companies or parts of the market that are dependent on them microstrategy fell 5 4 on monday shares of block recently renamed from square and coinbase were lower too although they reclaimed deeper declines from earlier in the day

georgia ex senator perdue to run for governor david perdue the former senator from georgia who lost his seat to sen jon ossoff d plans to challenge georgia gov brian kemp in the republican primary according to three people familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the upcoming announcement perdue will announce his intentions monday and spent sunday calling republicans about his plan to file for the race the people added former president donald trump has been pushing perdue to challenge kemp whom trump has blasted for not helping him overturn 2020 election results in georgia based on his false claims that the presidential race was stolen from him perdue was narrowly forced into a runoff in the 2020 election which he went on to lose to ossoff trump loomed over the contest attacking the results of the election and using two pre runoff rallies to air conspiracy theories about his defeat perdue hurt by reporting on stock trades he made after a pandemic briefing for senators refused to debate ossoff and spent the race s final days self quarantining after being exposed to the coronavirus he briefly considered a run for the state s other senate seat but backed out in february advertisement david weigel amy b wang and amy gardner man who jumped from taxiing plane in phoenix is identified authorities have identified a man who jumped out of a jetliner s galley door to the tarmac as the plane was taxiing to a gate at phoenix sky harbor international airport daniel ramirez 30 was booked into jail late saturday on suspicion of two felony counts of trespassing he was a passenger on a southwest airlines flight from colorado on saturday when authorities say he opened a galley door jumped out and ran to an airport fire station where he barricaded himself the control tower was notified and the plane went on to its gate
atlanta former u s sen david perdue plans to challenge georgia gov brian kemp in the republican primary next year according to multiple people with knowledge of his decision setting up a divisive contest between two of the state s leading gop figures ahead of a likely general election matchup with stacey abrams perdue s decision is expected to be delivered monday and comes days after abrams an icon to many democrats announced she would run for governor for a second time perdue has told allies he was motivated to join the race because he fears kemp can t defeat the democrat again his campaign will deepen a divide in the state gop stoked by former president donald trump who has vowed to punish kemp and is expected to quickly support perdue that points to a difficult 2022 election for the party following huge losses in the last campaign cycle when democrats captured georgia in a presidential race for the first time since 1992 and then flipped both of the state s u s senate seats in dual runoffs that decided control of the chamber perdue was on the losing end of one of those races falling to democrat jon ossoff kemp is destined to put perdue s failure to defeat ossoff in the november 2020 election and the january runoffs at the center of their competition perdue s only reason for running is to soothe his own bruised ego because his campaign for u s senate failed to inspire voters at the ballot box twice said kemp spokesman cody hall giving a taste of the brutal campaign to come advertisement not long ago it seemed perdue s political career might be over he ruled out a comeback bid against u s sen raphael warnock and began building a new estate in coastal georgia but as grassroots unrest with kemp dogged his campaign perdue months ago began quietly calling donors and activists to sound out a campaign he seems assured too of winning the endorsement from trump who has already backed a slate of georgia gop candidates who supported his efforts to overturn the election the former president has publicly encouraged perdue to run and recently warned the maga base will just not vote for kemp and in interviews perdue has tried to promote himself as a unifier who can rally trump loyalists more effectively than kemp who has been on the former president s bad side since he refused demands to overturn joe biden s victory in georgia we have a divided party in georgia right now perdue recently said forget about me it s divided and a lot of people feel like that people in power haven t fought for them and caved in to a lot of things back in 2020 that didn t have to be done man of his word kemp finds himself fighting on two fronts trying to fend off perdue and other lesser known challengers from his right flank while abrams is free to consolidate democratic support advertisement abrams top aide lauren groh wargo echoed other democrats in welcoming the gop infighting while david perdue and brian kemp fight each other she said stacey abrams will be fighting for the people of georgia indeed an all out brawl awaits the two republican rivals kemp s camp has long warned that a perdue challenge would trigger a total war the governor suggested that it would also be an act of betrayal pointing to perdue s past support for his re election i hope he ll be a man of his word kemp said shortly before his former ally announced he is running but again that s not anything i can control veteran republican strategist brian robinson put it a different way harkening back to gen william t sherman s ruinous march to savannah during the civil war sherman left more standing than this primary will tough job advertisement long before perdue planned his bid kemp was taking the threat seriously he has reloaded his campaign coffers sharpened his reelection platform and unveiled volleys of endorsements the republican governors association has pledged its support his campaign recently returned to the airwaves with a tv ad touting his agenda and he s calling in favors the georgia chamber which declined to support kemp in 2018 recently endorsed his re election bid that development was seen as a signal to both perdue and abrams about where the corporate crowd is leaning a former fortune 500 chief executive perdue defeated a slate of better known republican candidates in 2014 by billing himself as an outsider who could shake up the washington status quo he embraced trump in 2016 and emerged as one of his most effective champions in the u s senate but perdue whose plans were first reported by politico was also hindered by backlash against the president in 2020 he led ossoff in the november vote but fell short of the majority needed to win the race nine weeks later he lost the runoff by a thin margin as tens of thousands of trump supporters stayed home amid false claims of a rigged vote during his 2014 run for the senate perdue often sported a jean jacket to portray himself as an outsider but in fact the multimillionaire is part of one of the most powerful political networks in georgia advertisement his first cousin former gov sonny perdue was trump s secretary of agriculture for four years and many of his political associates are in influential positions in state government and republican politics complicating matters kemp has also backed sonny perdue who appointed him secretary of state in 2010 to lead the state s higher education system sonny perdue who along with his cousin david encouraged trump to endorse kemp in 2018 recently had positive words for the governor he told a crowd of activists in perry to show kemp respect and honor because it s a tough job it s not immediately clear if he s still in line for the coveted post mess kemp will be a formidable primary opponent despite his falling out with trump over his refusal to overturn the november election the governor has the power of incumbency and dozens of endorsements already lined up along with the bully pulpit tied to being the state s top politician he also reported amassing a small fortune in his campaign coffers and legislation he recently signed allows him to set up funds that can collect unlimited contributions from donors for a 2022 bid advertisement kemp s campaign has been preparing for perdue s challenge for months and on sunday one of his top aides gave a preview of the bruising affair to come in a lengthy statement hall pointed to the issues that dogged perdue during the senate runoff including stock transactions that benefited the then senator during the pandemic and his decision to skip multiple debates governor kemp has a proven track record of fighting the radical left to put hardworking georgians first while perdue is best known for ducking debates padding his stock portfolio during a pandemic and losing winnable races a perdue spokesman fired right back if brian kemp fought stacey abrams as hard as he fights perdue and trump we wouldn t be in this mess send questions

if memory serves me right chico where brandon was staying is only about five minutes from the zona rosa this is a t shaped area of luxury shops cafes and upscale restaurants the rich and famous colombians would hang out there if you were a single guy that is what special forces guys would call a target rich environment colombia wasn t considered safe for american military troops assigned to either the american embassy or the colombian military headquarters can nevertheless bogota and colombia overall was a fantastic place it was with great interest that i read brandon webb s piece about his travel to bogota colombia having spent time there during the heyday of the medellin cali cartel i was really interested in how much the city has changed bogota is beautiful and huge i had heard from other sf guys who were there recently or had families there quite a few sf guys married colombian women that since the peace deal with the farc tourism has been back and things are much better in bogota yet back then bogota and colombia were a much more unsafe place and even a donut could be dangerous the rich history of us special operations units in colombia army special forces and navy seals made multiple deployments to several areas in the country they trained counter insurgency and counter narcotics troops and performed riverine operations delta force troops did specialized training with select colombian units also they were part of the task force with dea cia and colombians in the hunt for pablo escobar today colombia s special forces are some of the best in the world during one such deployment we had an augmented sf team assigned to the colombian army hq we were helping facilitate the creation of training packages between the american embassy washington and the colombians it was basically an administrative job and pain in your fourth point of contact but the good part was that we got to live in bogota every two sf guys got an apartment which was a nice perk from the embassy nevertheless due to security concerns and threats against americans we had to get picked up each morning in an armored suburban four heavily armed colombians in a jeep would escort us from the front door of our apartment to the vehicle and follow us to the hqs uniforms were low key that black windbreaker over the green dress shirt and no class a jacket allowed those were left in the office no berets or jump boots either you get the idea although the distance was only five six miles due to the horrible traffic it would take an hour to get there the milgrp had some great sf guys assigned there and they were always on top of stuff my good buddy wade chapple was the american liaison officer to the colombian lancero school and we got to see one another on occasion ambushed by donuts in bogota one particular morning there was a bad accident on the route to work so our drivers and security guys told us that we were going to have to take a different route no problem just sit back read the miami herald and shoot the breeze we were in the left lane of traffic zipping along at a pretty good clip then suddenly one of the guys spotted a piece of americana across the road a dunkin donuts although today there are several dunkin donuts in bogota back then there was only one which we weren t aware of turn left quick we yelled at the driver motioning him to pull into dd he cut in front of a small opening of oncoming traffic and we zipped into the parking lot we quickly went inside and ordered two boxes of joe and two dozen donuts for the guys in the office don t make any mistake colombian coffee is the bomb and we had developed an affinity for it that still exists today in fact some of the big colombian coffee producers would come by the embassy every month and you could send home cases of the stuff that would be delivered to the embassy mail room and shipped right out to addresses in the states i had enough stockpiled back home in nc that i had a year s worth upon returning dunkin was a taste of home and although they used colombian coffee the donuts had been sorely missed but in our haste or stupidity of having the driver veer off the route we d neglected our security guys who were delayed in getting across the same oncoming traffic and they were pissed a very unique direct action operation believing something was wrong or just to make a point the three heavily armed security guys entered the restaurant with drawn weapons and demanded to know what was wrong the people in the dunkin donuts were aghast they sat stock still and with mouths wide open when we told them that nothing was wrong and we just wanted to stop at dds the commander of the detail fumed he told us in no uncertain terms to never f ing do that again we were ready to come in shooting he said which wasn t true they were too well trained for that yet their entrance had a great effect on the people behind the counter who looked like we they were about to empty their bladders we apologized to the detail leader one of our guys turned to the cashier and asked how much we owed he just pushed the donuts and coffee across the counter and shook his head nothing just take it and go he replied we passed the last few minutes before arriving at our hqs in silence after which point we all burst out laughing our escapade ended up reaching the ears of the milgrp commander he commenced with chewing our asses a bit which was pretty common he was a marine corps pilot and hated sf and the seals for our closeness and familiarity all being on a first name basis regardless of rank nearly gave him a stroke every day a compromise is reached later that afternoon our security guys and driver offered a compromise if we wanted they d drop us off at work and every friday they d go back and pick up a box of joe and donuts for the crew perfect our driver later told us that the cashier remembered him when he went back the next time and he begged him to not bring the gringos back i thought we were all going to get shot because of them my heart can t take that stuff the cashier had told him many years later i had a similar experience in mexico city while working security for a film company hey like my favorite coffee company says coffee or die but that is a story for another day this article was originally published in april 2021 it has been edited

how did you get started in the hobby my earlier memories of model trains go back to first grade on my way to school we would pass by the front window of a store that would set up a layout during christmas time later i learned that it was an ho train set but at that time all i knew was that i had to stop by that window on the way to and from school to see the train go around the loop of track for one reason or another i never got a train set as a child but as soon as i began working and had my own money i went to america s hobby center in new york to buy an ho train set thus began a long history of buying an engine here a couple of cars there some track in one visit to the hobby store some switches during the following visit what was your first large scale locomotive for many years i had been collecting ho engines and cars until one day i happened to visit a craft store it was not a train store but on one of the shelves behind the cashier there was this red lgb diesel engine and a couple of passenger cars i don t remember too many details about the pieces just that they were huge and beautiful once i was bitten by the lgb bug there was no going back to ho soon after my encounter with g scale i went to trainworld in brooklyn and purchased a mogul in the maroon pennsylvania livery a couple of passenger cars and a caboose to make a train although i continued to work on some of the ho trains by then my heart focused on large scale what s your favorite part of the hobby as i began to build my garden railway i discovered that building the structures like the trestle the bridge see more in the february 2017 issue of garden railways the coaling tower a blue cottage a pergola spring 2019 two tunnel portals the signal tower the water tower fencing august 2016 issue etc was what i enjoyed the most it gave me a chance to use my wood working skills and tools this in turn resulted in my writing and publishing in garden railways a number of articles about some of the structures i built for the railway which also turned out to be a favorite aspect of the hobby what s your least favorite part as time went by the world of electronics made great advances and the bells and whistles in model trains became sophisticated and a common feature especially in large scale models which afforded more room for circuit boards and related components i was not attracted to this area of the hobby because i was afraid that due to my lack of electronics knowledge i would fry the electronic board of a very expensive piece of equipment that kept me away from dismantling an engine and working on the electronics what has been your biggest modeling success when we purchased our current home the first thing i did was to stake out the portion of the yard that would eventually become the g scale railway notice the term railway as opposed to layout space budget and time limitations kept me from putting together my dreamed garden railway however in 2013 after i retired time became available by then i had slowly gathered enough track switches and rolling stock to allow me to break ground but more importantly i had gathered a substantial amount of information on what works and on what does not work by religiously reading the articles in garden railways magazine so i would say that completing the railway has been my biggest modeling success what was your biggest modeling mistake although most of the railway is fine there is a portion of the track that climbs a 3 grade at the end of a curve which apparently turned out to be too steep since many trains get stuck there spinning their wheels i ve done some regrading which has helped some but i think i need to rework that entire curve to eliminate that hump if i ever have to build another railway i will pay closer attention to the grade to make sure it is free of train stopping humps what advice would you give to a new hobbyist for those starting with garden railways i would say that you need to be prepared to and be accepting of what mother nature will throw at you this includes inclement weather extreme cold heat torrential rain snow and ice flora impact leaves twigs acorns seeds tree zap etc fauna force bug juice bird droppings raccoon droppings squirrel damage other vermin and depending on your geographical location i m sure you could add more issues that the outdoor world has to offer nonetheless regardless of the kind of model trains we work with and regardless of the challenges we face at the end of the day we have to remember that we are having fun we are creating our own miniature world we are our own railroad barons we run our own railway empires of course that is until we have to drop everything we are doing on the railway because the boss says ok time for dinner come to the table

former georgia republican senator david perdue launched his bid for governor of georgia on monday setting up a high stakes primary challenge against incumbent republican governor brian kemp perdue s decision comes just days after democrat stacey abrams announced her campaign for governor her second effort after she lost to kemp in 2018 perdue s website went live late sunday night and encouraged supporters to join our team to stop stacey abrams in his announcement video on monday perdue attacked abrams and accused kemp and republican secretary of state brad raffensperger of dividing the gop in georgia to fight back we simply have to be united perdue said look i like brian this isn t personal it s simple he has failed all of us and cannot win in november instead of protecting our elections he caved to abrams and cost us the senate majority and gave joe biden free reign the gop gubernatorial primary is likely to be incredibly divisive in the key swing state former president donald trump railed against kemp after joe biden won georgia in the 2020 presidential election trump called for a strong primary challenger to enter the race and floated perdue s name at a georgia rally in september ivanka trump and senators kelly loeffler r ga and david perdue r ga wave to the crowd at a campaign event on december 21 2020 in milton georgia the two georgia u s senate runoff elections on jan 5 will decide control of the senate elijah nouvelage getty images are you going to run for governor david perdue trump said at the rally he s a great guy and he loves this state trump said monday in a statement that kemp can t win the election unless it is rigged of course i can t imagine that brian kemp who has hurt election integrity in georgia so badly can do well at the ballot box trump said he cost us two senate seats and a presidential victory in the great state of georgia later monday trump issued an official endorsement of perdue saying it was great to see that perdue had entered the race trump called kemp a very weak governor and said he can t win because the maga base which is enormous will never vote for him kemp was widely praised by republicans for signing a law that made sweeping changes to georgia s election system earlier this year perdue is a wealthy businessman and a close ally of trump perdue won his 2014 senate race by pitching himself as an outsider but lost his bid for reelection against democrat jon ossoff in a runoff in january he decided against making another run for the senate earlier this year i m concerned about the state of our state perdue told a talk radio show in georgia last month we have a divided party in georgia right now forget about me it s divided and a lot of people feel like the people in power haven t fought for them and caved in to a lot of things back in 2020 that didn t have to be done the primary campaign will likely divide many georgia republicans ahead of the high profile gubernatorial and u s senate races in the state next year republicans are hoping for big wins in 2022 after biden s victory in 2020 and democrats flipped two u s senate seats to gain control of the chamber former georgia state representative vernon jones who used to be a democrat but switched parties and educator kandiss taylor are also challenging kemp kemp last week addressed the reports that perdue was considering challenging him after initially planning to support the governor s reelection bid all i know is what senator perdue has told me i hope he ll be a man of his word but again that s not anything i can control kemp said in a statement on sunday kemp campaign communications director cody hall said perdue s only reason for running is to soothe his own bruised ego the man who lost republicans the united states senate and brought the last year of skyrocketing inflation open borders runaway government spending and woke cancel culture upon the american people now wants to lose the georgia governor s office to the national face of the radical left movement hall said governor kemp has a proven track record of fighting the radical left to put hardworking georgians first while perdue is best known for ducking debates padding his stock portfolio during a pandemic and losing winnable races at a conference in arizona last month republican governors association chair doug ducey was asked about the potential perdue primary challenge and said the rga is in the business of course of supporting our incumbents and ultimately electing republican governors ducey added that decisions will be made race by race for how to use resources but said that the rga won t attack other republicans we don t fund losers we don t fund landslides ducey said the rga follows the 11th commandment we do not speak ill of another republican

advisor dr anthony fauci made sunday saying the initial data on the omicron variant is encouraging the comments came the same day cdc director dr rochelle walensky told abc news the new variant has now been discovered in at least 15 u s states and less than two weeks after the world health organization designated it as being of concern clearly in south africa omicron has a transmission advantage fauci said although it s too early to make any definitive statements about it thus far it does not look like there s a great degree of severity to it the nasdaq though higher lagged the other major averages monday weighed down by health care and tech stocks moderna the biggest decliner in the index fell 13 4 amd and nvidia were off by 3 4 and 2 1 respectively but as investors fears about omicron faded several high priced tech shares that began the day in the red turned green craig erlam senior market analyst at oanda urged investors to stay cautious until more data can provide more cause for optimism reports of the omicron symptoms being less severe are boosting risk appetite but it s too soon to get carried away he said in a note for one we ve seen this repeatedly since the initial news broke a little over a week ago markets have been very headline driven and this is just the latest rally on the back of some positive reports erlam also warned that the rest of this week could prove to be as volatile as the last while this may be the first in a slew of positive data around the new variant it could also be the anomaly and what follows could explain why world leaders and various agencies have been so anxious he said weeks like this the economic data would always play second fiddle but as it turns out it s looking a little thin on that front and central banks are in the same position as the rest of us on friday tech stocks pulled the market lower the nasdaq composite slid 1 92 with shares of tesla as the biggest drag cathie wood s flagship ark innovation fund fell more than 5 on friday and all of the fund s holdings entered a bear market apart from two stocks but it was comments from the fed that unnerved markets late last week not fears about the omicron variant according to tom essaye author of the sevens report last week chair jerome powell signaled the fed s focus is inflation even with the new variant emerging that led investors to rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth essaye called the market behavior a sort of taper tantrum 2 0 as markets react to a more hawkish fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates the central bank is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to 30 billion a month at its meeting next week cnbc s steve liesman reported monday based on comments by fed officials initial discussions could also begin as soon as the december meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year tom hainlin of u s bank wealth management said investors are also focused on what the terminal interest rate will be and that he expects it to be lower that what investors are pricing in the long term growth rate is challenged by factors that are changing demographics productivity and longer term growth in the labor force and drive the economy in the long term he told cnbc we still think those are muted relative to history so the idea that the federal reserve would raise rates up until up to a rate that we ve historically seen we think that it s not likely to get up to that level bitcoin traded around 57 000 on friday morning but by saturday had plunged to around 43 000 by monday the world s largest cryptocurrency had clawed back some of its losses last trading at around 49 297 08 according to coin metrics hainlin declined to comment directly on cryptocurrency markets but said the weekend s crash was consistent with what s happening in the broader markets any speculative growth portions of the market are the ones that are trading off the most and that s perhaps due to accelerated fed tapering and fed rate increases he said if you raise interest rates that decreases the value of those long term cash flows for those long term growth companies or parts of the market that are dependent on them microstrategy fell 5 4 on monday shares of block recently renamed from square and coinbase were lower too although they reclaimed deeper

transport for london tfl chaired by labour mayor sadiq khan has submitted plans to force through 4 billion in cuts by boris johnson s conservative government to bus rail and london underground services and infrastructure over the next two years the cuts are set to take effect on december 11 with the tories refusing to provide emergency funding to cover a collapse of fare revenue during the pandemic tfl london s transport authority relies on passenger fares to fund a massive 72 percent of basic operating costs since the cameron tory government axed central government operating grants in 2015 johnson has seized on the pandemic to demand that tfl become financially self sufficient his government speaks for a financial oligarchy whose herd immunity policy has resulted in more than 160 000 preventable deaths while overseeing trillions in handouts contracts and subsidies to the banks corporations and other financial parasites the unprecedented scale of the cuts being readied was made clear by tfl s finance committee in a paper released on november 24 which forecast 18 percent reduction in london bus services with 100 routes to be axed a seventh of the network and reduced frequency across 200 more about one third of all additional routes 9 percent service reduction across the london underground with possible scenarios including permanent closure of the 115 year old bakerloo line or the jubilee metropolitan or hammersmith city lines non replacement of ageing train fleet for example 50 year old bakerloo trains with rolling stock renewal contracts cancelled scrapping of bus electrification with existing bus vehicles to be kept in service longer to reduce costs no progress towards vision zero safety decarbonisation improving air quality or active travel to support a shift towards more sustainable modes of transport end of capital expenditure on disability access for transport passengers with non renewal of step free assets resulting in more frequent failures of lifts and escalators london s road assets to remain in current degraded condition with a high risk of unplanned bridge and tunnel closures cancellation of tfl supply chain contracts impacting on 43 000 jobs in derby falkirk bolton liverpool yorkshire and ballymena northern ireland the cuts are so deep that by tfl s own admission they will push london s transport system into a state of managed decline as council housing tenants know this involves the deliberate rundown of public assets as a prelude to privatisation and looting by developers and speculators working class londoners will be hit hardest only 56 percent of london s 8 9 million people has access to a car tfl says its cuts will result in one million fewer daily bus and train journeys and a 20 percent reduction in the number of jobs available within 50 minutes travel but the wider social costs are incalculable london has the highest poverty rate in england with 38 percent of children in poverty and one in five working families unable to meet their daily needs while 59 percent of londoners use the bus each week tfl s own modelling shows the poorest and most vulnerable rely on buses the most the least profitable routes will be axed unions call for alliance with labour and big business tfl s cuts will generate mass opposition among transport workers and passengers workers are already demanding unified strikes on the london underground to defeat the government s plans but workers can only mount a successful struggle if they break free from the grip of the transport unions which are seeking to shackle workers to an alliance with labour party politicians including useless appeals to mayor khan to refuse johnson s cuts the agenda of transport unions aslef the rail maritime and transport rmt union unite and tssa was on display last wednesday at a rally held outside parliament under the banner save london s transport unite london eastern regional secretary general secretary peter kavanagh rmt general secretary mick lynch and aslef general secretary mick whelan issued cringeworthy praise for a line up of labour mps the empty affirmations of solidarity from labour mps john mcdonnell louise haigh sam tarry and elly baker labour assembly member and the party s transport lead in the london assembly were issued safe in the knowledge that the unions will do all in their power to block a mass industrial and political fight by transport workers and their millions of supporters the unions promotion of the labour party was damage control aimed at concealing khan s role and his labour run london assembly in enforcing the johnson government s diktats the whitewashing reached absurd levels at the rally with the rmt s lynch declaring we ve got a message today for mayor khan he s got to decide which side he s on because when it comes down to it there are only two sides in a struggle you re either with the workers or you re against them more ludicrous still was lynch s appeal to labour leader sir keir starmer you either join with us or you stand on the sideline there is no neutrals in this struggle starmer has been in de facto coalition with the tories for nearly two years now while khan is an obedient servant of the city of london since the former shadow lord chancellor became mayor in 2016 he has enforced 1 billion in annual cuts at tfl downgrading services across the network during the pandemic he signed emergency funding agreements with transport secretary grant shapps pledging swingeing cuts and a fire sale of public assets khan is calling for 3 billion emergency funding over the next two years to meet a projected revenue shortfall and a longer term funding model to end tfl s overwhelming reliance on passenger fare revenue his fruitless appeals are directed to the sociopaths at 10 downing street khan chose the financial times to publish his written protest last month against the government s cuts his op ed cited warnings by business groups tfl and city hall that tfl s funding crisis threatens national economic recovery and that deep cuts to services would jeopardise efforts to force londoners back to their workplaces during a still raging pandemic unite s peter kavanagh took up this theme with relish at wednesday s rally calling for an almighty alliance between all interested parties and between politicians and yes big business because big business needs a properly funded public transport system kavanagh is a ruthless official who has a record of victimising workplace militants rmt briefing paper the rmt has enjoyed an undeserving reputation as a militant union but its briefing paper on tfl s funding crisis exposes it as a corporatist flunkey of labour and big business its first paragraph offers the following naked apologia for khan tfl s statutory status as a local authority binds it to operate a balanced budget so it has had to model a programme of massive cuts to services to cover its budget shortfall the rmt s depiction of khan as the hapless victim of johnson was echoed by unite tssa aslef and the labour mps at wednesday s rally it is absolution offered for labour s role in enforcing government cuts tfl s finance committee has already submitted proposals for savage inroads declaring as a local authority for statutory financial purposes we are obliged to prepare a budget that is balanced over both the short and medium term under the heading london is uniting against the cuts the rmt s briefing paper outlines its strategy to fight johnson transport workers may be surprised to learn that their allies in this fight are the london chamber of commerce and industry lcci business lobby group london first and a global coalition of city mayors led by khan london mayor sadiq khan ap photo robert stevens file transport workers must reject these efforts at chaining their struggle to the corporate and financial boardrooms unsurprisingly the rmt offers scant evidence of support from big business and the morsel held out turns on closer inspection to dust for instance the rmt cites an october 20 statement by the lcci claiming it shows that businesses want to see the return of consistent central government financial support but the lcci s statement merely called for a month long emergency funding package with no conditions stating that a longer term funding discussion should be the point at which substantial changes such

are an indictment of capitalism a city that once boasted the world s first modern sewage system 1865 its first underground railway system 1863 and such marvels of civil engineering as tower bridge

the fiscal responsibility bill will support public debt reduction and the sustainability of the government development plan the authorities should also reconsider the allocation of a portion of cbi revenue to build an insurance framework against natural disasters and debt reduction on the financial sector front priority should be given to the capitalization of credit unions and the reduction of non performing loans npls recent developments outlook and risks the covid 19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the dominican economy gdp is estimated to have contracted by 11 percent in 2020 and to have shown a modest recovery of 3 7 percent in 2021 underpinned by a sharp reduction in tourism and related sectors plus the covid 19 outbreak that forced a lockdown in august 2021 since march 2020 the government had a swift reaction to the pandemic by carrying out health spending and social transfers however despite ample vaccine and testing availability vaccination remains below 40 percent of the population due to hesitancy output decline was contained by strong growth in the construction sector due to the large public investment program in housing and infrastructure resilient to natural disasters financed with record high cbi revenue of 30 percent of gdp despite sharp declines in tax revenue and increase in spending large cbi revenue led to a small reduction in the fiscal balance in fy2020 however the estimated public debt increased to 106 percent of gdp in 2020 with higher official borrowing in this context the current account deficit is estimated to have widened into near 30 percent of gdp underpinned by the loss of tourism exports and increase in imports related the public investment and the increase in commodity prices albeit contained by a decline in private demand for imports the financial sector has remained liquid and stable during the pandemic but npls are above prudential benchmarks the loan service moratoria authorized by the regulators of banks and credit unions helped support firms and households affected by loss of income helping contain a deterioration in portfolio performance despite an improvement relative to 2020 npls remain high in the range of 11 14 percent of loans for banks and 10 17 percent for credit unions the prudential benchmark is 5 percent in both sectors to comply with the eccb requirement banks have prepared plans to increase provisioning to 100 percent of npls by 2024 pre covid precautionary increase in provisions with adoption of ifrs9 standards in 2018 has facilitated this process most loans under moratoria have currently normalized the financial sector remains liquid with an increase in deposits underpinned by prudent private spending government transfers the loan moratoria and increase in foreign remittances the growth outlook is promising supported by the large public investment program and the projected gradual recovery in tourism with added hotel capacity the government plans to maintain high levels of public investment into the medium term financed mainly by cbi revenue key projects include a new international airport housing resilient to natural disasters roads improvement a resilient water and sewage network improvements in the hospital capacity including a new hospital financed by the people s republic of china and a geothermal electricity plant these projects will accelerate growth in the near term during the construction phase and will also increase potential output in the long term including spillovers in tourism and reduction of fossil fuel dependency all of which improve dominica s external sustainability and competitiveness gdp is projected to reach pre pandemic levels by 2023 averaging 5 percent growth per year through 2022 26 tourism recovery would be supported by the ongoing construction of new hotels and the inauguration of direct flights from the united states from december 2021 risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside main risks include renewed worldwide and domestic covid 19 contagion waves leading to loss of tourism revenue and forcing lockdowns and mobility restrictions a decline in cbi revenue below expectations and insufficient progress on local vaccination due to continued hesitancy weakness in the financial sector particularly the credit unions where 4 out of 6 institutions have thin capital buffers below the regulation requirement could amplify downside risks and may result in contingent fiscal liabilities economic policies in the near term the government should continue maximizing the effort to increase vaccination which is critical from health and economic recovery perspectives continuing public communication and education campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy and building additional health care centers could prove critical in possible contagion outbreaks reallocation of windfall cbi revenue to balance public investment with government financial resilience and debt sustainability would strengthen the outlook thus far the authorities have used the majority of cbi revenue to invest in infrastructure resilient to natural disasters this is understandable considering dominica s significant exposure moreover the improvements in infrastructure in the public investment plan are important and expected to boost potential output especially with resilient investments in roads electricity generation a new hospital and the water and sanitation network however the risks to the outlook justify the allocation of a portion of cbi revenue to the vulnerability and resiliency fund vrf for self insurance against natural disasters at least 10 percent of gdp plus annual savings of about 1 5 percent of gdp to ensure its long term sustainability and to reduce public debt with targeted net repayments once output has recovered this would increase fiscal buffers speed up post disaster recovery with funding for reconstruction and rehabilitation and create space to access external financing in the event of a large natural disaster or a prolonged pandemic this strategy would better support the long term sustainability of the public investment plan and development agenda while protecting public finances especially considering their long execution horizon it would also support the achievement of the regional debt target of 60 percent of gdp by 2035 by reducing the impact of natural disaster shocks on public debt while helping avert a debt crisis after an extreme shock this allocation however would come at the cost of lower public investment which could reduce the estimated output level by about 3 4 percentage points of gdp in the medium term self insurance in the vrf should be topped up with additional coverage for large and extreme disasters as part of a layered insurance framework the first layer the vrf would cover relatively more recurrent but less damaging disasters a second layer could include increased coverage under the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility ccrif with a re calibration of the triggers to activate under more severe disasters the government could also consider a third layer of state contingent instruments calibrated to trigger after extreme events including for example the world bank cat ddo facility a re prioritization in the execution of the fiscal consolidation plan committed to in the 2020 rapid credit facility disbursement could support the recovery better thus far the government has made progress on several measures it committed to establishing limits on discretional tax exemptions on imports advanced preparations of an income tax reform including a presumptive tax which could be passed in fy2022 and launching a property tax reform to incentivize the use of idle property in prime urban areas beyond this the government intention to avoid additional new taxes or charges is welcome consistent with the objective of creating a favorable environment for private investment while minimizing the burden on tax administration which is affected by limited capacity the actuarial analysis update of the pension system by the dominica social security dss planed by early 2022 delayed due to covid mobility restrictions would trigger parametric amendments if needed for sustainability these measures improve allocational efficiency while addressing long term contingent liabilities therefore contributing to the sustainability of the public investment plan within the regional debt target commitment however the introduction of a solid waste charge could be delayed or reconsidered in light of the low potential revenue and the additional tax administration burden while a reduction of the preferential rate on diesel could be done later once the economy has recovered to reduce its distortionary impact the government should prioritize cost saving expenditure efficiency measures and begin preparations for their implementation as soon as feasible these include a civil service reform including a review of allowances at an advanced stage with support from caricad and better targeting of social transfers the national census needed to update the ministry of social services database has been delayed to 2022 due to the pandemic measures could be taken to reduce informality and increase the tax base fund staff estimates indicate that over 30 percent of the dominica economy is informal including by ensuring the registration with the dss of workers employed in the public investment projects and with the introduction of the presumptive tax to strengthen the public debt sustainability outlook and support achievement of the regional debt target the government should maintain progress on institutional fiscal reforms re submission to parliament the fiscal responsibility bill after a consultation with affected parties to ensure political support which will be critical for societal commitment and an effective implementation other ongoing reforms that should be completed include the new public procurement and disposal of public property act to modernize public procurement and a framework to monitor state owned enterprises important to identify contingent liabilities and for fiscal planning the government s fiscal plan should internalize the long term implications of the large public investments on the positive side the projects are mostly financed with cbi revenue which implies that the external and fiscal solvency position has improved with the buildup of valuable revenue generating assets that are expected to have positive spillovers on private investment and growth on the downside the added capital stock will require sustained recurrent maintenance spending underscoring the importance of disaster resiliency which has been incorporated in all the projects with low cost geothermal electricity generation the government should maximize the potential reduction of electricity tariffs currently among the highest in the world this would improve further external competitiveness and the business environment domestic banks should prepare a capitalization plan to comply with the provisioning targets set by the eccb banks operating in dominica are working on medium term plans to strengthen capital buffers in 2022 24 including to meet increasing loan loss provisioning requirements set by the eccb 60 percent of loans by 2022 and 100 percent by 2024 preliminary staff analysis indicates that domestic banks would have to increase provisioning by 55 percent in 2022 an amount equivalent to 1 6 percent of gdp and near 20 percent of capital and by 160 percent by 2024 3 percent of gdp and near 60 percent of capital relative to their 2021q1 value delays in reducing remaining npls could add to this need considering the weaknesses in the credit union sector a plan is needed to address capital shortfalls as soon as feasible the national regulator of non bank financial institutions should stress test credit unions and insurance companies in lieu of the risks to the outlook while the loan moratorium and restructuring has helped maintain financial stability during the pandemic credit unions should prepare a plan to reduce npls the modernization of foreclosure legislation could facilitate seizing collateral and aid the resolution of new and longstanding npls the regulator should enforce a plan to bring all credit unions capital above the regulatory minimum and prepare other structural reforms to support financial stability the latter includes the consideration of options to provide liquidity assistance to the sector this is important considering their size and macro criticality assets of credit unions and insurance companies exceed 75 percent of gdp and credit unions deposit their liquid assets in the domestic banks long standing plans to modernize the regulation in line with regional harmonization strategy should be advanced in the near term additional human and financial resources and independence from the ministry of finance would strengthen supervision effectiveness and accelerate compliance the capitalization of financial institutions and progress on regulatory reform are critical to support private sector growth while reducing the need of government support after a shock thereby improving the public debt outlook continued progress on aml cft legislation framework is important to minimize risks to correspondent banking relationships dominica completed its mutual evaluation round with the caribbean financial action task force during 2008 14 and has addressed identified deficiencies a

debbie kelley the gazette colorado springs colo a nationwide tradition viewed by some americans as a patriotic display recognizing service and sacrifice represents for others a sectarian religious symbol amounting to desecration complaints about the popular wreaths across america day when fresh evergreen wreaths are placed at gravesites of military veterans at national and local cemeteries are climbing in the weeks leading up to this year s event says the founder of a civil rights advocacy organization that s protesting the practice we have no problem if people reach out and want a wreath on their deceased veterans graves but to put them everywhere to blanket them without permission of the surviving families is unconstitutional an atrocity and a disgrace said mikey weinstein founder of the military religious freedom foundation the crucifix is at the crux of the opposition weinstein who is jewish and his supporters who include jews muslims buddhists sikhs and the jedi church as well as christians believe the wreath pays homage to christianity this should be an aspect of respect weinstein said it s almost like a fundamentalist christian gang sign to put a symbol of the christian season of christmas on any grave the purpose amber caron spokeswoman for the maine headquartered wreaths across america said the wreaths each hand made of 10 boughs of balsam tied with a red velveteen bow are veterans wreaths not christmas wreaths we are not decorating graves but honoring american heroes she said the idea of placing wreaths on deceased military members graves began informally at arlington national cemetery in december 1992 when a family who owns a wreath making business in maine donated their leftover stock to the army run cemetery in virginia since becoming a nonprofit in 2007 wreaths across america has expanded to 3 100 burial sites including 145 of 154 national cemetery administration properties caron said individuals as well as groups such as american legion posts and scouting programs contributed 24 9 million to wreaths across america in the fiscal year ending june 30 2020 tax forms show volunteers are expected to lay nearly 2 million wreaths on graves during this year s observance on dec 18 the mission caron said is to remember all the fallen honor those that serve in the military and their families and teach the next generation the value of freedom symbolism weinstein calls the custom proselytizing to argue that it isn t a christian symbol is preposterous he said imagine if that was an atheist satanic or jewish symbol throughout history wreaths have been laced with symbolism from various cultures including paganism and often denote the spiritual belief in life everlasting and the rebirth of the spirit weinstein s organization requested in 2014 that wreaths across america not place wreaths at headstones of departed service members that display the jewish star of david known in hebrew as magen david leaving live flowers or wreaths at headstones is normally not a jewish ritual in 2017 a photo circulated with a wreath from the program leaning on a headstone with a star of david some jewish families request the wreaths caron said and sometimes volunteers unintentionally place them at a grave with the jewish star policies wreaths across america s official policy states that the organization is not affiliated with any religion or political view she pointed out the program follows the policies of cemeteries that grant permission for the annual remembrance ceremony caron said at cemeteries that don t have formal policies volunteers do not place a wreath on the headstones of those graves marked with the star of david out of respect for jewish custom the organization s policy states we simply pause and pay our respects the only exception is when families of the deceased request a wreath and then their wishes are honored the national cemetery administration honors that policy to the best of our ability said michael brophy director of the fort logan national cemetery complex in denver which has more than 105 000 graves the federal agency allows wreaths across america to set wreaths at gravesites but does not carry out any function of the program brophy said volunteers do but cemetery staff check graves to see if any graves are marked incorrectly brophy said concerns anyone who has concerns about gravesite decorations or other issues should contact the cemetery he said fort logan keeps a list of requests regarding such matters brophy said and abides by them as a general matter of course for any reason of concern we try to try to reach a mutual accommodation and respect the wishes of families of loved ones interred brophy said weinstein said his organization has received thousands of grievances since wreaths across america expanded nationwide 15 years ago this year the office has fielded an overwhelming number of complaints weinstein said producing hundreds of angry phone calls letters and emails about the program he s calling for cemeteries to require families permission instead of an opt out system to address the matter donations fort logan a national cemetery under the auspices of the department of veterans affairs has not received any complaints brophy said it seems to be quite popular he said of the wreath laying event which this year has raised enough money for volunteers to place 12 000 wreaths at fort logan in a yearly rotation so that all graves are periodically covered he expects up to 2 000 volunteers for the public ceremony that starts at 10 a m dec 18 the united states air force academy for the eighth time will place donated wreaths on all 1 350 gravesites on the military installation in colorado springs said spokesman dean j miller wreaths were donated from contributions of americans nationwide he said and are arriving from the air force services agency in san antonio texas no religious affiliation is associated with wreaths by the academy and all requests to opt out of such honors received from families of veterans interred at the academy cemetery are honored miller said in an email the academy s mortuary affairs officer said in her nearly 30 years in her post she has never received a request to opt out from families of interred veterans sponsorship of the 15 wreaths topped the goal of covering all 2 600 gravesites at the pikes peak national cemetery this year said wreaths across america cemetery coordinator jennifer kendig she s a member of the american legion ladies auxiliary in falcon so many people come out and support this event because it means a lot to honor the veterans that have passed kendig said it s heart warming to see fundraising produced enough money to buy more than 3 000 wreaths this year with the overage offered to other area cemeteries or applied to next year s ceremony she said sponsoring organizations receive 5 from every wreath sold some of which is donated to veterans organizations in the falcon area she added weinstein said he and his wife started the organization he heads after their children attended the air force academy and were subject to anti semitism over the past 16 years he said his organization has represented nearly 77 000 clients who oppose certain practices pertaining to the military that they believe have religious overtones most wish to remain anonymous weinstein said for fear of retribution but he believes they all have the right to dissent when religion primarily christianity is infused into the military culture and lifestyle people say you re scrooge weinstein but this is wrong and un american to assume every veteran would want a wreath on their grave he said these veterans have given their all for this country and they can t fight back now we re going to continue fighting for them

medical advisor dr anthony fauci made sunday saying the initial data on the omicron variant is encouraging the comments came the same day cdc director dr rochelle walensky told abc news the new variant has now been discovered in at least 15 u s states and less than two weeks after the world health organization designated it as being of concern clearly in south africa omicron has a

lagged the other major averages monday weighed down by health care and tech stocks moderna the biggest decliner in the index fell 13 4 amd and nvidia were off by 3 4 and 2 1 respectively but as investors fears about omicron faded several high priced tech shares that began the day in the red turned green craig erlam senior market analyst at oanda urged investors to stay cautious until more data can provide more cause for optimism reports of the omicron symptoms being less severe are boosting risk appetite but it s too soon to get carried away he said in a note for one we ve seen this repeatedly since the initial news broke a little over a week ago markets have been very headline driven and this is just the latest rally on the back of some positive reports erlam also warned that the rest of this week could prove to be as volatile as the last while this may be the first in a slew of positive data around the new variant it could also be the anomaly and what follows could explain why world leaders and various agencies have been so anxious he said weeks like this the economic data would always play second fiddle but as it turns out it s looking a little thin on that front and central banks are in the same position as the rest of us on friday tech stocks pulled the market lower the nasdaq composite slid 1 92 with shares of tesla as the biggest drag cathie wood s flagship ark innovation fund fell more than 5 on friday and all of the fund s holdings entered a bear market apart from two stocks but it was comments from the fed that unnerved markets late last week not fears about the omicron variant according to tom essaye author of the sevens report last week chair jerome powell signaled the fed s focus is inflation even with the new variant emerging that led investors to rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth essaye called the market behavior a sort of taper tantrum 2 0 as markets react to a more hawkish fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates the central bank is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to 30 billion a month at its meeting next week cnbc s steve liesman reported monday based on comments by fed officials initial discussions could also begin as soon as the december meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year tom hainlin of u s bank wealth management said investors are also focused on what the terminal interest rate will be and that he expects it to be lower that what investors are pricing in the long term growth rate is challenged by factors that are changing demographics productivity and longer term growth in the labor force and drive the economy in the long term he told cnbc we still think those are muted relative to history so the idea that the federal reserve would raise rates up until up to a rate that we ve historically seen we think that it s not likely to get up to that level bitcoin traded around 57 000 on friday morning but by saturday had plunged to around 43 000 by monday the world s largest cryptocurrency had clawed back some of its losses last trading at around 49 297 08 according to coin metrics hainlin declined to comment directly on cryptocurrency markets but said the weekend s crash was consistent with what s happening in the broader markets any speculative growth portions of the market are the ones that are trading off the most and that s perhaps due to accelerated fed tapering and fed rate increases he said if you raise interest rates that decreases the value of those long term cash flows for those long term growth companies or parts of the market that are dependent on them microstrategy fell 5 4 on monday shares of block recently renamed from square and coinbase were lower too although they reclaimed deeper declines from earlier in the day

menafn caribbean news global usa dominica the covid 19 pandemic has hit dominica hard impacting tourism and related sectors recovery in the medium term is promising underpinned by a large public investment program to build resilience to natural disasters largely financed by buoyant citizenship by investment cbi revenue on the fiscal front near term policies should prioritize expenditure efficiency while avoiding additional taxes and fees that hamper the recovery of the private sector and the business climate with public debt approaching 106 percent of gdp after the pandemic passing the fiscal responsibility bill will support public debt reduction and the sustainability of the government development plan the authorities should also reconsider the allocation of a portion of cbi revenue to build an insurance framework against natural disasters and debt reduction on the financial sector front priority should be given to the capitalization of credit unions and the reduction of non performing loans npls recent developments outlook and risks the covid 19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the dominican economy gdp is estimated to have contracted by 11 percent in 2020 and to have shown a modest recovery of 3 7 percent in 2021 underpinned by a sharp reduction in tourism and related sectors plus the covid 19 outbreak that forced a lockdown in august 2021 since march 2020 the government had a swift reaction to the pandemic by carrying out health spending and social transfers however despite ample vaccine and testing availability vaccination remains below 40 percent of the population due to hesitancy output decline was contained by strong growth in the construction sector due to the large public investment program in housing and infrastructure resilient to natural disasters financed with record high cbi revenue of 30 percent of gdp despite sharp declines in tax revenue and increase in spending large cbi revenue led to a small reduction in the fiscal balance in fy2020 however the estimated public debt increased to 106 percent of gdp in 2020 with higher official borrowing in this context the current account deficit is estimated to have widened into near 30 percent of gdp underpinned by the loss of tourism exports and increase in imports related the public investment and the increase in commodity prices albeit contained by a decline in private demand for imports the financial sector has remained liquid and stable during the pandemic but npls are above prudential benchmarks the loan service moratoria authorized by the regulators of banks and credit unions helped support firms and households affected by loss of income helping contain a deterioration in portfolio performance despite an improvement relative to 2020 npls remain high in the range of 11 14 percent of loans for banks and 10 17 percent for credit unions the prudential benchmark is 5 percent in both sectors to comply with the eccb requirement banks have prepared plans to increase provisioning to 100 percent of npls by 2024 pre covid precautionary increase in provisions with adoption of ifrs9 standards in 2018 has facilitated this process most loans under moratoria have currently normalized the financial sector remains liquid with an increase in deposits underpinned by prudent private spending government transfers the loan moratoria and increase in foreign remittances the growth outlook is promising supported by the large public investment program and the projected gradual recovery in tourism with added hotel capacity the government plans to maintain high levels of public investment into the medium term financed mainly by cbi revenue key projects include a new international airport housing resilient to natural disasters roads improvement a resilient water and sewage network improvements in the hospital capacity including a new hospital financed by the people s republic of china and a geothermal electricity plant these projects will accelerate growth in the near term during the construction phase and will also increase potential output in the long term including spillovers in tourism and reduction of fossil fuel dependency all of which improve dominica s external sustainability and competitiveness gdp is projected to reach pre pandemic levels by 2023 averaging 5 percent growth per year through 2022 26 tourism recovery would be supported by the ongoing construction of new hotels and the inauguration of direct flights from the united states from december 2021 risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside main risks include renewed worldwide and domestic covid 19 contagion waves leading to loss of tourism revenue and forcing lockdowns and mobility restrictions a decline in cbi revenue below expectations and insufficient progress on local vaccination due to continued hesitancy weakness in the financial sector particularly the credit unions where 4 out of 6 institutions have thin capital buffers below the regulation requirement could amplify downside risks and may result in contingent fiscal liabilities economic policies in the near term the government should continue maximizing the effort to increase vaccination which is critical from health and economic recovery perspectives continuing public communication and education campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy and building additional health care centers could prove critical in possible contagion outbreaks reallocation of windfall cbi revenue to balance public investment with government financial resilience and debt sustainability would strengthen the outlook thus far the authorities have used the majority of cbi revenue to invest in infrastructure resilient to natural disasters this is understandable considering dominica s significant exposure moreover the improvements in infrastructure in the public investment plan are important and expected to boost potential output especially with resilient investments in roads electricity generation a new hospital and the water and sanitation network however the risks to the outlook justify the allocation of a portion of cbi revenue to the vulnerability and resiliency fund vrf for self insurance against natural disasters at least 10 percent of gdp plus annual savings of about 1 5 percent of gdp to ensure its long term sustainability and to reduce public debt with targeted net repayments once output has recovered this would increase fiscal buffers speed up post disaster recovery with funding for reconstruction and rehabilitation and create space to access external financing in the event of a large natural disaster or a prolonged pandemic this strategy would better support the long term sustainability of the public investment plan and development agenda while protecting public finances especially considering their long execution horizon it would also support the achievement of the regional debt target of 60 percent of gdp by 2035 by reducing the impact of natural disaster shocks on public debt while helping avert a debt crisis after an extreme shock this allocation however would come at the cost of lower public investment which could reduce the estimated output level by about 3 4 percentage points of gdp in the medium term self insurance in the vrf should be topped up with additional coverage for large and extreme disasters as part of a layered insurance framework the first layer the vrf would cover relatively more recurrent but less damaging disasters a second layer could include increased coverage under the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility ccrif with a re calibration of the triggers to activate under more severe disasters the government could also consider a third layer of state contingent instruments calibrated to trigger after extreme events including for example the world bank cat ddo facility a re prioritization in the execution of the fiscal consolidation plan committed to in the 2020 rapid credit facility disbursement could support the recovery better thus far the government has made progress on several measures it committed to establishing limits on discretional tax exemptions on imports advanced preparations of an income tax reform including a presumptive tax which could be passed in fy2022 and launching a property tax reform to incentivize the use of idle property in prime urban areas beyond this the government intention to avoid additional new taxes or charges is welcome consistent with the objective of creating a favorable environment for private investment while minimizing the burden on tax administration which is affected by limited capacity the actuarial analysis update of the pension system by the dominica social security dss planed by early 2022 delayed due to covid mobility restrictions would trigger parametric amendments if needed for sustainability these measures improve allocational efficiency while addressing long term contingent liabilities therefore contributing to the sustainability of the public investment plan within the regional debt target commitment however the introduction of a solid waste charge could be delayed or reconsidered in light of the low potential revenue and the additional tax administration burden while a reduction of the preferential rate on diesel could be done later once the economy has recovered to reduce its distortionary impact the government should prioritize cost saving expenditure efficiency measures and begin preparations for their implementation as soon as feasible these include a civil service reform including a review of allowances at an advanced stage with support from caricad and better targeting of social transfers the national census needed to update the ministry of social services database has been delayed to 2022 due to the pandemic measures could be taken to reduce informality and increase the tax base fund staff estimates indicate that over 30 percent of the dominica economy is informal including by ensuring the

the fiscal responsibility bill will support public debt reduction and the sustainability of the government development plan the authorities should also reconsider the allocation of a portion of cbi revenue to build an insurance framework against natural disasters and debt reduction on the financial sector front priority should be given to the capitalization of credit unions and the reduction of non performing loans npls recent developments outlook and risks the covid 19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the dominican economy gdp is estimated to have contracted by 11 percent in 2020 and to have shown a modest recovery of 3 7 percent in 2021 underpinned by a sharp reduction in tourism and related sectors plus the covid 19 outbreak that forced a lockdown in august 2021 since march 2020 the government had a swift reaction to the pandemic by carrying out health spending and social transfers however despite ample vaccine and testing availability vaccination remains below 40 percent of the population due to hesitancy output decline was contained by strong growth in the construction sector due to the large public investment program in housing and infrastructure resilient to natural disasters financed with record high cbi revenue of 30 percent of gdp despite sharp declines in tax revenue and increase in spending large cbi revenue led to a small reduction in the fiscal balance in fy2020 however the estimated public debt increased to 106 percent of gdp in 2020 with higher official borrowing in this context the current account deficit is estimated to have widened into near 30 percent of gdp underpinned by the loss of tourism exports and increase in imports related the public investment and the increase in commodity prices albeit contained by a decline in private demand for imports the financial sector has remained liquid and stable during the pandemic but npls are above prudential benchmarks the loan service moratoria authorized by the regulators of banks and credit unions helped support firms and households affected by loss of income helping contain a deterioration in portfolio performance despite an improvement relative to 2020 npls remain high in the range of 11 14 percent of loans for banks and 10 17 percent for credit unions the prudential benchmark is 5 percent in both sectors to comply with the eccb requirement banks have prepared plans to increase provisioning to 100 percent of npls by 2024 pre covid precautionary increase in provisions with adoption of ifrs9 standards in 2018 has facilitated this process most loans under moratoria have currently normalized the financial sector remains liquid with an increase in deposits underpinned by prudent private spending government transfers the loan moratoria and increase in foreign remittances the growth outlook is promising supported by the large public investment program and the projected gradual recovery in tourism with added hotel capacity the government plans to maintain high levels of public investment into the medium term financed mainly by cbi revenue key projects include a new international airport housing resilient to natural disasters roads improvement a resilient water and sewage network improvements in the hospital capacity including a new hospital financed by the people s republic of china and a geothermal electricity plant these projects will accelerate growth in the near term during the construction phase and will also increase potential output in the long term including spillovers in tourism and reduction of fossil fuel dependency all of which improve dominica s external sustainability and competitiveness gdp is projected to reach pre pandemic levels by 2023 averaging 5 percent growth per year through 2022 26 tourism recovery would be supported by the ongoing construction of new hotels and the inauguration of direct flights from the united states from december 2021 risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside main risks include renewed worldwide and domestic covid 19 contagion waves leading to loss of tourism revenue and forcing lockdowns and mobility restrictions a decline in cbi revenue below expectations and insufficient progress on local vaccination due to continued hesitancy weakness in the financial sector particularly the credit unions where 4 out of 6 institutions have thin capital buffers below the regulation requirement could amplify downside risks and may result in contingent fiscal liabilities economic policies in the near term the government should continue maximizing the effort to increase vaccination which is critical from health and economic recovery perspectives continuing public communication and education campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy and building additional health care centers could prove critical in possible contagion outbreaks reallocation of windfall cbi revenue to balance public investment with government financial resilience and debt sustainability would strengthen the outlook thus far the authorities have used the majority of cbi revenue to invest in infrastructure resilient to natural disasters this is understandable considering dominica s significant exposure moreover the improvements in infrastructure in the public investment plan are important and expected to boost potential output especially with resilient investments in roads electricity generation a new hospital and the water and sanitation network however the risks to the outlook justify the allocation of a portion of cbi revenue to the vulnerability and resiliency fund vrf for self insurance against natural disasters at least 10 percent of gdp plus annual savings of about 1 5 percent of gdp to ensure its long term sustainability and to reduce public debt with targeted net repayments once output has recovered this would increase fiscal buffers speed up post disaster recovery with funding for reconstruction and rehabilitation and create space to access external financing in the event of a large natural disaster or a prolonged pandemic this strategy would better support the long term sustainability of the public investment plan and development agenda while protecting public finances especially considering their long execution horizon it would also support the achievement of the regional debt target of 60 percent of gdp by 2035 by reducing the impact of natural disaster shocks on public debt while helping avert a debt crisis after an extreme shock this allocation however would come at the cost of lower public investment which could reduce the estimated output level by about 3 4 percentage points of gdp in the medium term self insurance in the vrf should be topped up with additional coverage for large and extreme disasters as part of a layered insurance framework the first layer the vrf would cover relatively more recurrent but less damaging disasters a second layer could include increased coverage under the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility ccrif with a re calibration of the triggers to activate under more severe disasters the government could also consider a third layer of state contingent instruments calibrated to trigger after extreme events including for example the world bank cat ddo facility a re prioritization in the execution of the fiscal consolidation plan committed to in the 2020 rapid credit facility disbursement could support the recovery better thus far the government has made progress on several measures it committed to establishing limits on discretional tax exemptions on imports advanced preparations of an income tax reform including a presumptive tax which could be passed in fy2022 and launching a property tax reform to incentivize the use of idle property in prime urban areas beyond this the government intention to avoid additional new taxes or charges is welcome consistent with the objective of creating a favorable environment for private investment while minimizing the burden on tax administration which is affected by limited capacity the actuarial analysis update of the pension system by the dominica social security dss planed by early 2022 delayed due to covid mobility restrictions would trigger parametric amendments if needed for sustainability these measures improve allocational efficiency while addressing long term contingent liabilities therefore contributing to the sustainability of the public investment plan within the regional debt target commitment however the introduction of a solid waste charge could be delayed or reconsidered in light of the low potential revenue and the additional tax administration burden while a reduction of the preferential rate on diesel could be done later once the economy has recovered to reduce its distortionary impact the government should prioritize cost saving expenditure efficiency measures and begin preparations for their implementation as soon as feasible these include a civil service reform including a review of allowances at an advanced stage with support from caricad and better targeting of social transfers the national census needed to update the ministry of social services database has been delayed to 2022 due to the pandemic measures could be taken to reduce informality and increase the tax base fund staff estimates indicate that over 30 percent of the dominica economy is informal including by ensuring the registration with the dss of workers employed in the public investment projects and with the introduction of the presumptive tax to strengthen the public debt sustainability outlook and support achievement of the regional debt target the government should maintain progress on institutional fiscal reforms re submission to parliament the fiscal responsibility bill after a consultation with affected parties to ensure political support which will be critical for societal commitment and an effective implementation other ongoing reforms that should be completed include the new public procurement and disposal of public property act to modernize public procurement and a framework to monitor state owned enterprises important to identify contingent liabilities and for fiscal planning the government s fiscal plan should internalize the long term implications of the large public investments on the positive side the projects are mostly financed with cbi revenue which implies that the external and fiscal solvency position has improved with the buildup of valuable revenue generating assets that are expected to have positive spillovers on private investment and growth on the downside the added capital stock will require sustained recurrent maintenance spending underscoring the importance of disaster resiliency which has been incorporated in all the projects with low cost geothermal electricity generation the government should maximize the potential reduction of electricity tariffs currently among the highest in the world this would improve further external competitiveness and the business environment domestic banks should prepare a capitalization plan to comply with the provisioning targets set by the eccb banks operating in dominica are working on medium term plans to strengthen capital buffers in 2022 24 including to meet increasing loan loss provisioning requirements set by the eccb 60 percent of loans by 2022 and 100 percent by 2024 preliminary staff analysis indicates that domestic banks would have to increase provisioning by 55 percent in 2022 an amount equivalent to 1 6 percent of gdp and near 20 percent of capital and by 160 percent by 2024 3 percent of gdp and near 60 percent of capital relative to their 2021q1 value delays in reducing remaining npls could add to this need considering the weaknesses in the credit union sector a plan is needed to address capital shortfalls as soon as feasible the national regulator of non bank financial institutions should stress test credit unions and insurance companies in lieu of the risks to the outlook while the loan moratorium and restructuring has helped maintain financial stability during the pandemic credit unions should prepare a plan to reduce npls the modernization of foreclosure legislation could facilitate seizing collateral and aid the resolution of new and longstanding npls the regulator should enforce a plan to bring all credit unions capital above the regulatory minimum and prepare other structural reforms to support financial stability the latter includes the consideration of options to provide liquidity assistance to the sector this is important considering their size and macro criticality assets of credit unions and insurance companies exceed 75 percent of gdp and credit unions deposit their liquid assets in the domestic banks long standing plans to modernize the regulation in line with regional harmonization strategy should be advanced in the near term additional human and financial resources and independence from the ministry of

cushy relationship between wall street and chinese tech giants who are under siege from authorities in beijing and regulators in america only five months transpired between didi s going public in new york in june and word friday that it would prepare a hong kong listing during that time its market value has fallen by 63 per cent a logo of chinese ride hailing giant didi chuxing at its headquarter in beijing picture afp didi s move comes in the wake of a sweeping chinese regulatory crackdown in the past year that has clipped the wings of major internet firms wielding huge influence on consumers lives including alibaba and tencent after friday s announcement heavyweight chinese online retailers whose stocks are sold on the new york exchange such as alibaba jd com and pinduoduo dropped sharply shares in alibaba whose arrival on wall street in 2014 to a loud fanfare kicked off the parade of chinese firms listing in the big apple fell to their lowest level in nearly five years as rumours circulated that after didi leaves alibaba might be next technically even as didi chuxing moves its listing to hong kong holders of its shares in new york retain those stakes their investment does not simply vanish but people are very fearful about regulations and the chinese government said kevin carter portfolio manager at emqq and that has really really affected sentiment people are scared investors are fearful of the beijing s regulation and crackdown on tech companies coincidentally on thursday us market regulators announced the adoption of a rule allowing them to delist foreign companies if they fail to provide information to auditors the move is aimed primarily at chinese firms and requires them to disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a government while more than 50 jurisdictions have worked to allow the required inspections two historically have not china and hong kong securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler said sensitive data the global times a newspaper close to the chinese communist party criticised the new us regulation in an opinion piece friday if the us sets unequal conditions on national security for competition between

investor base like no other in the world with 52 5 trillion in assets under management compared to 7 1 trillion in china according to a study last year by mckinsey and company a management consulting firm carter said this political pressure on chinese companies creates an odd situation in which the stars of the chinese tech world are plummeting on the stock market but not because of their earnings reports and these companies are still making profits and then those profits are still growing he said the revenue growth for the year is over 30 per cent not for every company but a bit collectively no matter where the stock is no matter where the stocks trade that s still the case he said

central bank financing of government returned to the fore of the policy debate during the covid 19 crisis as many countries faced additional budgetary pressures at a time when debt levels were already high several economists called for an expansion in quantitative easing programmes and injections of helicopter money explicitly for fiscal purposes blanchard pisany ferri 2020 gali 2020 lifting the taboo around central bank financing of governments at least temporarily yashiv 2020 but even the advocates of monetary finance still highlight the risks in particular fiscal dominance and its inflationary consequences the dangers of fiscal dominance or the coordination scheme where fiscal policy dominates monetary policy1 sargent and wallace 1981 have long been warned against by economists and policymakers and history provides no shortage of cautionary tales many hyperinflation episodes have been associated with central bank financing of government debt weimar germany 1922 23 hungary 1945 46 greece 1941 45 and latin america during the 1980s debt crisis to name a few however there has been limited empirical research on the determinants and impact of central bank financing of government deficits beyond the most extreme episodes of hyperinflation a large literature has studied the relationship between central bank independence and inflation cukierman 1992 alpanda and honig 2014 though the results are ambiguous baumann et al 2021 a few studies examine legal limitations on central bank lending to the public sector a sub component of de jure indices of central bank independence and find a negative association between the strictness of limits and inflation jacome et al 2012 garriga and rodriguez 2020 however these studies ignore a crucial link the relationship between legal limits and actual central bank lending to government in practice evidence from sub saharan africa in recent work hooley et al 2021 we look at what lessons can be drawn from sub saharan africa a region where government financing by central banks has been common even prior to the covid 19 crisis unsustainable financing of fiscal deficits financing by central banks has led to stark episodes of hyperinflation in countries such as angola the democratic republic of the congo and zimbabwe but it has also been a more generalised phenomenon in fact the incidence of central bank lending to government in sub saharan africa has been much higher than elsewhere figure 1 amounting to 2 of gdp on average during 2001 17 compared with less than 0 5 in other regions moreover the covid 19 crisis led some central banks to lend large amounts to their governments as financing constraints started to bite democratic republic of congo ghana mauritius imf 2020 figure 1 central bank financing is highest in sub saharan african countries sources imf international financial statistics imf world economic outlook and imf staff calculations the role of legal limits because of the prevalence of central bank lending to governments in sub saharan africa the question of whether or how much to restrict it has long been a feature of policy debates in the region many countries impose legal limits on central bank lending to government both direct and indirect specified in their central bank legislation the limits are typically applied to loans overdrafts and advances extended in any given year defined as a percentage of fiscal revenue 2 most limits allow for some limited budgetary financing from the central bank usually with the aim of providing a lender of last resort facility to cover intra year fluctuations in revenue in economies where alternative market financing options may be sparse and shocks relatively frequent any empirical analysis of central bank financing of government deficits in the region therefore needs to take account of these legislative constraints we augment the imf s central bank legislation database for our sample of sub saharan african central banks to include quantitative information on legal limits on central bank lending to government updated to 2017 this shows that many sub saharan african countries have introduced and in some cases tightened such limits over the past three decades figure 2 the limits are set somewhat higher in sub saharan african countries than in other regions but still permit only modest and temporary central bank lending to government figure 2 legal limits in sub saharan africa have become stricter over time sources imf central bank legislation database imf world economic outlook national authorities and imf staff calculations non binding but a speed limit but how effective are legal limits in a region where institutions are relatively weak interestingly while the data show that the legal limits were frequently breached the observed patterns of noncompliance suggest that they nevertheless have teeth the recourse to the central bank when deficits rose was indeed lower when legal limits were in place a result confirmed in econometric analysis the effect of legal limits is therefore analogous to a speed limit for car drivers the limit is often exceeded but rarely by a lot and drivers go more slowly than when there is a more stringent limit other factors affecting the propensity of governments to borrow from their central bank include the prevalence of outside financing options and an imf programme on average about 9 of a fiscal deficit is financed by the central bank but if the government can borrow from financial markets and issue bonds then only about 3 of the fiscal deficit is covered by central bank financing and if the government has an imf supported programme with a condition on domestic borrowing or borrowing from the central bank akin to a quasi legal limit then almost none of the deficit is covered by central bank financing macroeconomic impact but should we care about deficit financing particularly if it is small and does not pose hyperinflationary risks in short yes because central bank deficit financing matters for inflation empirical investigation of the impact of central bank lending on monetary aggregates the exchange rate and inflation finds a statistically significant contemporaneous impact on the exchange rate and a lagged impact on inflation an increase in central bank credit to the government by 1 percentage point of gdp or about 5 percentage points of revenue is associated with a decline in the exchange rate of 1 percentage point contemporaneously and an increase in inflation by half a percentage point a year later moreover the impact on inflation seems to be mostly through the exchange rate channel there does not seem to be evidence of credit growth the aggregate demand channel in summary our findings suggest that fiscal dominance is a relevant macroeconomic risk that policymakers should take seriously even if the impact of central bank deficit financing does not reach hyperinflation proportions it can still generate significant inflation pressure although a central bank may sometimes need to provide additional financing in exceptional circumstances for example during the covid 19 pandemic it should be on a temporary basis to avoid the risk of runaway inflation and keep expectations anchored authors note the views expressed herein are those of the authors and should not be attributed to

2020 breaking the taboo the political economy of covid motivated helicopter drops voxeu org 26 march endnotes 1 the concept of fiscal dominance used here is based on sargent and wallace 1981 fiscal policy dominates monetary policy when the fiscal authority independently sets its budgets deficits and determines the amount of revenue that must be raised through bond sales and seignorage and the monetary authority faces the constraints imposed by the government as it must try to finance with seignorage any discrepancy between the revenue demanded by the fiscal authority and the amount of bonds that can be sold to the public 2 separating any central bank s claims on government on its balance sheet into monetary and fiscal policy purposes is not straightforward in practice some claims are typically extended for monetary policy purposes for example central banks may hold treasury bills for liquidity management for example conducting open market operations or to influence monetary conditions at the zero lower bound for example quantitative easing though these programs can sometimes in theory at least have a fiscal purpose cukierman 2020 for our sample of sub saharan african countries for the pre covid 19 period central bank claims on government to accommodate fiscal needs were typically through loans overdraft facilities while direct government bond issuance to central banks for fiscal purposes or securitization of overdrafts has to our knowledge only occurred in a few african countries and on an exceptional basis we therefore assume that central bank holdings of government securities are mostly for monetary policy purposes while loans and advances to governments are for fiscal policy purposes although we include securities holdings in robustness checks

periods swinging between being bullish and bearish with the bears slightly more dominant as the market is currently down over 4 6 while the market has fallen by nearly 6 since the high in august it

protecting the border is essentially the same thing as protecting your own property right you ve got to protect it from invaders thieves lawless jerks who want what you have if you re rich and paranoid then you have no doubt that s what refugees are especially down there at the southern u s border or if you re the european union the northern edge of africa the eu s mexico is the failed state of libya which thanks to its former colonial conquerors can now make a little scratch stopping the desperate hordes of people fleeing poverty violence and the vicious effects of climate change from crossing the mediterranean and finding a more secure life in europe how do we move beyond a world that is shredded by invisible imaginary borders into endless enclaves of us and them how do we embrace planet earth as a single organic whole of which we are just a part how do we govern with a reverence for this whole what todd miller asks in his book build bridges not walls quoted at yes if we were to allow ourselves to imagine a world without borders what if we were to see borders not as shields but as shackles keeping the planet in an unsustainable status quo of inequality racial divide and climate catastrophe this is the question that needs to hover over our geopolitics over this planet that we think we control i don t mean to suggest for a minute that there s a simple answer here but rather the simple answer is the one that s currently in operation we find ourselves as we emerge into the current present moment from the turbulence and struggle of history under the control of institutions that demand that we live in fear of one another and the primary consequence of this fear this religion of us vs them is our ability to dehumanize the scapegoat them of the moment dehumanization gets easier and easier the more we engage in it the process is called war it s called economic exploitation and it s called border control ian urbina in a remarkable story in the new yorker a story that nearly cost him his life describes the migration hell currently going on in libya instigated and financed by the eu which eventually became overwhelmed by the flow of immigrants fleeing to europe from their homelands in the middle east and sub saharan africa it wound up partnering with the broken country of libya to control that flow in the process creating a shadow immigration system that stops them before they reach europe it has equipped and trained the libyan coast guard a quasi military organization linked to militias in the country to patrol the mediterranean sabotaging humanitarian rescue operations and capturing migrants the migrants are then detained indefinitely in a network of profit making prisons run by the militias in september of this year around six thousand migrants were being held international aid agencies have documented an array of abuses detainees tortured with electric shocks children raped by guards families extorted for ransom men and women sold into forced labor urbina quotes a libyan official who told him the eu did something they carefully considered and planned for many years create a hellhole in libya with the idea of deterring people from heading to europe the eu has poured half a billion dollars into the project urbina notes the goal of which according to the libyan official is clear make libya the bad guy make libya the disguise for their policies while the good humans of europe say they are offering money to help make this hellish system safer we have to acknowledge especially if we are one of the good humans living behind a safe border this is a shackled planet neither good intentions nor humanitarian outrage will by themselves change the politics of shackled dehumanization some further awareness is necessary before humanity will begin reorganizing itself an awareness that will no doubt be largely forced on us by the simmering matters that transcend our imaginary national borders you know climate change environmental collapse the current pandemic and others to come as the world health organization warned of a very high global risk posed by the omicron variant of covid 19 julia conley writes at common dreams representatives from the body s 194 member states gathered in geneva to forge a treaty aimed at preparing the world for the next pandemic with public health officials warning that the emergence of omicron should push governments to embrace global solidarity to avoid another disastrous public health crisis and as michael marder writes borders are porous by definition no matter how fortified they are more like living membranes than inorganic walls an individual or a state that effectively manages to cut itself off from the outside will be as good as dead so as we cut ourselves off from the impoverished and the desperate you might say we re blocking the human river part of the flow of life the trillions of dollars that are invested in this blockage in defense of something that doesn t actually exist arbitrary lines of demarcation that were largely drawn during the era of colonization when land was stolen and the planet was sliced into random entities called states or colonies could be reinvested sanely into building a better world for everyone at the very least we must begin talking collectively about what this would mean and what it

editor s note global economic recovery in 2021 faces many challenges not least because of the continuing covid 19 pandemic emergence of new variants of the novel coronavirus and vaccine inequity the pandemic is changing how we think about economies and societies so what will the global economic landscape be like next year four experts share their views on the issue with china daily uncertainty over the economic outlook has risen dramatically over the past few days has that prompted us at oxford economics to shift our baseline view of the world economy for now information on the health implications of the omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is scarce making the economic repercussions highly unpredictable at the time of writing about 30 economies have reported cases of omicron but the number of countries where it is present is likely to be substantially higher in south africa for instance it s estimated that omicron has accounted for about 70 percent of the total covid 19 cases over the past four weeks based on this it seems possible that omicron may take over from the delta variant as the dominant strain globally nonetheless the world health organization has cautioned that there is not yet sufficient evidence that omicron is more transmissible the other key uncertainty is the degree to which it reduces the efficacy of existing vaccines while some of those infected have reportedly been fully vaccinated it s too early to judge whether this is indicative of lower vaccine efficacy in addition even if vaccine efficacy is reduced it s unclear whether some vaccines will offer better protection than others the main repercussion that s clear at this stage is that governments have already reacted to the omicron news by re imposing restrictions particularly on foreign travel more generally the latest development underscores that the path to normalcy will continue to be bumpy and uncertain what is a plausible best case scenario in a best case scenario omicron could turn out to be a blessing in disguise if the efficacy of the vaccines against serious health outcomes remains high and the symptoms of those infected are generally less serious in such a scenario the spread of omicron could help to expedite the transition back toward normalcy and any near term weakness in economic activity due to renewed restrictions might be quickly caught up early next year the emergence of a less serious virus strain and the rapid deployment of modified vaccines moderna has already said that by early 2022 a reformulated vaccine to tackle omicron could be available in large quantities might reassure people and enterprises that although covid 19 is set to linger its economic impact will lessen over time and a plausible worst case scenario although far from inevitable we can t discount the possibility of omicron having greater transmissibility similar or worse symptoms to delta and greater resistance to vaccines so what might be the plausible economic consequences of a more worrisome variant in our current covid 19 downside scenario in which new novel coronavirus variants trigger a protracted period of restrictions and lengthen the disruption to global supply chains world gdp growth slows to 2 3 percent in 2022 and financial markets weaken in this scenario advanced economies are particularly hard hit with the gdp growth of the united states and eurozone in 2022 being about 2 percentage points below our current baseline forecasts of 4 5 percent and 4 2 percent respectively based on the current relationship with lockdown stringency a downward revision of that magnitude would be consistent with restrictions ratcheting up to levels similar to those seen globally from may to september this year this would lower calendar year global growth from the current 4 5 percent to 4 2 4 3 percent in the nearer term it is likely that governments will tighten measures that restrict international travel or make it more inconvenient and expensive which may help to push down oil prices and thus energy price inflation globally over the coming months that would support our view that global consumer price index inflation will ease sharply over the course of 2022 but greater restrictions particularly in china and other asia pacific economies that are likely to continue to pursue zero covid 19 policies may add to supply chain strains in the short term and slow the speed at which bottlenecks are cleared in addition tighter restrictions are also likely to result in a more gradual transition of spending from goods back to services these two factors combined would likely result in goods price inflation in 2022 remaining higher than our current baseline envisages the impact on core inflation will also depend on the extent to which an omicron wave affects demand while demand effects outweighed supply side effects during the global lockdown supply effects typically dominated demand effects in subsequent shutdowns on balance the latter episodes are likely to be more representative than the former when it comes to future inflation trends unless we end up in our worst case scenario in that case demand effects might dominate beyond 2022 though the impact on inflation is likely to be governed by two factors the first is the extent to which omicron enhances or diminishes labor bargaining power for now we see the risk of sustained high wage growth as limited and the second is the extent to which policymakers step in to protect demand if the omicron variant ends up having a significant impact on the economy then governments and central banks would likely focus their response on the demand impacts rather than the more ambiguous inflation impact ben may is director of global macro with oxford economics and

washington the biden administration has plenty of options to make good on its pledge to hit russia financially if president vladimir putin invades ukraine from sanctions targeting putin s associates to cutting russia off from the financial system that sends money flowing around the world the united states and european allies have made no public mention of any plans to respond militarily themselves if putin sends troops massed along the border into ukraine a former soviet republic with close historical and cultural ties to russia but now eager to ally with nato and the west instead payback could be all about the money secretary of state antony blinken this week promised financial pain high impact economic measures that we ve refrained from taking in the past president joe biden on friday said the us had developed the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very very difficult for mr putin the united states over the past decade already has put a range of sanctions in place against russian entities and individuals many of them over russia s invasion and annexation of crimea and its support for armed separatists in eastern ukraine in 2014 us sanctions also have sought to punish russia for election interference malicious cyberactivities and human rights abuses since 2014 the west also has helped ukraine build up its military so while putin denies any intention of launching an offensive his troops would face a ukrainian army much more capable of putting up a fight the sanctions now imposed on russians include asset freezes bans on doing business with us companies and denial of entry to the united states but in seeking to punish russia the west over the years has weighed even bigger financial penalties that includes the so called nuclear option blocking russia from the belgium based swift system of financial payments that moves money among thousands of banks around the world the european parliament this year approved a non binding resolution calling for that step if russia does invade ukraine when the us successfully pressured swift to disconnect iranian banks over iran s nuclear programme the country lost almost half of its oil export revenue and a third of its foreign trade said maria shagina an expert on sanctions and energy politics affiliated with the carnegie moscow center think tank the impact on russia s economy would be equally devastating shagina writes russia depends on its oil and natural gas exports for more than one third of its federal revenues and depends on swift to make the petrodollars flow russia has worked since 2014 to insulate its domestic financial systems from such a cutoff a swift cutoff would cause indirect pain for western economies as well john herbst a former us ambassador to ukraine and career diplomat said friday he believed that while swift is not off the table it would be a last resort the biden administration earlier this year further limited russia s ability to borrow money by banning us financial institutions from buying russian government bonds directly from state institutions but the sanctions didn t target the secondary market leaving this as a possible next step other possible tools and targets herbst noted financial sanctions targeting people close to putin and their families and more sanctions on russian banks and on russia s vital energy sector
prosper ndlovu in his foreword to the vision 2030 document published in september 2018 president mnangagwa pledged to work hard towards building a new zimbabwe a country with a thriving and open economy capable of creating opportunities for investors and employment my government will leave no stone unturned in transforming zimbabwe into a knowledge driven and industrialising upper middle income economy by 2030 he wrote as a new administration we were categorical from the onset that focus would be on putting in place policies and measures to regain investor confidence lost over the last two decades vision 2030 simply reflects the collective aspirations and determination of the people of zimbabwe towards a common prosperous destiny its objectives are clearly aligned with those of africa s agenda 2063 the 50 year continental dream which runs from 2013 to 2063 the national vision also takes into cognisance the united nations sustainable development goals covering the period 2016 2030 no doubt the realisation of this vision would be largely dependent on revitalising the productive sectors alongside a series of cross cutting reforms as spelt out in the actions and measures that have been undertaken through the short term transitional stabilisation programme tsp 2018 to 2020 and now under the national development strategy 1 a five year blue print spanning 2021 to 2025 while the tsp has been commended for restoring key fundamentals of the fiscal front and enhancing the general ease of doing business increased focus now has to be directed at capacitating the productive sector through securing strategic partnerships and luring solid foreign direct investments there is huge potential in revitalising the mining agriculture manufacturing construction innovation and technology sectors however over and above the need to embrace modern technology these industries are mainly constrained by inadequate capitalisation both from domestic financiers and offshore sources economists across the globe are agreed that capital markets could play an important role in mobilising the critical savings in an economy and channelling these into productive investments to create a thriving industry and commerce president mnangagwa reiterated this in his keynote address while officially opening the victoria falls stock exchange vfex last thursday where he also presided over the ceremony to mark the listing of global mining investor caledonia mining corporation plc a parent company to gwanda based top gold producer blanket mine the president implored local businesses to ride on capital markets to harness the critical funding to bolster their operations and thereby contribute to economic growth of the country let me take this opportunity to encourage unlisted corporates in the mining manufacturing agriculture tourism and other sectors of our economy to also consider listing president mnangagwa said if not here on the victoria falls stock exchange they can also list on the zimbabwe stock exchange zse and the financial securities exchange finsec i particularly want to encourage our micro small and medium enterprises to consider listing on these various stock exchanges in their large numbers as this is the surest way to raise long term capital for growth caledonia mining corporation is the third counter to list on the vfex which was established in october 2020 joining seed co international limited and padenga holdings it is also the first new listing in the zimbabwean capital markets since 2016 which strongly endorses the drive to transform victoria falls into an offshore financial hub as well as a hub for tourism and financial services under the special economic zones sezs initiative being the first initial public offering ipo to the stock exchange the listing of the vfex by caledonia is a milestone for the young bourse given that stock exchanges normally take up an average of six to 18 months to be well established said finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube an initial public offering ipo refers to the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance vision 2030 and the role of stock exchanges stock exchanges largely assist productive sectors to grow the economy through providing a platform for capital raising the viability of such platforms goes further to consolidate investor confidence and deepening of the country s financial markets in the case of vfex for instance the bourse is expected to help unlock mining sector potential which has suffered lack of financing over the years and yet it is a key economic player already the sector has set a target to achieve a us 12 billion industry by 2023 as set out in the mining industry strategy in 2019 mining employs more than 45 000 people and contributes at least 60 percent in export revenue annually which accounts for at least 12 percent of gross domestic product gdp according to official statistics vfex thus comes in handy in the context of the risky and capital intensive mining industry which requires suitable funding mechanisms capital markets also provide suitable funding for other keys sectors of the economy such as tourism manufacturing agriculture and other viable ventures the significance of a foreign currency denominated stock exchange has been necessitated by the fact that since de dollarisation of the economy in 2019 most companies could only raise capital on the zse in local currency which has been subjected to inflationary pressures companies have also been struggling to then convert these funds into forex for critical raw material and equipment imports among other expenses including repatriating their profits in the case of foreign investors this has resulted in the death of the ipo and listed companies raising money on the stock exchange while the reserve bank of zimbabwe s foreign currency auction system has helped ease the burden on forex access the pressure has mounted on the system and in some instances some players have manipulated the bidding process how vfex works and benefits it offers according to prof ncube the rbz administered government incentive scheme has played a key role in attracting the giant businesses like seed co caledonia and padenga to list on the vfex this is because under this platform investors have the leeway to move their capital and dividends in and out of the country freely at lower transactional costs tax incentives that include a five percent dividend withholding tax for foreign investors and exemption from capital gains withholding tax are also applicable since the platform is denominated in united states dollars there is minimal currency risk for investors companies listed on vfex also enjoy an increased export retention of up to 100 percent compared to about 40 percent for non listed entities a lot of benefits accrue to investors through this platform and these include the ability to raise hard currency for retooling and expansion there is also an advantage of secondary market liquidity for their securities which enhances primary capital raising and international branding at relatively lower listing fees trading on the vfex is done nationwide and the exchange operates on a fully automated system already there are 17 stockbrokers responsible for placing bids and offers on behalf of investors as well as five custodians responsible for the settlement of trades said the vfex offshore financial services centre the establishment of vfex was laid by the ministry of finance and economic development in the formation of the offshore financial services centre in victoria falls the operationalisation of vfex thus has kick started the victoria falls special economic zone in 2019 vfex at its formative stages was part of the team that was involved in the research and benchmarking exercise on how other jurisdictions operate their offshore financial service centres the concept is common on jurisdictions such as ireland the caribbean luxembourg singapore netherlands and hong kong in africa mauritius stands out as an offshore financial centre it is in this regard that the establishment of vfex is expected to complement the existing infrastructure in promoting both domestic and cross border investments this also has huge implications on the ease of doing business front given that the offshore financial centre promotes a one stop shop model government expects this to help create employment opportunities for local communities going forward zimbabwe is focused on developing new products with plans to establish a commodities exchange riding on the recent signing of the memorandum of understanding between vfex and the dubai gold and commodities exchange dgce the treasury has also hinted on listing government bonds to also raise money through vfex
trust and verify was the motto of the americans when negotiating nuclear arms cuts with the soviets during the cold war it may be a good policy for proponents of the new clean energy wonder cure green hydrogen writes sue arnold in the battle to save the planet while ensuring an adequate source of harm free energy we are destined to seemingly take one step forward and two steps back or at least sideways scott morrison s carbon mantra technology not taxes is incapable of providing the proper policy required governments appear to be rushing into green hydrogen without comprehensive understanding methodology and defined sources leaving aside the morrison government s pollyanna ish slogan there is leadership coming from the private sector the most prominent plutocrat to seize the green energy baton is andrew forrest forrest s fortescue future industry has disavowed the use of forest biomass but the mining baron may himself be wearing rose coloured glasses speaking on the future of green hydrogen energy at the national press club in mid october forrest told the audience australia can become a global green future manufacturing centre and energy superpower if we follow what the state government is doing in nsw with the federal policy settings only yesterday new south wales introduced the most far reaching green hydrogen strategy in australia with a 3 billion investment to kickstart a globally competitive local green hydrogen industry whether it is as forrest put it the most far reaching strategy remains to be seen in october premier dominic perrottet and treasurer environment minister matt kean announced their 3 billion world leading green hydrogen strategy this announcement was soon followed by the government s development of hydrogen hub guidelines which proclaimed that hydrogen projects will not be eligible for government funding if any input is derived using biomass from native forests forests play a key role in the carbon cycle as they store huge quantities of organic carbon more carbon than the atmosphere the carbon storage of land is improved through afforestation or decreased by deforestation as a joint minister for forests together with deputy premier paul toole kean has strenuously resisted ending industrial logging of native forests a key measure in combating carbon emissions while this guideline is welcome it s not a regulation nor does it bind or prevent private companies or international corporations from funding and utilising this resource with no similar ban on green hydrogen funding for plantations or private forestry significant gaps in the guidelines raise concerns using native vegetation as biomass is also an issue the current definition of forest residues is sufficiently broad to include thinning cutting stands for timber as well as stands damaged by insects and diseases exactly what constitutes stands is unclear in november federal energy minister angus taylor s australian renewable energy agency arena released australia s bioenergy roadmap developed by enea consulting and deloitte under bioenergy resources the following statement is made the forestry sector accounts for 22 per cent of total resource potential largely composed of plantation forests most of which are certified sustainable forestry residues and wood processing wastes given the low community support for harvesting native forests this resource is not a feasible component of the growth of australia s bioenergy industry what isn t clear is whether this statement supports the use of plantation forests in lieu of native forests neither the nsw or federal governments mention biodiversity and the impacts which would flow from using plantation forests or native vegetation as feedstock and in december the nsw land and environment court will hear a case destined to decide the fate of operators looking to use forest biomass as feedstock to burn as green hydrogen energy in nsw verdant earth technologies the owner of the redbank power station near singleton is challenging singleton council s deemed refusal to allow biomass to be utilised as an additional fuel source for the power plant verdant s proposed biomass source is detailed in a planning report application submitted to the land and environment court in august the report indicates pulp wood logs and heads and off cuts from clearing carried out in accordance with a private native forestry property vegetation plan or forestry operations carried out in accordance with an integrated forestry operations approval under part 5b of part a of the forestry act 2012 trees cleared as a result of thinning carried out in accordance with a private native forestry property vegetation plan or an integrated forestry operations approval a foundation of green hydrogen is carbon parity forest biomass proponents claim carbon emissions created by burning the feedstock are balanced by forest regrowth verdant s ceo richard poole gave this explanation in a renew economy article so what people are scared about is is this actually net zero emissions and 100 per cent it s net zero emissions poole says the science is on the side that this is net zero emissions the easiest way to explain it is for example if we have a sustainable forestry in new south wales which we do it s all sustainable and the forest grows from 1 000 000 tonnes to 1 050 000 tonnes and we take 50 000 tonnes out of that forest this year well the new growth a grows faster and absorbs more carbon dioxide and b we use that 50 000 tonnes and we generate electricity with it and by next year that 50 000 tonnes has replaced itself he says it s unlikely that any forest activists would agree with this explanation who bears responsibility for the new growth remains a critical question how many tree seedlings would be sufficient what level of growth would be required are key issues at federal government level carbon stock calculations are samples from trees are collected in different parts of the forest and the data is used to estimate the amount of carbon stored in all the eligible areas of the forest the net amount of abatement during a project s reporting period is determined by subtracting any actual emissions due to fires and fuel use from the theoretical emissions that could have been caused if clearing had occurred neither government reports recommend legislation or regulations banning biomass from plantation and private forests internationally green hydrogen has been defined by green tech media as if the electricity comes from renewable sources such as wind solar or hydro then the hydrogen is effectively green the only carbon emissions are from those embodied in the generation infrastructure storing and transporting the highly flammable gas is not easy it takes up a lot of space and has a habit of making steel pipes and welds brittle and prone to failure because of this the bulk transport of hydrogen will require dedicated pipelines which would be costly to build pressurizing the gas or cooling it to a liquid those last two processes are energy intensive forrest ended his speech at the national press club with a thinly disguised rebuke for today s politicians i ve heard your rallying cries of deception that australia has sold out its economic and energy sovereignty but it s you the laggard politician standing on the hose stopping us from getting our own economic and energy sovereignty back with our own green hydrogen there are none so blind as those who will not see

nearly three weeks since the united auto workers uaw sabotaged the five week john deere strike by 10 000 workers in the united states many deere workers remain dissatisfied describing ongoing issues with pay and unsafe working conditions as covid cases surge across the united states along with the new omicron variant which initial studies indicate may be more infectious and resistant to immunity deere and the uaw are taking no serious measures to stop the spread of the virus in the plants covid they could care less about a deere worker in waterloo iowa told the world socialist web site i ve been sick with no voice and coughing my supervisor knows it but will give me points if i m not at work testing takes days to complete and if it comes back negative you get points for your time missed he added a woman at work tested positive for it she was supposed to be out for 10 days they called her back and had her come back in at day seven they made all people who weren t vaccinated go home and get tested but then they had someone unvaccinated go over to do her job as long as they get their numbers they don t care asked about the overall conditions workers have confronted upon returning he said it sucks we still haven t received a contract book no word from the union on what they are doing for our cipp or when they re sending chassis through without parts they have tanked our cipp plans and the only thing the union says is we just have to work through it there s no help from the union at all deere s continuous improvement pay plan cipp is an incentive payment scheme that pays workers an extra amount if teams meet or exceed company defined production goals cipp is used by deere to force workers to work fast deliver more machines and parts and in the end make more money for deere if we have to follow the contract why doesn t the company he asked so this 120 percent they have us on doesn t mean anything when they just tank our cipp making us lose base pay which in turn takes away the little raise they gave us our ratification bonus didn t get put into our 401 k s so the company didn t have to match our 401 k contribution it s a complete mess with no help from the union another worker said the current cost of living adjustments cola included as part of the new contract are far below the current inflation rate of 6 2 percent we re getting a paltry 1 18 percent for cola which honestly is a slap in the face he said large amounts were taken out of workers 8 500 signing bonus we got screwed on the ratification bonus due to taxes and the union took hundreds of dollars in special union dues they re also not letting us do overtime presumably as punishment for striking leading up to the final contract vote on november 17 which the uaw called deere s last best and final offer the union carried out a campaign of lies and intimidation to secure ratification the contract which the uaw said was ratified by a 61 39 percent margin was virtually identical to the second uaw deere tentative agreement that workers had voted to reject just two weeks before addressing the cynicism of the union s attempt to portray the new contract as a great gift to deere workers a deere worker from east moline illinois said we are barely running we haven t even completed one machine yet we have already had days off for part issues we have had line speedups jobs eliminated and forced job changes the same issues before seem worse now in my opinion while the uaw claimed that there was no more money on the table and the company had to remain competitive deere s fourth quarter financial report showed just how flush with cash they were deere s profits more than doubled from 2020 reaching a record of nearly 6 billion and the company is projecting it will exceed its record by an even greater amount next year meanwhile deere reported that it spent over 3 5 billion in dividends and stock repurchases again double the amount in 2020 giving more money to their super wealthy investors and giant financial institutions an opinion piece published in bloomberg news on november 24 deere proves it can afford to give its workers a raise offered an unusual admission of this reality from the financial press while stopping short of explicitly stating that deere and the uaw were lying when they claimed the company could not pay more it s a good thing for deere co that the company was able to come to an agreement with its striking workforce before the agricultural equipment giant reported its latest earnings the author brooke sutherland wrote the update leaves no doubt that the company can afford to pay its employees a lot more adding that workers thought they had room to push for more it turns out they were right expressing the concerns among the wall street investors who comprise bloomberg s primary constituency sutherland pointed to the deep seated grievances which will fester among workers writing that the feeling of being shortchanged isn t one that s easily forgotten the experience of the john deere strike provides further confirmation that the uaw and the unions as a whole function as instruments of corporate management at every turn throughout the strike the uaw worked to undermine it while the strike is over the broader fight to improve workers living standards and secure safe and decent working conditions is not it is necessary to continue build the john deere workers rank and file committee and begin preparations for the struggles that lie ahead deere workers join the deere workers rank and file committee to carry forward the

stop me if this sounds familiar it s been kind of a hard year but i felt optimistic about the holidays my wife and i had just scheduled our covid 19 boosters even better we d been able to get our young child vaccinated we imagined a cautious return to simple family pleasures like indoor dining and maybe playdates at indoor play centers during the long midwestern winter maybe we d even test our kid s appetite for air travel and visit relatives in different parts of the country then another covid 19 variant possible breakthrough infections travel bans and tumbling stock markets and that familiar feeling of the rug being pulled out we don t know a whole lot about the omicron variant yet will it fizzle out like earlier variants or run rampant like delta whatever happens we do know one thing the longer it takes the world to get vaccinated the more variants we ll see here in the united states getting vaccination rates up means battling misinformation apathy and employers who won t give their employees sick time but vaccinating the rest of the world means battling corporate greed in poorer countries vaccine access is limited by the patent protections for pharmaceutical giants like pfizer modern and johnson johnson that puts life saving vaccines beyond the reach of what many countries can comfortably afford omicron was first reported in south africa as my institute for policy studies colleagues pointed out in their invaluable inequality org newsletter south africa had pleaded with western governments earlier this year to waive vaccine patents instead south africa ended up having to pay over double the price for doses that european union nations paid thanks to price gouging like that they note moderna alone has minted five new billionaires meanwhile south africa s vaccination rate hovers at less than 30 percent with rates that low new variants are inevitable but south africa is comparatively lucky less than 10 percent of people on the african continent are fully vaccinated according to the people s vaccine alliance rich countries have received about 50 times as many vaccine doses as poor countries that means the virus has free rein to multiply over vast swathes of the planet every new infection increases the possibility of new variants including some that may prove resistant to the existing vaccines to close those gaps poorer countries need more vaccines and fast the biden administration courageously defied big pharma by backing a waiver for vaccine patents but countries like germany continue to resist it and advocates insist the us isn t doing enough to fight for it another solution involves simply sending doses overseas the administration announced in august it had already exported 110 million doses and it recently promised another 500 million that s good but public health advocates are calling for far more vaccine equity could save millions of lives and prevent needless suffering that s reason enough on its own but by protecting workers across the globe it would also ease the global supply disruptions that are contributing to inflation here and abroad and it would go a long way toward ensuring that the existing vaccines remain effective excerpted why is this pandemic taking so long in one word greed courtesy commondreams org

editor s note global economic recovery in 2021 faces many challenges not least because of the continuing covid 19 pandemic emergence of new variants of the novel coronavirus and vaccine inequity the pandemic is changing how we think about economies and societies so what will the global economic landscape be like next year four experts share their views on the issue with china daily uncertainty over the economic outlook has risen dramatically over the past few days has that prompted us at oxford economics to shift our baseline view of the world economy for now information on the health implications of the omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is scarce making the economic repercussions highly unpredictable at the time of writing about 30 economies have reported cases of omicron but the number of countries where it is present is likely to be substantially higher in south africa for instance it s estimated that omicron has accounted for about 70 percent of the total covid 19 cases over the past four weeks based on this it seems possible that omicron may take over from the delta variant as the dominant strain globally nonetheless the world health organization has cautioned that there is not yet sufficient evidence that omicron is more transmissible the other key uncertainty is the degree to which it reduces the efficacy of existing vaccines while some of those infected have reportedly been fully vaccinated it s too early to judge whether this is indicative of lower vaccine efficacy in addition even if vaccine efficacy is reduced it s unclear whether some vaccines will offer better protection than others the main repercussion that s clear at this stage is that governments have already reacted to the omicron news by re imposing restrictions particularly on foreign travel more generally the latest development underscores that the path to normalcy will continue to be bumpy and uncertain what is a plausible best case scenario in a best case scenario omicron could turn out to be a blessing in disguise if the efficacy of the vaccines against serious health outcomes remains high and the symptoms of those infected are generally less serious in such a scenario the spread of omicron could help to expedite the transition back toward normalcy and any near term weakness in economic activity due to renewed restrictions might be quickly caught up early next year the emergence of a less serious virus strain and the rapid deployment of modified vaccines moderna has already said that by early 2022 a reformulated vaccine to tackle omicron could be available in large quantities might reassure people and enterprises that although covid 19 is set to linger its economic impact will lessen over time and a plausible worst case scenario although far from inevitable we can t discount the possibility of omicron having greater transmissibility similar or worse symptoms to delta and greater resistance to vaccines so what might be the plausible economic consequences of a more worrisome variant in our current covid 19 downside scenario in which new novel coronavirus variants trigger a protracted period of restrictions and lengthen the disruption to global supply chains world gdp growth slows to 2 3 percent in 2022 and financial markets weaken in this scenario advanced economies are particularly hard hit with the gdp growth of the united states and eurozone in 2022 being about 2 percentage points below our current baseline forecasts of 4 5 percent and 4 2 percent respectively based on the current relationship with lockdown stringency a downward revision of that magnitude would be consistent with restrictions ratcheting up to levels similar to those seen globally from may to september this year this would lower calendar year global growth from the current 4 5 percent to 4 2 4 3 percent in the nearer term it is likely that governments will tighten measures that restrict international travel or make it more inconvenient and expensive which may help to push down oil prices and thus energy price inflation globally over the coming months that would support our view that global consumer price index inflation will ease sharply over the course of 2022 but greater restrictions particularly in china and other asia pacific economies that are likely to continue to pursue zero covid 19 policies may add to supply chain strains in the short term and slow the speed at which bottlenecks are cleared in addition tighter restrictions are also likely to result in a more gradual transition of spending from goods back to services these two factors combined would likely result in goods price inflation in 2022 remaining higher than our current baseline envisages the impact on core inflation will also depend on the extent to which an omicron wave affects demand while demand effects outweighed supply side effects during the global lockdown supply effects typically dominated demand effects in subsequent shutdowns on balance the latter episodes are likely to be more representative than the former when it comes to future inflation trends unless we end up in our worst case scenario in that case demand effects might dominate beyond 2022 though the impact on inflation is likely to be governed by two factors the first is the extent to which omicron enhances or diminishes labor bargaining power for now we see the risk of sustained high wage growth as limited and the second is the extent to which policymakers step in to protect demand if the omicron variant ends up having a significant impact on the economy then governments and central banks would likely focus their response on the demand impacts rather than the more ambiguous inflation impact ben may is director of global macro with oxford economics and

according to a press release on friday by the world health organization who the omicron variant b 1 1 529 first detected in south africa in early november has now been found in 38 countries across all six who regions dr soumya swaminathan who s chief scientist explained that though it is possible that it could become the dominant variant delta still accounts for 99 percent of all infections worldwide cases globally continue to surge with more than 266 million cumulative reported cases and over 5 27 million deaths delta continues to take its toll on the populations of north america and europe the daily average number of cases has continued its steady climb for nearly two months reaching more than 600 000 cases per day worldwide deaths have held constant at a horrific rate of around 7 000 per day medics wearing special suits to protect against coronavirus treat patients with coronavirus at an icu of a hospital in volgograd russia sunday nov 21 2021 ap photo alexandr kulikov in the united states cumulative cases will top 50 million this week deaths are approaching 810 000 according to the worldometer covid dashboard meanwhile the number of daily covid cases is fast approaching 150 000 once more the seven day average of cases is over 106 000 and the rate of daily deaths has turned upwards nearing 1 200 on a daily average in europe more than 88 million covid cases and 1 56 million deaths have been reported weekly cases have been rising for more than nine straight weeks with close to 400 000 cases on a daily average though there are indications that deaths have plateaued they remain disastrously high at around 30 000 per week or more than 4 200 per day in east asia countries that had been able to control the coronavirus up to now face their most dire period in the pandemic south korea had a single day high of 5 352 cases and 70 deaths on december 4 infections are growing exponentially there and deaths are rapidly rising further south vietnam and thailand continue to battle recent surges despite these developments the world is focused on the current concerns raised by the highly mutated and transmissible omicron variant as bad as delta has been the incredibly rapid rates of infections caused by omicron in south africa have gripped public attention according to the initial contact with this variant it has far outpaced any of its previous predecessors according to angelique coetzee the south african medical association chair the effective reproduction number r for omicron has been estimated to be above six speaking with the bbc she said we know currently that the virus is transmissible according to the scientists the r value is 6 3 i think the value for delta was just over five since scientists there first detected the omicron on november 9 when the daily average was just 266 cases infection rates in south africa have risen 32 fold at 8 861 new cases per day cases are doubling every three days accompanying this trend has been a concerning rise in hospitalizations of children under the age of five underscoring the issue that children are not only able to become infected but they can become very ill during a press conference dr waasila jassat public health medicine specialist who works at south africa s national institute for communicable diseases said all these young children being admitted most of them the parents have not been vaccinated either so i think certainly the value of vaccination in the adults protecting the children in the homes is something to keep in mind infants under the age of two account for about ten percent of hospital admissions in tshwane the epicenter of the omicron outbreak in south africa the incidence of admissions for children under five is second only to those over the age of 60 dr jassat explained that more than 100 children under the age of five were admitted in the first two weeks of the fourth wave in the first two weeks of the country s third wave less than 20 children had been hospitalized rather than taking the appropriate public health measures to stem this massive tide of infections president cyril ramaphosa of south africa is pressing for a vaccine mandate only a quarter of the country s population is fully vaccinated meanwhile health minister joe phaala has attempted to control the messaging on these developments by assuring the public that even though omicron is more transmissible it is less severe gisaid which is tracking sars cov 2 variants globally noted that 35 countries have thus far submitted sequences confirming the presence of the omicron variant south africa has submitted 228 sequences accounting for almost 80 percent of all submissions the united kingdom has submitted 84 ghana 33 the us 27 and botswana 23 in the us the centers for disease control and prevention cdc said that 15 states had detected the omicron variant cdc director dr rochelle walensky speaking on abc news on sunday said we know we have several dozen cases and we re following them closely and we are hearing about more and more probable cases every day so that number is likely to rise and this statement comes on the heels of ever rising cases of infections caused by the delta variant walensky s insistence that sars cov 2 will become endemic in the us must be seen by the working class as an abdication of her responsibility to protect the population it is a political statement that assures the ruling class that the policy of the cdc is aligned with that of the financial oligarchs omicron will be treated no differently than delta or any future variants in europe the netherlands germany portugal switzerland belgium spain france italy norway denmark sweden luxembourg ireland and the czech republic have reported cases the european cdc s december 2 2021 threat assessment brief noted that more than 70 cases had been confirmed by 13 european union and european economic area countries by the time of their report these are by now a vast undercounting as several superspreader events have already been confirmed according to a norwegian public health official at a recent christmas party in norway where 120 people had joined in the festivities more than half have been infected by omicron dr preben aavitsland said this party has been a superspreader event our working hypothesis is that at least half of the 120 participants were infected with the omicron variant during the party this makes this for now the largest omicron outbreak outside south africa the european cdc made the following prediction in their brief preliminary data from south africa suggests that it may have a substantial growth advantage over the delta variant of concern voc if this is the case mathematical modeling indicates that the omicron voc is expected to cause over half of all sars cov 2 infections in the eu eea within the next few months they added the presence of multiple mutations in the spike protein of the omicron voc indicates a high likelihood of reduction of neutralizing activity of antibodies induced by infection or vaccination preliminary data suggest that the omicron voc may be associated with increased risk of reinfection in south africa the statement is based on a recent study out of south africa that showed a very high rate of reinfection implying that omicron can evade immunity from previous infections and vaccinations what is less clear is if infection with omicron will produce less the same or more severity than delta the technical lead at the who dr maria van kerkhove noted that it was still too early to make sense of the severity caused by omicron generally children and young adults will have mild symptoms and inferences in populations that have been vaccinated or previously infected with other variants will muddy attempts to concretize these questions in the initial period she said there were initial reports that it tended to be more mild but it s really too soon dr mike ryan executive director of the who s health emergencies program echoed his colleague s caution it takes time unfortunately we saw that as well in previous waves of this pandemic when the incidence rate goes up it takes a week or two for that to result in hospital admissions and deaths in north america besides the us mexico and canada have also reported the new variant cases have also been found throughout southeast asia japan brazil and australia by all accounts many countries that lack comprehensive sequencing capacity are more than likely harboring omicron it is more than sure that this new variant has been deeply seeded in communities throughout the globe indeed despite the concerns raised by omicron country after country continues to take a cavalier attitude to these developments a situation that could evolve into a two strain pandemic with delta and omicron acting side by side rather than one displacing the other as noted by numerous principled scientists the reliance on a vaccine only strategy is shortsighted and irrational it amounts to calling for the population to get vaccinated and hoping for the best the logic remains that the stock markets must remain unfettered by the risks posed by these deadly variants to the planet s population
curbing soil degradation is critical to the food security and ecological sustainability of the caribbean yet unsustainable land management practices coupled with the pressures of climate change continue to impact soil health and threaten to rob the region of its prospects for a food secure future according to a 2018 report from the united nations convention to combat desertification unccd 30 of degraded land in small island developing states sids worldwide and more than 14 of the two billion hectares of degraded land in the world can be found in the caribbean region the primary cause of soil degradation in the arid semi arid sub humid and dry regions of the latin america and caribbean region is desertification the process by which fertile land becomes desert typically due to drought deforestation or inappropriate agriculture which affects 35 of the caribbean region s surface area inter american institute for cooperation on agriculture iica 2020 soil is quite literally at the root of food production and according to the food and agriculture organization fao soil degradation is one of the primary causes of declining agricultural productivity the impact of human actions and climate change on soil health has direct implications on arable land yields and productivity of agricultural soils this picture taken in 2004 shows an undernourished cow in camaguey province in cuba the severe drought affecting the east part of the island caused great losses in agriculture ranching and other economic activities afp via getty images the caribbean is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures sea level rise droughts storms and flooding all play a role in the deterioration of soil quality particularly that of the 20 centimeters of topsoil that is critical for carbon sequestration the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide climate change impacts such as hurricanes and droughts exacerbate land degradation and pose a major challenge to the sustained health of caribbean soils and consequently food security excessive rainfall and wind experienced during a hurricane strip natural vegetation cause erosion and flooding and trigger landslides washing precious layers of topsoil out to sea for the 30 year period 1991 2020 there was a 44 increase in named storms a 20 increase in hurricanes and a 60 increase in major hurricanes compared to the prior 30 years this increase in extreme weather has been attributed to climate change in the case of hurricane maria in 2017 dominica experienced almost 25 kilo hectares of hurricane related tree cover loss 63 of which was humid primary forest resulting in about 14 metric tonnes of co‚ÇÇ being emitted into the atmosphere the agriculture sector was devastated due to soil damage and a complete loss of crops as well as substantial destruction to productive trees and the death of livestock global forest watch in the region droughts have also impacted soil health reducing its ability to sequester carbon impacting agricultural yields and resulting in reduced nutritional content in crops in 2014 jamaica s worst drought in three decades devastated farming communities and led to a 30 drop in agricultural production at the turn of the century droughts experienced in guyana resulted in a 37 drop in rice production and in haiti between 2015 and 2017 the food security of about 1 million people was aggravated by prolonged drought conditions as the caribbean undergoes rapid development these climate change impacts have been compounded by unsustainable human activities regionally unsustainable agricultural practices which include tilling deep root removal slash and burn and indiscriminate use of harmful chemicals have contributed to the degradation and depletion of 75 of natural carbon stocks and biodiversity from the region s agricultural soils iica 2020 forty nine percent of the land in the region is exposed to water erosion and 56 is affected by chemical degradation salinity or acidity of soils due to inappropriate agricultural practices in the case of grenada for example the overuse of agricultural chemicals such as herbicides pesticides and mineral fertilizers in cropland areas has resulted in acidification across more than 860 hectares of land grenada land degradation neutrality report 2015 uncontrolled development and urbanization have contributed almost ironically to the depletion of soil and reduced food and water security poor road construction poorly planned settlements in landslide prone areas and the development of large residential and tourism related structures have not only affected the quality of soil and the availability of arable land but have also impacted the quality of the region s water resources in barbados for example between 2001 and 2020 the country lost 397 hectares or a 7 6 decrease in tree cover the equivalent of 148 kilo tonnes of co‚ÇÇ emissions not surprisingly a quarter of this tree cover loss was experienced in the parishes of st james and st peter situated on what is known as the platinum coast of the island where most of the tourism activity occurs global forest watch 2021 elsewhere in the region mining has been another development related cause of deforestation and desertification in haiti alone 97 of all forests have been cleared for wood or charcoal and 4 200 hectares of soil have been eroded each year due to accelerated runoff leading to the loss of fertile topsoil and biodiversity loss haiti s unsustainable land management practices have resulted in the irreversible erosion of at least 6 of its land with less than 20 of the land under cultivation considered to be appropriate for agriculture global environment facility 2018 a denuded landscape in haiti which was engulfed by floods during hurricane ike this shows the erosion and damage to the landscape and the interplay between deforestation due to mining and climate change related extreme weather corbis via getty images similarly in jamaica intensive mining of bauxite the country s major mineral source has resulted in soil erosion in affected areas according to a study conducted by the jamaica environment trust 2020 bauxitic soils retain considerable amounts of water allowing the growth of large trees and forests but when soils are removed for mining soil fertility is lost with impacts appearing to be irreversible and not restorable by reclamation the majority of rehabilitated mined out ore pits have not met the standard of

early in the 1996 race for the white house the senior leadership of bob dole s presidential campaign noticed something that troubled us it seemed no matter how carefully we crafted his talking points senator dole would go off script often way off script so we considered the possibilities maybe at 72 years of age mr dole s eyesight was the problem but when increasingly larger type didn t have the desired effect we decided somebody had to go to the senate majority leader and raise the delicate question of whether he could see the words on the papers we handed to him that somebody was me as his press secretary i had the unenviable task to ask a man who was first elected to congress in 1960 the year i was born if his eyes were giving out mr dole pondered my question for a moment and replied no i can see just fine i can t hear worth a damn but my eyes are fine
editor s note global economic recovery in 2021 faces many challenges not least because of the continuing covid 19 pandemic emergence of new variants of the novel coronavirus and vaccine inequity the pandemic is changing how we think about economies and societies so what will the global economic landscape be like next year four experts share their views on the issue with china daily uncertainty over the economic outlook has risen dramatically over the past few days has that prompted us at oxford economics to shift our baseline view of the world economy for now information on the health implications of the omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is scarce making the economic repercussions highly unpredictable at the time of writing about 30 economies have reported cases of omicron but the number of countries where it is present is likely to be substantially higher in south africa for instance it s estimated that omicron has accounted for about 70 percent of the total covid 19 cases over the past four weeks based on this it seems possible that omicron may take over from the delta variant as the dominant strain globally nonetheless the world health organization has cautioned that there is not yet sufficient evidence that omicron is more transmissible the other key uncertainty is the degree to which it reduces the efficacy of existing vaccines while some of those infected have reportedly been fully vaccinated it s too early to judge whether this is indicative of lower vaccine efficacy in addition even if vaccine efficacy is reduced it s unclear whether some vaccines will offer better protection than others the main repercussion that s clear at this stage is that governments have already reacted to the omicron news by re imposing restrictions particularly on foreign travel more generally the latest development underscores that the path to normalcy will continue to be bumpy and uncertain what is a plausible best case scenario in a best case scenario omicron could turn out to be a blessing in disguise if the efficacy of the vaccines against serious health outcomes remains high and the symptoms of those infected are generally less serious in such a scenario the spread of omicron could help to expedite the transition back toward normalcy and any near term weakness in economic activity due to renewed restrictions might be quickly caught up early next year the emergence of a less serious virus strain and the rapid deployment of modified vaccines moderna has already said that by early 2022 a reformulated vaccine to tackle omicron could be available in large quantities might reassure people and enterprises that although covid 19 is set to linger its economic impact will lessen over time and a plausible worst case scenario although far from inevitable we can t discount the possibility of omicron having greater transmissibility similar or worse symptoms to delta and greater resistance to vaccines so what might be the plausible economic consequences of a more worrisome variant in our current covid 19 downside scenario in which new novel coronavirus variants trigger a protracted period of restrictions and lengthen the disruption to global supply chains world gdp growth slows to 2 3 percent in 2022 and financial markets weaken in this scenario advanced economies are particularly hard hit with the gdp growth of the united states and eurozone in 2022 being about 2 percentage points below our current baseline forecasts of 4 5 percent and 4 2 percent respectively based on the current relationship with lockdown stringency a downward revision of that magnitude would be consistent with restrictions ratcheting up to levels similar to those seen globally from may to september this year this would lower calendar year global growth from the current 4 5 percent to 4 2 4 3 percent in the nearer term it is likely that governments will tighten measures that restrict international travel or make it more inconvenient and expensive which may help to push down oil prices and thus energy price inflation globally over the coming months that would support our view that global consumer price index inflation will ease sharply over the course of 2022 but greater restrictions particularly in china and other asia pacific economies that are likely to continue to pursue zero covid 19 policies may add to supply chain strains in the short term and slow the speed at which bottlenecks are cleared in addition tighter restrictions are also likely to result in a more gradual transition of spending from goods back to services these two factors combined would likely result in goods price inflation in 2022 remaining higher than our current baseline envisages the impact on core inflation will also depend on the extent to which an omicron wave affects demand while demand effects outweighed supply side effects during the global lockdown supply effects typically dominated demand effects in subsequent shutdowns on balance the latter episodes are likely to be more representative than the former when it comes to future inflation trends unless we end up in our worst case scenario in that case demand effects might dominate beyond 2022 though the impact on inflation is likely to be governed by two factors the first is the extent to which omicron enhances or diminishes labor bargaining power for now we see the risk of sustained high wage growth as limited and the second is the extent to which policymakers step in to protect demand if the omicron variant ends up having a significant impact on the economy then governments and central banks would likely focus their response on the demand impacts rather than the more ambiguous inflation impact ben may is director of global macro with oxford economics and

seth meyer was appointed usda s chief economist in january of 2020 returning to usda after two years prior to his return seth was a research professor and the associate director for the food and agricultural policy research institute fapri at the university of missouri meyer grew up in eastern iowa and has a bachelor s and master s degree from iowa state university and a ph d in agricultural economics from the university of missouri ift the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about crop demand is exports and trade with the expiration of the phase 1 trade deal coming up do you feel things are going to change in our export market meyer perhaps i tell this story too much but you have to think back to where the sentiment was in august 2020 when prices were starting to rise before that point despite the fact we had that trade deal the sentiment was pretty negative from producers but then the chinese eventually came into the market with really robust export demand and really robust domestic demand prices really started to run that s something that really offered us that price boost to finish up the tail end of the 2020 harvest when one looks at the chinese performance relative to the phase 1 agreement it s a pretty good response i think from a usda standpoint we think the chinese will continue to come into our market we just finished a record 12 months for u s agricultural exports and a lot of that is the fact that china came back into our market during trade friction they got as low as our fifth largest trading partner but they came roaring back to be our no 1 trading partner by a lot in the latest expectations by our foreign ag services we ll hold onto a lot of that trade and as a result of that prices will be really solid ift a concern for a lot of farmers is possible difficulties with supply and prices for inputs this year is that going to have a significant impact on the way the usda views next year s crop meyer talking purely about the market intelligence aspect of this clearly when we think about what acreage is going to be you ll run through some thought of where input prices are and where returns are on corn relative to soybeans we did our first look at our baseline process in october and had 92 million acres of corn and 87 million acres of beans corn is still holding a lot of its area when you look at returns even with higher fertilizer prices for a more nitrogen intensive crop like corn it s still keeping a lot of those corn acres in now fertilizer is continuing to rise but so has many of the lines in a producer s budget so we ll clearly consider and evaluate that as we go on we ve seen harvest price futures strongly favor corn and they need to do so to keep those acres in because of those more intense fertilizer price increases ift how much do these things impact what the usda sees in forecasts meyer early on all you have is weather and economics what do things look like planting and what are the comparative economics for this eventually nass will go out and survey and farmers will respond with what they actually planted weather always has final say in terms of how much corn and beans we actually get in ift many producers in our area had better than expected yields on corn and soybeans how are we looking as far as supply goes after this year and do we see our stocks coming back to a number we are happy with meyer i think part of the reason we saw such good prices prior to this harvest is because we were running a bit tight both domestically and globally we ended up a little tighter than we thought we might be it s interesting because what led the charge higher on prices in october of 2020 was corn and beans and they dragged wheat along with them at some point we saw a shift where wheat has grown legs of its own and produced its own strength if you go north and west of des moines there was some extreme drought but if you go east of des moines into illinois and indiana there were record yields that is part of what got us some moderation in prices they are still good prices ift looking ahead we are still dealing with good prices especially compared to a few years ago but now we are seeing so many rising costs do we expect these higher prices to stick around for a little while meyer the price we forecast is the price received by farmers so it tends to lag increases of the spot market because farmers will have already marketed some of the grain the same works in the opposite way if prices fall through the floor the prices received by farmers tend to follow that more slowly i noted that the last time i checked prices at eddyville iowa you could still get more than five bucks for corn for the crop you harvest in 2020 when i look at our own projections we are looking at 4 80 corn and 11 beans when we did this in october that would probably still favor corn a little bit in a crop budget i think it s reasonable to expect under normal conditions a response both here and around the world maybe not a fall in demand but some cooling relative to the jump we had and not holding onto that there s an opportunity for softening prices but not for the floor to collapse underneath them

spoilers ahead for succession episode 8 chiantishire the roys are in tuscany for caroline s wedding to a seat sniffing bankrupt the sun s out the libations are flowing and everyone is looking chic in linen outfits but the idyllic setting only gives way to dramatic developments because anywhere the roys go betrayal and pain and not yet accepted marriage proposals follow meanwhile holy crap the succession moment that made you jump out of your seat is the one that sunk roman so low into it he may as well be dipping his toes into magma when it comes to errant dick pics that s one he ll really regret sending and logan reacted in exactly the way you d expect which is to say like a sea witch note that he tried to sexually shame two of his sons this week dad of the year chiantishire was a totally wild episode that had pivotal moments for all the key characters so this week we re going to break it down into character arcs roman the youngest roy son had the most rollercoaster ride of the tuscany set episode or maybe it s more like the tower of terror where you re dropped precipitously with a couple of small bounces before getting off at the very bottom and having to line up behind throngs to people to get back up that s where roman is at now at the back of the line at this point even karl would probably pip him that chair doesn t sink any lower roman picture binge he started off with his stock high at the beginning bringing the gojo deal with lukas matsson to his dad but it s not before he has to run interference with the eccentric technology prodigy the deal is essential to waystar it s the only way the company will stay relevant in a media landscape that is swinging away from broadcast and traditional publishing towards digital services such as streaming and sports betting gojo will help waystar scale where it needs to instead of wither and die on the vine as a relic of a bygone era but the elon musk esque matsson has other ideas so he goes on a tweet spree which includes among others an eggplant emoji everyone loses their minds in trying to decipher them again just like when musk is let loose and the tweets have the desired effect sending gojo s market cap so high it s now worth about the same as waystar roman is dispatched to switzerland to meet with matsson only just a chopper ride away from tuscany and he manages to figure out what matsson is really after a merger of equals not a buyout lukas matsson is loose with the tweets picture binge roman sells the idea to his dad even though it would be a significant dilution of the roys value in the company but roman says that logan could still run the company and the alternative is they don t have a company to run at all just as he s about to blush from the good work old chap praise for setting up a viable deal he decides to send gerri a dick pic as some kind of victory lap because that s a thing guys do i can t relate but a slip of the finger means the offending picture accompanied with a message telling gerri to eat it is sent instead to daddy and there s enough detail on the screen for everyone to know that roman wears calvin klein undies and uh some other stuff that cringeworthy moment he realises is the most roman has ever looked so haunted are you a sicko logan asks roman as the scion awkwardly tries to explain why he sent the dick pic he s obviously very erudite and insightful people just send each other pics of their dicks logan is far from impressed picture binge roman being confronted by his dad to explain his many sexual proclivities and repressions is some of the most uncomfortable moments of this show punctuated only by logan s casual misogyny what happened to that nice piece of tail you were with sometimes it s hard to tell if logan is more annoyed that his youngest son has what he considers to be unusual sexual appetites or that he didn t know about it beforehand you re a laughing stock oh go on f k off logan growls from his perch high up on the tower of terror roman is now in the pits covered in the piss of his dad s disdain not even the retired janitors of idaho can clean him off now haunted picture binge shiv which brings us to the calculating shiv who immediately pounces on the roman fracas to propel herself into logan s orbit after an earlier conversation with tom in which she resolves to do whatever it takes to gain control of the company she sees her opportunity to push roman down several rungs she s the one who puts into logan s mind the word disgusting to describe roman s fascination with gerri which the old man spits back at his son moments later but as bad as her behaviour is towards roman what she does to gerri is worse under the pretence of care this must be so hard for you or that s my concern for you here shiv basically threatens gerri by laying it out that unless she reports roman s acts as harassment it could be construed that gerri encouraged him let s recall that earlier in the episode gerri specifically told roman to stop sending the pics for shiv she thinks she s neutralising both roman and gerri in one swoop clearing the path for her own ascension and it is perilous for gerri but gerri has been around for a long time and she s a lawyer to boot so she s not giving shiv anything for now it s such an illuminating scene that further undermines any idea that shiv might act out of care for others or heavens forfend the sisterhood these scenes follow two other revealing scenes about shiv and gives the audience a lot of insight into her childhood in that cold cold family during caroline s hen s night in cortona shiv and her mother have the closest to a heart to heart as you re ever likely to get in succession little hen s night d m picture binge but not before a little titbit about the other families in their terrible world shiv s soon to be stepsisters apparently exported her address book while offering to take photos for her what a crazy move these people kind of deserve each other despite a plea to not snipe the spotty mother and sh tty daughter go in for each other immediately shiv says to caroline that it was probably best that you let dad take us and caroline replies that she gave logan custody so that her kids could keep their shares and that she was just protecting their interests it s very on brand for logan to threaten his kids futures to gain advantage in a divorce we d almost be disappointed if that s not what happened caroline says shiv chose her father but shiv reminds her she was only 10 when it happened caroline shoots back you were 13 and you knew how to twist the knife you knew then and you know now and then she says what probably many parents wish they could say to their kids you were my onion you are my onion a moment of begrudging understanding passes between them before caroline vocalises another thing parents are never allowed to say but some probably feel truth is i probably should never have had children and then praises shiv for choosing not to caroline also gave the most insightful thing we ve maybe heard about logan this entire series when she explains why she could never have had dogs around logan he never saw anything he loved just to see if he could kick it and see if it would still come back shiv and caroline are each other s onions picture binge on the promo tour this year for the third season premiere brian cox said that logan does love his children but that they disappoint him if we are to take caroline s assessment of her ex it lines up with what cox said the mills brothers were really onto something drunk on chianti and emotional trauma shiv returns to the hotel room to tell tom she wants to have a baby because caroline basically told her she d be a bad mother only to semi backtrack the next morning by talking about egg freezing and revisiting it in 10 years not the anchor baby tom was hoping for but he s got other issues to ponder in his bag of insecurities about their marriage shiv s idea of talking dirty during sex is to tell tom you re not good enough for me and i don t love you verbal aphrodisiac maybe more likely is that shiv doesn t actually love tom but needs a convenient ally he s always suspected it in the deep dark recesses of one s mind that we never plunge because the horrors to emerge from it is too hurtful so for shiv to actually say it even under the guise of sexual role play it s all just a little too real kendall after his emotional breakdown last episode kendall is a subdued and shorn man when he arrives at the tuscan villa with his kids seeing his mother doesn t help when she tells him that he needs to sit out some of the itinerary at the request of his father that caroline would acquiesce to her soon to be husband who s starstruck by logan s presence rather than think of her oldest child is no surprise kendall is uninvited to many of the festivities picture hbo foxtel he eventually corners logan and proposes a sit down tete a tete to hash things out in private so naturally logan brings his bodyguard and kerry kendall jokes that logan is scared that he ll be poisoned during the meal but the old man is actually a little paranoid or is he it s hard to know what to make of logan asking his grandson to taste his mozzarella first because surely no one is so heartless as to risk his grandchild just to stick it to his son maybe he figured if kendall really did do something to his food he s not going to let iverson eat it or he just wants kendall to know that he doesn t trust him what is it with this family and toxins remember the doughnuts from episode two when you use your grandson to test for poison picture binge logan dismissively warns kendall he ll leave if things are not civil and by that he means he doesn t want any sort of emotional showdown or catharsis because obviously having feelings makes you weak kendall very honestly says to logan i ll be broken when you die and it s about the truest thing anyone has said this whole episode he also says he doesn t know where his life goes from here but he knows it s not going to be with waystar he s conceding defeat in this knife fight but defeat is still costly he wants to take logan s 2 billion buyout offer from the previous episode as well as a chunky asset for that he ll give up his board seat his inheritance and the chance to speak at logan s memorial i m a ghost we re done logan says he needs to think about it because the offer in the birthday card was for fun because emotionally abusing your son on his 40th birthday is the funniest logan doesn t really want to see the back of his son no matter how angry he is right now because if he agreed to kendall s terms then he no longer has any control over his second son and logan is all about control kendall desperately wants to be a good person picture binge it s a bruising but understated scene as the camera increasingly pushes in closer on the two roy men as kendall tells his dad that he s kind of evil and has monetised resentment while logan weaponises the one thing that wrecks kendall when kendall insists he s a good guy a conception of himself that seems integral to his mental state staying intact logan asks kendall how long was that kid alive referring to the chappaquiddick moment from season one in which kendall killed a caterer during a car accident which is also referenced earlier in the episode possibly to set up a later plot development or to lay the foundation for logan s barbs it s the incident that kept kendall under his dad s thumb for the second season and logan knows it s kendall s kryptonite he even throws some spurious sexual accusations in there for good sport because as mentioned above re roman logan loves to sexually shame his sons must be a reverse oedipal thing if you never let your sons become full humans then they can t replace you when kendall says for the second time i am a good person he believes it less succession is available on

spoilers ahead for succession episode 8 chiantishire the roys are in tuscany for caroline s wedding to a seat sniffing bankrupt the sun s out the libations are flowing and everyone is looking chic in linen outfits but the idyllic setting only gives way to dramatic developments because anywhere the roys go betrayal and pain and not yet accepted marriage proposals follow meanwhile holy crap the succession moment that made you jump out of your seat is the one that sunk roman so low into it he may as well be dipping his toes into magma when it comes to errant dick pics that s one he ll really regret sending and logan reacted in exactly the way you d expect which is to say like a sea witch note that he tried to sexually shame two of his sons this week dad of the year chiantishire was a totally wild episode that had pivotal moments for all the key characters so this week we re going to break it down into character arcs roman the youngest roy son had the most rollercoaster ride of the tuscany set episode or maybe it s more like the tower of terror where you re dropped precipitously with a couple of small bounces before getting off at the very bottom and having to line up behind throngs to people to get back up that s where roman is at now at the back of the line at this point even karl would probably pip him that chair doesn t sink any lower roman picture binge he started off with his stock high at the beginning bringing the gojo deal with lukas matsson to his dad but it s not before he has to run interference with the eccentric technology prodigy the deal is essential to waystar it s the only way the company will stay relevant in a media landscape that is swinging away from broadcast and traditional publishing towards digital services such as streaming and sports betting gojo will help waystar scale where it needs to instead of wither and die on the vine as a relic of a bygone era but the elon musk esque matsson has other ideas so he goes on a tweet spree which includes among others an eggplant emoji everyone loses their minds in trying to decipher them again just like when musk is let loose and the tweets have the desired effect sending gojo s market cap so high it s now worth about the same as waystar roman is dispatched to switzerland to meet with matsson only just a chopper ride away from tuscany and he manages to figure out what matsson is really after a merger of equals not a buyout lukas matsson is loose with the tweets picture binge roman sells the idea to his dad even though it would be a significant dilution of the roys value in the company but roman says that logan could still run the company and the alternative is they don t have a company to run at all just as he s about to blush from the good work old chap praise for setting up a viable deal he decides to send gerri a dick pic as some kind of victory lap because that s a thing guys do i can t relate but a slip of the finger means the offending picture accompanied with a message telling gerri to eat it is sent instead to daddy and there s enough detail on the screen for everyone to know that roman wears calvin klein undies and uh some other stuff that cringeworthy moment he realises is the most roman has ever looked so haunted are you a sicko logan asks roman as the scion awkwardly tries to explain why he sent the dick pic he s obviously very erudite and insightful people just send each other pics of their dicks logan is far from impressed picture binge roman being confronted by his dad to explain his many sexual proclivities and repressions is some of the most uncomfortable moments of this show punctuated only by logan s casual misogyny what happened to that nice piece of tail you were with sometimes it s hard to tell if logan is more annoyed that his youngest son has what he considers to be unusual sexual appetites or that he didn t know about it beforehand you re a laughing stock oh go on f k off logan growls from his perch high up on the tower of terror roman is now in the pits covered in the piss of his dad s disdain not even the retired janitors of idaho can clean him off now haunted picture binge shiv which brings us to the calculating shiv who immediately pounces on the roman fracas to propel herself into logan s orbit after an earlier conversation with tom in which she resolves to do whatever it takes to gain control of the company she sees her opportunity to push roman down several rungs she s the one who puts into logan s mind the word disgusting to describe roman s fascination with gerri which the old man spits back at his son moments later but as bad as her behaviour is towards roman what she does to gerri is worse under the pretence of care this must be so hard for you or that s my concern for you here shiv basically threatens gerri by laying it out that unless she reports roman s acts as harassment it could be construed that gerri encouraged him let s recall that earlier in the episode gerri specifically told roman to stop sending the pics for shiv she thinks she s neutralising both roman and gerri in one swoop clearing the path for her own ascension and it is perilous for gerri but gerri has been around for a long time and she s a lawyer to boot so she s not giving shiv anything for now it s such an illuminating scene that further undermines any idea that shiv might act out of care for others or heavens forfend the sisterhood these scenes follow two other revealing scenes about shiv and gives the audience a lot of insight into her childhood in that cold cold family during caroline s hen s night in cortona shiv and her mother have the closest to a heart to heart as you re ever likely to get in succession little hen s night d m picture binge but not before a little titbit about the other families in their terrible world shiv s soon to be stepsisters apparently exported her address book while offering to take photos for her what a crazy move these people kind of deserve each other despite a plea to not snipe the spotty mother and sh tty daughter go in for each other immediately shiv says to caroline that it was probably best that you let dad take us and caroline replies that she gave logan custody so that her kids could keep their shares and that she was just protecting their interests it s very on brand for logan to threaten his kids futures to gain advantage in a divorce we d almost be disappointed if that s not what happened caroline says shiv chose her father but shiv reminds her she was only 10 when it happened caroline shoots back you were 13 and you knew how to twist the knife you knew then and you know now and then she says what probably many parents wish they could say to their kids you were my onion you are my onion a moment of begrudging understanding passes between them before caroline vocalises another thing parents are never allowed to say but some probably feel truth is i probably should never have had children and then praises shiv for choosing not to caroline also gave the most insightful thing we ve maybe heard about logan this entire series when she explains why she could never have had dogs around logan he never saw anything he loved just to see if he could kick it and see if it would still come back shiv and caroline are each other s onions picture binge on the promo tour this year for the third season premiere brian cox said that logan does love his children but that they disappoint him if we are to take caroline s assessment of her ex it lines up with what cox said the mills brothers were really onto something drunk on chianti and emotional trauma shiv returns to the hotel room to tell tom she wants to have a baby because caroline basically told her she d be a bad mother only to semi backtrack the next morning by talking about egg freezing and revisiting it in 10 years not the anchor baby tom was hoping for but he s got other issues to ponder in his bag of insecurities about their marriage shiv s idea of talking dirty during sex is to tell tom you re not good enough for me and i don t love you verbal aphrodisiac maybe more likely is that shiv doesn t actually love tom but needs a convenient ally he s always suspected it in the deep dark recesses of one s mind that we never plunge because the horrors to emerge from it is too hurtful so for shiv to actually say it even under the guise of sexual role play it s all just a little too real kendall after his emotional breakdown last episode kendall is a subdued and shorn man when he arrives at the tuscan villa with his kids seeing his mother doesn t help when she tells him that he needs to sit out some of the itinerary at the request of his father that caroline would acquiesce to her soon to be husband who s starstruck by logan s presence rather than think of her oldest child is no surprise kendall is uninvited to many of the festivities picture hbo foxtel he eventually corners logan and proposes a sit down tete a tete to hash things out in private so naturally logan brings his bodyguard and kerry kendall jokes that logan is scared that he ll be poisoned during the meal but the old man is actually a little paranoid or is he it s hard to know what to make of logan asking his grandson to taste his mozzarella first because surely no one is so heartless as to risk his grandchild just to stick it to his son maybe he figured if kendall really did do something to his food he s not going to let iverson eat it or he just wants kendall to know that he doesn t trust him what is it with this family and toxins remember the doughnuts from episode two when you use your grandson to test for poison picture binge logan dismissively warns kendall he ll leave if things are not civil and by that he means he doesn t want any sort of emotional showdown or catharsis because obviously having feelings makes you weak kendall very honestly says to logan i ll be broken when you die and it s about the truest thing anyone has said this whole episode he also says he doesn t know where his life goes from here but he knows it s not going to be with waystar he s conceding defeat in this knife fight but defeat is still costly he wants to take logan s 2 billion buyout offer from the previous episode as well as a chunky asset for that he ll give up his board seat his inheritance and the chance to speak at logan s memorial i m a ghost we re done logan says he needs to think about it because the offer in the birthday card was for fun because emotionally abusing your son on his 40th birthday is the funniest logan doesn t really want to see the back of his son no matter how angry he is right now because if he agreed to kendall s terms then he no longer has any control over his second son and logan is all about control kendall desperately wants to be a good person picture binge it s a bruising but understated scene as the camera increasingly pushes in closer on the two roy men as kendall tells his dad that he s kind of evil and has monetised resentment while logan weaponises the one thing that wrecks kendall when kendall insists he s a good guy a conception of himself that seems integral to his mental state staying intact logan asks kendall how long was that kid alive referring to the chappaquiddick moment from season one in which kendall killed a caterer during a car accident which is also referenced earlier in the episode possibly to set up a later plot development or to lay the foundation for logan s barbs it s the incident that kept kendall under his dad s thumb for the second season and logan knows it s kendall s kryptonite he even throws some spurious sexual accusations in there for good sport because as mentioned above re roman logan loves to sexually shame his sons must be a reverse oedipal thing if you never let your sons become full humans then they can t replace you when kendall says for the second time i am a good person he believes it less succession is available on

hardware news this week talks about vulnerabilities found and patched on several amd and intel motherboards including gigabyte and asus boards we ll also be talking about nvidia s lovelace gpus rtx 40 series competition to intel s in bound i3 cpus via amd montech taking gn criticism seriously and more article below the video 01 00 gn store charity drive for the end of 2021 gn is donating 10 of its total store revenue from now until december 15 2021 to the eden reforestation projects we ve worked with eden reforestation projects several years in a row now and love what they do the organization supports people in need by creating long term jobs revolving around reforesting deforested land which restores local economies supports the people in the community and also prevents further habitat loss and actually restores habitat for local wildlife gn s steve will be matching the resultant 10 of store revenue at the end of the campaign gn s store can be found here we currently have volt modmats on back order and shipping within just a few weeks so if you want to get one place an order soon our toolkits are also on back order and all back orders count toward this 10 contribution t shirts bar mats and mouse mats and pads are also available now 05 54 nvidia lovelace hopper to use tsmc silicon now that the market is fully saturated with rtx 30 series cards including many many options under 300 that expands the whole range nvidia is primed to move on to something new after all it would be really insulting if there were two companies with competitive gpus and a year after launching a new generation there were no new cards with an msrp under 300 nvidia s next generation architecture for datacenter server gpus has been codenamed hopper meanwhile the architecture for consumer gpus has been named lovelace both hopper lovelace gpus will use the tsmc n5 process node currently nvidia uses samsung silicon for the ampere gpus but it has used tsmc for several products before for the datacenter ga100 nvidia uses tsmc n7 and that s an actively sold part after a year of supply chain issues nvidia is moving from a diversified silicon supply chain to a consolidated source this would mean that nvidia will be splitting its supply from tsmc between consumer and datacenter rather than each one having discrete sources the argument from digitimes via tomshardware for solely using tsmc is that a larger order will result in a larger allocation of silicon from tsmc only time will tell if this strategy works out in the real world source 08 37 new gpus fine i ll do it myself in hw news not too long ago we ran a piece that the rtx 2060 was going to be revived again and this time with an expanded 12gb of vram as it turns out nvidia needn t bother finish those plans because a russian modder has beaten them to the punch vik on is no novice when it comes to slapping more memory modules onto a gpu he s made a name for himself equipping 2070s and 3070s with 16gb somewhat recently this time the modder is giving an asus rtx 2060 turbo a few more samsung gddr6 2gb modules to play with disappointingly but perhaps not unsurprisingly vik on didn t see much of a difference between the 6gb and 12gb versions in the few tests that he did run this is hardly conclusive and we ll have to wait till we get our own 12gb rtx 2060 to see if we can find a difference elsewhere but this mod still leaves us wondering why the rtx 2060 is getting more memory source vik on s video on yt russian language 11 14 rumor amd prepping for intel i3 cpus in a leak posted by r√®xƒ´n sh√¨m√≠n mi√°o biƒÅn gu√†i on the chiphell forums amd is preparing to launch a zen 2 based renoir x cpu for socket am4 which gu√†i xian1sheng1 says will be ryzen 4000g components without the igp or with a stripped down one the ryzen 4000 series of cpus never made it onto this channel or most others for that matter because it was largely an oem only launch of apus for pre built machines because these are zen 2 they re on older technology than the modern 5000 series cpus and so they re not going to be competitive at the high end they may be enough to compete with intel s inbound core i3 cpus launching early next year but since we don t have those yet we can t be certain amd could refresh the 4000 series as low end r3 parts by using poor silicon or fusing off the igps making use of existing stock these will likely be the last cpus on am4 source 13 26 montech takes gn seriously changing case we ve had one neutral to positive review of a montech case and one negative one with the latest being the montech air 1000 lite we found that the case called itself air but didn t actually have enough porosity to allow sufficient air into the chassis it ended up being a poor thermal performer despite overall acceptable build quality montech s representative emailed us a few weeks ago to inform us of incoming changes to the cases and we wanted to share that with you all hey steve patrick after your video came out montech has taken the suggestions seriously they will be updating the new batches of the air 1000 mesh with diameter 2 0 pitch 2 8 open porosity 46 2 also see image below any customer that got the old mesh can also apply for a free new mesh by applying on the montech website the glass buckle will been improved front 2 fans will be installed in the second and third positions this is an excellent response and is exactly how a company should respond with an attitude like this we re looking forward to where montech goes in the future source email to gn 17 43 intel s secret weapon in security research last year we had fun putting together a piece compiling and testing 10 years of intel cpus we went back to 2500k 2600k and ran almost every generation since in a series of benchmarks in an exclusive with the wall street journal intel detailed its own historical efforts with cpus talking about its long term retention lab located at the company s costa rica facility with another catchy intel name the long term retention lab started up in 2019 as a response to the growing security issues being discovered in intel cpus one of the more amusing details of the new lab is that despite having made the cpus in the first place intel had to take to ebay to find some of the older processors sandy bridge was specifically named for this intel we can spot you next time just ask if we don t have it in our trays we probably have it in our pile of donor cpus to accommodate a decade of technological development and some stagnation the engineers at the ltrl had to dig up architectural materials for many generations of cpu and at times they even had to dig up engineers who no longer worked at intel at all for more details the project is an impressive one with plans to expand up to 27000 square feet with 6000 pieces of equipment the lab gets requests to run different specific configurations constantly from other intel facilities and teams one of the engineers on the project said they get 1000 requests a month the lab runs 24 7 with 25 technicians on hand at any given time to keep the tests going source 20 30 sapphire launches something out of date in 2016 razer took the pc gaming world by storm when it launched the razer core x external gpu the entire industry changed and because it s the future now everyone uses an external gpu well one bit of that is true anyway razer did sell an external gpu enclosure and we d like to hear from all three of you in the comments there is a reason we re talking about the core x though and that s because sapphire wants in on the action at a time when no one can keep gpus on the shelves and people will buy a gpu even when it s packaged with a bomb sapphire has decided to package its gpus with a case that can t fit anything else and a thunderbolt 3 connection it s a great way to dump inventory the sleek aluminum chassis is reminiscent of the apple system we restored last year and inside is a sapphire pulse rx 6600 xt we haven t tested sapphire s 6600 xt but broadly speaking we ve been impressed with sapphire s build quality in the past that includes the rx 6700 xt nitro we did a teardown on earlier this year it s reasonable to think that sapphire s execution of the rx 6600 xt will also be good frankly though we were disappointed with the price to performance of the mid tier gpus this generation but with the context of the constant supply issues this past year that really hasn t even factored into it we had trouble justifying egpus five years ago and with how hard it is just getting a gpu nowadays they seem even more pointless now source 22 13 smm vulnerabilities revealed we recently received a tip from a viewer that gigabyte has updated the bios version description on a couple of amd boards b550 and x570 at least to state major vulnerabilities updates customers are strongly encouraged to update to this release at the earliest and customers will not be able to reverse to previous bios version due to major vulnerabilities concerns non specific credit is given to assaf carlsbad and itai liba respectively a security researcher and a senior security researcher at cybersecurity company sentinelone on further investigation we found the same patch notes on multiple other gigabyte boards including intel boards carlsbad and liba have recently collaborated on a software tool called brick that automates checking for system management mode vulnerabilities smm is responsible for low level system interactions like setting fan curves and clock speeds as well as myriad other things like managing the tpm which explains the gravity of gigabyte s response our assumption is either that the sentinelone team used brick to dig up and report weak points in gigabyte s bios or more likely that gigabyte is patching around the broader vulnerabilities whose discoveries are credited to carlsbad and liba there s no reason to think that gigabyte is the only vendor affected keep an eye on bios patch notes from all companies in the near future carlsbad in particular has been posting a flood of brick discovered cves common vulnerabilities and exposures as confirmed and addressed by intel lenovo asus and of course gigabyte the disclosures from intel alone cover core cpus from 7th gen to 11th gen as well as many xeons and pentiums this story will very likely expand to include almost everyone source 24 12 umc settles with micron this is a story we haven t revisited in a few years back in 2018 micron was temporarily banned by a chinese court from selling 26 products in china in relation to a patent dispute umc alleged that micron was infringing on its patents while micron alleged that no they didn t and also umc s patents were invalid and also umc facilitated theft of micron s ip anyway so it was just stealing its own work back part of micron s official statement at the time was that the patent infringement claims of umc and jinhua were filed against micron in retaliation for criminal indictments filed by taiwan authorities against umc and three of its employees and a civil lawsuit filed by micron against umc and jinhua in the united states district court for the northern district of california for the misappropriation of micron trade secrets in the years since the legal battle has shifted in micron s favor in us courts as reported by trendforce in late 2018 the united states doj charged umc with helping another company to attempt to steal dram manufacturing technology from micron as micron had alleged obviously this case involves complex international relations umc is a taiwanese company micron is american and the ban against micron was enacted in china the incident that micron referenced in its statement was the recruitment of a micron engineer by umc who was indicted for supplying micron documents to chinese partner company fujian jinhua integrated circuit co more than three years after our last report umc has already paid a 60 million fine for trade secret theft and the two companies have finally reached a settlement wherein they agree to stop fighting and umc will make a one time payment of an undisclosed amount to micron it s an anticlimactic end but bloomberg reports that micron isn t done yet and will seek full restitution through civil court 26 25 cryptocrimes hacking the mines we love ending with a good cyberpunk style news story usually something involving gpu smuggling but this works too an unnamed couple was arrested in spain and charged for hacking damage and fraud the pair used the hacked machines to mine cryptocurrency and were apparently discovered when department store staff reported pre built display systems running their fans at full bore and constantly overheating this surprised us because we ve had a few pre builts that did that out of the box no mining required the best part of the story is how the couple carried out their scheme a classic sleight of hand the woman would approach department store staff with her laptop and ask for technical help which bitdefender says was typically just help booting the laptop while the staff was distracted the man would slip a usb stick into the department store computer to install anydesk and nicehash it was a clever plan and we even used it on der8auer s computer at the last trade show but unfortunately for the crypto bonnie clyde security cameras exist and were used to identify the pair source writing steve burke patrick lathan patrick stone video keegan gallick

don t miss out on the headlines from tv followed categories will be added to my news spoilers ahead for succession episode 8 chiantishire the roys are in tuscany for caroline s wedding to a seat sniffing bankrupt the sun s out the libations are flowing and everyone is looking chic in linen outfits but the idyllic setting only gives way to dramatic developments because anywhere the roys go betrayal and pain and not yet accepted marriage proposals follow meanwhile holy crap the succession moment that made you jump out of your seat is the one that sunk roman so low into it he may as well be dipping his toes into magma when it comes to errant dick pics that s one he ll really regret sending and logan reacted in exactly the way you d expect which is to say like a sea witch note that he tried to sexually shame two of his sons this week dad of the year chiantishire was a totally wild episode that had pivotal moments for all the key characters so this week we re going to break it down into character arcs roman the youngest roy son had the most rollercoaster ride of the tuscany set episode or maybe it s more like the tower of terror where you re dropped precipitously with a couple of small bounces before getting off at the very bottom and having to line up behind throngs to people to get back up that s where roman is at now at the back of the line at this point even karl would probably pip him that chair doesn t sink any lower roman picture binge he started off with his stock high at the beginning bringing the gojo deal with lukas matsson to his dad but it s not before he has to run interference with the eccentric technology prodigy the deal is essential to waystar it s the only way the company will stay relevant in a media landscape that is swinging away from broadcast and traditional publishing towards digital services such as streaming and sports betting gojo will help waystar scale where it needs to instead of wither and die on the vine as a relic of a bygone era but the elon musk esque matsson has other ideas so he goes on a tweet spree which includes among others an eggplant emoji everyone loses their minds in trying to decipher them again just like when musk is let loose and the tweets have the desired effect sending gojo s market cap so high it s now worth about the same as waystar roman is dispatched to switzerland to meet with matsson only just a chopper ride away from tuscany and he manages to figure out what matsson is really after a merger of equals not a buyout lukas matsson is loose with the tweets picture binge roman sells the idea to his dad even though it would be a significant dilution of the roys value in the company but roman says that logan could still run the company and the alternative is they don t have a company to run at all just as he s about to blush from the good work old chap praise for setting up a viable deal he decides to send gerri a dick pic as some kind of victory lap because that s a thing guys do i can t relate but a slip of the finger means the offending picture accompanied with a message telling gerri to eat it is sent instead to daddy and there s enough detail on the screen for everyone to know that roman wears calvin klein undies and uh some other stuff that cringeworthy moment he realises is the most roman has ever looked so haunted are you a sicko logan asks roman as the scion awkwardly tries to explain why he sent the dick pic he s obviously very erudite and insightful people just send each other pics of their dicks logan is far from impressed picture binge roman being confronted by his dad to explain his many sexual proclivities and repressions is some of the most uncomfortable moments of this show punctuated only by logan s casual misogyny what happened to that nice piece of tail you were with sometimes it s hard to tell if logan is more annoyed that his youngest son has what he considers to be unusual sexual appetites or that he didn t know about it beforehand you re a laughing stock oh go on f k off logan growls from his perch high up on the tower of terror roman is now in the pits covered in the piss of his dad s disdain not even the retired janitors of idaho can clean him off now haunted picture binge shiv which brings us to the calculating shiv who immediately pounces on the roman fracas to propel herself into logan s orbit after an earlier conversation with tom in which she resolves to do whatever it takes to gain control of the company she sees her opportunity to push roman down several rungs she s the one who puts into logan s mind the word disgusting to describe roman s fascination with gerri which the old man spits back at his son moments later but as bad as her behaviour is towards roman what she does to gerri is worse under the pretence of care this must be so hard for you or that s my concern for you here shiv basically threatens gerri by laying it out that unless she reports roman s acts as harassment it could be construed that gerri encouraged him let s recall that earlier in the episode gerri specifically told roman to stop sending the pics for shiv she thinks she s neutralising both roman and gerri in one swoop clearing the path for her own ascension and it is perilous for gerri but gerri has been around for a long time and she s a lawyer to boot so she s not giving shiv anything for now it s such an illuminating scene that further undermines any idea that shiv might act out of care for others or heavens forfend the sisterhood these scenes follow two other revealing scenes about shiv and gives the audience a lot of insight into her childhood in that cold cold family during caroline s hen s night in cortona shiv and her mother have the closest to a heart to heart as you re ever likely to get in succession little hen s night d m picture binge but not before a little titbit about the other families in their terrible world shiv s soon to be stepsisters apparently exported her address book while offering to take photos for her what a crazy move these people kind of deserve each other despite a plea to not snipe the spotty mother and sh tty daughter go in for each other immediately shiv says to caroline that it was probably best that you let dad take us and caroline replies that she gave logan custody so that her kids could keep their shares and that she was just protecting their interests it s very on brand for logan to threaten his kids futures to gain advantage in a divorce we d almost be disappointed if that s not what happened caroline says shiv chose her father but shiv reminds her she was only 10 when it happened caroline shoots back you were 13 and you knew how to twist the knife you knew then and you know now and then she says what probably many parents wish they could say to their kids you were my onion you are my onion a moment of begrudging understanding passes between them before caroline vocalises another thing parents are never allowed to say but some

new beijing bourse highlights positive effects of opening up on financial sector the beijing stock exchange which opened on nov 15 for business and is expected to grow into the chinese version of nasdaq has attracted the local capital markets spotlight that was hitherto shining on bigger bourses such as the shanghai stock exchange now foreign securities firms which have played an increasingly bigger role in the a share market are unwilling to miss their chance to shine as well on the burgeoning bourse for instance dbs securities from the stable of singapore s dbs is among the first few foreign securities firms that have received bse membership the firm is advancing ipo projects for the bse which are expected to enter the application phase next year dbs securities is also working closely with other professional institutions like law firms to conduct internal communication and study bse policies before their implementation the dbs management team said foreign investment banks are more experienced in seeking qualified foreign institutional investors or qfiis making more effective underwriting plans for issuers and attracting leading industry investors and strategic investors the risks embedded in the operations of small and medium enterprises smes require the involvement of professional institutions with corresponding risk taking capabilities for the bse listed smes it will take a longer time for them to get rooted in the market which means that foreign securities firms can give full play to their comprehensive financial services dbs said like dbs ubs securities co ltd which is linked to its parent swiss financial giant ubs group ag figures among the first few of the 112 member securities firms of the bse as ubs has received a license to conduct secondary market brokerage businesses at the bse the firm would like to bring more overseas experiences to the chinese market said eugene qian its chairman the bse is built on the neeq select the highest tier of the eight year old national equities exchange and quotations system some 81 companies have debuted on the exchange already to help smes float successfully on the bse regulators have lowered the threshold a company with market capitalization estimated at 200 million yuan 31 3 million can apply to go public on the bourse more importantly no stringent requirement has been set for bse applicants profitability they just need to demonstrate that they have invested a sufficient amount of money in research and development in comparison the threshold is 1 billion yuan for a company planning to go public on the chinext of the shenzhen stock exchange which helps companies from traditional industries come up with new business models and patterns a similar benchmark is set for the star market of the shanghai stock exchange which aims to nurture large technology companies guidelines for qfiis and rqfiis to trade on the bse took effect on its first trading day which have paved the way for foreign investors apart from bringing the experiences of exchanges from all over the world jp morgan will work actively to help companies float on the bse and obtain refinancing said houston huang ceo and head of investment banking at jp morgan securities china co ltd we would like to introduce more institutional investors and overseas investors into the chinese market as jp morgan has multiple channels and a rich client base huang said it is our hope that this group of investors can participate in trading on the bse via the qfii mechanism or other channels approved by regulators jp morgan announced in early august that the china securities regulatory commission has approved the registration of jp morgan international finance ltd with 100 percent ownership of jp morgan securities china co ltd making it the first foreign firm to fully own a securities venture in china no industry leader is left behind in the race to make their bse presence felt shortly after the decision to set up the bse was announced morgan stanley responded instantly and came up with a research report on sept 2 informing investors of the basics of the new bourse and its understanding of the bse s positioning integral to the construction of a multilevel capital market in china the bse will help stress direct financing some quality companies trading on the bse are likely to migrate to the shanghai and shenzhen bourses in the future according to morgan stanley credit suisse securities china ltd has been expanding its services in china by reaching out to more clients in the country credit suisse securities expansion strategy is in line with the positioning of the bse which aims to nurture more innovative smes said the firm s ceo tim tu currently credit suisse securities is preparing the internal and external procedures to become a bse member in the near term and link to the exchange s system said tu by comparing the bse with the shanghai and shenzhen bourses credit suisse will help suitable clients to float on the former foreign securities companies only play a very small part in the neeq trading at present due to the concerns over resource endowment and yield on cost said tu therefore the stock connect program which is now adopted by the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges can be introduced to the bse so that overseas investors can have more access to the chinese capital market meanwhile foreign securities firms and overseas investors can participate in the ongoing capital market reform in china as tu understands the history of nasdaq in the united states can work as a solid reference a migration system also exists at nasdaq as nasdaq listed companies can be transferred to the new york stock exchange when they grow big enough for the bigger bourse however an increasing number of quality companies especially technologically advanced companies have chosen to stay with nasdaq making it the listing venue for the world s technology giants such as microsoft apple and google he said the inauguration of the bse the exchange s positioning and related systemic arrangements point to the possibility of the bse growing into the chinese version of nasdaq this is why foreign institutions are not willing to steer clear of it foreign institutions quick moves on the bse is just one snapshot of their increasing interest in the a share market through qfii and stock connect programs between hong kong shanghai and shenzhen guangdong province the net inflow of foreign investment reached nearly 241 billion yuan between january and october this year which has already overtaken the whole year figure of 208 9 billion yuan in 2020 by the end of october foreign investors held up to 3 67 trillion yuan worth of a shares measured by market cap equaling nearly 5 percent of the entire a share market value that ratio was merely 0 3 percent a decade ago csrc vice chairman fang xinghai said at the china singapore chongqing connectivity initiative financial summit 2021 on nov 23 that foreign investors have been steadily improving their positions in the a share market reflecting their increasing interest in and recognition by the chinese capital market which has been advancing its further opening up wong kok hoi founder and chief investment officer of the singapore based aps asset management pte ltd said the launch of the bse may impel foreign investors to change their investment style in the a share market although the bse features vigorous and mushrooming small companies small cap companies in the other boards of the a share market may draw more attention from foreign investors especially when regulation on technology behemoths may continue to tighten he said among the first batch of 81 companies listed on the bse 87 percent of them are from advanced manufacturing modern services high tech services and strategic emerging industries seventeen of the first debutants are little giants recognized by the ministry of industry and information technology they are leading smes that specialize in niche sectors command a high market share and boast strong innovative capacity and core technologies the companies average annual r d investment was 25 3 million yuan in 2020 which was over 4 percent of their average annual sales revenue last year a share companies devoted an average 1 92 percent of their annual income to r d last year robin xing chief economist of morgan stanley china agreed that foreign investors may change their investment structure in china as the central government attaches greater importance to advanced manufacturing new energy industrial chains domestic consumer staples as well as the self dependent technology hardware and semiconductor sectors global capital will enhance their position in these spaces accordingly and reduce their allocations to internet based platforms xing said

don t miss out on the headlines from tv reviews followed categories will be added to my news spoilers ahead for succession episode 8 chiantishire the roys are in tuscany for caroline s wedding to a seat sniffing bankrupt the sun s out the libations are flowing and everyone is looking chic in linen outfits but the idyllic setting only gives way to dramatic developments because anywhere the roys go betrayal and pain and not yet accepted marriage proposals follow meanwhile holy crap the succession moment that made you jump out of your seat is the one that sunk roman so low into it he may as well be dipping his toes into magma when it comes to errant dick pics that s one he ll really regret sending and logan reacted in exactly the way you d expect which is to say like a sea witch note that he tried to sexually shame two of his sons this week dad of the year chiantishire was a totally wild episode that had pivotal moments for all the key characters so this week we re going to break it down into character arcs roman the youngest roy son had the most rollercoaster ride of the tuscany set episode or maybe it s more like the tower of terror where you re dropped precipitously with a couple of small bounces before getting off at the very bottom and having to line up behind throngs to people to get back up that s where roman is at now at the back of the line at this point even karl would probably pip him that chair doesn t sink any lower roman picture binge he started off with his stock high at the beginning bringing the gojo deal with lukas matsson to his dad but it s not before he has to run interference with the eccentric technology prodigy the deal is essential to waystar it s the only way the company will stay relevant in a media landscape that is swinging away from broadcast and traditional publishing towards digital services such as streaming and sports betting gojo will help waystar scale where it needs to instead of wither and die on the vine as a relic of a bygone era but the elon musk esque matsson has other ideas so he goes on a tweet spree which includes among others an eggplant emoji everyone loses their minds in trying to decipher them again just like when musk is let loose and the tweets have the desired effect sending gojo s market cap so high it s now worth about the same as waystar roman is dispatched to switzerland to meet with matsson only just a chopper ride away from tuscany and he manages to figure out what matsson is really after a merger of equals not a buyout lukas matsson is loose with the tweets picture binge roman sells the idea to his dad even though it would be a significant dilution of the roys value in the company but roman says that logan could still run the company and the alternative is they don t have a company to run at all just as he s about to blush from the good work old chap praise for setting up a viable deal he decides to send gerri a dick pic as some kind of victory lap because that s a thing guys do i can t relate but a slip of the finger means the offending picture accompanied with a message telling gerri to eat it is sent instead to daddy and there s enough detail on the screen for everyone to know that roman wears calvin klein undies and uh some other stuff that cringeworthy moment he realises is the most roman has ever looked so haunted are you a sicko logan asks roman as the scion awkwardly tries to explain why he sent the dick pic he s obviously very erudite and insightful people just send each other pics of their dicks logan is far from impressed picture binge roman being confronted by his dad to explain his many sexual proclivities and repressions is some of the most uncomfortable moments of this show punctuated only by logan s casual misogyny what happened to that nice piece of tail you were with sometimes it s hard to tell if logan is more annoyed that his youngest son has what he considers to be unusual sexual appetites or that he didn t know about it beforehand you re a laughing stock oh go on f k off logan growls from his perch high up on the tower of terror roman is now in the pits covered in the piss of his dad s disdain not even the retired janitors of idaho can clean him off now haunted picture binge shiv which brings us to the calculating shiv who immediately pounces on the roman fracas to propel herself into logan s orbit after an earlier conversation with tom in which she resolves to do whatever it takes to gain control of the company she sees her opportunity to push roman down several rungs she s the one who puts into logan s mind the word disgusting to describe roman s fascination with gerri which the old man spits back at his son moments later but as bad as her behaviour is towards roman what she does to gerri is worse under the pretence of care this must be so hard for you or that s my concern for you here shiv basically threatens gerri by laying it out that unless she reports roman s acts as harassment it could be construed that gerri encouraged him let s recall that earlier in the episode gerri specifically told roman to stop sending the pics for shiv she thinks she s neutralising both roman and gerri in one swoop clearing the path for her own ascension and it is perilous for gerri but gerri has been around for a long time and she s a lawyer to boot so she s not giving shiv anything for now it s such an illuminating scene that further undermines any idea that shiv might act out of care for others or heavens forfend the sisterhood these scenes follow two other revealing scenes about shiv and gives the audience a lot of insight into her childhood in that cold cold family during caroline s hen s night in cortona shiv and her mother have the closest to a heart to heart as you re ever likely to get in succession little hen s night d m picture binge but not before a little titbit about the other families in their terrible world shiv s soon to be stepsisters apparently exported her address book while offering to take photos for her what a crazy move these people kind of deserve each other despite a plea to not snipe the spotty mother and sh tty daughter go in for each other immediately shiv says to caroline that it was probably best that you let dad take us and caroline replies that she gave logan custody so that her kids could keep their shares and that she was just protecting their interests it s very on brand for logan to threaten his kids futures to gain advantage in a divorce we d almost be disappointed if that s not what happened caroline says shiv chose her father but shiv reminds her she was only 10 when it happened caroline shoots back you were 13 and you knew how to twist the knife you knew then and you know now and then she says what probably many parents wish they could say to their kids you were my onion you are my onion a moment of begrudging understanding passes between them before caroline vocalises another thing parents are never allowed to say but some probably feel truth is i probably should never have had children and then praises shiv for choosing not to caroline also gave the most insightful thing we ve maybe heard about logan this entire series when she explains why she could never have had dogs around logan he never saw anything he loved just to see if he could kick it and see if it would still come back shiv and caroline are each other s
