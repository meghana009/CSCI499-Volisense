advertisement joe and jill biden have worn masks to walk their dog alone on a beach while on their delaware vacation the bidens who are booster vaccinated covered their faces for no apparent reason as they took their german shepherd puppy commander for a walk along a deserted rehoboth beach on tuesday evening the president 79 even continued to wear his mask after the first lady 70 took hers off it s not clear who biden believed he was protecting or who he felt he needed protection from as the only other people on the beach the secret service didn t come within 10 yards when the couple were walking through the neighborhood members of the secret service and the press were seen closer within a couple of yards however the risk of infection given they were outdoors was negligible it was while speaking to the press that biden declared that he would impose a domestic vaccine travel requirement when i get a recommendation from the medical team the surge in covid cases from the omicron variant has made the white house reassess whether to impose it the president s mask wearing parade came just hours after dr anthony fauci admitted there was an extremely low risk of contracting covid indoors after getting fully vaccinated saying that he only continued to wear a mask to stop giving mixed signals last week the cdc updated its guidance to say that americans who are fully vaccinated can safely go maskless indoors or outdoors with the exception of crowded indoor settings like planes why the mask joe biden is seen wearing a face covering while walking his new pup commander on rehoboth beach in delaware on tuesday evening it s not clear who biden believed he was protecting by wearing a mask or who he felt he needed protection from as the only other people on the beach the secret service didn t come within 10 yards president joe biden and first lady jill biden both wearing masks on tuesday evening took their new german shepherd puppy commander on a neighborhood walk near their vacation home in rehoboth beach delaware the risk of infection outdoors is so minimal that it is absurd to wear a mask outside with the chances diminished even more by having received booster vaccines jill and joe biden toss a ball to each other as they take their dog commander for a walk on the beach in delaware biden plays with his new dog on rehoboth beach on tuesday biden told reporters that the 15 week old puppy is a rescue that was gifted to him by his brother last month for his 79th birthday the president told reporters that he will make a decision on domestic vaccine requirements when i get a recommendation from the medical team the president plays fetch with the newest addition to the first family during some off leash beach time december 28 members of the secret service guarding the president and first lady are seen spread out around them there is no scientific reason to wear a mask in such a scenario the change was long awaited and many u s leaders said it was overdue dozens of states have lifted or updated their mask mandates to reflect the new guidance including new york where vaccinated people can go maskless starting tomorrow but confusion has abounded and some like california are keeping their requirements or the time being despite the relaxing of mask rules fauci biden s top health adviser seemingly called for a vaccine mandate for air travelers on sunday but quickly retracted his remarks the next day everything that comes up as a possibility we put it on the able and we consider it that does not mean that it is likely to happen fauci clarified to cnn s jim acosta on monday i doubt if we re going to see something like that in the reasonably foreseeable future he added last month white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters that biden was considering an array of options but valuing the input of health and medical experts the most when she was asked about vaccine requirements for domestic air travel fauci laughed off acosta s questions on monday on whether there is conflict within the administration over whether to impose such a mandate it s not a question of being in favor of it or not i m in favor of what we can do to keep the country safe he said on sunday fauci told americans that removing masks on airplanes is not something we should even be considering while hundreds of flights in the u s continue to be canceled due to the spread of the omicron variant across the country appearing on abc s this week fauci said we want to make sure people keep their masks on i think the idea of taking masks off in my mind is really not something we should even be considering a vaccine requirement for a person getting on the plane is just another level of getting people to have a mechanism that would spur them to get vaccinated namely you can t get on a plane unless you re vaccinated which is just another one of the ways of getting requirements whatever that might be so i mean anything that could get people more vaccinated would be welcome but with regard to the spread of virus in the country i mean i think if you look at wearing a mask and the filtration on planes things are reasonably safe he continued joe and jill are spending several days at their rehoboth beach vacation home in the days after christmas biden chats to the press as he poses with his new puppy biden took commander off the leash to let him run around by the water tuesday evening the couple played with their new puppy as the sun set in delaware biden wore a face mask for the entire outing despite only being with

the president said is a 15 week old rescue given as a present from his brother for his 79th birthday last month the new addition to the first family comes after biden s dog champ who was also a german shepherd died in june 2021 some press gathered around for the walk were able to prompt biden to answer some questions before the president let commander off his leash to run around near the water biden told reporters that he has not spoken recently with centrist democratic senator joe manchin after he sank the president s 1 75 trillion build back better agenda earlier this month cases are surging and republicans claim there is no federal solution to the pandemic anything that could get people more vaccinated would be welcome dr anthony fauci says when asked by jonkarl about potential vaccine requirements for domestic air travel pic twitter com uetl9dabo7 this week thisweekabc december 27 2021 fauci said that the idea of removing masks while on an airplane is really not something we should even be considering while appearing on abc s latest edition of this week on sunday fauci added that the obligation to wear a mask while traveling by plane may never be removed and that introducing a vaccine mandate for domestic and international air travel would force non vaccinated americans to immune themselves against the coronavirus and although biden s tuesday schedule was blank his public events do not usually contain any private meetings or phone calls the president may hold during the day the white house called a lid at 10 13 am a lid means there will be no more

president joe biden on twitter monday after he said there is no federal solution to combatting covid 19 the gop s post was referencing a comment biden made in october 2020 where he promised to shut down the virus during the speech he told the governors that there was no federal solution to the omicron variant causing cases to spike around the country saying the solution was solidly on the state level his message to governors was if you need something say something we are going to have your back the president s comments came as the centers for disease control and prevention cdc cut in half isolation restrictions for americans who catch covid from 10 days to five the cdc also shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine the restriction change comes as several industries face staff shortages caused by the federal mandates and the administration s failure to provide adequate testing biden s supporters quickly rushed to his defense alleging republicans took his remarks out of context this deceptively edited clip put out by the rnc and several gop members of congress of biden today creates the false impression that biden is giving up on battling covid defense attorney ron filipkowski said this is a total lie filipkowski claimed the now viral clip of biden was a total lie and edited to suggest he is quitting on dealing with covid and just throwing it to the states echoing the rnc s sentiment texas gov greg abbott blasted biden s handling of the pandemic biden says there s no federal solution to covid and that this gets solved at a state level he should

federal mandates biden s remark came during a meeting with 25 of the nation s governors a mix of republicans and democrats where he addressed the ongoing pandemic he told the governors that there was no federal solution to the omicron variant causing cases to spike around the country saying the solution was solidly on state level cotton then argued that although there is no federal solution there

government can help by securing the border approving safe treatments tests and appointing competent leaders at the fda cdc north carolina rep madison cawthorn the youngest member of congress also chimed in on biden s handling of the virus joe biden blames the unvaccinated for covid more than he blames china said cawthorn a republican from north carolina congressional candidate buzz patterson

safely ensconced in his beach home sleep well rep tom cotton left and texas gov greg abbott right were among those who blasted biden over his handling of the pandemic both republicans accused him of implementing covid illegal mandates several conservatives took to twitter issuing their detest for biden s handling of the pandemic during monday s meeting with governors biden admitted that his administration has not done enough to ease the covid testing demand vowing to do better he acknowledged the long lines around the country as people sought to get a covid test ahead of the holidays saying clearly his administration has more work to do that s not enough clearly not enough biden said adding we have to do more we have to do better and we will the president joined his covid 19 response team s meeting with the governors for the first time ever on monday after the meeting biden told reporters the governors had thanked him for his work they didn t tell me they re worried but they thanked me for the cooperation they re getting they said they ve gotten all that they need they just want to know what we think is gonna happen from here he said adding there were no complaints a lot of cooperation he spoke with reporters on the south lawn of the white house as he and jill biden departed for rehoboth beach where the first couple will spend a few days at his family home in delaware for new year s the president also denied a report in vanity fair that his administration back in october rejected a plan for more at home covid tests that called for an estimated 732 million tests per month the plan also recommended a nationwide testing surge to prevent holiday covid surge we didn t reject it biden said biden joined the virtual meeting with the governors to discuss their needs to combat the omicron variant as cases continue to rise and testing kits remain in demand he acknowledged the testing shortage around the country in his opening remarks seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do he said during the meeting biden also admitted that his administration has not done enough to ease the covid testing demand vowing to do better he acknowledged the long lines around the country a seen above in new york city on dec 27 as people sought to get a covid test ahead of the holidays saying clearly his administration has more work to do president biden said his administration will do more to ease covid testing lines and that more testing centers were coming biden argued when he took office in january we had no zero over the counter home test in the united states none now there are more than 20 000 places to get tested for free he said he said more testing sites were coming i know the lines have gotten very long in some states that s why i ordered fema to set up pop up sites in places with high demand to shorten the wait we stood up 60 of sites in new york city in five days and there are more coming he told the governors he also said his administration worked with google so you can now search covid test near me on google to find a location biden s meeting comes as his administration faces criticism for a shortage of covid tests as americans rushed to get tested ahead of the holiday season with demand high and shelves emptying out of stock some retailers have placed limits on how many at home testing kits can be purchased at a time cvs has a limit of six test kits per purchase both in stores and online while walgreens limits it to four kits you know testing has always been an issue that has been problematic it has been compounded by the situation of the high demands biden s covid tsar dr anthony fauci told cnn we had a conflation of high demands high demands because of the concern about omicron which is a justifiable concern but the high demand that was triggered by the holiday season people getting ready to travel getting ready to go and mix with family members and friends it s been a very very strong run on testing the biden administration has announced plans to help quell this demand distributing 500 000 at home covid tests to americans in january fauci also stated he expects more tests to be available next month we ve obviously got to do better fauci said sunday on abc s this week i think things will improve greatly as we get into january but that doesn t help us today and tomorrow coronavirus cases are surging at a rate not yet seen in the near two year pandemic despite the massive surge in cases the cdc on monday cut isolation restrictions for americans who catch the coronavirus from 10 to five days and similarly shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine both hospitalizations and deaths have remained steady in recent weeks not rising at the same pace as cases covid cases in the us have exploded over the past two weeks as the newly discovered omicron strain begins to take hold in the country america is currently averaging 198 326 cases every day a 68 percent increase over the past two weeks deaths and hospitalizations have not followed though the us has not recorded a higher seven day case average since january 19 the backside of the nation s most devastating covid surge to date the country is averaging 71 302 hospitalizations every day only an eight percent increase over two weeks deaths are up three percent during that time span to 1 328 per day this could be a signal of the omicron variant which accounts for 73 percent of cases in the us according to most recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc being more mild than other strains deaths and hospitalizations do lag behind cases though and a similar spike could be seen in those metrics soon as well though despite the surge us health officials on monday cut isolation restrictions for americans who catch the coronavirus from 10 to five days and similarly shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine cdc officials said the guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop the quarantine guidance is not a mandate rather it s a recommendation to employers and state and local officials it says workers can go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don t have symptoms the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days or even fewer if there are severe staffing shortages meanwhile americans have been told by fauci to cancel big parties as the omicron variant tears across the nation daily cases have spiked in recent weeks up 68 percent over the past two weeks and america s top infectious disease expert warns that things will only worsen in the near future fauci told abc s good morning america that the surge may only be beginning and that americans should expect the situation to exacerbate over the coming weeks it s going to get worse before it gets better that s for sure he said we don t expect things are going to turn around in a few days to a week it likely will take much longer than that but that s unpredictable the omicron variant which was first discovered by south african health officials in late november is the most mutated covid strain yet it has more than 50 mutations including 37 on the spike protein targeted by the covid vaccines fauci says it s not possible to predict when the omicron variant surge will come to an end because different countries have seen varied patterns each demography of a country is different he said the omicron variant which was first discovered by south african health officials in late november is the most mutated covid strain yet it has more than 50 mutations including 37 on the spike protein targeted by the covid vaccines the u s confirmed 10 179 cases of the variant as of tuesday morning though the real case figure is likely much higher only two other countries have confirmed more cases than that of the u s research performed by vaccine manufacturers and independent health experts have repeatedly found that the initial vaccine regimens two shots of the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines or one dose of the johnson johnson vaccine are not effective at preventing infection from the variant scientists and the pharmaceutical and biotechnical companies insist however that

according to a translation of what appears to be an interview with nintendo president shuntaro furukawa the supply of nintendo switch consoles is not likely to get better in early 2022 this has largely been the case throughout 2021 as well even with the nintendo switch oled model selling well enough issues persist that make it difficult for nintendo to first make the consoles at all and then get them delivered where they need to go and it sounds like next year at least initially will be much of the same roughly translated via google translate the japanese newspaper kyoto shimbun quotes furukawa as saying that the global shortage of semiconductors and logistical turmoil continue to be problems for the company in general the supply of nintendo switch consoles could remain scarce at the start of 2022 due to the aforementioned issues which have affected all major console manufacturers like playstation and xbox among other companies this isn t likely to be surprising news for anyone that s been trying to pick up a new console of any kind during the ongoing covid 19 pandemic due to all of the disruption it s become increasingly difficult to find the high end machines on shelves especially in the united states for now it seems like that isn t close to being resolved at least for nintendo and likely not for any other company that relies on semiconductors to construct whatever it is that s being sold as for the nintendo switch consoles the base model and nintendo switch lite are currently available for 299 99 and 199 99 respectively while the improved oled model is available for 349 99 that is if you can find any of the various models in stock anywhere you can check out all of our previous coverage of the nintendo switch right here what do you think about the nintendo switch shortages likely continuing into 2022 have you already managed to grab one for yourself let us know in the comments or feel free to reach out and hit me up directly over on twitter at rollinbishop to talk about all things gaming

owned national securities law firm with offices in new york pennsylvania california and georgia according to the complaint the company made false and misleading statements to the market robinhood suffered from major issues with revenue growth at the time of the ipo with its touted transaction based revenues from cryptocurrency trading only providing a temporary boost to otherwise flat growth the company s supposed significant investments in reliability and infrastructure growth were subpar creating the opportunity for service disruptions and cybersecurity failures based on these facts the company s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the ipo period when the market learned the truth about robinhood investors suffered damages on october 26 2021 after the markets closed robinhood reported its third quarter 2021 financial results revealing that its total net revenue for the period between july 1 2021 through september 30 2021 the same period during which the company conducted its ipo came in at 365 million badly missing analyst estimates by nearly 73 million and declines in its monthly active users maus funded accounts assets under custody auc and average revenue per user arpu robinhood also disclosed that third quarter transaction based revenue from cryptocurrency trading which in the lead up to the ipo had been the bulk of the company s revenues was a measly 51 million staggeringly below the 233 million robinhood earned from crypto trading in the second quarter the proportion of robinhood s cryptocurrency transaction based revenue generated by dogecoin alone fell 40 in q3 with robinhood only generating 20 4 million in q3 compared to 144 5 million in q2 at the same time robinhood s net losses skyrocketed from 11 million to 1 32 billion due to a remarkable 1 24 billion stock based compensation expense that was tied to the stock s post ipo performance and its initial rally which boosted its shares to an all time high of 85 a share on august 4 2021 and triggered a massive payout to defendants tenev and bhatt to make matters worse robinhood also guided for less than 1 8 billion in revenue for the full year implying a maximum 85 growth which fell well short of analyst expectations of 111 analysts immediately took note with those at j p morgan for example downgrading their price target and characterizing the company s trading revenue as a disappoint noting in particular how equity trading was particularly weak down both sequentially and yoy despite a near doubling of accounts and mtus and how rypto trading revenue fell 78 down more than the crypto industry average of 40 and the decline of dogecoin trading of 75 before concluding we believe robinhood has been overearning and guidance will weaken for 22 j p morgan also questioned why management did not disclose trading volumes finding it peculiar for a company generating 75 of revenue on volumes but nonetheless suspecting revenue per trade had been elevated a weaker business outlook on this news robinhood s stock declined nearly 10 5 falling from 39 57 per share on october 26 2021 to close at 35 44 per share on october 27 2021 then on november 8 2021 after the markets closed robinhood disclosed that it had suffered a data security incident on november 3 2021 admitting that an unauthorized third party had obtained email addresses for approximately five million users and the full names of a different group of about two million users indicating that the attack potentially affected nearly 40 of robinhood s maus what is more robinhood said the additional personal information of 310 other users including their names dates of birth and zip codes were exposed and within that group that 10 users suffered even more extensive breaches on this news robinhood s stock declined further falling over 3 on november 9 2021 to close at 36 70 per share before then falling another 6 to close at 34 49 the very next day the court appointed lead

beijing dec 28 beijing has tightened the rules on overseas listings by chinese firms in a series of new regulations that increase scrutiny of companies seeking to raise funds on foreign stock markets china has stepped up scrutiny of major overseas listings after a controversial new york ipo by ride hailing giant didi chuxing went ahead this year despite regulatory concerns at home in the latest measure to increase oversight authorities said monday that companies in industries where foreign investment is banned due to a negative list will have to seek approval from authorities for an overseas debut overseas investors total ownership will be capped at 30 per cent while a single investor should hold no more than 10 per cent according to the updated list of restrictions on foreign ownership taking effect from january advertisement foreign investors are also not allowed to participate in the operations and management of the company a joint statement by the commerce ministry and national development and reform commission said it came days after authorities proposed that companies seeking foreign ipos would need to register with the securities regulator the listing will be blocked if it could be considered to constitute a threat to national security advertisement some of china s biggest firms have listed on us stock markets in search of more developed markets and fresh lines of cash from a massive investor base but enthusiasm has wavered amid soaring tensions between beijing and washington beijing has also launched a wide ranging regulatory crackdown over the last year to curb runaway growth in china s powerful internet sector and rein in the influence of big businesses in the wake of didi s new york listing authorities shocked investors by launching investigations into the company over cybersecurity before they ordered it be removed from app stores and extended probes into other us listed chinese companies didi said this month it would delist from the new york stock exchange shortly after us regulators adopted a rule that would allow them to remove foreign firms china s government has been encouraging companies to list on domestic exchanges instead to protect information and data heading overseas and develop the country s capital markets the latest regulatory moves stop short of a ban on offshore structures known as variable interest entities vie structures which allowed tech giants like alibaba and tencent to avoid restrictions on foreign investment and listings abroad in recent decades but the restrictions will make vie structures less attractive as well as making foreign listings less appealing for chinese founders and investors university of hong kong law professor angela zhang told afp the rule will not affect companies already listed overseas regulators also earlier suggested that companies with at least a million users undergo a cybersecurity review before going public abroad afp

ten women share the regrets they have about how they handled money so we can learn from their mistakes i thought investing was for rich people it never occurred to me that it was something i could and should be doing it was totally off the table and anyway wasn t it so complicated it wasn t until i was in my mid 30s that i realized i was wrong i ve always been very into personal finance but honestly when i was younger it stemmed from anxiety born from concern about money i nagged my husband for years telling him that we should budget but he s not the budgeting type i finally wore him down or maybe just convinced him that it was his idea and we started budgeting a few years ago so there i was reading all these personal finance books and they all talked about investing and preparing for retirement i read that and freaked out ohmigosh retirement i have no money how am i supposed to save up investing how can i pick stocks it s so risky but then i started paying attention to what i was reading and hearing in podcasts and i realized that index funds and efts are the safe easier way to invest we started slowly and worked from there i sometimes think about how much better off we d be if we d started saving and investing earlier my parents never taught me this because they didn t know it themselves but i want to keep my kids from getting deeper into this hole today i actually deposited 270 of my kids money they re investing in an eft and the other night i sat down with my 11 year old to talk about the stock market and compounding interest we took out a calculator and figured it out if he wants to have an investment goal of 10k by the time he s 20 how much does he need to put away now what does he need to do with it we talked about how many years i have to save for retirement and i showed him the difference between what i d have if i started saving now and how much i d have had if i d started saving when i was young lesson learned investment is for everyone and compound interest is a beautiful thing half a year after i got married we were living in israel and i still hadn t found a job my father in law offered to hire me to work remotely in his company i was so relieved to find employment i immediately agreed without thinking it through it was a tough beginning but i kept telling myself that all beginnings are hard after some time though it became clear though that this wasn t about beginnings i hated the work and the hours i was supposed to do a certain number of hours per week but because i hated it so much i often ended up working less i d then be consumed with guilt over taking advantage of my father in law it made me miserable at the same time we needed the money so i felt trapped once our first child was born i resigned it was the easiest and least awkward way out lesson learned think things through before you accept a job offer think again if it s being offered by family and utilize maternity leave to peacefully transition out of a job you aren t happy at ilana after living in rentals for close to a decade we were thrilled to buy a home of our own it needed some work and personalization like most homes do we were so eager to get everything fixed up we did everything we wanted to do all at once we painted installed new outlets added kitchen cabinets it was a big mistake and for more reasons than one because we did everything at once instead of one thing at a time which would have been affordable we ended up house poor and in serious debt now that we ve lived in our house for longer and our family has grown we realize that had we waited longer we would have had the experience living in the home to make changes that were more practical and would serve the family better yes we had our house but we struggled to afford everything else we finally climbed our way out of those debts a few years later but knowing what i know now i would have done things very differently back then lesson learned when building renovating or designing a home take everything one step at a time don t rush it tziporah when i got married i knew that the financial burden would be on my shoulders neither my parents nor my chassan s parents were providing any financial support and our plan was that my husband would be in kollel for a minimum of two years i didn t think much about what that would mean i signed up to be the breadwinner and knew we d live frugally but i never considered the emotional impact it would have needless to say shanah rishonah with a husband in kollel and zero support brings challenges that first year also brought our first baby i was working hard and on top of that always trying to figure out how to balance our accounts i was stressed and resentful after two years my husband got a side gig tutoring and he took responsibility for deciding what to do with that income that s when i realized the mistake i d been making i was taking sole financial responsibility for our family but being the only breadwinner didn t necessarily mean i had to be the cfo i felt very grateful that we were able to stay in learning and i didn t regret working or not having two incomes but it was unhealthy that our finances were my domain only my husband would help me with laundry but he wouldn t be stressed about it because it wasn t his job that was the mindset i needed to have when it came to money we slowly shifted our approach i started to tell my husband i needed him to figure out things like how we could afford plane tickets to visit our parents for pesach or how we d pay our taxes he rose to the occasion and took over my husband is still in kollel and i still work full time we still live on a tight budget the difference is that now i have more simchah and less stress i go to work and yes i m the breadwinner but my husband is the one who makes sure we can afford everything we need throughout the year lesson learned you can support a husband in kollel and have him take financial responsibility for your family it isn t a contradiction faiga our family is one of those families who financially fit smack dab in the middle we re not wealthy but we aren t poor we do well enough that we don t qualify for tuition discounts but we struggle to pay all of it while i was happy that we could in fact make it i look back and realize i had a sense of entitlement when it came to paying full tuition when i d call the school s office and ask to speak with a principal or teacher i always had the fact that we paid full tuition in the back of my mind as if they owed me returning my call promptly more than they owed it to other parents i also never gave teacher appreciation gifts my gift is paying full tuition i don t have to do more than that then my husband was asked to help the hanhalah of one of our children s schools with fundraising once he was privy to the school s finances he realized that no they weren t pocketing money no one was becoming wealthy from running a mossad and we weren t paying for someone else s child even more important was the realization that the schools couldn t pay the teachers more after that i started buying the teacher appreciation gifts for rosh hashanah and purim and i saw how much it meant to them while i feel that all of my children got the same education teachers are human and with my younger children who had a mother who bought teacher appreciation gifts the lines of communication between us and the teachers were warmer and friendlier and my children benefited from that lesson learned show your children s teachers that they re valued it s the right thing to do and your children will benefit tehillah i grew up in an affluent family and we lived comfortably i knew that when i got married my life wouldn t be as comfortable but my standards were a bit unrealistic the first year we were married we rented a gorgeous apartment in an upscale neighborhood because i grew up in a beautiful and spacious home i naturally assumed that that was what both i and my husband needed we had three big bedrooms and a beautiful porch i invested time money and energy into making it stunning after a year we downgraded to a nice but not as elegant two bedroom apartment in a less expensive neighborhood and guess what we were just as happy if not more with the money we were saving on rent we were able to enjoy more nights out and trips we felt more financially secure i had been far too focused on giving us a luxury shanah rishonah experience and to this day i regret the money we wasted lesson learned it s better to start small you might need less than you think dini when i became a graphic designer i was so eager to make a name for myself i took on every client i could gave the lowest possible price and did whatever i could to make the client happy even at the expense of my time and health once i built up my business i didn t take a client if i didn t have time but i was still struggling to balance my responsibilities at home with my career i was burning myself out fast i started to see my time as more valuable than my going project rate or hourly rate i made a bold move and began charging almost double what i d been charging previously i knew i would upset some of my clients and that i d lose a lot of them and initially i did i gave my long term clients a discounted rate but for everyone else i stood firm with my new prices interestingly enough i started to attract bigger clients once they saw my price they assumed i was worth it pretty soon i was working fewer hours but earning even more than i had before lesson learned charge more work less ruchy i ve always been the frugal type i was terrified of ending up in debt like i knew so many young couples do but i also wanted to have fun and enjoy shanah rishonah i therefore decided to spend less money on furniture and more on experiences i bought the cheapest of everything couch beds refrigerator oven sheitels if it was cheap i d buy it with the money i saved we did go on plenty of trips and ate out at fancy restaurants but after five years of marriage i d already had to buy a new oven and a new couch had our beds fixed twice fixed the refrigerator once neither of my linen sets lasted more than two years after two years of marriage we didn t have money for extras because we were always replacing or fixing something major finally when it came time to replace things the third time around i decided we were going to invest in quality items did it cost more money yes but ten years later all of the quality items have lasted and because we aren t spending our money replacing things we do have money to spend on extras lesson learned sometimes it s expensive to be cheap penina we were in our mid fifties when we inherited a nice sum of money after my mother in law s petirah the amount was close to two years salary for years we d dreamed of moving from our very out of town city to the tristate area but it had always seemed financially impossible we d tried to make the move before but were always stuck between the need to be on site to job hunt and to be back home in our current jobs bringing in an income employers were reluctant to consider my husband and me for jobs if it meant we first had to tie up loose ends in our hometown but we couldn t move first and then job hunt because we couldn t swing the higher rent and cost of living if we didn t have a steady income from the get go and what if it took a while to find employment with this yerushah the move was now possible relying on our large financial cushion we were very relaxed about the move perhaps too relaxed we took our time settling our kids into schools and ourselves into our new community and put job hunting on the back burner my husband joined a morning and night kollel and was home in the afternoons and evenings to help me with the supper homework bath routine we acted like we were on vacation regularly enjoying the numerous kosher restaurants new york had to offer back where we came from there was only a pizza store we indulged our daughters in fashionable new clothing from frum stores what a pleasure it was not to have to search a department store high and low for something tzniyus it was a blissful time it was almost a year after our move before we took job hunting seriously and another half a year before we found excellent employment meanwhile we d used up almost all of the yerushah we weren t in debt but things were tight once we started working again we regretted that we d spent the money freely instead of carefully budgeting it speaking to a financial planner and investing it so it could grow and looking for jobs sooner so that we didn t use it for day to day living for so long that money could have provided a cushion for a far longer amount of time had we used it wisely lesson learned if you receive a significant sum of money create a clear plan of what you want to do with it and how you can make it grow so that you don t end up squandering it daniella my husband and i never really had ideals or a system when it came to spending money sometimes we were more easy going about money and sometimes less so we tried to be responsible and for the most part we were but every time we did spend a significant amount of money i always suffered intense feelings of regret and doubt still it was working one of my children needed extra help with reading and we tried a bunch of tutors but nothing was panning out finally we found someone who really clicked with my child and his reading improved dramatically of course this tutor s rates were sky high i was eating myself up with doubt about whether we were being careless or not so we went to speak with our rav he told us one line that has forever since changed our perspective on spending money if you need it consider yourselves rich but if you want it consider yourselves poor following this motto we re frugal with wants and thus we always have money or close enough to it to cover our needs and i feel confident about our spending habits lesson learned hashem always gives you what you need but it s up to you to decide how you spend the money if you need it consider yourselves rich but if you want it consider yourselves poor originally featured in family first issue 774
sales of electric vehicles evs have been skyrocketing and forecasts predict that sales will exponentially grow over the next decade as a result ev stocks such as nio nio and this story originally appeared on stocknews sales of electric vehicles evs have been skyrocketing and forecasts predict that sales will exponentially grow over the next decade as a result ev stocks such as nio nio and tesla tsla have been soaring legacy car manufacturers such as general motors gm and ford f are also getting in on the action and now tech companies like rivian rivn and baidu bidu are joining the fray after being one of the best performers in 2020 the electric vehicle ev industry added to these gains in 2021 although there was considerably more volatility in 2021 the kraneshares electric vehicle and mobility etf kars was up 22 which is slightly below the s p 500 s ytd gain of 25 in comparison kars had an 80 gain in 2020 vs the s p 500 s gain of 16 however 2022 does bring with it some ev industry headwinds a major challenge will be the fed s hawkish pivot and the increase in short term rates which leads to outflows in growth stocks another challenge for the industry is supply chain issues with shortages of key components leading to production below capacity many companies will also have to reconfigure their production and assembly to account for increased evs as well as develop new supply chains of course it s also possible that some new ev releases will fail to connect with the public and generate sufficient demand still there are many reasons for the industry s outperformance and reasons to be bullish on its longer term outlook the major factor is that ev sales are expected to sharply increase over the next decade and eventually overtake gas powered cars as the dominant form of transportation this continues a trend that started last decade according to the iea there were less than 100 000 evs on the road around the world in 2010 in 2021 there were over 11 million evs on the road by 2030 it s expected that there will be close to 100 million a new industry this type of growth means there will be tremendous opportunities for companies in the ev market which is why we ve seen ev leaders like tesla tsla and nio nio soar these two companies are currently the leading ev companies have a devoted and loyal following and have already demonstrated the ability to produce and deliver thousands of cars every week another development is that many legacy auto companies are positioning themselves for this new reality with the most notable examples being general motors gm and ford f who are investing heavily in ev production capacity and are unveiling an entirely new lineup over the next couple of years even tech companies are getting in on the game as apple aapl is reportedly looking to launch its autonomous ev in the coming years baidu bidu has partnered with geely gelyy to do the same in addition to legacy car companies and deep pocketed tech companies several startups are attempting to compete as well such as rivian rivn lucid motors lcid lordstown motors ride fisker fsr and nikola nkla many of these company s stock prices are quite high despite these companies having no revenue and no immediate path to profitability for the most part these companies are still mainly in the prototype phase while a handful is spending to build their production facilities or partnering with other companies for manufacturing this will certainly be challenging in an environment with inflation and supply chain constraints how they handle this expensive and complicated task will ultimately determine the fate of these companies accelerating ev adoption according to bloomberg 5 6 million evs were sold in 2020 and it projects that 30 million will be sold in 2030 the major impetus behind this growth is the falling cost and improving the performance of these cars other factors driving demand are rising gas prices and the improving performance of evs already many evs are faster and more efficient than cars with internal combustion engines ice additionally ev ranges are continually improving currently most evs have a 200 mile range which is enough for 80 of households however there remain some challenges such as a limited number of charging stations cold weather adversely impacting battery performance and the amount of time it takes to charge ev batteries however like any new technology these challenges are steadily being overcome the next generation of evs is expected to have 400 mile ranges charging stations are being rapidly built to meet this demand additionally battery technology is being improved to increase charging times due to these improvements evs are expected to reach a crossover point within the next 5 years at which point they will be cheaper with more power and range than gas powered vehicles additionally as production increases costs will further decline on a per unit basis due to economies of scale and network effects evs will eventually be cheaper to produce than gas powered vehicles with the most expensive component being batteries battery costs are also declining at a precipitous rate and they will retain some residual value even after the car stops working government support one of the reasons that the ev stocks added to their gains in the early parts of 2021 was democrats winning control of the presidency house of representatives and the senate this raised hopes that president biden would be able to pass the measures that he had campaigned upon like an expansion of the public charging network increased subsidies for ev purchases and tax credits for r d however this has proven to be more difficult than anticipated given the tight margins in congress which give inordinate power to more fiscally conservative members thus there was some money allocated for evs in the infrastructure bill 7 5 billion is allocated for ev charging infrastructure with another 5 billion allocated for the purchase of low and no emission buses another 65 billion is allocated towards clean energy generation the bill also includes 110 billion to upgrade roads bridges and other infrastructure which benefits all types of vehicles while the fate of the build back better bill remains uncertain it s even more generous in terms of ev policy most notably the bill includes an increase in the tax credit to 12 500 from 7 500 the subsidies are more generous for companies manufacturing in the us and with a union workforce there was some hope that the bill would be passed along with the infrastructure bill these hopes have faded as senator joe manchin remains opposed due to his concerns about inflation there remains the possibility that a smaller version of the bbb bill could be passed in 2022 as negotiations in the senate continue according to morgan stanley the passage of the bbb bill would likely result in an additional 7 million evs on the road by 2030 chinese market currently china is the largest market for evs in the world in large part this is a reflection of government policy which is looking to reduce emissions to improve the environment as a result the chinese government has offered a variety of incentives including rebates tax credits and quicker approval times for vehicle registration on the supply side the chinese government has directly invested in several ev companies and made low interest loans to others also the government sees having domestic ev makers as being important for strategic reasons including employment it s also created standards for the manufacturing and production of batteries that ensure they are swappable between different cars this reduces any wasted investment if a company goes under the government is also investing significant sums in charging infrastructure these efforts have yielded some success nio nio xpeng xpev and li auto li sales are growing and the companies have already attained multibillion dollar valuations they are even expected to start selling cars in foreign markets in the coming years their stocks are listed on us exchanges and have skyrocketed over the last year while these are the early leaders there are close to 500 ev startups in china that are still in the product development phase adjacent opportunities for people who want to invest in the ev industry the most straightforward way to participate in the industry s growth is through buying stocks of companies making and selling evs however a risk is that as the market matures the competition will intensify and some ev companies won t survive to avoid this risk investors may choose to diversify with a broad ev etf like kraneshares electric vehicle and mobility etf kars or the global x autonomous and electric vehicle etf driv another option is to invest in companies that are helping to develop the requisite infrastructure for evs such as the charging station stocks similar to gas stations today evs will require a distributed network of charging stations this will require a significant upfront investment but it would pay dividends in the future as more evs are on the road however a lack of charging infrastructure would stymie the industry s growth some of the companies developing the technology for charging infrastructure are blink charging blnk and beam global beem an additional adjacent opportunity is to invest in companies focused on battery technology batteries are the heaviest and most expensive parts of evs some ev makers are choosing to build their batteries such as tesla tsla while others are outsourcing to companies like quantumscape qs while there s less certainty about which ev company will emerge as the winner demand for better batteries will certainly increase as the ev market grows investing in battery companies presents the same type of challenges as investing in evs however investors can be confident that the commodities used as inputs to manufacture batteries such as lithium nickel and cobalt will see increased demand regardless of which battery company performs the best some of the leading companies that mine these metals are albemarle alb fmc fmc rio tinto rio and vale vale 5 electric vehicle stocks to watch general motors gm last year gm announced that it was accelerating its ev plan timeframe it will launch 30 new ev models by 2025 and invest 7 billion in ev and autonomous technology within the ev industry gm is almost like a value stock with its forward p e of 8 3 and the car is expected to sell close to 3 million vehicles in 2021 with around 100 000 being evs one reason for gm s recent underperformance has been supply chain issues which have constrained production to about 65 of full capacity however the company believes that the worst of the crisis is over and production should return to full capacity sometime by the end of 2022 gm is rated a c by the powr ratings which equates to a neutral rating it s not surprising that gm has a b for value given its low p s and p e ratio especially compared to other ev stocks it also has a b for value which is consistent with its low ps ratio of 0 7 and forward p e analysts are also bullish on the stock as it has a consensus price target of 74 with the highest estimate being 90 additionally 11 out of 13 analysts have a buy rating on the stock ford f f is making big waves in the ev industry with the mustang mach e and electric f 150 garnering rave reviews and strong presales f would also be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the bbb bill being passed given its unionized workforce and production in the us the company s last earnings report showed that it s doing well despite some of the challenges on the supply side which is preventing its factories from running at full capacity in q3 ford topped earnings and revenue expectations by a significant margin the company also raised its guidance for the second time it also holds a meaningful stake in rivian rivn and has benefitted from its recent gains as well f is well positioned as its legacy business is a cash cow which it s using to build its ev segment this puts it in a better position especially as many ev startups are dependent on funding growth through debt or issuing equity which erodes eps given its attractive valuation including a low forward pe of 10 5 it s not surprising that ford has a b for value ford also has an a for sentiment and a b for quality these factors are reflected in wall street s assessment of the stock as 11 out of 15 analysts covering it has a buy rating for 2022 they also are forecasting earnings growth of 35 with a strong economy and increased production tsla tsla tsla is currently the market leader in evs last year 2 8 million evs were sold of this tsla sold 700 000 and it s expecting to sell 40 more in 2022 another milestone for tesla in 2021 was its new production facilities in texas germany and china continuing to scale production it s a notable accomplishment as tsla struggled with this task for many years even causing a 40 decline in the stock price at one point and it s expected to be the major challenge for the slew of competitors emerging while many argue that tsla is overvalued given its more than 1 trillion market cap it is the clear leader in evs by a wide margin further it has a dominant lead in autonomous driving given that its vehicles are already generating data and helping its neural network improve given its resources and ceo elon musk s past successes they can t be counted out baidu bidu similar to aapl bidu is another tech company that is looking to move into the ev industry bidu s primary business is internet search and online marketing solutions in china bidu has been using the proceeds from its search business to invest in other high growth areas like cloud computing ai and autonomous vehicles av while there was speculation that bidu would license its self driving software to other original equipment manufacturers oems bidu instead is embarking on building its vehicles through a partnership with geely gelyy a chinese multinational automotive company the joint venture will use bidu s autonomous driving software and design with geely s ev modular platform it reduces the upfront cost of production for bidu which has no experience in manufacturing for geely it will see increased volumes while bidu will contribute capital for scaling production in pilot tests bidu s self driving vehicles had shown success in making trips without incidents and navigating road hazards investors were enthusiastic about this move by baidu to take the next step in the commercialization of its av technology as shares climbed 35 in less than a month following the announcement since then shares have given up all these gains and more the primary reason is the chinese government s crackdown on tech companies due to concerns about market power and user privacy while this remains a risk it also could be an opportunity to pick up shares at a discount especially as bidu s core business remains profitable and it offers exposure to a variety of growth categories including evs the powr ratings rate bidu a c which equates to a neutral rating the company has a b for value which is consistent with its very low p e in total the powr ratings system rates bidu on 8 different levels beyond what we stated above we also have given bidu grades for stability sentiment growth value and industry get all the bidu ratings here nio nio nio is one of the best performing stocks in the market and among evs since this bull market started in march 2020 over this period the s p 500 is up 116 while nio is up more than 1 300 however the stock is down by more than 50 from its highs in february 2021 there are a couple of drivers of this massive volatility during the upswing the company s shares were bid up as many saw it as the china of tesla given that both companies products were popular due to their design and had visionary and charismatic ceos at the helm therefore many investors believe that the company will have a similar trajectory to tsla however this bullish euphoria has been interrupted for most of 2021 a major factor is certainly the move higher in short term rates which leads to outflows in high multiple growth stocks like tsla another factor is the aforementioned crackdown on chinese businesses which has cooled sentiment among investors and led to a re risking of all chinese stocks these are salient risks that investors need to consider however the company is doing an exceptional job in terms of operations it s consistently increased production and is set to unveil new models in the coming years in a variety of categories and at different price ranges it s also likely that the chinese government will continue to provide additional support for domestic ev companies like nio tsla shares fell 1 97 0 18 in after hours trading tuesday year to date tsla has gained 54 25 versus a 29 25 rise in the benchmark s p 500 index during the same period tesla tsla and ford f are a part of the entrepreneur index which tracks some of the largest publicly traded companies founded and run by entrepreneurs

beijing dec 28 reuters china s kintor faced a temporary setback as interim analysis for a late stage trial for its potential covid 19 pill did not yield sufficient data due to the lack of hospitalised cases sending its shares crashing as much as 85 on tuesday morning in a trial designed to study how well kintor pharmaceutical inc s proxalutamide tablet could cut hospitalisation for outpatients which had recruited more than 300 people less than 10 people with initially mild or moderate illness were hospitalised by the time of interim analysis kintor chairman tong youzhi said on a call with investors on tuesday the potential reason for the lack of hospitalisation so far in the trial included the expansion of vaccination drive in the united states and the relatively young age of participants which averaged 38 years tong said this is not yet a failure of the drug but a reading that cannot draw a statistically significant conclusion for now leaving the company unable to deliver a result on the drug s efficacy in reducing hospitalisation a kintor spokesperson said late on monday kintor s stock plunged to as low as hk 6 91 on tuesday morning the lowest since the company listed its shares in may 2020 one of the issues caused by the unsatisfactory interim analysis could be the delay in the company s business plan tong said but added that kintor will continue to push forward the existing trials kintor said in a filing on monday that it will seek consent from authorities including the u s food and drug administration to amend clinical protocol and continue to enroll patients of higher risk such as those who have not received a covid 19 vaccination the company is also testing proxalutamide in already hospitalised covid patients and developing other potential treatments for diseases including cancers and hair loss reporting by roxanne liu and ryan woo additional reporting by donny kwok editing by kirsten donovan louise heavens and michael perry

tantalizing prototypes of electric freight trains ships aircraft and an array of electric automobiles promising benchmarks in renewable energy generation battery storage and battery powered transportation advertisement advertisement but while electric modes of transportation benefit from falling wind and solar costs to become more than niche luxury goods they will need mature supply chains long term investment and their own government support progress we re building constituencies in the clean energy space that are a long way from being as politically powerful as the dirty energy space but they re a lot more powerful than they were 10 years ago rep sean casten d ill told equilibrium casten pointed to one key fact according to a bloomberg analysis about 46 percent of the world s population now lives in countries where it is more profitable to build new solar or wind infrastructure than run existing natural gas or coal power plants is the united states one of those countries no in the u s where oil and gas are heavily subsidized existing gas power plants are the cheapest generation option advertisement advertisement but even here things are changing two thirds of next year s new electricity generation capacity is expected to be either large scale solar or energy storage according to pv magazine twenty percent of u s electric power currently comes from wind water and solar power and more than 180 u s cities have passed policies requiring all renewable electricity according to a stanford study a diminishing danger of power failure a common fear around renewable power is that it doesn t work when rivers are low skies are cloudy or winds aren t blowing leading to power failures in an all renewable economy unless long term battery storage can be developed but the stanford study found these fears might be overblown a series of short term batteries linked together and constantly cycling electricity between them providing long term battery power on existing technology or releasing their full charge simultaneously to meet sudden short term heavy peaks in demand advertisement advertisement there are knock on economic benefits too building and operating the renewable energy grid could offer 4 7 million permanent jobs and save 53 200 lives a year from reduced health care costs with about 700 billion in savings researchers found 2021 sees a fleet of new tech the plummeting costs of low carbon electricity and rise in electric storage potential are a boon for a transportation system that may soon depend on renewables for fuel either in the form of high capacity batteries or zero carbon fuels like green hydrogen generated using solar or wind energy here s a look at the surge in new technologies we saw this year advertisement advertisement battery powered ships leave port 2021 saw key innovations in transportation sectors seen as the most difficult to decarbonize airline ocean borne shipping and freight trains which all rely on the high density energy of fossil fuels but while zero carbon airliners and long haul container ships are still years away battery technology is now far enough along to power small aircraft and smaller cargo carrying vessels with fixed short haul routes for example a new 100 percent battery powered ship called the asahi will now carry fuel to container ships in tokyo bay ship bunker magazine reported and a battery powered autonomous container ship now plies norways fjords delivering fertilizer electrek reported the global ferry trade group interferry also announced in october that it was embarking on a global

month rolls royce s spirit of innovation a one seat plane broke the record for the world s fastest zero carbon aircraft holding a speed of 345 miles per hour for nearly two miles there s not much commercial use for that sort of plane that s why rolls royce is hoping to bring an electric powered four passenger air taxi capable of 120 mile flights with vertical takeoff and landing to urban markets by 2024 and in collaboration with the scandinavian regional carrier widerøe rolls royce hopes to bring an even larger plane an 11 seater suitable for short hops between communities along the forbidding north and west coasts of norway to market by 2026 according to a joint statement united airlines wants to do the same thing the carrier announced in july that it was buying a hundred es 19s

from pittsburgh pa to conneaut ohio cleantechnica reported if the cost of carbon and the public health cost of air pollution is factored in or if rail companies can take advantage of wholesale electricity battery electric trains may soon be the same cost as current diesel electric models according to a study published last month in nature energy electric vehicles offer cautionary tale while

ford mustang mach e volkswagen id 4 and that s about it with slim options for those seeking an ev not made by tesla a company that has its own problems with the national transportation safety board according to an official statement and many of the most hyped ev companies this year like lordstown rivian and nikola are alleged to have been far further away from production than they led the public to believe as we reported earlier this month a looming question of infrastructure though they re a good start better gadgets and lower cost renewable energy aren t enough to decarbonize an economy built around fossil fuels particularly not when those fuels remain so heavily subsidized rep sean casten d ill told equilibrium what s needed is an incredible scaling up of capacity and electricity transportation casten said advertisement advertisement putting things in perspective the amount of energy we use to run our transportation is roughly the same as all the energy we use for power generation casten told equilibrium well if we re going to replace all of the fueling stations in the country with charging stations the implication is that you re adding a load that is in some way comparable to the total current electric load of the united states that you re stringing out along our nation s highways and those those sites do not currently have a bunch of generation tied into them that s one reason why the apparent failure earlier this month of the biden administration s build back better plan with its electric vehicle tax credits and particularly its funding for a nationwide network of charging stations led to a gut punch to ev stocks as tech analyst dan ives told cnn takeaway for the u s to reach the next stage of electrification requires a guiding hand that energy markets can t really provide on their own casten maintained that includes a regulatory streamlining and national support for electric infrastructure aimed at helping consumers and carriers alike feel comfortable betting on batteries over fossil fuels tuesday tech two tech trends to watch in 2022 china pushes self reliance in tech frightening trading partners frustrated by china s reliance on semiconductors from risky trading partners like japan taiwan and the united states beijing is pushing domestic companies like e commerce giant alibaba cell giant xiaomi and gaming and social media company tencent to build locally made semiconductors according to the associated press though chinese firms are as much as a decade behind rivals like taiwan in semiconductor technology

augusta this month speaker ryan fecteau and sen craig hickman chaired the final meeting of the commission to increase housing opportunities in maine by studying zoning and land use restrictions the commission began meeting in august covering maine s current approach to zoning municipal issues involving zoning the historical role of race and racism in zoning policies and how land use and zoning laws affect housing in maine among other topics in their final report released today the commission recognized the immediate need to increase housing opportunities in maine and the need to plan for increased housing opportunities in the future they published nine recommendations to help municipalities produce more affordable housing because we had experts from real estate agricultural and the environment civil rights groups municipality management the builder and developer communities and legislators on both sides of the aisle come together to work on this report we feel these recommendations will actually help move maine communities to a place where they can better meet the housing needs of our citizens said speaker ryan fecteau we know mainers are facing an affordable housing crisis in too many municipalities a web of various zoning and land use ordinances and state laws some decades old are preventing sensible affordable housing projects big and small from coming to fruition our commission was thoughtful about how maine can grow the supply of housing through new construction and how we can incentivize the revitalization of buildings and housing stock that already exists across maine i was honored to co chair this emergency commission where members and staff alike went above and beyond to get it done every commissioner agreed that access to safe affordable housing is a fundamental human right this belief guided our work as we deliberated the bold recommendations compiled in this report said sen hickman who also serves as senate chair of the legislature s labor and housing committee maine is facing an affordable housing crisis every week i hear from people in my community who are directly impacted by it while i know there is much work ahead of us the commission s recommendations represent a firm step in the right direction to ensure that all mainers have a roof over their heads and a safe place to call home governor mills recognizes the urgent need to address the availability of affordable housing for maine people as a member of this commission i m proud that we were able to deliver significant consensus recommendations that have the potential to expand housing opportunities in maine said hannah pingree director of the governor s office of policy innovation and the future and commission member i am grateful for the leadership of speaker fecteau who initiated and led the work of this commission so ably with co chair senator hickman the positive engagement by maine s cities and towns in the commission s work was welcome and i look forward to their continued partnership to address this crucial issue housing issues are no longer simply a big city issue municipal officials in urban suburban and rural areas alike have witnessed significant increases in both the number and value of home sales which in turn have or will place additional property tax burdens on lifelong homeowners and impact the availability of affordable and workforce housing in our communities said commissioner kate dufour director of maine municipal association for municipalities to be able to implement our recommendations we need to honor maine s spirit of local control while providing towns and cities the resources and incentives to develop the ordinances necessary to facilitate the construction of affordable housing in our communities a state municipal private sector collaboration is key to these efforts working on the commission to increase housing opportunities in maine studying zoning and land use restrictions was a revealing process while doing this work it became apparent the need for urgency and action said commissioner anthony jackson the brutal reality is that people in what is now known as maine are unable to affordably keep roofs over their heads what needs to be stressed also is the severe impact this has on communities of color specifically black mainers it is important to recognize the inequality that shapes this environment and center this problem when proposing solutions it is my belief that these recommendations alone will not fix the current housing crisis we are in but with intentional implementation of anti exclusionary zoning policy we can take steps to make sure housing is treated as a human right in maine according to the maine affordable housing coalition 1 in 5 maine renters pay more than half their income toward housing costs and for every family living in an affordable federally subsidized unit nearly three families are on a waiting list fecteau s bill to establish the commission ld 609 resolve to establish a commission to increase housing opportunities in maine by studying zoning and land use restrictions was passed into law this year as an effort to tackle systemic issues holding maine back from building and renovating more affordable housing

this article is part of the bond buyer s multi platform series on the future of infrastructure build what better in this four part series the bond buyer looks at the changes this infrastructure moment could bring to landscapes and markets across the nation it includes four longform feature stories running every other tuesday for the remainder of 2021 beginning november 16th and concluding december 28th a four episode companion podcast series beginning november 30th and a live video december 28th on our leaders channel all hosted by the author as 2021 draws to a close the martha s vineyard land bank can take pride in what it has accomplished over the past two years even as a real estate rush pushed average home prices beyond 1 6 million on the vineyard an 88 square mile island that sits south of cape cod the organization kept up a 35 year long fight against overdevelopment it paid 15 1 million to purchase a majority interest in a 304 acre oceanfront property from caroline kennedy and her husband edwin schlossberg the biggest acquisition in its history it created or enlarged a variety of other preserves and has now conserved 3 882 acres or 7 of the vineyard its goat program still has free manure available for pickup the land bank which projected revenues of 10 9 million in 2021 is funded partly by a 2 transfer fee paid by anyone who purchases property on the island in 2021 first time homebuyers could exempt the first 595 000 they paid from that tax but it also got a 35 million shot in the arm by selling bonds rated aa and with a range of maturities and coupons in 2014 the land bank which has since refinanced but still pays about 4 5 million a year of debt service marketed those instruments as municipal green bonds municipal of course means the bonds were issued by a local authority and pay interest that s exempt from federal taxes and in this case also from massachusetts state taxes and green means well wait just what does green mean houses on the waterfront on martha s vineyard in oak bluffs bloomberg news at a time when it s easy to see why investors are increasingly interested in portfolios that reward sustainability and why the issuers trying to lure them the advisors managing their money and the companies selling them information are too it can be surprisingly difficult to quantify what they re all trying to chase for example the martha s vineyard land bank aims to preserve properties unique for their aesthetic agricultural wildlife and passive recreational features the debt it has incurred has indeed helped local environmental preservation but as the climate bonds initiative cbi a leading evaluator of green debt points out t has minimal climate benefits moreover a thornburg investment management analysis last year stated we believe part of the purpose of this issue may be to preserve the ocean views and land values for owners of some adjacent properties do bonds that benefit the beach houses of centimillionaires and don t reduce carbon emissions deserve a green tag ask questions like that in the world of environmental social and governance esg investing and you will find a lot of guidance but very few binding answers particularly when it comes to municipal debt issuers face few disclosure requirements or standardized evaluations of their products and there s more at stake in their reporting than semantics to fight the massive threat of climate change effectively the united states needs robust efficient municipal markets that connect investors who have esg goals with projects that are developing genuine advances in clean energy sustainability and resiliency not just attractive sales campaigns they re not here yet and in this final installment of our series on the future of infrastructure we will look at just what s holding them back green investing broadly defined is the flow of capital toward instruments issued specifically for environmental and climate related projects it s been surging since the risks of climate change became broadly clear in the 2000s and particularly since the 2015 paris climate accords called for nations around the world to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally 354 billion of green labeled bonds mostly corporate were issued in the first three quarters of 2021 up from less than 50 billion in 2015 and more than in all of 2020 this year has also seen record levels of equity issuance and merger activity by companies expressing a commitment to sustainability the municipal bond s essential purpose is to fund public projects but green debt hasn t taken off in the muni market as quickly as in european or corporate markets municipal green bond issuance in the u s grew from almost nothing a decade ago to 16 3 billion in 2020 and now accounts for about a quarter of all of the country s green debt but that s still just 3 of all muni issuance as a july report by morningstar put it this growth is impressive but represents merely a drop in the bucket green munis growing but still a tiny part of a niche market interest is there in an october arizent bond buyer survey 56 of respondents said esg is critical or very important to the municipal industry moreover 77 of respondents said there should be universal esg standards for municipal bonds but with no universal language agreed upon by the entire industry it s often difficult to tell which offerings are really green case in point the martha s vineyard land bank bonds the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb which is currently seeking comments about esg disclosure says green debt should fund projects with material positive net benefits for the environment but issuers themselves can label their bonds green and it s typically up to them how to construe those guidelines and what to disclose about their products there are always the anti fraud provisions of rule 10b 5 from the securities exchange act of 1934 so the baseline that you always need to be truthful is always in the background says jennifer brooks associate at the law firm of ballard spahr who recently co authored a white paper on esg disclosure in municipal offerings but at this point there s no regulatory regime regarding this that means investors have to be concerned about greenwashing where issuers affix green labels to offerings that don t actually produce substantial environmental benefits this has already become a serious problem in places where trading volume is higher than for munis in 2018 bnp paribas told the wall street journal that 45 of bonds calling themselves green in emerging markets and 22 from developed economies would fail to meet inclusion standards for the green funds it managed the cbi has excluded hundreds of bonds from its global climate aligned bond index in recent years most comically including two taiwan power company offerings that spent revenues on coal plants in march tariq fancy former chief investment officer of sustainable investing at black rock wrote in usa today in many instances across the industry existing mutual funds are cynically rebranded as green with no discernible change to the fund itself or its underlying strategies simply for the sake of appearances and marketing purposes but even the good faith designation of green bonds can get murky because issuers and underwriters often face complicated issues and decisions that go beyond the bounds of typical credit analysis can a utility claim credit for producing green energy at a new site if it s still burning fossil fuels at another is it enough for a project s design or construction to incorporate green principles like a leed certified building or must it generate ongoing environmental benefits what metrics should measure those benefits and how much carbon emission reductions must they show what happens when environmental goals clash if say parkland is cleared away for a nuclear reactor how broad should an analysis of a project s impact get should it include an assessment of its impact on local citizens the problem isn t that there are no answers to questions like these it s that there are many answers from many sources the cbi promulgates best practices the international capital markets association icma provides guidelines the united nations has published sustainable development goals and more than 50 companies around the globe now offer verification of green bond designations but their metrics don t always apply to the specific needs of the municipal market they don t often merge easily into a one size fits all green light or red stop sign and they re based on disclosures that still aren t mandatory esg is really more art than science says lisa abraham senior esg fixed income analyst at brown advisory you can t just take a third party rating you need to understand what s driving that rating and the priorities that could be competing against one another it does require you to look under a hood as a result another phenomenon that s actually the opposite of greenwashing has also cropped up in the united states municipal issuers are putting bond proceeds to work on environmental and sustainability projects without ever labeling them as green at all many local authorities are already investing in greener energy public transit and cleaner water and are about to see a wave of federal money come their way at the same time these agencies are often working within stressed budgets and lack the resources to figure out what additional processes to track or results to disclose to certify their bonds or to pay consultants for answers particularly for smaller issuers it s not always clear the benefits of adopting a comprehensive new marketing strategy will outweigh the costs a lot of communities have done a significant amount to address environmental and social concerns on the ground for decades says emily brock director of the federal liaison center at the government finance officers association now how astute have those communities been in articulating what they ve already been doing for a very long time in their official statements not so great on june 16 the house of representatives did pass by the narrowest of margins a vote of 215 to 214 the esg disclosure simplification act of 2021 this bill would require issuers to disclose esg metrics as defined by the sec in their financial statements and to include a clear description of the views of the issuer about the link between esg metrics and the long term business strategy of the issuer this or something similar is what s required to standardize transparency among public companies and local authorities and ultimately give municipal green bond investing a chance to scale up the legislation however is almost certainly doomed in the senate even before the house vote every republican on the senate banking committee signed a letter to the sec arguing that federal securities regulations are not the appropriate vehicle to advance climate change policy goals municipal issuers may be even less inclined to go explicitly green because investors don t seem to reward them for doing so research into taxable instruments has generally found that green bonds trade at a slightly higher price and therefore a lower yield than unlabeled but otherwise matched bonds in such a scenario investors pay a greenium for the knowledge they are financing projects related to the environment and issuers save on interest costs but that doesn t hold for munis comparing green securities to nearly identical securities issued for non green purposes by the same issuers on the same day we observe economically identical pricing stanford professors david larcker and edward watts wrote last year in the journal of economics and accounting the greenium is essentially zero refinitiv recently studied the 20 biggest municipal green issues of the first half of 2021 such as new york metropolitan transportation authority mta bonds it found the same thing we observed no greenium paid for a tax exempt green bond compared to its non green counterpart it reported in october there does not appear much if any spread differential for muni green tax exempt deals at the moment a metropolitan transportation authority conductor in a train points to a sign at a subway station in new york bloomberg news maybe as a group municipal bond investors feel that fighting climate change is basically as good a public purpose as any other but no better perhaps they believe tax exemption already cuts issuers a break could be that the u s market where an average of just 30 000 to 40 000 municipal securities out of about one million bonds outstanding trade per day is fragmented and illiquid enough that it will take time to change whatever the reason municipal offerings are missing out on the upward spiral many activists and some investors are hoping to see just as enforceable disclosure requirements would allow investors to judge which issuers are worth rewarding and encourage bad actors to leave the market a greenium would show municipal issuers there s an advantage to financing sustainable projects and would encourage more of them to enter the market but at the moment neither exists ultimately if encouraging sustainability makes issuers and their projects stronger they will encourage sustainability i think we re seeing factors traditionally considered esg risks tie into fundamentals says abraham if you re building a bridge today that won t be viable in 15 years that should be factored into its pricing we are looking at climate scenarios environmental approvals and also where that bridge is being built and whether it s displacing any communities of course self negation is the great paradox of any socially responsible investment once divesting from south africa helped make apartheid untenable it was no longer necessary in the long run issuers who ignore climate risks when building roads or tunnels or airports will see their projects crumble and watch cheap capital flow elsewhere but you know what they say about the long run
the year winds down with another day of an unchanged muni market and slightly weaker u s treasury market while equities were mixed triple a benchmarks were left unchanged and ratios were also little changed the five year was at 47 70 in 10 and 78 in 30 according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the five at 46 the 10 at 72 and the 30 at 78 in 2022 issuers are expected to return 300 billion of maturing and called bond principal of that 195 billion will come from maturing debt while 105 billion will come from bonds that have already been called or are pre refunded taxable municipals will contribute 32 billion investors will also receive 139 billion of interest payments in 2022 about 593 million more than in 2021 according to a report from creditsights the amount of maturing bonds is down slightly from 2021 when 200 of bonds matured the report said the amount that will be called in the new year will certainly grow as issuers refinance older bonds the amount of money redeemed in january is expected to be 20 2 billion the lowest since april 2018 later in the year there will be fewer planned redemptions but as issuers refund older bonds the totals will climb the report said taxable bonds will account for 1 6 billion of the january principal in january the report said bondholders will get 13 7 billion of interest payments raising the total amount available for reinvestment to 33 8 billion the sectors with the largest january redemptions will be general obligations with 2 7 billion followed by hospitals with 2 billion airports with 1 5 billion and higher education with 700 million according to the report the states with the largest amounts of redemptions will be new york with 2 3 billion illinois with 2 2 billion ohio with 1 billion and georgia with 1 billion tax exempt yields are currently so low that they are not compelling for most corporate investors subject to the 21 federal income tax rate the report noted for that reason principal and interest returned to those investors is likely to leave the tax exempt muni market some of those corporate investors have been buying taxable municipals to diversify into municipal credit risk so much so that taxable supply has not been enough to satisfy demand the report said the municipal market has been a relative bright spot for core fixed income investors in 2021 while most of the other safe parts of the core fixed income universe have generated negative returns this year the national muni market is up for the year a report from lpl financial said with state and local governments flush with cash due to better than expected tax receipts along with generous amounts of federal aid many municipalities are in good shape 2021 has been a good year for munis and valuations reflect that good story noted lpl financial fixed income strategist lawrence gillum continued positive inflows to the asset class along with the improved fundamental story for many state and local governments should provide a positive backdrop for returns next year just two trading sessions remain in 2021 and two reports of fund flows from the investment company institute and refinitiv lipper come wednesday and thursday with the expectation of positive flows to end the year though unlikely to break records the effects of higher tax collections strong federal support and robust investor demand has thus far had a positive impact on municipal bond valuations as such when looking at the ratio between aaa munis and similar maturity treasury yields prices remain elevated at this point the report said and while the relative valuation story has improved in recent months munis remain expensive relative to history with 10 year aaa and 30 year aaa munis near the bottom decile of historical valuations meaning munis have been cheaper approximately 90 of the time gillum said while valuations per se aren t necessarily a reason for yields and spreads to move higher in the near term they do likely provide a slight headwind to potential future returns investor expectations should likely be guided downward as outsized returns are unlikely the report said as 2022 approaches we continue to favor municipal bonds as a high quality option for taxable accounts the report said federal stimulus is providing support although valuations relative to treasuries remain elevated and demand may not get a boost from personal tax rate increases what else to expect in 2022 uncertainty took center stage in 2021 and its remnants remain heading into 2022 there was plenty to worry about in 2021 said darrell cronk cio of wealth investment management wim at wells fargo but we saw a robust economic recovery and we stayed optimistic about risk assets besides covid variants inflation and uncertainty about federal reserve action there were also supply chain issues to be concerned about he said the firm is still optimistic about next year in fact significantly more optimistic than many on the street he said some are actually pricing in a fed policy mistake as their base case forecasting ever increasing numbers of fed rate hikes in 2022 the economy is clearly stronger than many realize as we move from early cycle dynamics to mid cycle drivers and the economic recovery becomes self sustaining cronk said although inflation will continue in the first half of the year he said it should fade in the last half as supply chain issues resolve one data point that we will watch closely and wait for is labor inflation cronk said during past inflationary cycles inflation progressed from goods inflation to services based inflation to labor inflation he said we have seen goods inflation and we are right in the thralls of service driven inflation as for data on tuesday regional fed surveys took the spotlight activity in the texas service sector remains robust but moderated in december according to the dallas fed as the revenue and employment indexes suggested deceleration from november price

like most african states liberia is a multi ethnic and multi cultural state a mosaic that consists of four major cultural stocks africans who were repatriated from the united states known as settlers or americo liberians africans from the caribbean africans from other parts of west africa including sierra leone ghana nigeria mali and togo against this backdrop it is imperative that national celebrations reflect the historical and cultural experiences of all liberia s major cultural stocks however the bicentennial celebration is designed to show case the historical and cultural experiences of only the african group that came from the united states beginning in 1821 while it is good to celebrate but given the history of antagonism between the indigenous africans and the repatriated africans from the u s care has to be taken that such celebration of the repatriated africans does not contribute to further inflaming the antagonistic relationship between the two groups beginning in 1821 a small group of african americans called settlers arrived at a location that later became known as cape montserrado their voyage was underwritten by the american colonization society acs with the support of the american government the enterprise was presaged by a declaration made by the sponsors that the american africans would be able to find a place that will give them a new start on life it was then argued they would be free from the discrimination and persecution that was their frequent lot in america the new arrivals from america found in what became known as liberia the following sixteen 16 indigenous ethnic groups gola kpelle bassa loma gbandi mano mende mandingo krahn kissi kru grebo vai belle and dei each of these groups occupied its own territories eight of the 16 ethnic groups belle gbandi gola kissi kpelle lorma mandingo mende until recently when a new county gbarpolu was established occupied the northeastern part of liberia lofa county the mano and gio the northwestern part of liberia nimba county the kpelle occupied the central part of the country belle the gola occupied the western part of the country the kru and bassa occupied the eastern part including most of the coastal area and the vai and dei the southeastern part of the country these groups were involved in extensive trade and had their own cultural traditions and social institutions for example the gbandi gola kissi kpelle lorma mende and vai had the poro the mandingo had their quranic schools the poro and the quranic schools provided civic training and religious instruction these institutions became vehicles for the transmission and preservation of various ethnic cultures and traditions that we still observe today the early days of liberia so named for the freedom it signified for african americans were clouded by difficulties such as disease poor leadership local hostilities limited numbers of colonies and inexperience which almost led to their extinction in spite of the initial difficulties and clashes confrontation that ensued as a result of the encounter between the settlers and some of the indigenous groups they managed to form alliances that later on led to independence and gradual unification of the nation although we continue to witness tensions as a result of inequality between the indigenous and settler groups the idea of a bicentennial celebration is only relevant to the settlers or repatriated africans who came in the beginning of 1821 and not intended for the indigenous africans who had already established institutions and systems and are the original culture stream met by the settlers or the africans who migrated from the caribbean and other west african countries the key question is how do we promote unity among the liberian groups how do we locate the other african groups within the bicentennial celebration i suggest that we have a celebration that is inclusive of the other african groups to be named the return of the african also i ask that we revisit or redefine our national symbols that are outright exclusive divisive and diametrically opposed to the process of unity and patriotism according to professor george kieh jr the national symbols of liberia need to be rethought and redesigned so that they can embody and reflect and represent the collective and shared cultural and historical experiences of all of the stocks and ethnic groups that constitute the liberian state

today is tuesday welcome to equilibrium a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability subscribe here thehill com newsletter signup the danish energy company ørsted announced on monday that it had begun producing power from the second phase of an enormous four part offshore wind farm in the north sea 55 miles 89 kilometers off the shore of the u k the hornsea project represents the largest offshore wind farm in the world once it is complete ørsted says it will be the world s largest wind farm period and the farthest large scale one from shore according to techxplore the project is a sign of both the ambition of ørsted and of the growing capacity of renewables more generally which continued to come into their own in 2021 today we ll look at how far the renewables revolution has come and how far it has yet to go for equilibrium we are saul elbein and sharon udasin please send tips or comments to saul at selbein thehill com or sharon at sudasin thehill com follow us on twitter saul_elbein and sharonudasin let s get to it a long road for battery powered transport 2021 saw the release of tantalizing prototypes of electric freight trains ships aircraft and an array of electric automobiles promising benchmarks in renewable energy generation battery storage and battery powered transportation but while electric modes of transportation benefit from falling wind and solar costs to become more than niche luxury goods they will need mature supply chains long term investment and their own government support progress we re building constituencies in the clean energy space that are a long way from being as politically powerful as the dirty energy space but they re a lot more powerful than they were 10 years ago rep sean casten d ill told equilibrium casten pointed to one key fact according to a bloomberg analysis about 46 percent of the world s population now lives in countries where it is more profitable to build new solar or wind infrastructure than run existing natural gas or coal power plants is the united states one of those countries no in the u s where oil and gas are heavily subsidized existing gas power plants are the cheapest generation option but even here things are changing two thirds of next year s new electricity generation capacity is expected to be either large scale solar or energy storage according to pv magazine twenty percent of u s electric power currently comes from wind water and solar power and more than 180 u s cities have passed policies requiring all renewable electricity according to a stanford study a diminishing danger of power failure a common fear around renewable power is that it doesn t work when rivers are low skies are cloudy or winds aren t blowing leading to power failures in an all renewable economy unless long term battery storage can be developed but the stanford study found these fears might be overblown a series of short term batteries linked together and constantly cycling electricity between them providing long term battery power on existing technology or releasing their full charge simultaneously to meet sudden short term heavy peaks in demand there are knock on economic benefits too building and operating the renewable energy grid could offer 4 7 million permanent jobs and save 53 200 lives a year from reduced health care costs with about 700 billion in savings researchers found 2021 sees a fleet of new tech the plummeting costs of low carbon electricity and rise in electric storage potential are a boon for a transportation system that may soon depend on renewables for fuel either in the form of high capacity batteries or zero carbon fuels like green hydrogen generated using solar or wind energy here s a look at the surge in new technologies we saw this year battery powered ships leave port 2021 saw key innovations in transportation sectors seen as the most difficult to decarbonize airline ocean borne shipping and freight trains which all rely on the high density energy of fossil fuels but while zero carbon airliners and long haul container ships are still years away battery technology is now far enough along to power small aircraft and smaller cargo carrying vessels with fixed short haul routes for example a new 100 percent battery powered ship called the asahi will now carry fuel to container ships in tokyo bay ship bunker magazine reported and a battery powered autonomous container ship now plies norways fjords delivering fertilizer electrek reported the global ferry trade group interferry also announced in october that it was embarking on a global lobbying push to persuade countries and ports to build the necessary infrastructure for electric passenger ferries ship bunker reported electric planes break records this month rolls royce s spirit of innovation a one seat plane broke the record for the world s fastest zero carbon aircraft holding a speed of 345 miles per hour for nearly two miles there s not much commercial use for that sort of plane that s why rolls royce is hoping to bring an electric powered four passenger air taxi capable of 120 mile flights with vertical takeoff and landing to urban markets by 2024 and in collaboration with the scandinavian regional carrier widerøe rolls royce hopes to bring an even larger plane an 11 seater suitable for short hops between communities along the forbidding north and west coasts of norway to market by 2026 according to a joint statement united airlines wants to do the same thing the carrier announced in july that it was buying a hundred es 19s 19 seat electric aircraft with a 250 mile range part of a longer term plan by the company s venture fund to buy companies that are building the technology for carbon neutral flight and to increase the range of its prospective zero carbon flights the company also inked a deal last week for a hundred battery hydrogen hybrid turboprop planes which aims to have 20 seat planes with 500 mile range on the market by 2024 according to cleantechnica trains could be an easier lift yet a new battery electric locomotive will soon begin making its first 139 mile test runs from pittsburgh pa to conneaut ohio cleantechnica reported if the cost of carbon and the public health cost of air pollution is factored in or if rail companies can take advantage of wholesale electricity battery electric trains may soon be the same cost as current diesel electric models according to a study published last month in nature energy electric vehicles offer cautionary tale while electric vehicles are the furthest along when it comes to low carbon transportation and legacy car company ceos increasingly release glowing statements about the electric future the internal combustion engine still dominates the industry for all the chatter on earnings calls this year the rollout of new evs remains fairly thin the verge reported there s the ford mustang mach e volkswagen id 4 and that s about it with slim options for those seeking an ev not made by tesla a company that has its own problems with the national transportation safety board according to an official statement and many of the most hyped ev companies this year like lordstown rivian and nikola are alleged to have been far further away from production than they led the public to believe as we reported earlier this month a looming question of infrastructure though they re a good start better gadgets and lower cost renewable energy aren t enough to decarbonize an economy built around fossil fuels particularly not when those fuels remain so heavily subsidized rep sean casten d ill told equilibrium what s needed is an incredible scaling up of capacity and electricity transportation casten said putting things in perspective the amount of energy we use to run our transportation is roughly the same as all the energy we use for power generation casten told equilibrium well if we re going to replace all of the fueling stations in the country with charging stations the implication is that you re adding a load that is in some way comparable to the total current electric load of the united states that you re stringing out along our nation s highways and those those sites do not currently have a bunch of generation tied into them that s one reason why the apparent failure earlier this month of the biden administration s build back better plan with its electric vehicle tax credits and particularly its funding for a nationwide network of charging stations led to a gut punch to ev stocks as tech analyst dan ives told cnn takeaway for the u s to reach the next stage of electrification requires a guiding hand that energy markets can t really provide on their own casten maintained that includes a regulatory streamlining and national support for electric infrastructure aimed at helping consumers and carriers alike feel comfortable betting on batteries over fossil fuels tuesday tech two tech trends to watch in 2022 china pushes self reliance in tech frightening trading partners frustrated by china s reliance on semiconductors from risky trading partners like japan taiwan and the united states beijing is pushing domestic companies like e commerce giant alibaba cell giant xiaomi and gaming and social media company tencent to build locally made semiconductors according to the associated press though chinese firms are as much as a decade behind rivals like taiwan in semiconductor technology and foreign analysts are predicting disaster a similar thumb on the scale policy of state mandates and support has worked for china before bridging the people s republic to global dominance in electric vehicle batteries as we reported last week

love it or hate it blockchain based cryptocurrencies are not going anywhere whether or not they ll make a permanent mark on the way we conduct our online business using currency for trades and purchases is still up in the air but there can be no doubt that crypto has brought blockchain mainstream and introduced a new trading asset to our portfolios deutsche bank in a broad based end of year survey looking at a market trends heading into 2022 included a section on crypto with some fascinating results research analyst brian bedell tells us that a large majority of respondents on the crypto section expect to increase their cryptocurrency usage which amounts to 70 or higher whether than be trading investing or transacting this makes sense given the concluding point that 60 agree that cryptocurrencies have some form as a store of value which has been a topic of debate as the product has gained more acceptance advertisement advertisement all of this brings us to the point of crypto related stocks there are plenty of companies out there involved in the crypto craze and investors can usually find a way into crypto through the stock market bitcoin mining digital currency financing online trading all provide unique sets of attributes with this in mind we ve dipped into the tipranks database to pull the details on three crypto stocks to find out what s making them tick the platform revealed that these are strong buy tickers and more importantly all three offer considerable upside potential let s take a closer look stronghold digital mining sdig let s start with stronghold a bitcoin mining company with a twist stronghold has based its power usage which in bitcoin mining is always substantial on an environmentally beneficial coal refuse power generation facility giving it a tier ii alternative energy system classification in the state of pennsylvania stronghold boasts that it is using 21st century bitcoin mining and energy tech to help clean up the environmental messes of previous eras advertisement advertisement the cleanup is big stronghold has two power generation facilities in pennsylvania putting out 80 megawatts and 85 megawatts respectively both use the environmentally dangerous coal refuse as fuel permitting cleanup in older coal mining areas safe disposal of the pollutant coal piles and plenty of power for bitcoin miners to tap stronghold this month entered into an agreement to acquire 9 080 bitcoin miners with a combined capacity of 826 petahash per second these will be housed on site with the power facilities for maximum efficiency delivery of the first 4 800 miners is expected to be complete in early january with the remainder coming in 1h22 the first 4 800 miners have a total cost to the company of 35 7 million or 84 per terahash per second these new miners will join stronghold s existing bitcoin mining infrastructure which totals 54 000 miners installed or contracted and boasts a hash rate of 5 2 exahash per second stronghold entered the public trading markets in october of this year through an ipo the company put 6 68 million shares on the market 19 each above the expected pricing of 16 to 18 the ipo raised over 127 million instead of the 90 million initially filed for trading began on october 20 and the stock closed that day above 28 it has since fallen 61 advertisement advertisement in coverage for compass point analyst giuliano bologna acknowledges stronghold s major point of differentiation with its peers that it combines power generation and bitcoin mining on site he adds the combination is expected to result in one of the lowest costs of electricity in the sector at 18 per mw the company s goal is to build out 300 mw of aggregate hosting capacity by the end of fy22 which supports sdig s target of 8 eh s of hash power with a fleet of 85 000 miners by the end of fy22 we estimate sdig s miners and order book total 3 76 eh s of hash power by the end of fy22 which is likely an overhang on the company s valuation looking at an 8 eh s fy22 target securing additional definitive orders for miners would be a significant positive catalyst for sdig shares in our view everything that stronghold has going for it prompted bologna to rate the stock a buy along with a 35 price target this target implies shares could climb 209 higher in the next twelve months to watch bologna s track record click here while there are only three analyst reviews on this new stock they all agree that it s a buy proposition making the consensus rating a strong buy stronghold shares are

follow stock exchanges around the world have been seeking a larger role in pushing companies to decarbonise the united states is looking at mandatory disclosure on climate risks and for its securities and exchange commission to develop a rule by the end of the year the united kingdom said it will introduce mandatory climate related financial reporting for the first time in asia the singapore bourse unveiled a roadmap for climate related disclosures to be made compulsory in sustainability reports while japanese regulators are mulling mandatory climate risk disclosure requirements starting april 2022 india and china have already come out with mandatory reporting rules while most southeast asian countries are recommending companies to report their emissions though the requirements are not obligatory further improvement in mandatory disclosures in asian markets is expected in the coming year as regulators strive to streamline ambiguous information said diksha mishra enviromental social and governance policy esg specialist of asset manager arabesque these information gaps usually result from a lack of legal requirements she added regulation pushes companies to make the information available to a larger audience but pressure also comes from various stakeholders including consumers sustainability disclosure necessitates a global partnership where everyone plays a role said mishra 2 companies net zero pledges will be put to the test advances in regulation will force companies to start getting serious about their net zero goals exposing those who are making empty promises an analysis released in october found that a fifth of the 2 000 largest publicly listed companies in the world have committed to a net zero strategy however the report also revealed that many of these companies either do not count emissions produced by their supply chains or depend on unreliable strategies to offset their carbon production the united nations un backed non profit science based targets initiative sbti is helping companies translate the paris agreement s goal into concrete measures by accrediting only companies that have serious carbon mitigation plans to eliminate greenwashers it will require companies to first collect a comprehensive inventory of their direct emissions scope 1 indirect emissions from purchased electricity scope 2 and emissions from suppliers and end users scope 3 companies must then develop a concrete plan and detail how they will report on and bring about the emissions reductions that will bring their company in line with the level of decarbonisation required to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees celsius compared to pre industrial temperatures most companies will require deep decarbonisation of 90 to 95 per cent to reach net zero under the standards of the sbti 3 regulation tide moving towards strengthening the s factor in esg regulators are coming up with clearer measurements of the s or the social factor in esg germany adopted a new suppy chain law that requires companies to ensure human rights standards at all tiers of their supply chains the uk provided a clear cut methodology to calculate the pay gap between its male and female employees the year 2021 also saw a european single access point a centralised platform allowing access to publicly disclosed information on financial services being pioneered the impact it brings about will likely trickle down to asia based companies australia s modern slavery law is set to commence on 1 january 2022 where government agencies and local councils will be required to take reasonable steps to ensure that the goods and services they procure are not the product of modern slavery cop26 blazed a trail in strengthening social issues through its adoption of a landmark deal where more than 100 world leaders promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 this would not be possible without heavy consultation with farmers on the ground said pat dwyer founder and director of the purpose business a hong kong based sustainable business consultancy this year s cop allowed us to keep 1 5 c alive it isn t purely about fighting coal rather it is about all the interconnecting issues such as issues involving deforestation methane or reporting and transparency she said this is a very human and s centric approach to solving what is essentially a e or environment problem 4 illegal fishing at a turning point an agreement to remove harmful fishing subsidies and halt global fish meltdown is set to be finalised by the end of february in a bid to end over 20 years of negotiations to prohibit funds which enable overfishing every year more than us 20 billion of taxpayers money finances harmful fisheries subsidies around the world the world trade organization wto which deals with the global rules of trade between nations including rules regarding fishing was set to meet end november in geneva switzerland to come up with the consensus but after an outbreak of the newly announced covid 19 variant omicron the meeting was postponed wto director general ngozi okonjo iweala said she had spoken to several ministers to push through with online meetings among ambassadors and experts to arrive at an agreement okonjo iweala comes from a country familiar with the environmental and social cost of overfishing west africa has been significantly impacted by industrial fishing by distant water fleets operating with generous fuel subsidies from their home countries this does not mean that negotiations should stop she said in a statement on the contrary delegations in geneva should be fully empowered to close as many gaps as possible this new variant reminds us once again of the urgency of the work we are charged with 5 natural gas and nuclear energy poised for a comeback the gas industry has fervently been pushed as a climate friendlier alternative to coal as asia shifts to a lower carbon economy many now see gas as a bridging fuel uk based consultancy wood mackenzie predicted that the region will see 60 per cent of global gas demand growth over the next three decades with the largest increase expected in emerging markets across south and southeast asia liquified natural gas lng demand growth is supported by the development of new regasification pipeline and gas to power infrastructure in the philippines where dwindling gas reserves and the absence of new finds have spurred the country s shift towards importing lng the infrastructure boom amounts to us 13 6 billion worth of planned import terminals power plants ports regasification facilities and pipelines a global rehabilitation of nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions will also likely gain ground in the coming year china the third biggest nuclear energy consumer in the world after the us and france is set to build its first small modular nuclear reactor to keep with its ambitious goal to lead the world in nuclear ten years after the fukushima disaster its share of primary energy use has waned but more countries will seek to imitate france which derives about 70 per cent of its electricity from nuclear energy 6 electric cars airplanes and sustainable shipping a cop26 declaration to sell only cars and vans with zero emission by 2040 or earlier will signal more manufacturers especially those in emerging and developing markets to shift to electric cars in the year ahead to support them the uk presidency announced a more than us 5 million initial contribution to the global facility to decarbonise transport a facility created by the world bank this year aside from efforts to modernise road transport more sustainable aircrafts will be manufactured in 2022 toyota backed joby aviation based in california in the us plans to build more than a dozen of its five seater electric air taxis pilot tests will also happen in the year ahead as passenger planes with hydrogen fuel cells will make its first flight in the summer at delft university of technology in the netherlands french multinational michelin tire has signed up to ship some of the tires it makes in nova scotia canada across the atlantic to france on a cargo vessel powered mainly by sail to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions the service will reduce fuel consumption by up to 20 per cent said the company 7 innovation in nature based solutions covid 19 is a stark reminder to stakeholders that safeguarding natural capital would have the biggest impact on climate ecoonomies and health the world will likely see new nature based solutions emerge in the coming year rumah yapeka an indonesian nonprofit conservation and community development organisation has begun the process of developing plans to protect and restore seagrass ecosystems through community led activities by using innovative approaches such as using drones to monitor seagrass beds or by helping local residents launch sustainable businesses like growing vitamin rich blue green algae called spirulina and developing homestay ecotourism companies the group hopes to preserve seagrass ecosystems seagrass is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world as they nurture fish populations and weaken storm surges but it has been disappearing due to overfishing coastal development and climate change growing seaweed offshore is another emerging trend where the first seaweed

cnn president joe biden is closing out his first year in office facing one of the same problems he entered the white house vowing to fix a persistent shortage of covid 19 testing that if resolved could provide a way out of the still raging pandemic the inability to secure enough timely tests for the number of people who want them has led to a new reckoning for biden s covid 19 response an enhanced strategy that includes distributing 500 million free at home tests didn t come in time to prevent major disruptions to holiday travel and it remains unclear when those tests will reach americans who want them walking along the seafront in rehoboth beach delaware biden said on tuesday that he d made a bit of progress in distributing the new tests but he didn t expand on how far along the program was a combination of factors from a christmastime surge in demand to a highly transmissible new variant to a summertime lull in testing that created a shortage of supply are driving the testing deficit officials and others familiar with the matter say yet the failures surrounding testing have led to accusations that the white house failed to anticipate the pandemic s course and overemphasized vaccinations as a solution to ending the crisis even as outside experts warned of a looming test shortage directly to administration officials biden s team insists they took what steps they could in the fall to build up testing capacity but acknowledge that a surge in demand and relatively recent emergency use authorizations from the us food and drug administration have made stockpiling at home tests a challenge television footage of long lines at testing centers grabbed biden s attention over the christmas weekend and the shortage of tests factored into the administration s decision monday not to recommend tests for individuals exposed to the virus to emerge from a shortened five day quarantine according to an official familiar with the discussions if we require a test people are going to say what if we can t get a test the senior administration official said recounting internal deliberations on condition of anonymity rather than letting the perfect be the enemy of the good the official said the us centers for disease control and prevention opted for less stringent language noting that best practice would also include a test for sars cov 2 at day 5 after exposure biden himself has frankly acknowledged that his efforts have fallen short particularly in scaling up testing even as he seeks to take credit for other aspects of fighting the pandemic it s clearly not enough if i had we had known we would have gone harder quicker if we could have biden said in describing his testing efforts this week while meeting virtually with governors we have to do more we have to do better and we will other top health officials including dr anthony fauci the president s top medical adviser have similarly acknowledged the testing shortfalls in interviews and white house press secretary jen psaki conceded last week that she could have provided more context when she dismissed the notion of sending tests to americans just two weeks ago officials said a letup in demand for tests over the summer and fall despite the rapid spread of the delta variant had caused some companies to pull back their manufacturing which has compounded the current shortages many of the drive thru sites that opened earlier in biden s tenure were closed and abbott which manufactures a popular at home product discarded materials for millions of its tests and laid off workers despite steps the white house has taken since then to ramp up production including deploying the defense production act public health experts have decried the shortfalls i cannot believe this is where we are almost two years into the pandemic everybody saw it coming we knew we needed more tests i think the administration had dropped the ball on this said dr ashish jha dean of brown university s school of public health they focused a lot on vaccines which is terrific vaccines are a really really important part of this but did not pay enough attention to testing and i think it has been really costly in this holiday season i hope we fix it in january and february but we re going to have to have a real effort to make sure there s plentiful cheap ubiquitous testing everywhere in the country jha said that s where we should be in this pandemic right now new controversy on tuesday a second backlash this time against the cdc s decision to shorten the recommended isolation period for those who test positive for covid 19 was bubbling among some public health and medical experts the agency did not recommend a negative test as part of the conditions for ending isolation instead the new recommendation is that those without symptoms can end their isolation after five days instead of 10 and wear a mask for the ensuing five days the move was a sign that we expect cases to only grow one senior health official told cnn the step was a boon for businesses including major airlines which had been forced to dramatically scale back their business as employees tested positive and were unavailable to work for 10 days carriers including jetblue and delta air lines had lobbied the administration to shorten the isolation period for positive cases delta asked to cut it to five days specifically while the cdc said the change was motivated by science in its announcement monday night officials did not deny that a concern the omicron wave could effectively shut down society had also played a role according to one senior official we need people to get back to their jobs the official said speaking on cnn fauci said it was imperative to ensure essential personnel were able to continue working with the sheer volume of new cases that we are having and that we expect to continue with omicron one of the things we want to be careful of is that we don t have so many people out fauci said monday night on cnn if you are asymptomatic and you are infected we want to get people back to the jobs particularly those with essential jobs to keep our society running smoothly officials said the new guidance was subject to extensive discussion among administration health officials before it was announced monday evening with a final decision made on sunday a senior official said there had been near unanimity about the decision the biggest sticking point in the talks was how long people exposed to the virus should quarantine the agency ultimately recommended a reduced five day quarantine for people who are unvaccinated or not yet boosted the conversations among officials included weighing the availability of tests one official said along with the imperative of allowing businesses to continue operating amid the surge i was very surprised that there was not a testing requirement to come out of isolation said dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist who served on biden s coronavirus task force during the transition symptoms are really not a good way of determining if someone is infectious or not like other medical experts who have been critical of the updated guidance gounder argued it is irresponsible to halve the isolation period without requiring a negative antigen test while the biden administration came into office promising its coronavirus response would be driven by science gounder said the lack of a testing requirement to shorten the isolation period suggests science was not the driving force in the new guidance i think this is policy being driven by scarcity and this is not the first time we have seen this happen gounder said noting cdc recommendations on masking that have not urged the use of medical grade masks in order to preserve them for health care workers public health policy is going to be driven not just by science but by political economic and social considerations but i do feel like science is taking a back seat here a senior administration official involved in the deliberations said the cdc guidance focused on the absence of symptoms rather than a negative test because antigen tests can be unpredictable later in the course of infection the official also noted that the fda has not approved antigen tests as a way of determining whether someone is still infectious still with tests in short supply in certain areas of the country officials were forced to weigh availability against a recommendation to test before exiting quarantine unanswered questions about new testing plan officials say the scarcity of at home tests this month was driven by a steep uptick in demand particularly in major cities where cases began surging at the same moment americans were entering the holiday stretch increased travel and family get togethers prompted fresh urgency in getting tested that depleted stocks of at home tests at drugstores and online the plan biden announced last week to procure and distribute hundreds of millions of at hope rapid tests developed quickly over a stretch of days in december as reports emerged of empty shelves and sold out notices according to officials familiar with the matter still when biden made the announcement last week several details of the plan remained unresolved administration officials were unable to provide any specific details about when the website to request the tests would launch or how quickly tests would be shipped pointing only to a broad timeline of early january they also did not detail a plan to get tests to those with limited internet access we re working through all the details and we ll have those in the coming weeks a senior administration official said during a briefing the official said the first deliveries of those tests would happen in january and that the website would launch in january or around january as well the official also said the white house is working through all the details when asked how americans without internet access could secure tests a buildup of factors over the past year led to a shortfall in testing that became apparent only as the omicron variant began spreading across the country in the weeks after thanksgiving according to administration officials and others familiar with the matter biden entered office vowing to remedy the testing issues that had plagued the previous administration and he signed an executive order on his first day in office meant to expand the availability of testing including in schools and other priority populations he established a pandemic testing board a campaign promise modeled on president franklin d roosevelt s war production board early in his term and in february he announced a series of investments meant to increase testing capacity by scaling up the production of raw materials and establishing regional centers to distribute test kits and collect samples but biden s central focus in the early days of his term ultimately was on getting as many americans vaccinated as possible a campaign that diverted public attention away from the testing initiative he d entered office vowing to execute in september biden announced he was using the defense production act to increase the production of rapid tests including at home products he said major retailers including walmart kroger and amazon would soon begin selling the at home kits at cost and he announced a purchase of 300 million rapid tests to be distributed to community health centers food banks and schools at the same time administration officials said the process of getting fda authorization for at home test products has been slower than some inside the white house would like leading to products that have become available only in recent months for the white house the focus over the fall was on building capacity within the test market to produce the billions of tests that will be necessary to ending the pandemic in october a group of medical experts urged the white house during an informal and informative meeting to expand the nation s testing capacity in an effort to stem a winter surge according to one of the participants former harvard school of public health assistant professor michael mina mina who now serves as chief science officer of at home test maker emed was one of a number of medical professionals who presented the white house with a 10 page plan calling for among other measures procuring 732 million tests per month he acknowledged a surge in testing at that scale was always a tall order i think the bold initiative had it come to fruition would have been amazing mina said in an interview on cnn last week he said that since the meeting the administration has worked to scale up us testing capacity an effort that was still unable to prevent the long lines and shortages that have plagued the last months of 2021 it would have been very very difficult in the last two months he said
here s a piece of advice for anyone looking to invest wisely for long term gains don t get rid of those old lego sets just yet because they might be worth some serious dough they re a wildly popular diversion for both kids and adults and now it turns out that lego sets discontinued ones at least may be seriously valuable collectibles to boot a study by researchers at the higher school of economics in moscow found that prices for retired lego sets grew 11 per cent annually between 1987 and 2015 a rate that s faster than bonds stocks and even gold the study also concluded that lego returns are not exposed to risk factors and weakly dependent on the stock market however the sets are not a way to score fast cash rather they re long term investments that yield returns within two to three years of the sets being discontinued the study s authors victoria dobrynskaya and julia kishilova reported their findings after looking at the prices of 2 322 lego new unopened sets from 1987 to 2015 and using information from primary sales as well as online auction transactions their research also unearthed a number of fun facts to start prices of small and very large sets grow faster than medium sized sets this is most likely because smaller sets have unique parts and figurines while larger sets are rarer and appeal more to adults also sets tied to hit movies holidays and well known buildings see the highest growth in value as do limited edition sets top valued sets include the taj mahal imperial star destroyer and millennium falcon why exactly do retired lego sets rise in value so quickly for one they re produced in small quantities with special edition sets being the most limited they re also not widely available on the secondary market because owners lose parts or don t want to part with sets they love and since they re beloved by both adults and kids and have been around for decades the study assumes the more time has passed since a set first debuted the more nostalgic and desirable it becomes the architectural quality of lego sets also plays into why discontinued sets are so valuable says christian bailey a founding principal at oda architecture in new york and an avid lego fan who still owns sets acquired in the 1970s lego sets are like architecture because they re building blocks that you use to create a 3 d scene whether it s from a movie or of a building or set in space he says they re endlessly imaginative in a release about the study dobrynskaya said we are used to thinking that people buy such items as jewelry antiques or artworks as investment however there are other options such as collectible toys tens of thousands of deals are made on the secondary lego market even taking into account the small prices of most sets this is a huge market that is not well known by traditional investors bailey agrees that most people are unaware of the potential value of lego sets as a lego lover however i understand why the sets can become an asset he says i m not parting with mine anytime soon

the new year is time to think back and analyze but also to point forward as i write it is still a few days before christmas so let me begin with christmas 1944 dad is stationed in the philippine islands which are so far away that you are starting to come back around from the other side he is off duty on his ship lying on his bunk which is located right above a torpedo over the pa system comes bing crosby singing white christmas he sobs thinking of his new wife and not yet born child all he can do for comfort he later says is to roll over and hug the torpedo a little over a year later he is officer of the bridge as his ship steams under the golden gate bridge that day his now born son that s me stands up in his crib for the first time my dad came back but a whole bunch of others weren t so lucky for our accreditation in the illinois state university college of business we are required to have units on what is called the social environment it s great if you can develop a marketing or financial plan but you also need to know what is going on out in the world with that in mind back to mom and dad dad got his last bit of formal education and in an excellent job market chose the quaker oats co which became his career it was a nice complement to our family farm and it was often said that even if times became bad again people would still be eating then came i think the best day of their married life as they got out from under his mother in law s roof it was public project housing built quickly after the war to help ease the housing shortage they were barrack like units right off of green bay road on mccormick boulevard in evanston we had running water with the kitchen sink and bathroom there was a basic stove for cooking and an ice box which needed a new block of ice weekly there was a single fuel oil heater and no air conditioning the dishwasher was mom but we did have a solar dryer otherwise known as a clothesline evening entertainment was a small am radio i did not understand why jack benny was funny for a while we did not have a car and i don t recall there being a telephone dad earned in inflation adjusted dollars 24 000 so as we measure things today we lived in poverty but there was never a hint from my parents that they were somehow unfortunate there are about 45 million of us living in poverty today our census bureau is in charge of research and definitions and they say that students don t count among that number and for other reasons the homeless and soldiers living in barracks are also left out they say a family of four needs 25 000 to be not poor interestingly public assistance be it food stamps rent subsidy child tax credit or general welfare also don t count so who is in this 15 living in poverty the internet tells me that only 4 3 of married couples are poor as president lyndon johnson s great society began about 15 of kids were born to single mothers and today that number is past 40 of households headed by single women one third are in poverty poverty is a moving target so let us take a deeper look as a child my wife heard the guns of the russian front and was driven from her farm in the german east settling in a small village near dresden during her formative years she recalls that the physician had the only car in town i have visited the village a number of times and have seen the small food store where her war widow mother worked the building in which they along with her two older sisters had two rooms then there is the village well where they got their household water one bucket at a time i have also seen the building that housed the two room schoolhouse used for the first four grades and on a nearby hill that kids used for winter sledding there is a fairly large bomb crater how do you think it got there it is not right to describe the conditions of 70 years past with those of today and say no problem still some comparisons might have value for us as we point forward that two room four grade school had no paper budget so the students scratched on slate tablets yet my wife will tell you with considerable pride that she will put the quality of the no nonsense education she got there up against anything available here today we are told that all we need to turn failing schools to success is more money if it were only that simple then just a few days ago the wall street journal absolutely gloating reported that students in new york city public charter schools almost all of them poor outscored students from smooth suburban schools on standardized tests there is one more recent statistic i am having a hard time with it seems that a half century ago more than 60 of those in the lowest income brackets were in the labor force but today it is fewer than 40 have we made it too comfortable for some to live on the dole or for all of these single parents is paid work not really possible does everyone have opportunity if not what can we do every culture from the beginning of time has valued marriage until it seems now time to reset my wife grew up in a place where the government said that the people had an incredible number of rights but that every right was coupled with a responsibility responsibility is not a word often heard in our national discussion today 9 new illinois laws that started jan 1 vehicle taxes college admissions drug prices foid card changes

cnn by kevin liptak jeremy diamond and kaitlan collins cnn president joe biden is closing out his first year in office facing one of the same problems he entered the white house vowing to fix a persistent shortage of covid 19 testing that if resolved could provide a way out of the still raging pandemic the inability to secure enough timely tests for the number of people who want them has led to a new reckoning for biden s covid 19 response an enhanced strategy that includes distributing 500 million free at home tests didn t come in time to prevent major disruptions to holiday travel and it remains unclear when those tests will reach americans who want them walking along the seafront in rehoboth beach delaware biden said on tuesday that he d made a bit of progress in distributing the new tests but he didn t expand on how far along the program was a combination of factors from a christmastime surge in demand to a highly transmissible new variant to a summertime lull in testing that created a shortage of supply are driving the testing deficit officials and others familiar with the matter say yet the failures surrounding testing have led to accusations that the white house failed to anticipate the pandemic s course and overemphasized vaccinations as a solution to ending the crisis even as outside experts warned of a looming test shortage directly to administration officials biden s team insists they took what steps they could in the fall to build up testing capacity but acknowledge that a surge in demand and relatively recent emergency use authorizations from the us food and drug administration have made stockpiling at home tests a challenge television footage of long lines at testing centers grabbed biden s attention over the christmas weekend and the shortage of tests factored into the administration s decision monday not to recommend tests for individuals exposed to the virus to emerge from a shortened five day quarantine according to an official familiar with the discussions if we require a test people are going to say what if we can t get a test the senior administration official said recounting internal deliberations on condition of anonymity rather than letting the perfect be the enemy of the good the official said the us centers for disease control and prevention opted for less stringent language noting that best practice would also include a test for sars cov 2 at day 5 after exposure biden himself has frankly acknowledged that his efforts have fallen short particularly in scaling up testing even as he seeks to take credit for other aspects of fighting the pandemic it s clearly not enough if i had we had known we would have gone harder quicker if we could have biden said in describing his testing efforts this week while meeting virtually with governors we have to do more we have to do better and we will other top health officials including dr anthony fauci the president s top medical adviser have similarly acknowledged the testing shortfalls in interviews and white house press secretary jen psaki conceded last week that she could have provided more context when she dismissed the notion of sending tests to americans just two weeks ago officials said a letup in demand for tests over the summer and fall despite the rapid spread of the delta variant had caused some companies to pull back their manufacturing which has compounded the current shortages many of the drive thru sites that opened earlier in biden s tenure were closed and abbott which manufactures a popular at home product discarded materials for millions of its tests and laid off workers despite steps the white house has taken since then to ramp up production including deploying the defense production act public health experts have decried the shortfalls i cannot believe this is where we are almost two years into the pandemic everybody saw it coming we knew we needed more tests i think the administration had dropped the ball on this said dr ashish jha dean of brown university s school of public health they focused a lot on vaccines which is terrific vaccines are a really really important part of this but did not pay enough attention to testing and i think it has been really costly in this holiday season i hope we fix it in january and february but we re going to have to have a real effort to make sure there s plentiful cheap ubiquitous testing everywhere in the country jha said that s where we should be in this pandemic right now new controversy on tuesday a second backlash this time against the cdc s decision to shorten the recommended isolation period for those who test positive for covid 19 was bubbling among some public health and medical experts the agency did not recommend a negative test as part of the conditions for ending isolation instead the new recommendation is that those without symptoms can end their isolation after five days instead of 10 and wear a mask for the ensuing five days the move was a sign that we expect cases to only grow one senior health official told cnn the step was a boon for businesses including major airlines which had been forced to dramatically scale back their business as employees tested positive and were unavailable to work for 10 days carriers including jetblue and delta air lines had lobbied the administration to shorten the isolation period for positive cases delta asked to cut it to five days specifically while the cdc said the change was motivated by science in its announcement monday night officials did not deny that a concern the omicron wave could effectively shut down society had also played a role according to one senior official we need people to get back to their jobs the official said speaking on cnn fauci said it was imperative to ensure essential personnel were able to continue working with the sheer volume of new cases that we are having and that we expect to continue with omicron one of the things we want to be careful of is that we don t have so many people out fauci said monday night on cnn if you are asymptomatic and you are infected we want to get people back to the jobs particularly those with essential jobs to keep our society running smoothly officials said the new guidance was subject to extensive discussion among administration health officials before it was announced monday evening with a final decision made on sunday a senior official said there had been near unanimity about the decision the biggest sticking point in the talks was how long people exposed to the virus should quarantine the agency ultimately recommended a reduced five day quarantine for people who are unvaccinated or not yet boosted the conversations among officials included weighing the availability of tests one official said along with the imperative of allowing businesses to continue operating amid the surge i was very surprised that there was not a testing requirement to come out of isolation said dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist who served on biden s coronavirus task force during the transition symptoms are really not a good way of determining if someone is infectious or not like other medical experts who have been critical of the updated guidance gounder argued it is irresponsible to halve the isolation period without requiring a negative antigen test while the biden administration came into office promising its coronavirus response would be driven by science gounder said the lack of a testing requirement to shorten the isolation period suggests science was not the driving force in the new guidance i think this is policy being driven by scarcity and this is not the first time we have seen this happen gounder said noting cdc recommendations on masking that have not urged the use of medical grade masks in order to preserve them for health care workers public health policy is going to be driven not just by science but by political economic and social considerations but i do feel like science is taking a back seat here a senior administration official involved in the deliberations said the cdc guidance focused on the absence of symptoms rather than a negative test because antigen tests can be unpredictable later in the course of infection the official also noted that the fda has not approved antigen tests as a way of determining whether someone is still infectious still with tests in short supply in certain areas of the country officials were forced to weigh availability against a recommendation to test before exiting quarantine unanswered questions about new testing plan officials say the scarcity of at home tests this month was driven by a steep uptick in demand particularly in major cities where cases began surging at the same moment americans were entering the holiday stretch increased travel and family get togethers prompted fresh urgency in getting tested that depleted stocks of at home tests at drugstores and online the plan biden announced last week to procure and distribute hundreds of millions of at hope rapid tests developed quickly over a stretch of days in december as reports emerged of empty shelves and sold out notices according to officials familiar with the matter still when biden made the announcement last week several details of the plan remained unresolved administration officials were unable to provide any specific details about when the website to request the tests would launch or how quickly tests would be shipped pointing only to a broad timeline of early january they also did not detail a plan to get tests to those with limited internet access we re working through all the details and we ll have those in the coming weeks a senior administration official said during a briefing the official said the first deliveries of those tests would happen in january and that the website would launch in january or around january as well the official also said the white house is working through all the details when asked how americans without internet access could secure tests a buildup of factors over the past year led to a shortfall in testing that became apparent only as the omicron variant began spreading across the country in the weeks after thanksgiving according to administration officials and others familiar with the matter biden entered office vowing to remedy the testing issues that had plagued the previous administration and he signed an executive order on his first day in office meant to expand the availability of testing including in schools and other priority populations he established a pandemic testing board a campaign promise modeled on president franklin d roosevelt s war production board early in his term and in february he announced a series of investments meant to increase testing capacity by scaling up the production of raw materials and establishing regional centers to distribute test kits and collect samples but biden s central focus in the early days of his term ultimately was on getting as many americans vaccinated as possible a campaign that diverted public attention away from the testing initiative he d entered office vowing to execute in september biden announced he was using the defense production act to increase the production of rapid tests including at home products he said major retailers including walmart kroger and amazon would soon begin selling the at home kits at cost and he announced a purchase of 300 million rapid tests to be distributed to community health centers food banks and schools at the same time administration officials said the process of getting fda authorization for at home test products has been slower than some inside the white house would like leading to products that have become available only in recent months for the white house the focus over the fall was on building capacity within the test market to produce the billions of tests that will be necessary to ending the pandemic in october a group of medical experts urged the white house during an informal and informative meeting to expand the nation s testing capacity in an effort to stem a winter surge according to one of the participants former harvard school of public health assistant professor michael mina mina who now serves as chief science officer of at home test maker emed was one of a number of medical professionals who presented the white house with a 10 page plan calling for among other measures procuring 732 million tests per month he acknowledged a surge in testing at that scale was always a tall order i think the bold initiative had it come to fruition would have been amazing mina said in an interview on cnn last week he said that since the meeting the administration has worked to scale up us testing capacity an effort that was still unable to prevent the long lines and shortages that have plagued the last months of 2021 it would have been very very difficult in the last two months he said the cnn wire 2021 cable news

along with the imperative of allowing businesses to continue operating amid the surge i was very surprised that there was not a testing requirement to come out of isolation said dr celine gounder an infectious disease specialist who served on biden s coronavirus task force during the transition symptoms are really not a good way of determining if someone is infectious or not like other medical experts who have been critical of the updated guidance gounder argued it is irresponsible to halve the isolation period without requiring a negative antigen test while the biden administration came into office promising its coronavirus response would be driven by science gounder said the lack of a testing requirement to shorten the isolation period suggests science was not the driving force in the new guidance i think this is policy being driven by scarcity and this is not the first time we have seen this happen gounder said noting cdc recommendations on masking that have not urged the use of medical grade masks in order to preserve them for health care workers public health policy is going to be driven not just by science but by political economic and social considerations but i do feel like science is taking a back seat here a senior administration official involved in the deliberations said the cdc guidance focused on the absence of symptoms rather than a negative test because antigen tests can be unpredictable later in the course of infection the official also noted that the fda has not approved antigen tests as a way of determining whether someone is still infectious still with tests in short supply in certain areas of the country officials were forced to weigh availability against a recommendation to test before exiting quarantine unanswered questions about new testing plan officials say the scarcity of at home tests this month was driven by a steep uptick in demand particularly in major cities where cases began surging at the same moment americans were entering the holiday stretch increased travel and family get togethers prompted fresh urgency in getting tested that depleted stocks of at home tests at drugstores and online the plan biden announced last week to procure and distribute hundreds of millions of at hope rapid tests developed quickly over a stretch of days in december as reports emerged of empty shelves and sold out notices according to officials familiar with the matter still when biden made the announcement last week several details of the plan remained unresolved administration officials were unable to provide any specific details about when the website to request the tests would launch or how quickly tests would be shipped pointing only to a broad timeline of early january they also did not detail a plan to get tests to those with limited internet access we re working through all the details and we ll have those in the coming weeks a senior administration official said during a briefing the official said the first deliveries of those tests would happen in january and that the website would launch in january or around january as well the official also said the white house is working through all the details when asked how americans without internet access could secure tests a buildup of factors over the past year led to a shortfall in testing that became apparent only as the omicron variant began spreading across the country in the weeks after thanksgiving according to administration officials and others familiar with the matter biden entered office vowing to remedy the testing issues that had plagued the previous administration and he signed an executive order on his first day in office meant to expand the availability of testing including in schools and other priority populations he established a pandemic testing board a campaign promise modeled on president franklin d roosevelt s war production board early in his term and in february he announced a series of investments meant to increase testing capacity by scaling up the production of raw materials and establishing regional centers to distribute test kits and collect samples but biden s central focus in the early days of his term ultimately was on getting as many americans vaccinated as possible a campaign that diverted public attention away from the testing initiative he d entered office vowing to execute in september biden announced he was using the defense production act to increase the production of rapid tests including at home products he said major retailers including walmart kroger and amazon would soon begin selling the at home kits at cost and he announced a purchase of 300 million rapid tests to be distributed to community health centers food banks and schools at the same time administration officials said the process of getting fda authorization for at home test products has been slower than some inside the white house would like leading to products that have become available only in recent months for the white house the focus over the fall was on building capacity within the test market to produce the billions of tests that will be necessary to ending the pandemic in october a group of medical experts urged the white house during an informal and informative meeting to expand the nation s testing capacity in an effort to stem a winter surge according to one of the participants former harvard school of public health assistant professor michael mina mina who now serves as chief science officer of at home test maker emed was one of a number of medical professionals who presented the white house with a 10 page plan calling for among other measures procuring 732 million tests per month he acknowledged a surge in testing at that scale was always a tall order i think the bold initiative had it come to fruition would have been amazing mina said in an interview on cnn last week he said that since the meeting the administration has worked to scale up us testing capacity an effort that was still unable to prevent the long lines and shortages that have plagued the last months of 2021 it would have been very very difficult in the last two months he said the cnn wire 2021 cable news

as someone who covers southeast asia startups and funding stories the best word i can think of to describe 2021 is whoa this was the year that global investors not only started to pay close attention to the region s tech ecosystems but also began putting real money into them backed by international lps southeast asia focused venture firms like alpha jwc ac ventures and jungle ventures raised their largest funds yet the ken reported that american firms like a16z valar ventures hedosophia and goodwater capital were also setting up or planning regional offices as exits like grab and sea s initial public offerings fueled interest in southeast asia s startup ecosystems a comprehensive report from golden gate ventures also forecasted a record number of exits due in part to an increase in b and c rounds i always feel a bit silly using the term southeast asia because the region is so large and complex it s the easiest option when i m trying to be succinct but southeast asia consists of 11 countries and obviously there are huge differences between say singapore myanmar laos vietnam the philippines and indonesia as a global financial center one could argue that singapore s startup ecosystem is in a category of its own when compared to its neighbors and indonesia in particular warrants special attention as the fourth largest economy in the world and the most populated southeast asian country with 273 5 million people both countries produced a fair amount of unicorns in 2021 in singapore for instance ninja van carousell carro and nium were among startups that hit unicorn status while singaporean startups tend to focus on other southeast asian countries or in nium s case the united states and latin america indonesia based founders on the other hand might have mid or long term plans for international expansion but most of the ones i talked to plan to focus on expanding in the country for at least the next year or so not only is indonesia very large but it is also geographically complex with more than 17 000 islands of which about 6 000 are inhabited startups tend to launch in the greater jakarta area before expanding into other tier 1 cities like bandung and surabaya but many are eyeing smaller cities especially fintech and e commerce startups here are a few sectors that took off in 2021 and are worth keeping an eye on in 2022 investment apps a crop of investment apps many aimed at millennial and first time retail investors raised small early stage rounds at the beginning of 2021 only to quickly pick up much larger follow on funding a few months later some examples include indonesia based crypto focused pintu robo advisor bibit ajaib and pluang and singapore based syfe while rates of retail investment are still relatively low in indonesia that number is growing because of increased interest in financial planning during the pandemic and the popularity of stock influencers despite concerns about the legitimacy of some indonesian sme focused startups dig deeper into fintech according to government figures there are 62 million smes small to medium sized enterprises in indonesia but several founders told me this is likely an underestimate especially since family owned businesses or solo entrepreneurs tend to be undercounted regardless of their exact number smes many of which use excel spreadsheets or paper ledgers to handle their accounting present a lucrative opportunity for tech startups most notably bukuwarung and bukukas two competing bookkeeping apps both raised significant amounts of funding this year the two startups are similar in that they are initially focused on helping smes digitize but eventually plan to expand their product roster into financial services like working capital loans using data users have already entered into their software to judge creditworthiness some other startups that target smes include earned wage access and payroll management platform gajigesa and wagely social commerce people who live in indonesia s largest cities have a large choice of e commerce platforms to choose from but the selection is much less in more remote regions this is partly due to a fragmented logistics infrastructure but startups are also working on that including sicepat advotics kargo and waresix which means it is costly and time consuming to receive goods that is where social commerce startups like super evermos and kitabeli come in hoping to replicate the success of pinduoduo in china and meesho in india all focus on daily necessities like fast moving consumer goods and food and utilize the social commerce model to make the supply chain more efficient and affordable since orders are made in batches by people who live in the same communities in that sense they can also be described as being at least partially logistics startups e commerce aggregators startups that acquire small e commerce brands like thrasio have been attracting lots of funding in the united states and europe for several years but e commerce aggregators took a little while longer to reach southeast asia this year two e commerce aggregators officially launched there with venture capital funding and both raised follow on rounds a few months later while many e commerce aggregators focus on amazon sellers una brands refers to itself as sector agnostic there is no dominant marketplace across apac so it has developed a system to find brands across platforms like tokopedia lazada shopee rakuten and ebay on the other hand rainforest focuses on asia based amazon sellers but differentiates from other aggregators with its goal of becoming the online version of consumer goods conglomerate newell brands with so many e commerce sellers based in asia expect both una brands and rainforest to grow and other aggregators to launch
