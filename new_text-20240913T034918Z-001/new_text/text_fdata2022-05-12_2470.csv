free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased credit suisse together with its subsidiaries provides various financial services in switzerland europe the middle east africa the americas and asia pacific the company offers private banking and wealth management solutions including advisory investment financial planning succession planning and trust services and financing and lending and multi shore platform solutions credit suisse has a history of business dealings with russian oligarchs or ultra high net worth business leaders possessing significant political influence for example an article published by financial times on february 7 2022 entitled credit suisse securitizes yacht loans to oligarchs and tycoons cited a recent investor presentation for a synthetic securitization deal in which credit suisse sold off 80 million worth of risk related to a 2 billion portfolio of loans backed by assets owned by certain of the bank s ultra high net worth clients the securitization deal which disclosed that in 2017 and 2018 credit suisse experienced 12 defaults on yacht and aircraft loans a third of which were related to u s sanctions against russian oligarchs press reports at the time indicated that russian billionaires oleg deripaska arkady rotenberg and boris rotenberg had to terminate private jet leases with credit suisse in those years beginning in or around october 2021 russia commenced a major military build up near the russo ukrainian border in apparent preparation for an invasion of ukraine although the russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to invade or attack ukraine the u s later released intelligence of russian invasion plans including satellite photographs showing russian troops and equipment near the russo ukrainian border in november 2021 as russia s military buildup on the russo ukrainian border continued the company entered the securitization deal just months later on february 24 2022 russian military forces invaded ukraine in the immediate aftermath of the invasion western governments including among others the u s canada and the european union imposed significant sanctions on russia the sanctions included inter alia measures targeting russia s ultrawealthy oligarchs by denying them access to the global financial system and by in some cases authorizing the seizure of certain of their high value assets located outside of russia barely a week after the commencement of the russian invasion and the retaliatory sanctions imposed by western nations news outlets reported that credit suisse had requested non participating investors who received information about the company s loan portfolio to destroy and permanently erase any confidential information that credit suisse provided to them regarding the securitization deal the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i credit suisse had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting ii credit suisse s practice of lending money to russian oligarchs subject to u s and international sanctions created a significant risk of violating rules pertaining to those sanctions and future sanctions iii the foregoing conduct subjected the company to an increased risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and or enforcement actions iv the securitization deal concerned loans that credit suisse made to russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the u s v the purpose of the securitization deal was to offload the risks associated with these loans and mitigate the impact on credit suisse of sanctions likely to be implemented by western nations in response to russia s invasion of ukraine vi credit suisse s request that non participating investors destroy documents related to the securitization deal was intended to conceal the company s noncompliance with u s and international sanctions in its lending practices vii the foregoing once revealed was likely to subject the company to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm and viii as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on march 28 2022 the u s house of representatives committee on oversight and reform sent credit suisse a letter asking the company to turn over information and documents about a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets owned by clients potentially including sanctioned russian individuals in the letter house oversight chair carolyn maloney and rep stephen lynch chair of the subcommittee on national security questioned credit suisse s request that hedge funds and other non participating investors destroy documents related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank s clients given the timing of this request and its subject matter the house democrats wrote credit suisse s action raises significant concerns that it may be concealing information about whether participants in the deal may be evading sanctions imposed by the west after russia s invasion of ukraine on this news

ftse 100 closes 104 points higher dow s p 500 higher but nasdaq down us inflation decelerates but not as much as hoped 4 50pm footsie finds gains the ftse 100 index ended higher on wednesday helped by a morning rally from wall street blue chips after us inflation data for april showed the first deceleration since last august although it was still higher than consensus expectations at the close the uk blue chip index was 104 44 points or 1 4 higher at 7 347 66 just below the day s peak of 7 349 70 and well above the early session low of 7 238 97 in new york around london s close the dow jones industrial average was 313 points or 1 higher at 32 473 while the broader s p 500 index added 0 8 but the nasdaq composite shed 0 1 as tech stocks stayed under pressure chris beauchamp chief market analyst at online trading platform ig commented efforts to build a sustainable base for a rally continue in equities as an initial drop in us futures following the monthly us cpi figure is reversed and the opening hour of us trading sees some gains for embattled stock markets to borrow a word it is too soon to tell if the slowing of price growth is transitory or not but slowing or not 8 1 price growth is still far too hot for the fed s taste thus while we might get a short term and dramatic bounce in stocks it is highly unlikely that we have seen the end of 2022 s volatility beauchamp added jerome powell has certainly been doing his best to fight inflation through higher rates but comments from president biden in the wake of inflation data shows that the administration expects the fed to keep going in its quest to cool price growth some post cpi dollar weakness is likely to give way to more upside for the greenback at least until a global recession becomes a more distinct possibility 3 50pm windfall tax on oil firms a windfall tax on large oil and gas companies is not entirely out of the question according to sources close to the chancellor of exchequer rishi sunak may issue the tax to alleviate the surging cost of living if the firms don t reinvest their colossal record profits to accelerate the uk s transition to green energy sunak warned if sufficient investment was not upcoming then of course that is something i would look at current policy of big energy companies not being taxed on excess profits is meant to encourage investments in renewable technologies boris johnson agreed a windfall tax could put the future of uk energy under scrutiny 3 28pm shell to install 100 000 ev charging points in uk by 2030 shell plc lse shel nyse shel vowed to install 50 000 more electric vehicle ev charging points across the uk by 2030 on top of the same amount announced last year access to public charging needs to be made available to everyone no matter where you live shell s uk country chair david bunch said in a statement the energy giant aims to help the government reach its target of 300 000 ev chargers by the decade end there are just 31 000 currently so that figure must increase by tenfold in eight years the climate change committee confirmed meanwhile the department for transport said it ll invest 950mln into rapid charging points as part of its ev infrastructure strategy ev sales reached a new high in the first quarter while new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned from 2030 the initial cost to purchase an ev is far greater on average compared with fossil fuel vehicles but the operating costs are significantly lower 2 55pm us markets open lower unlike analysts expectations us indices declined on open following american inflation figures that revealed rising prices eased to 8 3 year over year in april the tech heavy nasdaq which has taken a battering in recent weeks as investors seek safe havens rather than riskier assets sunk 80 points or 0 68 the dow jones industrial average and s p 500 however experienced much smaller losses the dow fell 9 points or 0 03 to 32 152 while the s p eased 8 points or 0 19 lower to 3 994 2 27pm us inflation falls slightly to 8 3 us inflation eased slightly in april to 8 3 year over year according to the latest consumer price index cpi data released by the us bureau of labor statistics this morning however the cpi came in higher than the analyst consensus expectation of 8 1 the data indicates that while inflation remains high it may have peaked with april reporting a smaller increase than the 8 5 jump reported in march which was the fastest annual gain since december 1981 in an initial comment avatrade chief market analyst naeem aslam said the reality was that serious measures were needed to cool inflation otherwise stagflation is here the month on month cpi number is really a blowout number which no one expected and this has crushed the confidence among traders now aslam said the gold price has also crushed as traders are betting that the fed will increase the rate much faster than anticipated aslam noted that the numbers suggested that not only the fed would need to do more to control inflation but also the biden administration 2 05pm toyota profits to fall as costs surge toyota said an unprecedented hike in raw material prices could hit full year profits which are expected to fall by 20 according to a statement raw material costs are expected to double to 9bn for the year although it hopes to offset some of that by selling more vehicles with estimates currently 7 5 ahead of last year operating profit is expected to fall to 14 9bn from 18 6bn since the price of materials is rising we need to work to reduce the amount of materials we use as much as possible and to replace them with less expensive materials said chief executive kenta kon cited by the guardian 1 34pm trade unions insist uk government failed to enforce laws when dealing with p o 800 sackings trade unions have encouraged the united nations to intervene on behalf of the 800 seafarers that were unlawfully sacked by p o ferries in march they argue the uk government failed to enforce relevant labour laws and punitive sanctions following the layoffs unions believe it was a huge violation of the international labour organisation s principle on collective bargaining and the freedom of association the government did however introduce new laws this week in the queen s speech that stated all ferry operators using uk ports must pay sea workers at least minimum wage stephen cotton international transport workers federation general secretary said p o ferries ceo has admitted the company behaved illegally when it fired 800 seafarers without warning in march and he has told parliament he would do the same again p o ferries has behaved in the most calculated and egregious way and expects to get away with it 12 59pm two in five workers anxious to return to office nearly 40 of workers said they re worried about returning to the office as normality resumes following the covid 19 pandemic slack the messaging application surveyed 1 000 workers and found almost half of them said hybrid working is best for their mental health just two in five think their employer cares for their mental wellbeing seven out of 10 said a four day working week would improve their mental health many respondents believed returning to the office would affect their work life balance with just 25 able to choose when they go into the office half blamed the rising cost of food and travel for their hesitancy to return chris mills of slack said an employee who is cared for and supported will be inspired to do their best work it s positive to see uk workers highlighting that hybrid work and technology has an important part to play in their wellbeing 12 29pm us markets expected to open higher us markets are expected to open higher as investors eye key inflation data scheduled for release before the start of trade that are likely to shape the extent of the federal reserve s future interest rate hikes futures for the dow jones industrial average gained 0 78 in wednesday premarket trading while those for the broader s p 500 index rose 0 96 and the nasdaq added 1 1 markets ended mixed on tuesday a day after the worst day for global stocks since june 2020 as shares of technology companies regained some lost ground the nasdaq finished 1 higher at 11 738 after sinking 4 3 on monday the s p 500 eked out a 0 25 gain to end at 4 001 but the dow lost 0 26 to close at 32 161 markets have begun to stabilise over the last 24 hours following monday s rout but there s no doubt that risk appetite is still very subdued as worries about a potential recession gather pace commented jim reid chief credit strategist at deutsche bank april s consumer price index cpi is expected to show year on year inflation of 8 1 with a month on month increase of 0 2 march s reading of 8 5 was the fastest annual gain since december 1981 the report is due for release at 8 30am eastern time this will be a very important one for markets and the fed since although policymakers have strongly signalled that they re inclined to continue hiking by 50bps basis points at the next couple of meetings there is still 25 50 75bps to play for after those meetings reid added today s report will help shape the early read into this and has an ability to move markets in a large manner if diverging from consensus too far 11 59am national grid to pay uk homes 200mln within two years national grid revealed it ll pay 200mln in excess revenues to uk homes within the next two years rather than waiting for the culmination of the five year review period the premature payback which the energy regulator approved is meant to reduce energy bills and alleviate the rising cost of living crisis although ofgem has not decided how the money will be repaid to households from the company s power link profits which are paid when a predetermined cap is exceeded john pettigrew chief executive of national grid said while national grid s impact on customer bills is relatively small we strive every day to keep our costs as low as possible given how challenging the current rise in overall energy costs is for people across the country we want to play our part in helping reduce consumer bills that s why we have requested this change to our standard regulatory process and are working with ofgem to accelerate payments over the next two years to make a difference now 11 28am 1 5mln uk homes food and energy bills to exceed disposable income new research from a think tank expects nearly 1 5mln households across the uk to face food and energy bills that are more than their disposable income national institute of economic and social research niesr believes the highest incidence rates will be in london and scotland according to its research the war in ukraine and the impact this has had on prices would lead to a further rise in inflation and consequentially a fall in output and real income gdp is expected to slow over the next few years due to a combination of stocks such as war brexit covid and energy prices niesr also added that the chancellor rishi sunak should provide a further 2 85bn of support in a one off 250 payment to 11 3mln lower income households to cushion the income shock for the next year 10 57am scottish mortage no longer uk s largest trust scottish mortgage investment trust is no longer britain s largest investment trust by market cap according to interactive investor replaced by 3i group plc lse iii a brutal tech sell off so far this year has seen the trust lose 38 of its share price with its current market cap now 11 5bn scottish mortgage investment trust provides global exposure to disruptive growth companies public and private selected by highly experienced managers said dzmitry lipski head of fund research at interactive investor the strength of their stock picking skills combined with strong risk adjusted performance and competitive fees make this a good choice for adventurous long term investors investors should note however that it is higher risk investment due to its high portfolio concentration exposure to unquoted companies and tech stocks the risks of all this is enhanced further by gearing borrowing so it works better as a satellite holding in a well diversified portfolio the style bias of the trust is toward growth with less attention paid to valuation meaning it can complement other funds with a core or value style orientation despite the recent sell off or as long term investors would say short term volatility it is still well positioned to grow and reward patient investors over the longer term the size of assets should continue to provide easier access to more opportunities in both public and private markets and the managers expertise and their commitment to work with academia should allow them to find modern portfolio ideas and maintain a competitive edge against other players support and access to wider resources from baillie gifford are also important especially in such challenging times 10 12am quick snapshot ftse 100 started today as it finished yesterday gaining 90 points to 7 333 as us stocks recovered slightly after monday s battering elon musk said he would reverse donald trump s twitter ban if his bid were to be successful the world s richest man claimed the decision was morally wrong and flat out stupid ilika said trading for the

month low on tuesday looking around tui ag lse tui the german tour operator is helping drive positive sentiment saying it expects to climb back into the black this year as the travel market continues to recover the today s update indicates that bookings are moving in a positive trajectory and holidaymakers are yet to be dissuaded by the 20 jump in peak season average selling prices versus 2019 this suggests that tui can pass some of its additional costs from rising fuel bills and cost inflation onto customers as it aims to simultaneously pay back its debts and restore profitability said victoria scholar market analyst at interactive investor elsewhere in ftse 100 company results a positive first quarter update from itv plc lse itv where it beat expectations for ad revenues has not helped its shares recover after the fright markets took to its march launch of another streaming service itvx reports that the company might be interested in a 1bn bid for channel 4 have been treated with indifference with the shares earlier this week sliding to their lowest levels since october 2020 and up only a fraction of a penny this morning all in all today s update while a decent one does little to inspire confidence that itv has a clear strategy when it comes to its digital offering and certainly doesn t inspire confidence that it can reach its target of 750m of digital revenue by 2026 said market analyst michael hewson at cmc markets 8 29am positive start delivered the ftse 100 made a positive start to the trading day with the overnight recovery in us stocks helping to buoy

making a new one year low at 3 958 before recovering back above 4 000 to eke out a modest gain while the nasdaq 100 closed higher and the dow closed lower said michael hewson analyst at cmc markets this slightly more positive turn should help markets here in europe open modestly higher this morning he added we ve seen plenty of speculation as to whether we re close to seeing a plateau in short

a severe shortage in baby formula has drawn the attention of members of iowa s congressional delegation and has become a campaign issue as well spot shortages in many groceries and pharmacies have been exacerbated by a food and drug administration recall that stopped production at abbot s largest u s formula manufacturing plant in michigan as supply disruptions and the massive safety recall have continued several big box retailers have begun rationing sales of the formula it s very concerning sen chuck grassley told reporters wednesday after hearing about the scarcity at his county meetings grassley wrote the fda to ask what it is doing to address the shortage he cited reports that at least 40 of baby formula supplies in the u s are completely depleted iowa was among six mostly midwestern states where more than half of all baby formula was completely sold out during the week of april 24 it s pretty much looking for a needle in a haystack rachel beadle who recently moved from marion to des moines told the gazette in april according to the biden administration the fda is working around the clock to address the shortage manufacturers say they re producing at full capacity but it s still not enough to meet demand i m going to keep on top of it we got to help families feed their kids and empty shelves are unacceptable grassley said finkenauer push that s not enough for former u s rep abby finkenauer who is among democrats seeking to challenge grassley s re election this fall she called it shocking that it has taken grassley and other members of congress this long to address a national crisis when you have people not being able to feed their children the nutrition they need to thrive and survive finkenauer has called for the biden administration to invoke the defense production act to force manufacturers to produce more formula we need all hands on deck to address the dangerous shortage of baby formula in iowa and across the country finkenauer said invoking the act would bring any and all federal resources to the table to increase the supply of baby formula and address the shortage it just seems like the rational and right thing to do she said it might be an appropriate tool grassley said when asked about invoking the act but didn t think it would necessarily solve the contamination issues that led to the production shutdown at abbott you wouldn t want to put the defense production act into action and then produce unsafe food he said timeline sought iowa republican rep ashley hinson joined a colleague in writing the fda asking for a timeline for when baby formula is expected to be sufficiently restocked as well as a long term plan to minimize supply chain disruptions for formula parents who are unsure how to provide this essential sustenance for their babies and worried about the nutritional impacts of this supply chain shortage hinson and new york republican rep elise stefanik wrote as moms ourselves we know the stress this is causing in so many households families already worried about higher food and fuel prices now have the added stress of not knowing if the baby formula they need will even be in stock hinson said she called on the biden administration to prioritize fixing supply chain disruptions to replenish the supply of infant formula i ll work with anyone who will work with me to ensure that families don t have this extra burden she said bipartisan effort iowa republican rep miller meeks has joined bipartisan legislation to encourage competition reduce costs and improve the quality of infant formula options available through the women infants and children program by creating an online database it s a companion to bipartisan senate legislation fourth district republican rep randy feenstra called the situation dire threatening babies who rely on formula for their health and development he joined a colleague in proposing the formula act to direct the fda to establish and communicate to congress clear standards by which it domestically regulates infant formula gazette des moines bureau chief erin murphy contributed to this report

article the u s food and drug administration announced it will allow abbott to resume producing certain baby formula products on a case by case basis after a massive safety recall earlier this year the announcement comes as many parents scramble to find baby formula because the recall and supply disruptions have led to a nationwide shortage in february abbott one of the country s largest infant formula makers issued a voluntary recall affecting certain lots of similac alimentum and elecare with expiration dates of april 1 2022 or later the product was distributed throughout the u s and overseas the company said in a statement the fda then warned parents not to use the product due to its investigation of four reports of infants who were hospitalized after consuming the formula including one who died the agency said one of the cases involved salmonella and three involved cronobacter sakazakiim a rare but dangerous germ that can cause blood infections and other serious complications related baby formula shortage has parents on the hunt for product the company shuttered its sturgis michigan plant before fda inspectors visited the plant in march and found lax safety protocols and traces of the bacteria on several surfaces none of the bacterial strains matched those collected from the infants however and the fda hasn t offered an explanation for how the contamination occurred since that time the agency has been working with abbott and other manufacturers to bring safe products to the u s market the fda said on its website we recognize that many consumers have been unable to access infant formula and critical medical foods they are accustomed to using and are frustrated by their inability to do so fda commissioner robert m califf said in a statement we are doing everything in our power to ensure there is adequate product available where and when they need it prior to the recall fda officials were combating the global supply chain crisis which affected the supply of baby formula the agency said it continues to address the issue related baby formula shortage 40 of major brands sold out across the u s analysts say u s health officials say they re also meeting with manufacturers to understand how they can increase production streamlining and expediting the review process that could increase supply monitoring the status of baby formula supply and compiling data trends to make sure formula is available in the right locations however they still advise parents not to make their own infant formula but encourage them to work with their child s health care provider for recommendations on changing feeding practices if needed for now pediatricians and health workers are urging parents who can t find formula to contact food banks or doctor s offices they also warn against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online diy recipes trying to keep formula in stock retailers including cvs and walgreens have begun limiting purchases to three containers per customer nationwide about 40 of large retail stores are out of stock up from 31 in mid april according to datasembly a data analytics firm more than half of u s states are seeing out of stock rates between 40 and 50 according to the firm which collects data from 11 000 locations baby formula is particularly vulnerable to disruptions because just a handful of companies account for almost the entire u s supply the associated press contributed to this report this story was reported from los angeles
the idea that we might be headed toward a softish landing was probably the great victim of the april report on the consumer price index cpi consumer prices were up another 0 3 percent in april for a higher than expected 8 3 percent annual gain the official consensus had inflation slowing to a 0 2 percent monthly gain and 8 1 percent over the previous 12 months but many analysts including those at bank of america were forecasting a 7 9 percent year over year gain and there was talk that an inflation report that began with a seven handle could spark a major stock rally sure enough stock futures showed the market was preparing for a substantial jump prior to the report s release at 8 30 wednesday morning the theory ran something like this if inflation had already dropped 50 or 60 basis points in april after the fed had hiked just 25 basis points at the end of march then the central bank would not have to squeeze financial conditions too tight to restore something like price stability looser financial conditions would be good for stocks especially the high flying growth stocks that had led the market up in the previous two years no dice headline inflation came in just 20 basis points despite a powerful base effect resulting from the fact that prices were already rising rapidly a year ago while the monthly figure was down substantially it was not down by as much as expected perhaps even more importantly there were signs that underlying inflation strengthened in april exactly the opposite of what was expected let s start with core inflation which is cpi minus food and fuel we jokingly call this inflation minus essentials but there is a good reason why economists want to look past it to detect underlying price pressures gas prices for example can be quite volatile and are subject to manipulation both by the opec cartel and our own government s policies food prices are also volatile and subject to idiosyncratic pressures that might not show up in the broader economy core prices were up 0 6 percent in april compared with the previous month twice as much as the month before inside core inflation we see little evidence of an easing of supply chain problems furniture prices rose 1 5 percent bringing the 12 month gain up to 15 percent tools and hardware were up 0 6 monthly and 11 2 annually new vehicle prices climbed 1 1 percent for the month and were up 13 2 percent for the year somewhat offsetting these gains were declines in used car prices apparel and appliances but only on a monthly basis compared with a year ago prices on all of these are up sharply on balance though core goods rose 0 2 percent for an annual gain of 9 7 percent more than reversing the 0 4 percent decline recorded in march so much for the idea that inflation peaked in march part of the expectation for april was the idea that there would be a handoff from goods to services obviously with core goods up no such thing occurred instead all we got was an increase in core services prices these rose 0 7 percent in april up from 0 6 percent a month earlier compared with a year ago core services cpi was up 4 9 percent rents were up half a percentage point for an annual gain of 5 2 percent lodging at hotels and motels jumped two percent for an annual gain of 22 6 percent this sent the stock market plunging the nasdaq composite dropped 3 18 percent and the dow jones industrial average fell one percent to put that in context the nasdaq is now down nearly 30 percent from its november high for the biden presidency the nasdaq is down by around 13 percent maybe instead of talking about a soft landing people should start wondering when we ll land at all so far all we re doing is falling

mass sell off of digital assets triggered by the terrausd ust stablecoin implosion against its 1 1 dollar peg it is a very nervous time in crypto markets following the collapse of the controversial stablecoin ust and as the majority of institutional crypto investors that invested last year are now losing money oanda americas senior market analyst edward moya wrote terra blockchain luna token token which was created as a buffer against the volatility of ust stablecoin plunged 96 at one point after the luna foundation guard the non profit established to support the terra network moved its reserves to bitcoin exchanges to defend the dollar peg ust dropped as low as 23 cents before recovering to 77 cents later in the day stable it wasn t bitcoin the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at 28 500 down about 7 although it fared better than most other major cryptos underscoring its status as a less risky option during tumultuous times for the wider

luna and ust the token and stablecoin of singapore based terraform labs continued spiraling as ust s key design imploded and trader sentiment around luna plummeted the impact wasn t limited to niche regions of the internet either as suicide helplines trended on community forums centered on terra ust a stablecoin pegged to u s dollars fell to as low as 28 cents on wednesday despite being backed by the likes of big name crypto venture funds such as three arrows capital and the luna foundation guard lfg the de pegging however was unsurprising several algorithmic stablecoins have failed over the past two years and none have thrived examples include iron finance and its titan tokens basis cash empty set dollar dynamic set dollar and many more these equated to millions of dollars in losses for investors algorithmic stablecoins like ust are backed by a basket of assets such as luna and bitcoin btc without depending on any centralized third party to hold those assets this is unlike tether and usd coin whose parent firms claim to hold actual dollars in bank accounts to sufficiently back the values of usdt and usdc respectively tokens such as ust depend on luna to maintain a price of 1 using a set of on chain mint and burn mechanics traders can always swap 1 worth of ust for 1 worth of luna and vice versa with luna s growing value serving as a shock absorber for ust s price however the mechanism of algorithmically governed stablecoins like ust makes them susceptible to the colloquial bank run as an example consider terra s luna and ust tokens a sudden fall in luna prices affects ust s entire stabilizing mechanism because users can no longer redeem their 1 of ust for 1 of luna this creates a downward spiral as falling ust prices affect sentiment around luna and a luna sell off leads to lower ust prices a case in point is wednesday s price action luna fell below 6 a 96 drop since tuesday while ust slumped to 28 cents analysts and market observers say algorithmic stablecoins remain a cause for concern now algorithmic stablecoins we see on the market today are innately brittle due to their design said kate kurbanova cofounder of risk management platform apostro in a telegram chat they try to hold the peg by using different algorithms market incentives and so on but nevertheless they are highly vulnerable and rely on the market and reference asset price however such experiments work as there is a demand for stablecoins especially when it comes to juicy apy kurbanova added reasoning their popularity the takeaway retail participants should perhaps stay away from algorithmic stablecoins that aren t ready for prime time just yet as the many failed experiments and dollar losses prove it s not like the crypto market isn t enough of a risky asset class already technician s take bitcoin struggles near 27k 30k support zone bitcoin btc is down by 6 over the past 24 hours and is trading at the bottom of a year long price range the cryptocurrency could find support between 27 000 and 30 000 although negative momentum signals point to additional breakdowns the relative strength index rsi on the daily chart is deeply oversold similar to what occurred on jan 24 of this year and may 20 of last year still in a downtrend oversold conditions can persist for a few weeks before an upswing in price occurs on the weekly chart the rsi is the most oversold since march 2020 which preceded a strong rally this time however long term momentum has deteriorated suggesting limited upside beyond the upper 40 000 45 000 resistance zone for now a relief rally

information we use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate our business and monitor ongoing results of operations adjusted ebitda is defined as income loss before depreciation and amortization stock based compensation interest expense income taxes acquisition restructuring and integration costs ipo readiness costs and other one time non recurring costs adjusted ebitda margin represents the adjusted ebitda for the applicable period divided by the revenue for that period presented in accordance with gaap for the periods included herein we also present operating expenses excluding stock based compensation for comparability since there were no stock based compensation expense for the periods prior to the company s initial public offering we use non gaap financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a gaap basis we believe that excluding certain items from our gaap results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare gaap based financial measures moreover we believe these non gaap financial measures provide our shareholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons although we believe these measures are useful to investors and analysts for the same reasons they are useful to management as discussed below these measures are not a substitute for or superior to u s gaap financial measures or disclosures our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies other companies including companies in our industry may calculate non gaap financial measures differently than we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes ias is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward looking guidance of adjusted ebitda to net income loss the most closely comparable gaap measure because certain material reconciling items such as depreciation and amortization interest expense income tax expense benefit and acquisition restructuring and integration expenses cannot be estimated due to factors outside of ias s control and could have a material impact on the reported results however ias estimates stock based compensation expense for the second quarter of 2022 in the range of 10 0 million to 11 0 million and for the full year 2022 in the range of 42 0 million to 45 0 million a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort reconciliations of historical adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap financial measure net income loss and operating expenses excluding stock based compensation to operating expenses are presented below we encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non gaap financial measures for each of the periods presented in future fiscal periods we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items reconciliation of adjusted ebitda in thousands three months ended march 31 2022 2021 net income loss 1 159 2 772

operating activities in the period minus payments for property and equipment made in the period fcf is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules management believes however that fcf is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance as it measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations fcf should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of fcf is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other obligations payments made for business acquisitions amounts spent to buy back shares or pay dividends therefore we believe it is important to view fcf as supplemental to our entire statement of cash flows

the idea that we might be headed toward a softish landing was probably the great victim of the april report on the consumer price index cpi consumer prices were up another 0 3 percent in april for a higher than expected 8 3 percent annual gain the official consensus had inflation slowing to a 0 2 percent monthly gain and 8 1 percent over the previous 12 months but many analysts including those at bank of america were forecasting a 7 9 percent year over year gain and there was talk that an inflation report that began with a seven handle could spark a major stock rally sure enough stock futures showed the market was preparing for a substantial jump prior to the report s release at 8 30 wednesday morning the theory ran something like this if inflation had already dropped 50 or 60 basis points in april after the fed had hiked just 25 basis points at the end of march then the central bank would not have to squeeze financial conditions too tight to restore something like price stability looser financial conditions would be good for stocks especially the high flying growth stocks that had led the market up in the previous two years no dice headline inflation came in just 20 basis points despite a powerful base effect resulting from the fact that prices were already rising rapidly a year ago while the monthly figure was down substantially it was not down by as much as expected perhaps even more importantly there were signs that underlying inflation strengthened in april exactly the opposite of what was expected let s start with core inflation which is cpi minus food and fuel we jokingly call this inflation minus essentials but there is a good reason why economists want to look past it to detect underlying price pressures gas prices for example can be quite volatile and are subject to manipulation both by the opec cartel and our own government s policies food prices are also volatile and subject to idiosyncratic pressures that might not show up in the broader economy core prices were up 0 6 percent in april compared with the previous month twice as much as the month before inside core inflation we see little evidence of an easing of supply chain problems furniture prices rose 1 5 percent bringing the 12 month gain up to 15 percent tools and hardware were up 0 6 monthly and 11 2 annually new vehicle prices climbed 1 1 percent for the month and were up 13 2 percent for the year somewhat offsetting these gains were declines in used car prices apparel and appliances but only on a monthly basis compared with a year ago prices on all of these are up sharply on balance though core goods rose 0 2 percent for an annual gain of 9 7 percent more than reversing the 0 4 percent decline recorded in march so much for the idea that inflation peaked in march part of the expectation for april was the idea that there would be a handoff from goods to services obviously with core goods up no such thing occurred instead all we got was an increase in core services prices these rose 0 7 percent in april up from 0 6 percent a month earlier compared with a year ago core services cpi was up 4 9 percent rents were up half a percentage point for an annual gain of 5 2 percent lodging at hotels and motels jumped two percent for an annual gain of 22 6 percent this sent the stock market plunging the nasdaq composite dropped 3 18 percent and the dow jones industrial average fell one percent to put that in context the nasdaq is now down nearly 30 percent from its november high for the biden presidency the nasdaq is down by around 13 percent maybe instead of talking about a soft landing people should start wondering when we ll land at all so far all we re doing is falling

considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the claim is based on one study that looked at a small group of students and there is no comprehensive data source that tracks student borrower graduation rates in late april following president joe biden s extension of the student loan payment pause and the renewed conversation about widespread debt forgiveness vlogger and youtube creator hank green tweeted that 40 of americans who take out student loans do not graduate from college he s not the first to make this claim rep alma adams d nc and sen elizabeth warren d mass both made the same claim last year the question do 40 of americans who take out student loans not graduate from college the sources national center for education statistics nces jill barshay an economist and education data reporter for the non profit hechinger report which reports on inequality and innovation in education the answer this claim needs context a department of education survey found that about 40 of student borrowers surveyed didn t graduate but the survey s sample size was small and only spanned a six year period what we found the national center for education statistics nces routinely surveys cohorts of first time beginning students in what it calls the beginning postsecondary students survey the bps surveys students at the end of their first year and then again three years and six years after first entering college nces has completed four of these studies the last of which was the beginning postsecondary students 2012 2017 survey the 2012 2017 bps found that of surveyed freshmen who started college in 2011 and took out loans for their college education between 2011 and 2017 38 5 did not have a degree by june 2017 that s where the 40 figure comes from but the survey has several limitations the survey is based on the responses from 22 500 students who were first enrolled in 2011 12 and responded again to the survey six years later according to the nces s digest of education statistics total fall enrollment for first time degree seeking or certificate seeking students has hovered around 3 million since 2008 that means nces surveyed fewer than 1 of 2011 freshmen the survey also didn t continue beyond june 2017 which means it leaves out anyone who may have earned a degree more than six years after they first enrolled the nces says that just over 25 of bachelor s degree recipients from 2015 16 took longer than six years from the date they first enrolled to get their degree according to jill barshay an economist and education data reporter for the non profit hechinger report which reports on inequality and innovation in education there s a good reason why the data is so limited there is no readily available data to say what percentage of student borrowers never graduate from college barshay said we can only make estimates by triangulating several data sources that aren t comparing apples to apples barshay said a major issue with trying to measure this data is determining how long borrowers have to graduate school before they re included among borrowers who never earned a degree

open up for questions we are pleased to report our revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was slightly higher than our guidance of 25 5 million revenue for the quarter was 26 million an increase of 271 from the prior period we generated over 43 million in new bookings during the quarter of which our extraction division had record quarterly bookings of 20 million we currently have a total pipeline of over 375 million as a reminder when it comes to our bookings and pipeline numbers agrify reports the total value of our extraction solutions and non ttk cash based vfu purchases but for our ttk engagements we only include the first three years of the expected revenue even though the partnership is typically 10 years from a bookings and pipeline perspective we only include the upfront facility construction costs and the first two years of the saas and estimated production success fees which is based on the assumption that each of our vfus will produce 35 pounds of dry flower per year i would like to first share with you the significant progress we are making with our extraction division in the last seven months we have strategically propelled ourselves to the top of the rapidly growing cannabis extraction industry becoming the formidable leader in this space through the intentional acquisition of the four leading extraction brands we have successfully integrated finance legal hr it and marketing we have consolidated the sales team and established territories with targeted accounts we have 19 employees that are part of our extraction division s sales team the team is focused on upselling and cross selling all of our high quality extraction solution as well as our services related to lab design installation and training in addition we re seeing our vfu customers buying extraction solutions and our extraction customer wanting to learn more about our vfus as mentioned in our prior call once integrated we plan to extend our ttk program into the extraction sites last week our extraction division announced the launch of the px5 the most advanced and scalable passive hydrocarbon extractor in the industry the px5 s unique passive recovery design offers immediate economic benefits to cannabis operators of any size by increasing the daily production up to 33 savings of up to 40 annually in energy costs and increasing hourly extracted production by over 200 yesterday our extraction division announced a multimillion dollar sale to boone labs that will outfit a new production facility with a complete range of agrify offerings including 72 of our vertical farming units vfus solidness extraction hydrocarbon extraction and ice water hash solution this is our cultivation and extraction coming together for a complete agrify sales to a single customer as mentioned earlier our extraction division had a record quarterly new bookings in q1 of 20 million we continue to expect our extraction division to be accretive and produce revenue of between 62 million to 65 million for fiscal year 2022 with gross profit margin of 30 or greater now i will turn to the cultivation side of our business and of course our total terpene solution in april we announced our first new jersey ttk with loud wellness loud wellness is one of the only 18 licensed cultivation and manufacturing operators in new jersey these 500 vfus partnership is expected to generate approximately 18 million of high margin production success and saas fees over the next 10 years we estimate the commissioning of the vfus for this project to be in q2 of 2023 with the first harvest happening in q3 of 2023 on the mso front we also were very excited to announce our second agreement with a prominent multistate operator this time with greenlight cannabis greenlight is a rapidly growing mso in the united states with 28 locations across five states under the agreement with greenlight we will be installing vfus that will enable greenlight to increase its growth cannabis in order to achieve rapid business growth and geographic expansion under one standard internationally we are pleased that in april we consummated our first vfu agreement with a european customer biocann pharmaceutical which is based in portugal will be deploying 190 vfus at its 25 000 square feet state of the art cultivation facility the engagement with biocann will help agrify begin to pave the path for success on a global scale as we continue to put in place the ability to manufacture our vfus locally and provide quality vfu installation and support for future european based customers as of today agrify has contractual commitments of 4 569 vfus that will be powered by the agrify insights cultivation and production software 3 783 of these vfus were committed to as part of the ttk program which required customers to pay both production and saas fees for up to 10 years and it also typically includes agrify providing a variety of other value added services the remaining 786 vfus were sold to customers through onetime equipment sales but still require these customers to pay monthly saas fees on a per vfus basis assuming 35 pounds of production per year per vfu cumulatively alter the vfus under agrify ttk solutions or the saas agreements will produce an estimated 923 million in total revenue over the course of the next 10 years of which 674 million is an anticipated high margin production success fees 129 million in anticipated high margin saas and approximately 95 million is in construction related fees it is important to reiterate once more that our ttk business assumes that each agrify vfu produces 35 pounds of cannabis flowers per year or on average seven pounds per harvest with five harvests per year we are extremely pleased to share with you that one of our vfu customers in nevada has consistently produced over 9 pounds per harvest over the last two months with certain strains hitting as high as 11 plus pounds and with thc concentration as high as 34 and a productivity rate of 5 2 turns per year this customer is on track to produce close to 50 pound of dry flowers per vfu on annual basis this is a strong validation of the robust capabilities and the performance of our vfus i would also like to update you on our progress with various customer facilities as this is tied to when our anticipated high margin recurring revenue from our ttk customers and non ttk vfu customers will begin to formalize in the state of nevada we will begin to charge our non ttk vfu customer whitecloud saas fees this quarter next week we will begin vfu conventioning with our las vega based ttk customer treehouse and will begin charging both saas and production success fees next quarter in washington and colorado we expect to go live with hannah and greenstone in early july and will begin to charge saas fees in the third quarter with anticipated production success fees coming in in the fourth quarter of this year furthermore we expect to begin commissioning our vfs for the massachusetts base ttk partner bud mary s before the end of 2022 and charging saas and production fees in the first quarter of 2023 we have also moved ahead with the a e and several plants with our florida ttk customer gold leaf and our arizona partner i m also pleased to inform you that el mirage officially received their license through the social equity lottery on april 8 under the name of woodstock one el mirage is our arizona ttk partner as you can see we are making excellent headwind with our customer deployment schedules and we expect to start generating high margin recurring saas and production fees sooner than initially planned now let s spend a minute to talk about our future ttk financing we plan to finance our future cultivation facility construction requirements with debt based investment partners which include reits among other types of investors we expect our debt based investment partners to finance in average 60 to 80 of the construction while agrify contributed the remaining capital today we are pleased to announce that we have recently entered into a term sheet with our first debt based construction financing partner and we expect to finalize that partnership along with the new ttk project in the near future the combination of our current balance sheet and this leverage financing structure should give agrify the ability to scale significantly while maximizing shareholder value in summary we are very pleased with the accomplishments achieved for the first four months of the year and we look forward to generating high margin recurring revenues in the second half of 2022 now i would like to turn the call over to tim to talk about the results from the quarter timothy oakes chief financial officer thank you raymond and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on today s earnings call similar to our last earnings call i ll speak to our first quarter 2022 financial results and then i ll pass the call back to raymond for closing remarks overall our first quarter 22 financial performance is in line with our expectations revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was 26 million compared to revenue of 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 this represents a 271 year over year increase in comparative quarterly revenue the comparative increase in our first quarter 2022 revenue is attributable to incremental revenue from our extraction division of approximately 12 4 million combined with an increase in ttk related design and build work organically excluding the extraction revenue contribution which was not part of our revenue mix in the first quarter of 2021 first quarter cultivation related revenue increased by 94 non cannabis and related party revenues declined from 5 5 million or 79 of total revenue in the year ago first quarter period to 1 3 million or 4 9 of total revenue in the first quarter of 2022 bookings in the first quarter of 2022 were approximately 43 million of which as raymond mentioned 20 million was related to extraction products the bookings amount includes ttk related bookings which consists of construction and recurring saas and production success fees as well as product bookings including both cultivation and extraction equipment amounts we entered the second quarter of fiscal 2022 with approximately 923 million in backlog compared to 82 million in backlog entering the second quarter of fiscal 2021 a significant portion of our reported backlog amount is derived from the future ttk related recurring revenue streams associated with both our saas and production success fees total gross profit and the associated gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2022 was 4 2 million or 16 of total revenue compared to a negative gross margin of 540 000 or 8 of total revenue in the year ago quarter gross profit and gross margin improvements in the comparative year over year quarterly period is solely related to the incremental profit and margin contributions provided by the company s extraction product sales extraction related revenues achieved a gross margin of approximately 33 in the first quarter of 2022 with cultivation associated revenue including ttk related revenues which in the current quarter consisted primarily of design and billed revenue contributing a gross margin of approximately 1 moving on to operating expenses first quarter 2022 general and administrative expenses increased by 5 3 million or 118 to 9 8 million compared to 4 5 million in the year ago quarter the comparative increase in g a expense in 2022 is related to overall growth in the scale of the business including incremental g a assumed in connection with our recent acquisitions plus increases in depreciation amortization expense associated with the intangible assets and onetime charges related to direct acquisition costs investment banker termination fees and restructuring charges these increases were offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense the company recorded a significant amount of stock based compensation during the first quarter of 2021 in connection with its initial public offering which triggered the accelerated vesting of outstanding unvested stock options granted to employees sales and marketing expenses totaled 2 1 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 600 000 in the first quarter of 2021 the comparative increase is also related to the company increasing the scale of its business and strategically focusing on investments in sales and marketing activities such as headcount trade shows marketing programs etc necessary to drive our rapid growth research and development expense in the first quarter of 2022 totaled 2 1 million compared to 900 000 in the year ago quarter the increase in research and development expense is essentially reflective of the company s need to improve and upgrade the agrify insight saas software as well as the hardware features and functionality of its vertical farming units the company as of march 31 2022 is currently monitoring two separate contingent earn out consideration arrangements associated with the acquisitions of pure pressure and labs society each of the arrangements contains two consecutive 12 month earn out periods the potential additional consideration that can be earned under each of the two earn outs is capped at 1 5 million per year under the pure pressure earn out arrangement and 1 75 million per year under the lab society earn out arrangement the company has made initial estimates with respect to the probability of achievement of the additional consideration and recorded it as part of our initial purchase price accounting associated with each acquisition we will continue to evaluate on a routine periodic basis future performance against our initial assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis any identified changes to our original assumptions that generate a change to our initial fair value estimates of the probable earn out achievement will result in either an increase to or a reduction to our future periodic operating expenses lightly touching upon other income and expenses the company is reporting total other income of 662 000 for the first quarter of 2022 compared to total other expense of 32 000 in the first quarter of 2021 the increase in other income is directly related to the interest accrued on the outstanding loan receivable balances associated with our ttk related construction advances during the first quarter of 2021 the company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of the convertible promissory notes in the amount of 2 7 million in connection with the de recognition of the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt as it relates to our reported income tax benefit the benefit from income taxes in the first quarter 22 was primarily due to a discrete income tax benefit of 200 000 attributable to a non recurring partial release of the company s u s valuation allowance as a result of the lab society acquisition no provision or benefit for income taxes was reported in the first quarter of 2021 we consolidate the results of operations of less than wholly owned entities in our consolidated results of operations specifically agrify valiant llc which is a joint venture limited liability company in which we are 60 majority owner and valiant america llc owns the remaining 40 the reported net income or loss in each of the presented quarterly periods ended march 31 2022 and 2021 represents a portion of the periodic income or loss attributable to the non controlling parties finally the net results of the previously discussed changes in revenue gross margin and operating expenses resulted in a net loss of 8 9 million or 0 36 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2022 compared to a loss of 3 8 million or 0 33 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2021 adjusted ebitda amounted to a loss of 6 1 million during the first quarter of 2022 compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of 4 2 million in the year ago quarter additional information regarding our use of non gaap measures including a reconciliation to the most comparable gaap measures can be found in the press release we issued earlier this morning which is also available on the investor relations section of our website at ir agrify com finally providing an update on our cash restricted cash and marketable securities balances we entered the second quarter of 2022 with a combined amount of cash restricted cash and marketable securities of 93 4 million compared to a balance of 56 5 million as of december 31 2021 the net increase in our cash related balances is largely due to the two capital raising activities completed by the company during the first quarter of 2022 as discussed during our fourth quarter full year 2021 earnings call we noted that in january 22 we announced the closing of a 27 3 million private placement and additionally in march 2022 we announced the finalization of a debt facility arrangement which enabled the company subject to certain performance requirements to access up to approximately 135 million in debt financing upon closing the company made an initial draw of 65 million against the debt facility offsetting the increases in cash provided from our first two first quarter transactions were outflows of cash associated with our current quarter loss from operations approximately 16 4 million in inventory build approximately 12 5 million in ttk related construction payments 3 7 million in purchases of property and equipment 3 5 million in purchase price consideration paid in connection with the lab society acquisition and approximately 2 7 million in debt issuance costs associated with the debt facility with that i d now like to turn the call back to raymond for final comments raymond chang chief executive officer thank you tim i would like to turn to our guidance for fiscal year 2022 given our strong performance to date we are reiterating our revenue expectation of between 140 million and 142 million for 2022 reflecting an increase of approximately 134 when compared to the 59 9 million generated in the fiscal year of 2021 to give you a little more color on cadence for the year we expect that more than 60 of our projected revenue for the year will be achieved in the second half in summary we are thrilled to carry our strong momentum into 2022 we have continued to make tremendous progress on the successful execution of our business and growth strategies in a number of ways we have expanded our customer base across our cultivation and extraction divisions we have entered new markets with our vfus including europe new jersey and we continue to sign agreements with prominent msos across both our cultivation and extraction divisions we also continue to push forward on all of our ttk projects and further innovate and improve our product offerings we are especially excited to have new customer facilities coming online this quarter and more in the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023 which will be a crucial inflection point for our business model as more and more of our high margin recurring revenue streams begin to flow in i look forward to providing you with further exciting updates on our progress over the next several quarters i would like to now open up the call to questions from our audience operator please go ahead questions answers operator our first question comes from aaron grey with alliance global partners aaron grey alliance global partners analyst hi good morning and thank you for the questions raymond chang chief executive officer good morning aaron aaron grey alliance global partners analyst good morning so first question for me just want to think a little bit longer term with the ttk program and the performance based fees more specifically just on the floor pricing i know you guys have announced for some of them the 500 saas in terms of certain markets where you might see more pricing pressure over time particularly because massachusetts is obviously a key market for you guys for ttk programs how do you think about potentially adjusting that over the long term obviously it s mostly margin for you guys so not too big of an impact just less revenue maybe dropping down but just to make sure your partners are able to succeed over the long term and maybe you could provide some color in terms of what you re doing in some of the more mature markets like colorado and washington that could provide some line of sight in terms of how that could trend over time in other markets thank you raymond chang chief executive officer sure aaron great question obviously we understand very clearly that our success hinges on our customers success right so i think it s very we always encourage our customers to basically go beyond just per pound fee they really need to look at basically the overall return on investment out of that the facility that they operate and with agrify solution we have the ability to help them to basically have the maximum yield and more importantly is to have the lowest cost of production and also be able to produce premium flower so they can basically sell it with premium pricing in any market that they operate in right and which in return they will get the highest return on investments right so with that in mind first of all we do get much better higher yields if you actually triple stack then you get as much as 90 to 100 grams per square foot and then on top of it basically the per pound fee on the operating costs our customers are seeing somewhere in the low 3s versus the industry at 400 to 500 per pound right so it s basically convincing them that working with us they ll have the highest return on investment to be able to protect this themselves to be able to have the most be able to compete in any market that they operate in that s basically how they re going to win in the long run obviously we will look at our per pound fee on a market by market basis and right now the new ttk programs are only being rolled out in selective markets where the premium flower pricing is still relatively high the colorado washington and nevada projects are basically our legacy projects that we converted them over to ttk and they are benefiting by enjoying our lower production fees slightly lower production fees to basically help them to be able to compete in those markets but for now we are only offering the new ttk programs to selective new markets where the premium pricing is still high but we understand that overall at the end of the day we need to basically help our customers to be the most competitive cost competitive operator in each of the markets they operate in and also to be able to enjoy the highest revenue because the premium quality of flowers that they produce i mean right now for example the customer that we mentioned in nevada whitecloud because they re consistently producing very high thc products i mean as high as 34 they re products are completely sold out right and still be able to command the premium pricing in that market and i think that s basically where the market is going it s really bifurcating it s either you go for really really dirt cheap or you have to basically go for the premium aaron grey alliance global partners analyst ok thanks for that color guys i really appreciate it so second question for me last month you guys announced the vfu rapid deployment pack i know still very early days but i just want to talk about maybe how the conversations are going especially with some of the larger msos because now it s a little bit less capital intensive for them to drive vfus not if it changed the infrastructure of their own facilities now more of a plug and play if you will so i just want to know in terms of that initiative and how it s kind of spurred maybe more r d type initiatives with some of the larger players thank you raymond chang chief executive officer yeah aaron we understand that we have to listen to our customers right and in the early conversation with the msos everybody was interested in trying our vfus because obviously why wouldn t you want to look at a new technology that could help you to improve yield consistency and be able to operate at a lower cost but obviously having to go in and retrofit and have to go through renovation and all kinds of biosecurity risk that was a major turnoff for a lot of the msos so it wasn t the interest wasn t there it was basically people not wanting to bother with all these retrofitting issues so basically we had to kind of be there at the right time and only looking at new facilities and even then the question whether or not our units will perform in etc so it was a difficult sale but we developed this rapid deployment program and i can tell you as a result of that the conversations have just basically gone out the roof we have basically have so many mso interests and we will be announcing several more additional rapid deployment programs with msos in the very near future operator our next question comes from scott fortune with roth capital partners scott fortune roth capital partners analyst thanks for the question raymond chang chief executive officer good morning scott scott fortune roth capital partners analyst hey raymond good morning can you provide a little more color on addressing the build out timings on the ttk facilities in light of we ve seen inflation headwinds here cost and labor issues and delays in licensing with massachusetts and some of the other states within the industry but just provide an update on the ttk deals in the pipeline or that you sign in the timing to generate cash flow and make sure that s still on track here for the second half raymond chang chief executive officer sure scott so let me start with treehouse in nevada as i mentioned earlier treehouse we are beginning commissioning of our vfus actually as early as next week so we can expect both saas and production revenues coming out of that facility next quarter our two ttk projects washington and colorado so hannah and greenstone we are also will begin commissioning the vfus before the end of this quarter and we are also expecting both production and saas revenue coming out of both of those facilities in q3 bud mary s which is obviously the larger ttk project in massachusetts we will begin commissioning of our vfus before the end of this year with expected saas and production revenues in the first quarter of 2023 and lastly the two big ones el mirage in florida gold leaf those two projects we have kicked off the architectural and engineering design plan with those guys and we are expecting that both of these projects probably will have commissioning of vfus sometimes toward the end of q2 or beginning of q3 of 2023 with expected production and saas fees coming in in q4 of 2023 scott fortune roth capital partners analyst perfect so overall those projects that you re building out are remaining on track and despite some of the challenges going forward raymond chang chief executive officer that is correct in fact based on the timing that i share as you can see the production and saas fees is actually going to start kicking in in q3 of this year which is earlier than expected and in fact this quarter we will start to collect saas fees from our customer whitecloud in nevada as you know that s a non ttk customer but the saas fee will begin to kick in actually this quarter operator our next question comes from eric des lauriers with craig hallum eric des lauriers craig hallum capital group analyst great thank you for taking my question here so first question on the reit or kind of debt partnership that you touched on in your prepared remarks i just wanted to clarify if this was for one or more specific projects or if this is an enterprise level partnership thanks raymond chang chief executive officer hi eric good morning so it s very similar to kind of my ttk approach right we want to make sure that our we set a nice template of how we want to work with reits and so this first deal that i talked about today it s only at the enterprise level but we want to make sure that the terms are reasonable and also that obviously the market will react favorably and it also gives us the maximum leverage to be able to scale that over time however we are continuing to have conversations with multiple reits beyond just kind of at the enterprise level but we want to basically kick off with this particular one just to kind of set the framework and set the expectation and just to make sure that we structure everything correctly so we don t want to basically jump the gun and we credit over time so we re doing this very carefully because we know that our shareholders desire us to be able to maximize their values and we want to make sure that we re bringing the right partner under the right terms eric des lauriers craig hallum capital group analyst ok so i suppose just to clarify here it sounds like that it is sort of for one or more specific projects at first and then kind of proceeding from there raymond chang chief executive officer yes the term sheet that we signed is for one project they do have capacity to go beyond one but we want to start with one and then while at the same time we are also having conversations with bigger reits that basically talks about multiple projects and but again we want to do it carefully just to make sure we have all the terms and then structure the deal correctly eric des lauriers craig hallum capital group analyst yeah that make sense second question here so there was a big inventory investment in the quarter i mean obviously there s supply chain stuff going on so certainly could be reasonable here could you just kind of flesh that out a bit more what kind of inventories were involved there is this kind of extraction or on the vfu side of things and then overall any kind of indication on how to think of working capital flows for the rest of 22 would be really helpful and maybe you can remind us how i would think of the construction loans and how those impact working capital thank you raymond chang chief executive officer tim would you like to take this please timothy oakes chief financial officer yup i will raymond thank you eric so first question related to inventory inventory the build in inventory of 16 4 million is really related to the investment in the vfu production right as raymond talked about right we have a lot of deliveries on the vfu in terms of commissioning they re going to start to come up in the back half of the year and the early part of 2023 so that investment right now is investment in sort of the longer lead items as you mentioned to defeat supply chain issues as well as we ve got about 2 5 million in inventory prepayment in connection with our trying to bring online two additional contract manufacturers in order to offset and give us better leverage not only from a manufacturing capacity point of view but also from a price point of view as opposed to relying on a single source cm so that really accounts for the drive in inventory in terms of addressing the second part of your question i think is really working capital needs we have heavily invested at this point in time obviously in the inventory we have invested heavily in acquisitions and we have also heavily invested in the ttk on the construction piece right that upfront cost in terms of the outlay of the financing as we move through the rest of the year a lot of those legacy initial legacy contracts as raymond mentioned are coming to conclusion that will start to lessen a bit on the construction revenue side on the construction financing side so you will start to see sort of or would expect to see sort of a reduced outlay of capital on the ttk construction front until the newer engagements that we ve recently announced start to complete their design build in their a e studies we will then toward the back half of the year start to recycle on construction so the capital needs for the company really are going to be in the inventory production side you will see that manifest in the increase in inventory as we move through time and then ultimately you will see that inventory flip into a fixed asset because of the saas excuse me because of the lease based model on the vfus contributed to those ttk arrangements so that would you would expect to see that and you would expect to see as we have shown in the recent past quarters continued investment in sort of what we described on the balance sheet as loans receivable in terms of when does the construction start to flip as these construction start to come to completion those outstanding finance amounts will start to pay down over a 12 to 24 month period and you would start to see a reduction in the loan receivable amount and an increase in cash from the repayments of principal and interest on those outstanding finance balances operator our next question comes from anthony vendetti with maxim group anthony vendetti maxim group analyst thanks good morning raymond chang chief executive officer good morning anthony anthony vendetti maxim group analyst good morning raymond just a couple of questions on the backlog so backlog increased by 77 million what s the total backlog now and do you expect most of that backlog to be recognized over what time frame raymond chang chief executive officer tim would you like to take that timothy oakes chief financial officer yeah certainly so anthony right now as we enter the quarter we re looking at a backlog of about 923 million that obviously i think as raymond went through in his comments plays out over time because the larger chunk of that is related to the future saas software fees as well as the production fees so that backlog converts to revenue in our world comfortably over a six to eight year period anthony vendetti maxim group analyst six to eight years ok and i know some of it s over 10 years but most of it over six to eight ok and timothy oakes chief financial officer yeah because sorry let me interrupt you just need to also consider that some of that front loaded piece is construction related and as we talked about our legacy contracts those legacy construction pieces are starting to come to conclusion so raymond highlighted that as we look at toward the end of the second quarter of this year and into the third and fourth quarter we will start to recognize the leading edge of that pent up backlog related to the saas fees and the production fees anthony vendetti maxim group analyst ok and then raymond chang chief executive officer yeah so anthony if i may out of that 900 plus million good 80 plus is really production and saas fees and most of that will be over a 10 year period right but as you know we do get involved with the construction side of things and that s basically kind of a book and burn over 12 months period so kind of the six to seven is sort of like what the average if you kind of look at that entire 900 million but the high margin saas and production fees typically are 10 years and they all kind of come on the back end of that revenue streams anthony vendetti maxim group analyst sure sure understood and then the rapid vfus which are attractive to the msos you said you re having some i guess multiple conversations with msos about that can you give us an update on curaleaf i know that was one that was sort of that signed up for like a test run and just give us an update on where that project is and what the opportunity is with curaleaf at this point raymond chang chief executive officer sure i m happy to so they have officially submitted to the town of newton that is where the r d facility is basically the application for construction so everything is up we are proceeding forward a e plan is now done and they are moving forward with the construction this is one of the reasons why we basically develop the rdp the rapid deployment program because what we realize is that it is really really a hassle right basically for them to have to basically go back in and retrofit and apply for construction permits and all that stuff right and it was a big lesson learned right it took us it did take us a long time to kind of get this up they re moving forward so we re very excited about that but at the same time it also reminded us that we really do need to have this rdp program so that basically they can have 10 units they can have 20 units and it s a plug and play and this will help them to accelerate and be able to put our equipment to test now one of the other things that anthony i want i really want to reiterate is i am most excited about the fact that what is happening at our customer sites today right as you guys all know we estimate 35 of vfu production per vfu on an annual basis i just shared with you guys this morning whitecloud is hitting somewhere close to 50 pounds production that is an extremely exciting right development it really validates our business and we expect that number to continue to grow up and it s not only on the yield side which obviously people only talk about that by hitting as high as 34 thc so this is a very strong validation and i would say probable it s one of the more important piece of the information i shared today and we expect to continue to see progress on the advantage of our technologies and we re super excited about that operator our next question comes from harrison vivas with cowen harrison vivas cowen and company analyst great thank you so much for taking the question just wanted to double back on reit partnerships so i understand it s still early days and you re establishing a framework for how you re structuring deals but what s your do sort of kind of established repeatable framework does this accelerate your ability to execute against your existing pipeline or does it sort of expand your pipeline to kind of discuss the opportunity set once you ve established a repeatable deal structure with reits thanks raymond chang chief executive officer harrison thank you and thank you for joining the call today here is the thing industry headwinds and people seeing slowdown etc etc but i can tell you that the interest the amount of people wanting to engage with us we re continuously turning away deals because we re just way too busy and right now we re being super selective as to the partners that we want to team up with and obviously one of the challenges is how we re going to finance all these ttk projects right because obviously we don t want to do it just completely 100 from our own balance sheet so sitting to frame the right framework for reit partnership will allow us to be able to incredibly scale up that business right but at the same time even though we re in multiple engagement that basically like term seats from people but i want to make sure that we structured this correctly because you only really only you allow it one has to do it right and we want to make sure the first deal was done right so that it sets the expectation it sets a template and basically we can be we can scale from there right but once we can put a reit partnership in place then i see tremendous leverage out of our business because harrison right now for every ttk deal that we do about 60 of the upfront cost is related to construction right and the 40 is basically related to the additional equipment that we have to put in so if we can actually have a reit partnership to take away 50 of their upfront then we only have to worry about financing the 40 and i believe once we start showing these recurring revenues which we will begin to do starting from next quarter then we will be able to find maybe some partners on the equipment financing side for our vfus then under that scenario then this model becomes extremely scalable so that s kind of what we re putting in place harrison vivas cowen and company analyst and then kind of just a clarifier in response to an earlier question you talked about prioritizing markets where premium prices for flower were holding in the most can you kind of specify what markets you re referencing and kind of how you see your state mix evolving over the next several years thank you raymond chang chief executive officer yeah so obviously the new ttk markets that we are focusing on are primarily all limited license states east coast so for example we re heavily investing here in massachusetts and that s our backyard and we have to own our backyard for sure florida that s also a limited license state and the premium pricing still holding up very nicely there we re obviously entering into new jersey it s obviously that s a very exciting market predicted to be probably new york new jersey the second largest market outside of california i know that it s going to be difficult there but i think initially there may be a supply demand sort of imbalance because people are just trying to figure out how to bring supply into that market but i think the premium market might still be able to hold nicely there so and then there are other smaller states that actually again limit the license primarily for medicinal use that we re looking at right now but we re being very selective and looking and only at kind of the high premium pricing market for the moment operator our next question comes from pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald matthew baker cantor fitzgerald analyst hello this is matthew baker for pablo thank you for taking my question raymond chang chief executive officer hi matthew matthew baker cantor fitzgerald analyst hey good morning raymond can you talk about the balance sheet cash burn and your funding needs over the next 12 months raymond chang chief executive officer tim please take that timothy oakes chief financial officer yeah absolutely raymond so at the end of the quarter we end with cash and cash equivalents ballpark 93 million we ve got 30 million of that restricted as part of the debt agreement we entered into in the latter part of march so that gives us ballpark 64 million of cash as we look at moving through the year right now where we sit as raymond talked about signing the term sheet with a potential investor or financer for some of our other ttk arrangements we feel that we have enough to get through the rest of this year it will be tight getting through the year as we have done in the past we will always look to find ways to sort of strengthen the balance sheet as we move through time giving us again continued leverage on that balance sheet to continue to look at the expansion of investment in the growth of our top line matthew baker cantor fitzgerald analyst ok thanks for the color there just for our second question from like a value proposition point of view what s the average cost per pound that your vertical farm units produced compared to the average cost of indoor cultivation and then also on how does this compare in terms of potency raymond chang chief executive officer yeah great question so right now our customer is seeing an average around 320 opex per pound and that s basically comparison to roughly 450 to 500 industry average so as you can see it s significantly lower and i believe that number in fact will go even further down with scale the 320 number that i kind of referenced earlier is for a 200 plus vfu facility and it actually does have tremendous sort of scalability so you can expect that number to go even lower with higher volume of production so that s the first question in terms of the second question as i mentioned earlier today our customers are seeing as high as 34 thc in one of their strains right 34 and it s not just the thc it s the other cannabinoids and also terpene and it s also not just the other cannabinoid and terpene being higher but it s also the consistency right i mean the best thing about our solution is once you figure out the optimal growth recipe you just continue to use that operate at a current down completely controlled environment and you have the ability to repeat the same process over and over and over and that s really what gives us the maximum advantage is not only being able to push something out once but it s the ability to basically repeat that process over and over and that s really what sets us apart operator i m showing no further questions in queue at this time i d like to turn the call back to raymond chang for closing remarks raymond chang chief executive officer gentlemen i really want to thank you all for joining the call today and one of the other things as a closing remark i want i do want to say is just based on our backlog with 4 569 vfus currently under contract starting from 2023 and onwards once we commissioned all of these vfus you would be expecting to generate 84 million of high recurring revenue on an annual basis that s really the power of the business model that we have and we re executing against that and we re very happy to see a lot of our facilities coming into fruition and the team is 100 focused and we will look forward to updating you with more positive developments in the quarters to come again thank you for joining the call today and look forward to updating you all in the next quarter thank you operator duration 61 minutes call participants anna kate heller senior vice president investor relations raymond chang

all growth comparisons are on a year over year basis unless otherwise noted i ll now turn the call over to our ceo david rosenblatt david rosenblatt chief executive officer thanks kevin good evening and thank you for joining us today in the first quarter we delivered results near the high end of guidance while laying the foundation for future growth once again our trade business posted strong results and continues to have great momentum in contrast consumer gmv declined modestly year over year due to lower new buyer conversion a trend that s continued into the second quarter in 2020 and 2021 pandemic related lockdowns and other restrictions shifted consumer spending online as the world reopens the pendulum is swinging back in the other direction with consumers spending more in categories like travel and restaurants traffic and top of funnel engagement metrics remain strong but new buyer conversion headwinds resulting from rising macro uncertainty and economic reopening have reduced our gmv growth outlook for the second quarter relative to our previous expectations while our near term consumer demand outlook is lower we remain optimistic about the future from 1999 through 2019 u s e commerce penetration rates consistently increased during covid they inflected upward and we re now seeing this trend unwind we believe this is a temporary dynamic when we think about the next decade e commerce will be a much larger market than it is today said another way when the environment normalizes we expect that e commerce will resume its historical growth trend we aim to capitalize on that growth encouragingly top of funnel activity as measured by consumer traffic registration volume and item favoriting is strong however consumers are not converting their interest into orders at historical levels likely due to temporary external factors given our strong balance sheet and large opportunity we have chosen to continue to thoughtfully invest for future growth despite current consumer headwinds our high gross margin asset light business model and strong balance sheet provide us the flexibility to continue to execute on our strategic road map our plan for 2022 and beyond is to enhance our marketplace growth rate by focusing on four strategic areas supply growth auctions international expansion and nfts each represents a meaningful gmv opportunity in the first quarter we made progress on all four our first priority is accelerating supply growth there is no other marketplace with our breadth of unique luxury design however the number of our current listings is just scratching the surface of potential qualified items for two sided marketplaces supply begets demand given the heterogeneous and long tail nature of our listings more supply increases marketplace liquidity supply drives traffic broadens buyers options make search results more robust and increases the chances that we ll return a match for a given search our goal is to aggregate the world s most beautiful items regardless of where they re located to accelerate supply growth we launched a pricing test for new sellers in january this allows sellers to choose the plan that best fits their business and includes a subscription free tier with higher commission rates this option reduces friction by lowering the upfront cost of trying the 1stdibs marketplace early results have been encouraging we signed over 700 new sellers in the first quarter ending march with over 5 400 seller accounts up over 25 year over year our monthly seller acquisition was over three times higher than our monthly average in 2021 in general these new sellers are drawn from our geographies price points and verticals in a similar proportion to our existing sellers additionally the new pricing options are helping to reduce churn particularly for sellers with lower volumes sellers are responding well to having a choice of pricing options of note about 85 of new seller accounts are choosing the subscription free option even so the higher volume of new sellers means that the number of sellers selecting plans with the subscription component is still about 50 of our 2021 monthly new seller run rate highlighting the value of the services we offer on subscription tiers given the highly considered nature of our purchases it takes time for sellers to get up and running the average seller takes about 90 days to make their first sale still we re encouraged by the early progress we ve seen new seller accounts in the first quarter listed over 12 500 items and generated over 300 000 in gmv our second priority is commercializing auctions we made progress on this front as well auctions provide a new way for buyers to discover and own the world s most beautiful things this new purchase format leverages our existing supply and demand adds a common luxury purchase format to our marketplace increases urgency and creates opportunities for buyers to find exceptional deals auctions also provide a new on ramp to our marketplace for more price sensitive consumers while it s still early we re seeing healthy order growth offset by aovs below fixed price marketplace aovs as expected encouragingly and most important new buyer conversion rates for auction items are three times higher versus the same metric for non auction items additionally sell through rates on auction items are about two times higher than non auction items increasing new buyer activation and sell through rates were key objectives of introducing the auction format and we re excited to see them playing out since launching in november 2021 we ve enhanced the product experience through weekly updates this quarter we launched additional buyer urgency drivers through platform updates email and app notifications and new tools for sellers to manage their listings update pricing and provide second chance offers in the first quarter our efforts focused on providing sellers with pricing guidance listings with low starting bids competitive reserves and attractive buy it now prices have higher bidding activity and correspond to buyer expectations of value for auctions we ve seen a sharp increase in the adoption of our pricing guidance the number of auctions that meet all three of our pricing criteria has increased to over 20 at the end of march from below 1 at the start of january optimizing pricing allows us to get more aggressive marketing auctions and building awareness setting the stage for higher bid participation and ultimately higher future gmv growth our third priority is international expansion we see a meaningful global opportunity and have a multiyear road map today about 40 of our sellers one third of our traffic and one fifth of our buyers are located outside the united states additionally in the first quarter international seller gmv growth outpaced u s seller gmv growth in late april we smoothly launched in germany and we plan to launch in france in may these countries are our largest non english speaking markets by order volume localizing our product strengthens the 1stdibs marketplace and allows buyers and sellers to transact in the language they re most comfortable with with time this should grow our buyer base and increase the unique supply on the marketplace supporting our launch in the first quarter we completed the bulk of our upfront translation work over 400 million words in total to support localized production for germany and france other international expansion progress included localizing sort order and search translating marketing campaigns hosting press events in berlin and paris and building out european buyer and seller support these launches are a cross functional effort encompassing product engineering operations logistics marketing supply and customer experience i d like to thank everyone involved our final priority is nfts in the first quarter we made additional improvements to our nft platform in early march we launched self minting capabilities and creator profiles self minting allows digital artists to create and sell their tokens in a self serve fashion since those launches the supply of nfts on the 1stdibs marketplace has grown over 50 the number of artists on the marketplace has nearly doubled and our twitter followers almost doubled while expanding nft supply is our near term focus we believe these first quarter accomplishments are precursors to future gmv growth we are cognizant of the fact that the e commerce operating environment has become challenging and unpredictable over the past few months we remain confident that in the long term e commerce adoption will continue to grow and luxury design will continue shifting online this confidence is reinforced by the healthy top of funnel activity we ve seen year to date additionally our past success with initiatives like seo and expanding the marketplace beyond the vintage and antique furniture category give us the confidence to invest in our road map today about half of our gmv comes from our newer verticals like new and custom furniture jewelry art and fashion and seo traffic mix has increased substantially each of our initiatives is a tried and true marketplace growth tactic and has the primitives in place to be successful for example auctions are a common luxury purchase format a significant percentage of our supply and our traffic come from outside the u s growing supply increases marketplace liquidity the hardest part of scaling an online marketplace is cracking the chicken and egg problem with supply and demand we ve done this with auctions international and supply we are making these investments because we expect attractive rois in terms of new buyers and gmv margins matter to us profitability matters to us generating free cash flow matters to us as we think through our road map we do so with these considerations in mind turning away from strategic initiatives we also continue to improve our core platform while new buyer conversion declined top of funnel activity remains healthy with traffic registrations and item favorites growing double digits we also redesigned our mobile web product pages and increased parcel pre quote coverage today 99 of our eligible parcel items have a pre quote to buyers in the u s europe and other international markets however continued shipping inflation represents a conversion headwind since our last earnings call changing consumer behavior rising macroeconomic uncertainty and consumer conversion headwinds have reduced our second quarter gmv growth outlook relative to our previous expectations undoubtedly the macroeconomic environment has become more uncertain due to inflation rising interest rates geopolitical tensions increased mobility changing consumer spending patterns stock market volatility and other issues our high gross margins asset light business model and strong unit economics provide us the flexibility to think long term and make disciplined investments in our growth i ll turn it over now to tom who will discuss our financial results and outlook tom etergino chief financial officer thanks david i m delighted to have joined 1stdibs a few weeks ago and i m looking forward to helping drive growth for years to come in addition to being a 1stdibs customer i m a longtime admirer of the brand the business model and the company s unique position in luxury e commerce turning to the first quarter we delivered results at the high end of our guidance range which i ll review along with providing an outlook for the second quarter first quarter gmv was 117 million up 3 as a reminder we lapped historically strong gmv growth of 64 from the first quarter of 2021 similar to the last few quarters trade gmv growth outpaced consumer gmv growth with trade gmv hitting a quarterly record once again we grew both the number of spending trade firms and the average spending per firm many of the firms we work with have full pipelines and the trade business continues to have great momentum while trade gmv growth remained robust consumer gmv modestly declined due to traffic mix shipped from returning buyers to new buyers and softness in new buyer conversion additionally as the world reopens we believe there is pent up demand for spending on experiences and travel as a reminder when we reference trade gmv or consumer gmv we are speaking of the subsets of on platform gmv attributable to each of these buyer groups fashion and new and custom furniture were our fastest growing verticals consistent with the fourth quarter vintage and antique furniture accounted for less than 50 of gmv and the majority of our first time orders continue to come from our new categories like art jewelry and new and custom furniture continuing a trend from 2021 average order value was over 2 900 up 11 on broad based strength across categories this illustrates the trust we built over the past two decades there s no other digital marketplace operating at our scale transacting at our price points across multiple verticals average order value growth was offset by order softness due to two traffic mix shifts a shift toward mobile web and a shift toward new buyers both of which have lower conversion rates for context returning buyer conversion is materially higher than new buyer conversion so a traffic mix shift toward new buyers puts downward pressure on overall conversion many of these new buyers are coming from organic channels like seo we have several projects and tests in flight to increase conversion engagement from new buyers including overhauling remarketing for a post idfa world redesigning our mobile web product pages updating our mobile web checkout and increasing awareness of auctions which have higher new buyer conversion versus non auction orders importantly conversion for returning buyers grew year over year and top of the funnel activity remains healthy we ended the quarter with approximately 71 300 active buyers up 10 year over year but down 2 quarter over quarter as a reminder active buyers is a trailing 12 month metric and could be choppy near term as we cycle through some strong comps from the pandemic related e commerce boost on the supply side of the marketplace we closed the quarter with over 5 400 seller accounts up over 25 as david mentioned we ve seen great response from our new seller pricing test which launched in january net revenue of 26 6 million grew 4 driven by gmv growth transaction revenue which is tied directly to gmv growth was approximately 70 of revenue with subscriptions making up the bulk of the remainder gross profit was 18 9 million up 2 gross profit margins were 71 1 down from 72 5 a year ago as expected gross margins normalized following elevated shipping losses in the fourth quarter while we continue to see shipping price inflation the measures we implemented starting in december have kept shipping costs in line with historic norms we are reviewing shipping data on a regular basis and we ll continue adjusting our shipping rates to reflect market trends sales and marketing expenses were 11 8 million up 2 consistent with the fourth quarter we pulled back on some performance marketing due in part to continued idfa headwinds sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was 44 down versus 45 a year ago technology development expenses were 5 8 million up 46 driven by headcount growth and expenses supporting the launch of our localized sites in france and germany including translation as a percentage of revenue technology development was 22 up from 15 general and administrative expenses were 6 4 million up 45 the increase was mainly driven by expenses related to public company costs including d o insurance and increased headcount as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses were 24 up from 17 lastly provision for transaction losses were 1 7 million up 59 driven primarily by an uptick in transactional losses related to shipping damages and items lost in transit looking forward we are working to mitigate these issues by optimizing our carrier network reevaluating carrier slas and partnering with sellers to improve packaging practices provision for transaction losses were 6 of revenue up from 4 adjusted ebitda loss was 4 7 million compared to a loss of 1 3 million last year adjusted ebitda margin was a loss of 18 versus a loss of 5 last year this year over year change was driven primarily by higher g a expenses due to public company costs and higher investment in technology development spend due to headcount growth and product localization moving on to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with a strong cash and cash equivalent position of 161 million now turning to our outlook we forecast second quarter gmv of 104 million to 111 million equating to a year over year change between a decline of 3 and growth of 3 net revenue of 24 4 million to 25 5 million equating to year over year change between a decline of 1 and growth of 3 adjusted ebitda margin loss of minus 32 to minus 28 as david mentioned due to shifting consumer demand rising macroeconomic uncertainty and consumer conversion headwinds it s a tricky environment to forecast e commerce demand while we re not providing full year guidance we d like to share some additional context on the assumptions on delaying our gmv outlook we have widened our gmv guidance range to reflect increased uncertainty last quarter our outlook was that year over year gmv growth would be the lowest in the first quarter this is no longer the case due to the issues david and i discussed earlier the midpoint of our second quarter guidance implies that gmv growth is flat year over year we continue to expect gmv contribution from our strategic initiatives to increase in the second half of the year turning to adjusted ebitda margins guidance reflects a sequential decline in revenue continued disciplined investment in our four long term growth drivers when we resume growth we expect to generate operating leverage that said 2022 ebitda margins will be dictated by the pace of gmv growth in the first quarter we made foundational progress in our four strategic initiatives which represent meaningful upside potential over the next few years over time our objective remains scaling the 1stdibs marketplace improving our buyer and seller experience and achieving profitability and free cash flow generation thank you for your time i ll now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of ralph schackart with william blair your line is open please go ahead ralph schackart william blair and company analyst good evening thanks for taking the question david you called out a lot of macro headwinds that are fairly well known in the marketplace today but just curious it sounds like your upper funnel traffic still remain the same which is great you re having more sort of new buyers come to the platform however conversion is going to be a work in progress just curious how quickly do you think the platform can mobilize to drive stronger conversion with the new buyers despite sort of the or i guess given the macro headwinds david rosenblatt chief executive officer sure ralph thank you for the question so you re absolutely right top of the funnel remains as healthy as it s ever been in terms of traffic growth what we call dealer contacts meaning the number of buyers who reach out to sellers with product inquiries and so on in other words people are walking into the store they re just not checking out so we have a bunch of projects and initiatives pointed at that some are more tactical and near term others are longer term the near term ones include things like for example we re putting a lot of energy into optimizing the mobile flow because a lot of the traffic growth has been driven by mobile and mobile web as you know has lower checkout or lower conversion rates typically than desktop and app so we re putting some energy into that shipping as well we re increasing our pre quote coverage for parcel items which carry lower shipping prices in general and then in terms of the longer term bucket all of our core strategic initiatives are focused in one way or another on improving conversion right so international is a good example non u s visitors check out at a or convert rather at half the rate of u s buyers we just launched france yesterday or today rather we launched germany two weeks ago by increasing the number of items on the site we reduce the number of pages that buyers land on with very few products on them which is a fairly widespread given that we re a long tail marketplace and so and auctions are pointed at exactly the same thing so all the data that we re seeing in terms of these projects are encouraging but again to the extent to which they win against the macros people above my pay grade are probably the better people to ask in terms of when those macros change ralph schackart william blair and company analyst great maybe just a follow up i think you talked about it in the prepared remarks i apologize but just remind me if you talked about it already what happened with shipping costs i guess with respect to last quarter and how has that trended sort of quarter to date thanks tom etergino chief financial officer sure thanks for the question there s two different shipping issues that last quarter the shipping issues that we were talking about there were on pre quote losses that we had we effectively and quickly addressed those in q1 and that s why you re seeing that our margins were at 71 so they reverted back to historical levels in this quarter what we re seeing is an increase a little bit of an increase in the loss provision as a percentage of gmv and we ve seen a little bit of a trend on that over the past few quarters increasing to a high to the higher end of what we ve seen as a percentage of revenue in the past and it s primarily driven by items that are being lost or damaged in shipping and based on kind of the state of logistics services today we re seeing some degradation in the service levels as many of the carriers are operating at or above their capacity so we re doing three things to really mitigate the losses we re optimizing our carrier network we will be reevaluating and strengthening all of our carrier slas and we are partnering with our sellers to improve their packaging practices so we expect these actions to take the losses down to kind of the historic percentage of revenue the lower end of the historic percentages but it is going to take some time to realize those impacts ralph schackart william blair and company analyst ok great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of justin post with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open please go ahead justin post bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks one just quick numbers question can you give us any help on the mix of revenues between sorry between transaction and non transaction and as you change the fee structure and have less people on subscriptions what does that mean for overall take rates and then i have a couple of follow ups tom etergino chief financial officer so yeah this is tom the rough breakout of transactional is about 70 30 can you repeat the second part of that question justin post bank of america merrill lynch analyst on the call you mentioned more sellers are kind of joining the platform subscription free i think you said 85 so just wondering as more people adopt kind of that format of pricing what does that mean for overall take rates as you think out the next couple of years david rosenblatt chief executive officer yes i can answer that justin so the new seller pricing plan so far has we ve been quite happy with actually we ve tripled the growth rate or the number of sellers rather that we ve added in the first quarter versus q1 a year ago the program is designed to be take rate neutral so that s how we think about it justin post bank of america merrill lynch analyst great and then i guess the last one is on auctions obviously you ve got some new data here you mentioned it s kind of higher conversion is it at all material to gmv or something that could be helpful as you get out to q4 and how do you think about that now that you have a quarter into it about converting i think you said last quarter 14 billion of inventory but is it something that could make a difference by q4 or next year thank you david rosenblatt chief executive officer yes so we re quite happy with the progress so far our focus given that it just launched basically mid q4 has been on the operational or behavioral drivers that ultimately convert into gmv so specifically our focus in the first quarter was on helping educate sellers to price in a way that is most effective for the auction format and we went from 1 of items meeting our pricing criteria to roughly 20 the impact of that operationally was we basically doubled orders in q1 versus q4 albeit at a lower aov than in q4 but that s ok because again what we re optimizing for is effective pricing for this format in terms of making headway on the kind of the opportunity that this product is pointed at which as you point out was primarily conversion specifically new buyer conversion we did see as i mentioned in the script that conversion rates for new buyers for auction items were about three times that of conversion from non auction items if you look at that conversely on a supply basis sell through for items in auction was about two times sell through for items in the marketplace so we are making progress against our strategic objectives specifically in terms of being able to better monetize the large amount of unsold inventory in the marketplace we continue to make progress each quarter i don t want to put a kind of specific quarter on when it turns into any specific gmv number but again we re very happy with the inputs there and we re confident that it will translate into gmv growth justin post bank of america merrill lynch analyst last question on the 2q guidance if you take the midpoint it s down 9 million or 10 million for gmv quarter over quarter going back to 19 it was flattish clearly last year it was down as well on weird pandemic stuff but any reason why quarter over quarter it s down is that normal seasonality or is it some of the macro factors have really intensified here in april thank you david rosenblatt chief executive officer yes so there are a lot of growth areas in the business and i think it s worth calling that out i mean trade for example had a very strong quarter and again all the kind of inputs to that business continue to remain very healthy top of funnel as we mentioned before is also very healthy returning buyer conversion grew year over year the primary driver of the gmv softness in q2 is on conversion and specifically new buyer conversion so what s happening is we re getting a lot of growth from seo traffic in particular and that has among the lowest conversion rates of all of our traffic channels and in particular those growth rates rather the change in conversion from that channel declined and we feel like we have a pretty good handle on why certainly part of that has to do with macros part of it also has to do with things that are specific to that channel and we re working on addressing those justin post bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ross sandler with barclays your line is open please go ahead ross sandler barclays analyst hey i just wanted to follow up on that trade comment so the fact that that s holding up pretty well is interesting is there like a reason like a noticeable difference in like the end customer either being like more premium or do these designers just have a larger backlog that maybe they re working through currently that the consumer part of your business is more a reflection of like people feeling the pinch in real time just curious like is that is it a little more insulated to recessionary impact on the trade side and if you re adding more trade buyers can you potentially grow through it i guess is the question so that would be number one and then on the freight increases like you guys did a good job of improving the pre quote margin so nice job there in the first quarter but are higher shipping costs in general just deterring people from buying any color on that versus i guess the less bulky items that wouldn t be subject to huge shipping costs and then last one is one third of traffic from international is that a good proxy for kind of the north star i think international gmv is at like 7 or something like that is that how we should think about that and any early read on the germany i know it s only been a couple of weeks but any additional reads there david rosenblatt chief executive officer hey ross so just taking those in order first trade so we are seeing strength in trade both in terms of kind of actual spend also in terms of our sales pipeline and what our designers are reporting to us in terms of their own pipelines why is that happening is it a different market than the rest of our business i mean i think it s more of a direct proxy of course on the luxury real estate market which remains very strong and yes our buyers do tend to rely on designers so as long as that market remains healthy and the volume of new sales maintains then i think that business will remain healthy for us i d say another point there is that we ve now been in the business for i don t know four ish years or so and i think just the more that interior designers use 1stdibs to source the more it becomes embedded in their muscle memory the further up the learning curve they become designers tend to shift firms they typically bring their kind of approach to purchasing from firm to firm so i think there is something of a network effect there as well that we re benefiting from but obviously it s very hard to quantify that in terms of shipping look i mean we the market is dynamic enough that i don t know that we have a kind of specific ability to quantify it however intuitively of course as shipping prices increase it has to have a negative effect on conversion particularly for the roughly kind of 20 25 of our order volume that is freight rather than parcel and then third in terms of the north star in international as we said it a couple of times i mean conversion rates for non u s buyers are roughly half that of u s buyers i don t know that that closes 100 but in terms of the goal that is the goal i would say though a couple of other things to caveat that right one is it takes a while to get there we just for example we launched germany two weeks ago we just submitted our german site map to google for seo indexing we launched france today we of course haven t done that yet once we get some traction on seo then we ll layer in paid so that is out a bit as well so i think and that s a primary source of leverage we have in terms of driving growth and then of course we have ultimately new markets beyond that so and then lastly once we re a local language we also have the ability to localize the supply side meaning translate our seller tools into local languages in addition to translating the consumer experience which is what we ve done to date which should allow us to expand supply so everything i said does provide i think a healthy long term runway for international but it s also not something that happens overnight in terms of germany specifically which i think was your last question it s too early it s only two weeks and i think what we re encouraged by is that the launches were smooth from a technical point of view and from a marketing point of view but again it was only a couple of days ago that we submitted the site map for indexing by google and so we haven t it s a little bit too early to draw any conclusions in terms of performance operator thank you our next question comes from the line of spencer tan with evercore isi your line is open please go ahead spencer tan evercore isi analyst thanks for taking the question i had one just around the mix between cross vertical and single vertical buyers maybe over the last couple of quarters how that s trended i know that that was kind of a really big positive for you guys at the time of the ipo and then actually maybe just to follow up on that in your newer verticals so new and custom furniture art jewelry etc what kind of verticals do you have the most confidence around growing through the back half of this year understanding that it s a pretty difficult macro environment but just any color behind vertical mix and then as well as the single two multiple vertical buyer trends would be great thank you david rosenblatt chief executive officer yes in terms of share of wallet meaning cross vertical purchasing those trends have remained relatively constant over the last quarter in terms of how we feel about different sort of differential category performance right now our new and custom meaning contemporary furniture category and our fashion categories are growing the fastest what s very encouraging is that the fashion category has significantly ramped up its supply growth its posting activity and so again i think we do expect to see that continue new and custom is helped by strength in trade their primary buyers of new and custom furniture so again just the same fundamentals as long as the fundamentals don t change we don t expect to see a dramatic change in the relative growth rates versus what we saw in q1 which was which had new and custom and fashion growing the fastest

employee owners of s corporations have a retirement readiness advantage over their 401 k plan counterparts jerry ripperger national vice president of stock plan services consulting at principal explains that workers retirement readiness is greater when they are in s corporation employee stock ownership plans because participants build equity in the company that they work for s esops promote broad company ownership which is a good public goal with greater opportunities for employees to fund their retirement he says it s a way to share wealth across all those that are generating wealth on behalf of the organization ripperger added i can t control how amazon does or google i can control to some degree how company that i work for does it creates a line of sight and this ability to actually influence those results and reap the benefits esops offered by s corporations are tax deferred defined contribution plans s esops allow companies to provide compensation to employees through ownership interest in the company like esop plans from c corporations among employers with an s esop retirement plan option 57 offer it in addition to a pension or defined contribution plan according to research released last month from ernst young the report analyzed trends in s esop retirement plans from 2002 through 2019 including s esops net asset value number of participants average account balances and distributions to participants the research also estimated benefits that accrue to employee owners working for s esop firms the research contribution of s esops to participants retirement security and employee owner benefits prepared for the employee owned s corporations of america found that esops distribute 25 more per participant than 401 k plans on average ernst young also found that the average total cumulative return per participant for s esops from 2002 through 2019 was over 300 000 for a compound annual growth rate of 12 1 one third higher than the returns from the s p 500 over that time when its total returns index grew at a compound annual rate of approximately 9 in addition from 2002 through 2019 s esop participants received an annual average of 5 900 while 401 k plans distributed an annual average of 4 700 the research showed after the great recession s esop participants received an annual average of 6 700 while 401 k plans distributed an annual average of 5 400 s esops distributed approximately 1 350 or 24 more to participants during this period the findings are yet another data point demonstrating the relative strength of esop ownership inside a privately held company and the added benefits of having an esop not only to the company but more importantly to the employees who own the company through the trust says esca president ceo stephanie silverman having an esop isn t just about returns it s a cultural change and it requires a lot of commitment from the company to the employee owners s esops can accrue advantages that also benefit the business a previous study on esops from the national center for employee ownership found they serve as a retention tool as well as a cushion for employees to be more financially resilient in a crisis a typical s esop owned corporation is 90 owned by employees silverman says it s important to remember that with an esop almost all of the contributions to an esop account come from the company virtually none come from employees themselves so this is an added benefit provided by companies to employees as a way to enhance their retirement savings she explains in most if not all of the other qualified retirement savings plans employees are putting in their own money she adds that s esop companies tend have a different outlook and that having an s esop available changes the culture of a company people stay in their jobs longer and the company loses less energy money brand relationships because they lose fewer people turnover is lower she explains people work harder when they re working for themselves the irs and department of labor regulate s and c esops which are not appropriate for every company silverman notes the irs tax code section 409 t details for example that these structures need to be broadly held you can t start a sole practitioner business and then turn yourself into an s corporation because the law was intended to create broad based benefit to workers and so there are anti abuse rules that are pretty clear she says in addition owners of llc corporations are not permitted and esop participants cannot be non u s nationals living outside of the u s retirement plan participants with an s esop available tend to benefit in other important ways not provided by 401 k s and dc plans silverman adds while not every company outperforms the market is a very large sample of companies and a very strong proof point that there are cultural and other benefits inside of an esop that continue to increase their value and therefore the value to participants and give that extra layer of retirement security that employees might not get elsewhere she says
the pressures that have kept inflation elevated for months remain strong fresh data released wednesday showed a challenge for households that are trying to shoulder rising expenses and for the white house and federal reserve as they try to put the economy on a steadier path annual inflation moderated for the first time in months in april but the consumer price index still increased 8 3 an uncomfortably rapid pace at the same time a closely watched measure that subtracts food and fuel costs accelerated core inflation which excludes costs for groceries and gas picked up 0 6 in april from the prior month faster than its 0 3 increase in march that measure is particularly important for policymakers who use it as a gauge to help determine where inflation is headed while the letup in annual inflation gave president joe biden and the fed a dose of comfort the overall picture remains worrying policymakers have a long way to go to bring price increases down to more normal and stable levels and the newest data is likely to keep them focused on trying to slow an inflation rate that remains near its fastest pace in 40 years inflation is too high they need to bring it down said laura rosner warburton senior economist at macropolicy perspectives the re acceleration in core inflation is unwelcome tips from 5 on your side on how to deal with rising inflation don t take out any major loans for big purchases like cars and homes invest your money economy expert forbes dixon says the u s got here partly by keeping interest rates low for years and then infusing the economy with so much money during the pandemic at a time when availability of resources is limited printing money is kind of like adding kindling to the fire he said if it gets too hot you want to take some of that out dixon believes efforts to cool things down like the federal reserve raising interest rates by 5 to curtail spending is not enough i could be totally wrong i would rather be wrong and happy than right and paying a ton of money for my cost of living he said stocks were turbulent wednesday swinging between gains and losses as investors tried to parse the latest data the s p 500 ended the day down 1 6 annual inflation may have now peaked having climbed by an even quicker 8 5 in march the april slowdown came partly because gas prices dropped last month and partly because of a statistical quirk that will continue through the months ahead yearly price changes are now being measured against elevated price readings from last spring when inflation started to take off the higher base makes annual increases look less severe still even the white house greeted the new report with concern while it is heartening to see that annual inflation moderated in april the fact remains that inflation is unacceptably high biden said in a statement inflation is a challenge for families across the country and bringing it down is my top economic priority economists do expect price increases to continue to ebb somewhat this year because they think that consumer demand will taper off and supply chain stresses will ease the crucial question is how much and how quickly that moderation might happen many analysts have been predicting a slowdown in price increases or even outright price cuts on many goods but those forecasts look increasingly uncertain lockdowns in china and the war in ukraine threaten to exacerbate supply shortages for semiconductor chips commodities and other important products there are persistent issues in supply chains said matthew luzzetti chief u s economist at deutsche bank and the most recent developments have not been positive the path ahead for the car market for instance remains unclear supply shortfalls for used vehicles show some signs of easing but shortfalls persist in computer chips which are crucial to automobile production as a result companies are still struggling to complete vehicles prices for used cars and trucks declined in april compared with the prior month though the drop was smaller than the one they experienced in march while car parts had become cheaper in march they resumed their monthly increase in april new car prices also accelerated after a lull climbing 1 7 from the prior month and services prices are now increasing quickly as rents climb and as worker shortfalls lead to higher wages and steeper prices for restaurant meals and other labor intensive purchases if that continues it could keep inflation elevated even as supply problems are resolved rents picked up 0 6 in april from march and a measure of housing costs that uses rents to estimate the cost of owned housing climbed 0 5 up from 0 4 the prior month the pickup in housing costs is particularly important because they make up about a third of the overall inflation index domestically generated inflationary pressures remain strong andrew hunter senior u s economist at capital economics wrote after the report was released part of the increase in core inflation in april owed to trends that should not last most notably a big pop in airfares as travel demand surges following the latest wave of the coronavirus even so rosner warburton said she expected annual cpi inflation to remain at 5 1 at the end of the year far above levels that prevailed before the pandemic the fed aims for 2 annual inflation on average though it defines that goal using a related but different measure that tends to run slightly lower and comes out with more of a delay that inflation index picked up 6 6 in the year through march and april figures will be released later this month the fact that high inflation is lasting so long is a problem for the central bank after a full year of unusually swift increases household and investor expectations for future price changes have been creeping higher which could perpetuate inflation if households and businesses adjust their behavior asking for bigger raises and charging more for goods and services as such risks have mounted the fed has begun to lift interest rates to try to keep price increases from galloping out of control in a more lasting way in march fed policymakers lifted their main policy interest rate for the first time since 2018 then followed that up with the biggest increase since 2000 at their meeting last week by making it more expensive to borrow money officials are hoping to weaken spending and hiring which could help supply to catch up with demand as the economy returns to balance inflation should come down central bankers are hoping that their policies will temper economic growth without actually pushing unemployment up or plunging the u s into a recession engineering what they often call a soft landing i really want us to have that be the outcome but i recognize that it s not going to be easy to do raphael bostic president of the federal reserve bank of atlanta said monday officials have roundly acknowledged that letting the economy down gently will be difficult and some have suggested that they would be willing to inflict economic pain if that is what it takes to tackle high inflation if the economy gets to a point at which unemployment begins climbing but inflation remains unacceptably high bostic said price increases would be the threat that we have to take on board one challenge for policymakers and even more for families is that price increases are surfacing in essentials food costs rose 0 9 in april from the previous month the 17th consecutive monthly increase friday s report showed the increase was driven by dairy nonalcoholic beverages and a 10 3 monthly increase in the cost of eggs as avian flu decimated poultry flocks such inflation tends to especially hit the poor who spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on needs like groceries and gas but as americans see strong job gains and strong wage growth albeit not strong enough to fully counteract inflation many are managing to shoulder the rising costs for now keeping overall demand strong

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the claim is based on one study that looked at a small group of students and there is no comprehensive data source that tracks student borrower graduation rates in late april following president joe biden s extension of the student loan payment pause and the renewed conversation about widespread debt forgiveness vlogger and youtube creator hank green tweeted that 40 of americans who take out student loans do not graduate from college he s not the first to make this claim rep alma adams d nc and sen elizabeth warren d mass both made the same claim last year the question do 40 of americans who take out student loans not graduate from college the sources national center for education statistics nces jill barshay an economist and education data reporter for the non profit hechinger report which reports on inequality and innovation in education the answer this claim needs context a department of education survey found that about 40 of student borrowers surveyed didn t graduate but the survey s sample size was small and only spanned a six year period what we found the national center for education statistics nces routinely surveys cohorts of first time beginning students in what it calls the beginning postsecondary students survey the bps surveys students at the end of their first year and then again three years and six years after first entering college nces has completed four of these studies the last of which was the beginning postsecondary students 2012 2017 survey the 2012 2017 bps found that of surveyed freshmen who started college in 2011 and took out loans for their college education between 2011 and 2017 38 5 did not have a degree by june 2017 that s where the 40 figure comes from but the survey has several limitations the survey is based on the responses from 22 500 students who were first enrolled in 2011 12 and responded again to the survey six years later according to the nces s digest of education statistics total fall enrollment for first time degree seeking or certificate seeking students has hovered around 3 million since 2008 that means nces surveyed fewer than 1 of 2011 freshmen the survey also didn t continue beyond june 2017 which means it leaves out anyone who may have earned a degree more than six years after they first enrolled the nces says that just over 25 of bachelor s degree recipients from 2015 16 took longer than six years from the date they first enrolled to get their degree according to jill barshay an economist and education data reporter for the non profit hechinger report which reports on inequality and innovation in education there s a good reason why the data is so limited there is no readily available data to say what percentage of student borrowers never graduate from college barshay said we can only make estimates by triangulating several data sources that aren t comparing apples to apples barshay said a major issue with trying to measure this data is determining how long borrowers have to graduate school before they re included among borrowers who never earned a degree
new york oil prices rose more than 5 yesterday after flows of russian gas to europe fell and russia sanctioned some european gas companies adding to uncertainty in world energy markets oil and gas prices have risen since moscow invaded ukraine in february and the united states and allies subsequently imposed heavy sanctions on russia crude trade has been curtailed and russia has threatened to cut off gas supply to europe though it has stopped short of that move russian gas flows to europe via ukraine fell by a quarter after kyiv halted use of a major transit route blaming interference by occupying russian forces it was the first time exports via ukraine have been disrupted since the invasion that move raised concerns that similar interruptions could follow even as prices are already soaring russia yesterday sanctioned 31 companies based in countries that imposed sanctions on moscow after russia invaded ukraine in february brent crude settled up us 5 05 or 4 9 to us 107 51 rm470 51 a barrel while us west texas intermediate crude climbed us 5 95 a barrel to us 105 71 rm462 63 a 6 increase the european union eu has threatened a full embargo of russian oil though negotiations are continuing because of russia s role as the biggest exporter of crude and fuel the disruptions â which are expected to worsen â have caused markets to tighten around the world especially for refined products like diesel â prices are going to continue to move on up especially if the european union comes to an agreement to phase out russian oil purchases over the balance of this year â said andrew lipow president of lipow oil associates in houston the eu is still haggling over an embargo on russian oil which analysts say would further tighten the market and shift trade flows the vote needs unanimous support but it has been delayed as hungary has dug in its heels in opposition the latest figures on us inventories underscored the dynamics pushing prices higher even though us crude stocks grew by more than 8 million barrels â largely due to another release of strategic reserves â petrol stocks were down by 3 6 million barrels and stocks of distillates fell also refining capacity has dwindled in the us and the nation has ramped up exports to meet demand from buyers overseas so far in 2022 the us is exporting on net roughly 4 million barrels of fuel daily â the 90 utilisation rate numbers arenâ t what they used to be because overall capacity is down â said tony headrick energy market analyst at chs hedging â we are seeing refiners not able to keep up with demand for gasoline petrol â â reuters
kohl s corp shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the company s slate of candidates for the board of directors effectively striking down a campaign by activist investors to take over the company for now according to a preliminary vote count on monday all 13 kohl s candidates were reelected we would like to thank our shareholders for their support throughout this proxy contest said peter boneparth chairman of the board while we have had differences with macellum this board is committed to serving the interests of all our shareholders the board remains focused on running a robust and intentional review of strategic alternatives while executing our strategy to drive shareholder value we appreciate the feedback we have received from our shareholders over the past several months and look forward to engaging with them further the results are considered preliminary until final results are tabulated and certified by the independent inspector of elections and final certification is filed with the securities and exchange commission more large department stores like jc penney have left behind wisconsin small towns but kohl s remains a vital community asset the board members are michael j bender peter boneparth yael cosset christine day chuck floyd kohl s ceo michelle gass margaret jenkins thomas kingsbury robbin mitchell jonas o prising john e schlifske adrianne t shapira and stephanie streeter in one of the largest proxy fights in the nation shareholders gathered virtually and cast their votes for who they trust to lead the company macellum capital management has been pushing for regime and board change since january and nominated 10 people to be on the board kohl s responded to macellum s candidates by adopting a shareholder rights plan often known as a poison pill to prevent an investor from getting more than 10 of the company without a vote from the board although the vote went against macellum it s possible the fight is not over in 2021 macellum negotiated with kohl s and was able to get three board members elected by shareholders so it is possible the activist investor could try again to get board control after the vote jonathan duskin managing partner for macellum released a statement saying he and the firm respect the outcome of the vote but board and the company should not misconstrue today s result as a ringing endorsement of its preferred operating plan which has been met with considerable market skepticism it s unfortunate that many investors voting for the incumbents seem to have bought into the narrative that change in the boardroom would be too disruptive during a sale process and possibly delay or jeopardize a near term transaction duskin said we contend this vote was a shareholder referendum for a sale and we look forward to learning of an announced transaction on the quickest possible horizon however if kohl s is not sold all directors need to be held accountable for any value that is not realized kohl s evaluating potential bids while much of wall street watched the fight between the company and activist investors kohl s has been evaluating bids to buy the company it s been reported that kohl s has received a 8 6 billion joint offer from shopping mall giant simon property and canada based brookfield asset management which together bought jc penney when it filed for bankruptcy in 2020 on april 14 franchise group owner of the vitamin shoppe made a 9 billion offer to buy kohl s in march canadian retailer hudson bay was reported to be interested in kohl s in late january an affiliate of activist hedge fund starboard value lp offered 9 billion to buy the menomonee falls based department store chain as the stock market overall continues to be in decline it s unclear if and at what number kohl s will find a buyer the company is continuing with its strategy to heavily invest in its partnership with sephora by adding hundreds of new sephora at kohl s stores by the end of the year kohl s stock price closed at 46 65 down roughly 5 5 as the market overall continues to be in decline

considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of fcf is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other obligations payments made for business acquisitions amounts spent to buy back shares or pay dividends therefore we believe it is important to view fcf as supplemental to our entire statement of cash flows

lex 18 inflation continues to stay at record highs it was recently reported that rates only came down slightly in april from their peak in march as food prices continue to rise so do some convenience foods that were already taxed in the bluegrass at a higher rate critchfield meats family market has been impacted by inflation and rising food cost like most one store manager jerry cinnamon says inflation is hitting everybody out there kentucky has a 6 sales tax on certain food items critchfield s store says they are doing everything they can to keep costs low we get people from all over kentucky to come in and get our meats we have for years they all save up and come in once a month but i can see where people will not be getting prepared foods because they ll perish quicker cinnamon said and having to stock up on the staples so that they can make less trips with the price of gas and everything else that s probably exactly what people are doing the tax applies to foods like candy soft drinks and prepared foods something that grocers like critchfield s rely on prepared foods include items that are sold hot or heated by the retailer foods combined or mixed by a retailer and foods sold with utensils kentucky retail association says consumer trends show more people are buying ready made foods the kentucky retail federation s director of communication and public affairs steve mcclain says you pick up on the way home and you can take it home make a potato with it at home and then you ve got a meal so it s a convenience factor for people this is a tax that s been around for years but as food costs increase it could impact lower income shoppers or shoppers in food deserts rising gas costs may prevent people from traveling to the grocery store regularly those shoppers might then rely on other retailers such as convenience stores that prepare foods within that tax code university of kentucky professor of dietetics and human nutrition also a part of the college of nursing dr alison gustafson explains that food insufficiency is on the rise they re skipping meals they re reducing foods they would normally buy they are now shopping at places they maybe wouldn t shop at and they re buying less food because they have to dr gustafson points out that people may turn to more unhealthy options which can have long term health consequences she believes the change will come from legislation typically our processed foods that are higher in salt sugar and fat the yummy things are cheaper than produce said dr gustafson farmers need to make a profit and they are now losing money right so everyone is involved in this and so we need to think of policy approaches for how to help dr gustafson explains that current events like the pandemic the war in ukraine and other factors only highlight disparities in the food system

what may seem to one party in a fraught situation to be a merely neutral or even defensive move may well appear to the other side to constitute shameless and radical aggression in face of the ever increasing danger and destruction arising from vladimir putin s apparently demented invasion of the ukraine i thought it might be helpful to direct at the situation some reflections derived from the great greek historian thucydides as to the causes of the great war between athens and sparta in the last third of the fifth century bc 431 404 an event that marred what was otherwise one of the greatest periods of human social and intellectual creativity on record the classical age of greece as it would seem to have a considerable bearing on the analysis of the causes of the present conflict why did the two chief states of the greek world become involved in a long drawn out and mutually destructive conflict which drew in most of the rest of the greek world as well even as far as sicily and southern italy well thucydides who was himself a general in the athenian army but fell from grace as a result of a military failure in the north of greece in 424 bc and was exiled which gave him the leisure to reflect upon the war and compose his immortal history of it declares that in his view the real though unadmitted cause of the war was the growth of athenian power and the spartan fear of that growth that is a most perceptive analysis and i would like to suggest that something like that is best seen as the true cause of the unhappy conflict we are currently faced with in the ukraine and possibly further afield if this is not resolved fairly promptly what led thucydides to his conclusion was briefly this in the wake of the defeat of the persian invasion of greece in 479 athens moved quickly to establish a defensive league of greek states against a recurrence of persian aggression and over the next three decades or so this league had become something that looked rather more like an athenian empire than a league of independent states in the latter part of this period it had been tending to enrol a number of states which sparta would have regarded as within its sphere of interest read more militaristic oligarchy now unlike athens which was an open rather free wheeling democracy encouraging the arts sciences and free speech sparta was very much of a closed state a rather grim militaristic oligarchy holding down a captive class of serfs the so called helots and exercising hegemony over its immediate neighbours in the peloponnese while athens regarded it as a constantly looming threat it saw athens as the endlessly innovative and restless aggressor does any of this sound vaguely familiar let us consider the european american social and political system and how it might appear from the outside starting with nato now nato was founded as we know and as we are continually being reminded as a defensive alliance against the post war threat posed by the soviet union and as such it worked very well indeed as we now know from the perusal of soviet archives made available after the fall of communism the russians were actually much more scared of us than we were of them and saw the united states in particular as constantly encroaching for instance the erection of missile systems aimed at russia in northern turkey but in many other ways as well on the fall of the soviet union and the dissolution of the warsaw treaty organisation commonly known as the warsaw pact in december 1991 logic might seem to have demanded that nato be dissolved also and indeed putin claims that such an undertaking was given to gorbachev at the time by the us and nato leadership but on the contrary nato stayed very much in business and began systematically to gobble up admittedly at their urgent request one after the other of the former warsaw pact members ukrainian stock and so we come to ukraine which russians have always regarded as a sort of honorary part of russia indeed kyiv is widely and reasonably regarded as the cradle of russian orthodox christianity while a number of the most distinguished russian writers such as anton chekhov nikolai gogol and aleksandr solzhenitsyn were of partly or wholly ukrainian stock so when a west leaning uprising succeeded in 2014 in overthrowing the rule of viktor yanukovych alarm bells sounded in the kremlin and these rang a lot louder when it seems petr poroshenko who assumed the presidency promised the russian naval base in crimea to nato if ukraine were allowed to join that for putin was surely the last straw and led to the reclaiming of crimea for russia and ultimately to the present situation but let us turn back for a moment to thucydides what in his view was the final provocation that led to the peloponnesian war it was a kerfuffle that arose in corcyra modern corfu an island which sparta regarded as being firmly within its sphere of influence involving a conflict with its mother city corinth which was in turn an ally of sparta the details of the conflict are rather too complex to inflict on you on this occasion but the upshot was that the athenians acceded to a request from the corcyreans who had previously been broadly within the spartan orbit to accept them into the athenian league and to send a naval expedition to help them the assent of athens to this plea proved the last straw for sparta and war was declared the rest as they say is history but the lesson is surely this that what may seem to one party in a fraught situation to be a merely neutral or even defensive move may well appear to the other side to constitute shameless and radical aggression and this perception can result in a general conflict with unforseeable ramifications the peloponnesian war lasted the best part of 30 years and tore the guts out of greece for a generation the third world war is rather more likely to last about 30 minutes and should mean the end of civilisation as we know it john dillon is regius professor of greek emeritus at trinity college dublin

the live broadcast on may 10th 2022 with that i d like to turn the call over to rob rob kelley chief executive officer thanks emily good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us our mission at talis is to advance health equity and outcomes by delivering accurate infectious disease testing in the moment of need at the point of care over the last 60 days we have made encouraging progress toward assessment and validation of manufacturing scale up for our talis one testing platform a foundational step to support our mission during today s call i ll provide an update on the objectives previously set forth and our path forward then i will turn it over to roger to provide more details on manufacturing and to review our first quarter financials in march we committed to a strategic plan focused on the following key areas one demonstrating our ability to manufacture talis one instruments and cartridges at scale two initiating a phased launch for the talis one covid 19 test system under our eua three concentrating assay development to prepare for 2023 clinical milestones and four preserving cash to carry us through 2024 toward this first objective we engaged external consulting firms and conducted internal reviews to advise us on assessing the product design of our instruments and cartridges for manufacturing at scale evaluating our manufacturing processes and partners and determining appropriate next steps to manufacture both instruments and consumables at the yield and consistency needed to support commercialization this manufacturing assessment is complete and we remain confident there is a path to manufacturing at scale after working out process and minor design modifications importantly i am pleased to report we did not identify any substantial design or supply changes that would require extended time lines to validate based on what we have learned we are implementing modifications around manufacturing processes quality controls and supply conformance we are prioritizing this work to complete verification and validation followed by phased commercialization our team s immediate focus is to bring the talis one system to market and we are diligently executing against this priority once we are in a position to deliver our products at scale our focus will shift to initiating a phased launch for the talis one covid 19 test system under our eua beginning with a limited rollout to prospective customers our fundamental goal with this launch is to ensure an excellent customer experience as we focus on long term system adoption across multiple infectious diseases as a reminder our commercial strategy is to leverage our covid eua to drive initial use of the talis one platform in select market segments these segments represent customers who are seeking molecular point of care systems for infectious disease testing in respiratory sexual and women s health with this in mind we are confident that we are strongly positioned with our talis one system as we broaden our test menu and expand our addressable market while a variety of point of care technologies are commercially available we believe that few if any sufficiently meet the needs of healthcare providers due to limitations with accuracy time to result ease of use price or menu our competitively advantaged system offers robust sample preparation with high sensitivity and specificity on an integrated platform to enable rapid and accurate results in the moment of need additionally we recently completed the first release of our cloud software to provide customers with a comprehensive solution to consolidate patient test information and enhance organizational efficiency we believe this cloud based system called sia dx will further our competitive edge in the large markets we plan to pursue and look forward to gaining customer feedback on this application when we begin the first phase of our commercial launch looking ahead we are focused on addressing the growing unmet need in point of care molecular testing with a clear road map for our pipeline in the near term we plan to pursue a 510 k regulatory pathway for our respiratory panel and are on track to begin collecting samples this year we are also advancing the development of our ct ng assay to begin menu expansion into sexual and women s health this large and growing 5 billion u s market opportunity is characterized by a lack of tests at the point of care where prompt treatment can be prescribed i want to reiterate that we the talis board and management team are encouraged by the progress made in these past couple of months as we work to manufacture a complex system at scale with the goal of serving multiple infectious disease areas over time while covid 19 provides a near term opportunity to introduce the talis one system and gain market acceptance it is just the beginning in realizing our mission to make a meaningful impact on health equity and outcomes with accurate infectious disease testing at the point of care with that i will turn it over to roger to provide more detail on operations and to review our first quarter financials roger roger moody chief financial officer thanks rob with doug lou s departure i have reassumed the responsibility for manufacturing and operations functions i originally established as we pivoted to developing our covid test and scale up manufacturing in mid 2020 prior to joining talis i spent more than two decades in various leadership positions at medtech companies including coo at medsn and coo followed by ceo at glysure here at talis i am fortunate to work with highly experienced and capable manufacturing operations and supply chain leaders and their respective teams i look forward to drawing on this talented group and my past experience to demonstrate our ability to manufacture high quality talis one instruments and cartridges as rob stated earlier we are pleased to have completed the internal and external assessments of our manufacturing processes and product design these assessments provided us with valuable insights on how we can refine our manufacturing and quality control procedures to produce high quality products at scale based on learnings from this manufacturing review we are implementing modifications around manufacturing processes quality controls and supply conformance that are necessary to manufacture at scale while achieving our target quality standards these changes will take some time to implement verify and validate fortunately we have now ruled out the need for a substantial design or supply changes that would require extended time lines to implement i m also encouraged that our recent manufacturing refinements are beginning to yield improvements in instrument first pass acceptance and cartridge performance including reduced invalid rates we will continue to work diligently on making these improvements and expect to be able to provide specific time lines for our commercial launch in the future turning now to first quarter 2022 financial results we recognized 3 million in revenue in the first quarter which was driven by antigen test sales and a final payment from the nih radx contract while we may from time to time pursue other near term revenue generating opportunities we do not expect significant revenue contribution in 2022 turning to expenses first quarter total operating expenses were 33 million compared to 68 million in the same period last year research and development spending for the first quarter of 2022 was 21 million compared to 60 million in the same period of 2021 this decrease was driven primarily by our manufacturing scale up investments that were largely completed in 2021 selling general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 12 million compared to 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 this increase was primarily due to higher personnel expenses including salaries benefits and stock compensation as well as increases from public company expenses unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of march 31 2021 was 188 million in the first quarter we used 45 million in cash of this amount approximately 23 million was related to non recurring payments for manufacturing scale up inventory payroll and insurance as rob mentioned earlier our objective is to ensure that our cash reserves are sufficient to fund operations through the end of 2024 if needed we continue to focus on preserving cash to give us the longest runway possible and believe this objective is achievable as we gain more clarity on the timing and trajectory of our talis one launch this objective may change with that i ll turn the call back over to rob for closing remarks rob kelley chief executive officer thanks roger i m encouraged by the progress our team has made over the last couple of months toward understanding modifying and completing verification and validation of our manufacturing scale up i continue to believe it is a matter of when not if we are able to deliver the long term value proposition of our talis one system with the team s continued focus on execution i am confident we are on the right path to deliver on our 2022 business objectives we see a clear and fundamental need for rapid accurate and expansive point of care testing for infectious diseases and are committed to bringing the talis one system to market in doing so we believe we will be well positioned to address a multibillion dollar opportunity in respiratory women s and sexual health which we expect to be our core focus we look forward to updating you on our progress in the months ahead with that we will now open the call up for questions jesse questions answers operator thank you speakers our first question is from the line of rachel vatnsdal of j p morgan your line is now open rachel vatnsdal j p morgan analyst hey thanks for taking the questions so during last quarter you flagged that the invalid test rate was greater than 10 and today you mentioned that you made some improvements just given the manufacturing implementation that you ve been doing so where does that error rate stands today and then what does that validate need to get to ahead of the full commercial launch roger moody chief financial officer hi rachel this is roger i ll take that question so we ve made some good progress over the last couple of months and our target is to get that rate as low as possible ultimately we certainly would like to launch the product under 10 in fact our eua studies we had a rate of invalid under 10 and so we are now seeing us approach that number and more importantly than even seeing the number come down we re also seeing the variability around that number come down which is also good news so the changes that we re making are showing improvements already that said we re continuing to make other changes to make sure that when we launch this product that the customers have a great result so we are going through a very methodical verification and validation process to ensure that we get that lower invalid rate in when we launched this to customers rachel vatnsdal j p morgan analyst great and then could you spend a minute just talking about supply chain and inflation now that you re starting to get at that manufacturing curve to approach that full scale launch how is the emerging profile changed for the product just given inflation in supply chain roger moody chief financial officer sure so we are very fortunate to have purchased quite a bit of materials last year and into the beginning of this year but mostly last year to scale up and so from an instrument perspective we purchased parts for 5 000 instruments and so we re largely supplied for a good number of placements on the consumables side we also purchased materials for a fairly healthy number of cartridges to be manufactured so we do not have any what we consider to be supply constraints right now and also it helps from an efficiency of working capital because we ve already purchased and in fact expensed this inventory rachel vatnsdal j p morgan analyst got it and then last one for me just on the 510 k for the respiratory panel you mentioned that you re going to begin collecting samples later this year so obviously you ll likely miss this respiratory season but when do you think that you can receive that 510 k approval and would you be at full commercial launch ahead of next respiratory season so for the 2023 to 24 respiratory season thanks rob kelley chief executive officer sure rachel this is rob so i appreciate the question and we certainly are working diligently to bring our respiratory panel to market of course we re not providing time lines at this moment we do have a corporate objective to initiate our staged launch or phase launch toward the end of 2022 if things go well i mean obviously we re doing a lot of work right now on validating our instrumentation and as roger pointed out looking at invalid rates and the quality of our cartridges if all goes well we d like to start that and given the data that we re seeing right now i feel more and more confident that we ll have some time lines in the near future rachel vatnsdal j p morgan analyst great thanks for taking the questions roger moody chief financial officer sure operator next question is from the line of derik de bruin of bank of america your line is now open derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good afternoon roger moody chief financial officer hey derik derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey i m sorry we re at our healthcare conference so i m bouncing around over the place but just on sort of like the cash burn or like targets for this year roger moody chief financial officer sure so we haven t put out numbers but what we i did put in the prepared remarks was that the cash we used in the first quarter was 45 million about half of that was non recurring 23 million so just over half so we see that that cash burn continuing to come down we ll see some further benefits we think each quarter of this year and then as we get into next year we would expect to see one of two things either contribution from gross profit and or we would make further cash savings measures and either way we see that cash being able to stretch out for through 2024 derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you and i just i m sort of curious on your feedback from the field i mean given the covid waning and we re getting there s a lot of point of care platforms out there i guess what gives you confidence that you re going to be able to basically make inroads into the market when you re coming to the market so late rob kelley chief executive officer yes derik it s a good question i think we all feel the dwindling effects of covid as masks come off and people are getting back to work into the airports and traffic these days here in san francisco ultimately we believe first of all that we re seeing a lot of demand decline in the antigen space not as much in the molecular space which is obviously good for our business and good for molecular testing the other piece of that is i mean we think that there s great ways to differentiate the molecular test systems in the market menu is one of them accuracy is one price point ease of use all of those things and as we look at where we re positioning ourselves in the market we re focused on building a customer base that s going to be a long term user of our product and that long term user is going to be looking at respiratory health with sexual and women s health and the way that we designed our product with this robust sample preparation on board is going to enable us to do things a little bit differently than other vendors that are out there i believe namely the extraction and purification of the target nucleic acids and so as you move toward different tests like bacterial vaginosis you start to see yeast and types of bacteria gram positive bacteria that are difficult to life we ve designed our system for that so as we go forward to more and more challenging pathogens in the women s health space we think we ll have a leg up and yes the first step is for us to get the product to the market and launch covid but i do i am optimistic that we have some real value in the way we design the cartridge that will extend into the longer term menu derik de bruin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thank you operator your next question is from the line of mark massaro of btig your line is now open mark massaro btig analyst hey guys thanks for the questions and for all the updates i guess i just want to clarify your commentary on the respiratory panel in the 510 k can you just confirm that that is a flu covid panel rob kelley chief executive officer correct at the current state is right now we are focused on covid flu a and flu b for the respiratory health mark massaro btig analyst great and should we is it fair for us to assume that it s unlikely that you will commercialize your eua emergency use authorized covid test rob kelley chief executive officer i m sorry are you asking if it s unlikely that we will be commercializing our covid eua test mark massaro btig analyst correct rob kelley chief executive officer no so as i mentioned earlier we have a strategic objective this year to do a phased launch and the first phase of that launch we re hoping to squeeze into 2022 if all goes well roger moody chief financial officer yes and if we do so it will be under the covid eua that we currently have mark massaro btig analyst ok i appreciate that clarification i guess what are some of the maybe for roger you talked about the 23 million of non recurring in q1 how much of that was related to maybe severance or consulting or manufacturing remediation expenses and so maybe the second part of it is should we expect somewhere around 22 million or so to be kind of that recurring run rate throughout the rest of this year roger moody chief financial officer yeah so to provide you with a little more color without providing a specific projection here mark we the largest portion of the non recurring was trailing payments for the manufacturing scale up and inventory those aren t completely over so we re going to still see a little bit of that onetime spend here in the second quarter but it s trending down dramatically there were some onetime charges related to salaries that we took down in the reduction in force as well as severance they were smaller amounts and then there s also some large premiums that we paid in the first quarter so i would expect that we ll see it trending down i don t know that i would go as far as to say it s going to go all the way down to no non recurring cash flow this year or this quarter but it will continually come down we also have the benefit of working capital advantage here that we have prepurchased all of this inventory in these materials so most companies as they re getting ready for launch have a fairly sizable investment that they need to make in inventory we ve already made that and we also have no debt so we feel pretty good about our balance sheet right now mark massaro btig analyst ok great and just my last question on the ct ng assay what are some of the milestones we can expect and should we expect clinical trials to perhaps initiate in 2023 rob kelley chief executive officer so we haven t given time lines on the milestones yet although obviously we are working through those now and so i guess at this point in time we won t we don t have that information but as we get more clarity on our manufacturing status hopefully that will give us the insights for us to be able to do that and mark one other response i should have shared with you earlier on the covid eua part the rationale for us moving forward with covid at this point in time is not just to get covid sales it s to prove our system right we think we have a great system and rather than wait for our first 510 k to do so this gives us an opportunity to get our products into the hands of customers specifically kols in others who really can dig in on this and attest to the value that this system can bring it also gives us an opportunity to learn like we did with antigen testing to deliver product to customers to support customers to get a feel for what they like for new enhancements to it etc so even if there s not a huge amount of adoption of our system for covid getting the system into the market is going to be huge for us and i think as the customers see it we will start to see an increased demand for it and making sure we put those placements in the right locations that will drive long term revenue with our extended menu is going to be key mark massaro btig analyst ok great actually maybe just one more your decision to pursue a 510 k on the flu covid is that because you re not expecting euas to be sort of a i don t know 2023 or 2024 option i guess what are you hearing maybe from the agency with respect to the duration of these eua rob kelley chief executive officer yes so we haven t heard anything else from the agencies that anyone else hasn t heard it s just we expect that as covid is winding down they may start to make decisions to that end i do believe however that there was some guidance earlier about covid flu products and the requirements to be able to take a covid flu through ivd i m sorry through eua and it was around test capacity i believe we had to do something like 500 000 tests per week in order to be able to apply for an eua for covid flu since even with at capacity our systems are only 1 million a month we determined that it was the best course for us to just move forward with the traditional 510 k submission and not try to find some way around that volume requirement mark massaro btig analyst ok that makes sense thanks for taking the questions roger moody chief financial officer sure operator thank you participants i ll now turn the call back over to talis s panel for final remarks rob kelley chief executive officer ok well thank you for joining us

duke energy corp bid 155 million to secure the federal lease for 55 154 acres in the atlantic ocean 20 miles off bald head island southeast of wilmington to develop what could be as much as a 1 6 gigawatt wind project duke energy renewables wind llc a subsidiary of duke s commercial duke energy sustainable solutions business was named the provisional winner on wednesday of one of two n c offshore wind lease auctions held by the bureau of ocean energy management the auction for a companion 54 937 acre lease was provisionally awarded for 160 million to totalenergies renewables a subsidiary of the french multi national totalenergies se how it relates to n c clean energy plan duke n c president stephen de may said winning the lease is an important step for duke nyse duk as it works to comply with the n c clean energy plan adopted in october as part of the energy solutions for n c act securing this lease creates optionality for future offshore wind if the north carolina utilities commission determines it s part of the least cost path to achieve 70 carbon reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050 he said as we continue to assess the area and project potential we look forward to listening and learning from diverse stakeholders and community members in the region to ensure we are being thoughtful about all aspects of the potential project the company will file proposals for complying with the plan to the commission may 16 the plan calls for duke to reduce it n c carbon emissions to 70 of its 2005 levels by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050 duke will offer several different paths to achieve those targets including the use of wind power and small modular nuclear reactors the commission will consider duke s information along with proposals from other groups in the state to develop a final n c carbon plan for duke by the end of the year what is timeline for construction and operations subject to regulatory approval duke could begin site assessment and other preliminary activities in 2023 if it can begin that work then it would be on track to complete the project and put it in service as early as the 2030 to 2032 time period that would be in line with what duke has said it will be including in its proposal to the commission duke s wind subsidiary will have a year to come up with a site plan for boem s approval that involves detailing how duke will evaluate the actual wind energy resources available and the potential impacts a project would have on the ocean in the bald head area that is the first step in what is expected to be a 10 year development process duke says boem must approve a construction and operations plan and all federal and state regulatory requirements must be met as part of that effort analyst weighs in guggenheim partners analyst shahriar pourezza wrote in a note last night that duke was one of 16 companies that had been pre cleared to bid on the projects he said he caught up with people in duke management after the auction while duke s participation in the auction was known a win was by no means broadly expected in our view given the much loftier valuation seen in boem s february new york bight offshore lease auction and management s repeated commitment to investors to practice disciplined bidding as part of its clean energy transition he wrote the new york bidding involved six tracts totaling 488 201 acres the provisional winners bid a combined 4 4 billion to win those leases german giant rwe ag otc rweoy alone bid 1 1 billion for one of the tracts now pourezza wrote attention will turn to north carolina regulators support from the ncuc will be essential for the company to be able to ultimately proceed with development in our view his note said we expect to gain a better sense of where that level of support stands as we follow the evolution of monday s carbon plan filing towards its final version which nc s hb 951 clean energy law mandates must be finalized by the ncuc by dec 31 while duke energy renewables wind is an unregulated energy company not subject to the n c commission development of the project is likely to depend on the commission s approval of offshore wind a reliable and least cost way to produce some of the clean energy duke s carolinas utilities will need without that approval duke renewables will not be able to sell power from the planned project to the regulated utilities how much electricity could be generated the lease is a step toward the biden administration s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore electricity in the united states by 2030 says interior secretary deb haaland together with an all of government approach we can combat the effects of climate change while creating good paying union jobs that can benefit underserved communities today s lease sale is further proof that there is strong industry interest and that america s clean energy transition is here she says duke estimates its potential project could ultimately supply enough electricity for about 375 000 homes getting the electricity from the projects to customers in the carolinas will involve developing billions of dollars worth of new transmission infrastructure construction including lines to get the power on land and then to transport the electricity to more populous areas that can make use of it this is the second offshore wind auction boem has completed in north carolina in 2017 avangrid renewables an oregon based subsidiary of spain s iberdrola group bid 9 1 million to win the auction for a 50 000 acre wind area off north
