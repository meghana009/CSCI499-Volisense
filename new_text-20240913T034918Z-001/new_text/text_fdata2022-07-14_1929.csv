financial goals get started now what is a bear market a bear market is defined as any period in which prices fall by 20 or more that s what a bear market means but it s also important to understand what a bear market doesn t mean this isn t a sign that the stock market will definitely suffer long term losses nor does it mean that a recession is necessarily coming a bear market is a loss of value in stocks that take a significant amount of time to recoup when the downward trends end a bear market typically makes many investors afraid of investing in the markets a lot of people end up taking their money out of the market losing any gains that had been erased by the current market condition a bear market has always been followed by stronger gains in stocks that eventually and as a whole end up stronger than before the bear market began tips for investing during a bear market when a bear market occurs it typically takes between six and 18 months for stocks to recover their losses in particular if you need assets during that time period for example if you are retired or plan on buying a house this can be a big problem so what should you do here are four things you can do with your portfolio during a bear market hold on if you can bear markets reflect what s known as systematic risk this means that stock prices often decline based on what s going on in the market overall rather than the weakness of any individual business investors often sell because they don t want to take losses in the market overall not because they ve lost confidence in any particular business this skews traditional price indicators you can t necessarily take losses as an indication that a given company has gotten weaker because falling stock prices may indicate that investors have lost confidence in the s p 500 not the business mode except for when they haven t so the first rule of thumb in a bear market is to avoid selling if you can or at least don t make selling your first instinct if you sell during a bear market you re likely to absorb unnecessary losses from stocks that have declined despite the underlying company s value that doesn t mean you should have diamond hands just analyze risk the same way you always would if you think that a company s business model has gotten weaker or that it never really had that value to begin with then it may indeed be time to sell a bear market can reveal overvalued assets just make your moves based on the fundamentals and avoid selling unless you re sure it s the right move seek companies with high earnings per share for the reasons above a bear market is an excellent time to buy stocks since investors are selling based on systematic risk by definition they ll often sell good companies for low prices so this is a good era to hold stocks you already own and to buy stocks if you have the capital to do as long as they re strong but how can you tell the difference between a strong stock burdened with systematic risk and a weak company exposed by the market the truth is there s no sure fire way to know anyone who says otherwise is lying but a good rule of thumb is to look for what s called eps or earnings per share this is the measure of a company s profits relative to its share price a high eps means that the company is making a lot of money relative to its share price which often indicates a healthy company with an undervalued stock these are often good buys in a weak market invest in index funds for many investors the advice during a bear market doesn t change for example invest in index funds for most investors most of the time the best investment is an s p 500 index fund these tend to give you the best balance of diversity since an index fund represents a broad spectrum of individual stocks and assets vs growth this is more true than ever during a bear market while individual stocks may not recover from a bear market historically the stock market overall tends to do so as a result buying into an index fund while the market is down is a good way to buy a historically strong asset at a reduced price now this doesn t guarantee any specific results or outcomes however on an ordinary basis most investors should invest heavily in a good s p 500 index fund most of the time stagger your investments many investors look for bear markets as an opportunity to invest heavily this practice is called buying the dip and it can be a very strong approach to finance overall it tracks warren buffet s advice after all to buy when others are selling and sell when others are buying just be sure to practice moderation there s no telling when a bear market has bottomed out nor how long it will take for assets to recover their value so you don t want to go all in at any given time instead invest steadily over time you can certainly buy more heavily during a bear market but do so in pieces invest a given amount of money one month then another parcel the next that way you can capture the gains of an undervalued market while not going too heavily in any given direction during a volatile and unpredictable era above all else be patient and remember that this too shall pass often sooner than it seems the bottom line investing in a bear market typically creates fear for many investors but it can actually just mean being more aggressive and patient in your investment decisions more than anything else it often means not changing your overall strategy much at all although maybe getting a little more aggressive than usual working with a financial advisor can provide a huge peace of mind

the following is the unofficial transcript of a cnbc interview with lynn good duke energy corp nyse duk ceo from the cnbc evolve global summit which took place today wednesday july 13th video from the interview will be available at cnbc com evolve interview with duke energy ceo jim cramer hi tyler thank you so much for having us this is terrific lynn good welcome to what i regard as being the most thoughtful part of what we do at cnbc i want to get right into it because i want to approach this issue a little bit different from what other people have done i ve been looking at what the inflation numbers are and i ve obviously looked at what s going on in germany lynn you are probably i would say the most forward executive not just in the power industry but almost in every industry in trying to rid us of air that can kill people i put it like that because i think when we just say that it s just noxious or something we lose sight of the fact that there are people who we can identify who have been killed by what the emissions are how can you justify though the increasing nature of peril of moving to cleaner energy with the cost of it and the possibility that when we get there it s not

to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests if you re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals get started now lynn good you know jim great question and i appreciate the opportunity to be here today and to have this conversation with you as we think about the future and driving to a lower carbon future we think about it as something that has to be accomplished within the context of affordability and reliability it just doesn t work if we don t accomplish all of those things together so as we develop plans on how we are going to progress setting ambitious targets on reducing carbon we also do that within the constraints of what is going to maintain a reliable system that our customers count on and also keeping an eye on affordability so i think that combination is something that we can t lose sight of as we make the important progress on carbon but not step away from the reliability and affordability that makes our economy competitive jim cramer i had the great fortune of being someone who interviewed mr rogers jim rogers someone who really was for many people duke energy before you he was committed to coal why because he wanted the most reliable power he wanted the cheapest power and then one day he basically had a revelation a conversion if you don t mind saying this is just a bad idea there were protests but he took it upon himself to say you know what we re backing away at the same time that he backed away there are people in the communities that you serve who are deeply involved and need coal to do well how do you reconcile that with the idea that you have a senator perhaps the most powerful senator in the country who really says let s go slow on this coal removal lynn good well i think a couple of things to point to jim is we ve already made incredible progress in reducing our dependence on coal and lowering carbon emissions so for duke energy carbon emissions are down almost 45 percent from 2005 which has been the result of an orderly transition from coal using natural gas of course using renewables wind and solar increasingly using battery technology as we talk to our communities and we talk to our states about the need to continue to make progress on carbon but also continue to introduce diversity into the supply mix i believe that conversation is going well i think people understand that over the next several decades we must transition away from fossil fuels we must transition away from coal we need to introduce renewables battery technology energy efficiency nuclear needs to be a part of the equation so our commitment is to continue to have these conversations not only with customers but with policy makers with communities that could be impacted so that that transition is something we all understand we can plan for and we can make the adjustments necessary for the economy of the future jim cramer so you mentioned battery technology twice we re quite familiar with and my chattel trust owns shares in honeywell darius adamczyk the ceo has come on several times and told us do not be surprised if they don t have some battery technology that will blow us away are you working with darius on this lynn good we are in fact darius is right down the street from me here in charlotte and battery technology is something we re spending a lot of time on jim because we look at it as an important part of the equation as we introduce more renewables having a way to store that power so that it meets the needs of our customers when they have demand for energy is essential and so we are working with honeywell we re also working with a variety of other technologies hydrogen advanced nuclear these are the types of technologies that we think are going to be essential as we get toward the end of this decade into the 2030s to continue our progress on transition to a clean energy future jim cramer so lynn i ve been a big believer in nuclear even from the days when david crane was in texas trying to do it and failed failed dramatically in several of its initiatives but really the biggest flop i thought he had was nuclear i know canada s got some small models i know ge is trying to do some things but having when the russian soldiers went to chernobyl and actually kicked up the soil there there was a lot of radiation midnight in chernobyl an incredible text basically tells you that you can t stop a meltdown without just phenomenal casualties occurring and it makes me wonder we keep hearing that nuke could have a renaissance but every time i think of nuke i think of the one that i live next door to in sacramento i think of three mile island which i covered as a reporter and i think of chernobyl and i did not cover fukushima but i say to myself we re kidding ourselves we keep talking about nuke but it s too expensive and it s too dangerous what makes you as a person who really knows this stuff even confident at all that a new nuclear power plant could be built in this country lynn good jim i think the safety of nuclear is job one and you ve mentioned a couple of instances around the world where safety has been a concern and our commitment at duke energy and in the u s nuclear industry is to continue to maintain safety as the very highest priority if i think about duke energy 50 percent of the power that we produce in the carolinas is from nuclear and safety is what we do every day job one to make sure that those plants are operating in a way that not only we expect but our customers and communities etc so safety to me is job one and i do believe nuclear can be operated in a safe way if we think about the role it needs to play in the future and we believe in low carbon think about a world without nuclear and i think about the carolinas where 50 percent of the power today is from carbon free nuclear i do not have a technology that can replace that today so finding a way to keep those plants running and running safely is important to reducing carbon then if we can find a way to bring in commercially viable so cost effective smaller modular reactors that are of course safe i believe they could be a part of the solution so we are advocates for increased investment continuing investment in these nuclear technologies to see if they can reach a point of commercial availability in the 2030 s so that they can be a part of a diverse mix of resources that we need to accomplish our goals around carbon reduction jim cramer well do you think to some degree journalists are part of the problem here i mean look right in front of you i conflated chernobyl which was a horrible accident with three mile island where nobody died i mean our country s record in nuclear is perfect when i compare to the data that i ve seen by people been killed by coal and i say killed i mean like they died because of things that coal caused it is ridiculous how safe nuclear is versus what we have suggested with coal and also we know from methane from nuclear power i mean from natural gas so why does nuclear power other than for someone like me who said wait fukashima and hey chernobyl we have not been able to tell the story in this country i am so pro nuke it s ridiculous from the day this show began but we ve not been able to tell the story about how what happens is there s nukes where they re run well and that s the united states and there s nukes where they re not run well and that s overseas and we have to distinguish the two and therefore it s safe in this country lynn good well i do believe jim we should continue to tell the story around nuclear and i am a believer and believe deeply that the commitment in the u s domestically the safe nuclear operation is unparalleled but the u s is also involved around the world with the nuclear association world nuclear association to try to increase the focus on nuclear safety around the world and our commitment to that remains unchanged but i think any technology and you referenced it whether it s emissions from coal methane from natural gas whether it s implications from mining for materials that may be necessary for renewables and batteries there is no solution that s without some form of environmental impact or some impact that we need to deal with so our strategies to maintain safe operations to take care of the environment to operate with excellence is something that this industry has deeply engrained we care deeply about and it s our commitment as we continue this transition to clean energy that we take all of those things into consideration and deliver it in a way that our customers expect jim cramer okay so there was a time when i believed that you couldn t go fast enough to all green mike wirth who spoke earlier was talking about from chevron that you need to be able to basically go brown to green i didn t think there was any necessity in doing that at all now i see what s happened and germany had the most forward policy toward it and germany only has 27 percent of the days of saudi we certainly got more than that we have more wind but without a doubt they went too fast and i think anybody who thinks they didn t go too fast has their eyes closed to what s going on in ukraine do you ever think in your darkest moments that wait a second maybe we have to go slower look at what happened to germany they moved too quickly lynn good jim i think it gets back to the point that you made at the beginning of our discussion when you talk about the pace of change you have to maintain a focus on reliability you have to maintain a focus on affordability and you must make progress i think if we think about the transition with those three constructs then we have a framework within which we can make decisions reliability is incredibly important we don t have a renewable technology today that operates is load following that operates when customers need the power or that is available and controllable for the most part we take renewable energy when it s generated we can store it for a few hours but not over long periods or seasons and so that s what makes things like natural gas important as part of this transition so in my mind if i keep my eye on maintaining a reliable system moving as quickly as i can toward carbon free resources and maintaining a focus on affordability then i think the pace is about right jim cramer now the australian oil and gas companies pretty much assured the australian people that they would never export so much that the prices would go up they didn t know they made a mistake it was wrong our natural gas companies are very confident about a 100 year supply but when i look at the surge of natural gas prices from 4 to 6 i put it directly on the feet of what is going on in europe and the export and now the head long run to have more export facilities lng in louisiana and texas are we going too fast there are we helping our allies at the expense of your constituents lynn good you know there are a lot of dynamics going on jim and it sounds like you ve had conversations with some of the producers today i think we ve had a bounce back in demand coming out of the pandemic we ve had global issues around the world impacting what s going on we also have not been increasing production here in the u s we have some infrastructure issues we have labor and logistics that have been a challenge so you ve had a confluence of events and i think the issue becomes where do we want to take production over a 10 to 20 year period so that those who are producing natural gas can make the investments that they need to want to make and have some certainty about where it s going the prices have moderated recently so we have seen some balancing but i think it s an important strategic decision as we go forward i m a believer that increasing production and maintaining a pace around clean energy is possible we can do both i think that s a debate worth having jim cramer do you think the industry is a villain or shady and not capable of compromise as i believe our president feels and i say that if only because the president felt that the saudi arabians were pariahs were murderers he was happy to sit down all the photo opportunities you want over there in saudi arabia but no sit down with mike wirth no sit down with darren woods no sit down with scott sheffield no sit down with these people in oil and gas whom you and i both know are reasonable people who are doing their absolute best to try to weed out the carbon where they can do what is going on in washington that makes it so that they are the enemy of what you are trying to accomplish in many ways lynn good well i think energy has been a topic jim for some time and there are conversations on both sides of the equation carbon reduction energy independence affordability energy stability i mean there are so many different dimensions i think we need to talk about all of them and we need to have a long term view i think about my business i m planning for what i believe is going to be necessary to serve my customers to electrify our economy in the 2030s and the 2040s i m trying to get to net zero by 2050 that means we have to have conversations about a variety of resources about diversity of supply because there s never been a single source of power generation that has powered our country and i don t expect there to be over the next several decades so i would encourage the conversations i think we can have them jim cramer good i m glad you say that because not compromising with great americans who have done their absolute best like mike wirth 3 billion to 10 billion in just a few years time in order to be able to make it so there s more renewables means that that person is a great american and should be sat down with and should not be insulted which is what i think he was that s my own words now let s talk about the state of north carolina to be a little more upbeat we said that that was the most desirable state to work in you ve got some terrific people i mentioned darius adamczyk at honeywell he moves his company down the block from me in new jersey to north carolina you have so much industry coming down to that area is there a big surge in the need for electricity and what are the constraints that they want how many of these companies come to you and say you know what we ll come to you but we do not want any fossil fuels to be part of the mosaic by 2050 lynn good you know jim north carolina is open for business and i was so pleased to see the ranking of the state because there s been a lot of hard work in north carolina to understand how to drive the economy how to make sure we ve got the worse force how to attract the industries necessary to really power the growth of the state going forward when we are a part of those discussions and we frequently are because energy can be a part of the decision process that a company goes through in deciding where to locate we re always at the table coming up with solutions and ways that we can partner to meet their needs many of our customers have sustainability goals whether it s a net zero goal by 2050 or it s a 50 percent reduction by 2030 and we re anxious to have those conversations and to share where we re going and what else we can do to help the customers meet their sustainability goals jim cramer we ve spent a lot of time on mad money with the ceos of the cyber security companies to a person i would like to say actually to a man unfortunately but to a person they are all convinced that some of the easier targets after colonial pipeline are the people in the energy business because they re somewhat unsophisticated not everybody i think you have a very good read on this about what can happen and the need to be able to have a staff that understands you know what we can t just keep paying ethereum to companies so that they let our pipelines work who have you brought in what kind of strategies do you have to be sure that you re not targeted lynn good jim i would say to you that the electric industry has been operating under mandatory standards around cyber security for some time because we understand the importance that we represent to our communities as critical infrastructure to serve not only urban communities but rural communities as well so those standards have been in place for some time we re very active with information sharing not only with government partners but with industry partners and we ve been making increasing investments not only to strengthen our system but to put tools and processes in place around cyber and then we also drill which means recovery methods and plans simulating what could happen if we had a cyber attack if we had a physical attack if we had an explosion or an accident of some sort around the system so this work is ongoing and i would say to you that the investment has been increasing year over year and we understand the importance of maintaining our focus on doing as much as we can and working closely with these partners to make sure we have the kind of infrastructure that our customers and communities count on jim cramer okay so lastly lynn we had some cpi number out today it was torrid it was not what anybody wanted one of the components was i don t want to say skyrocketing because that would be hyperbole but much higher energy costs to consumers obviously the gasoline you do not control that but if there was a way to be able to reduce the price of energy to your constituents would it not require you to get dirtier and is that an option at a time when people are very worried about inflation to say you know what we re going slow here we ve got a number of great coal plants we can extend them we can make them cleaner and we can keep power cheaper is that a compromise worth making lynn good you know jim i don t think that s an equation that necessarily makes sense because it s actually the fuel that has been driving the energy prices the high natural gas prices coal prices are very high as the demand for coal overseas has accelerated and the price has actually increased to a global market price i believe what the answer is is to work on domestic production to work on our transition to clean energy in a way that finds that balance between affordability and reliability and to work closely with customers in this moment where prices are high to make sure energy efficiency programs are being put in place to make sure customers understand usage to communicate to provide flexibility on payment arrangements to find assistance for those that are vulnerable and to work our way through this transition in a way that demonstrates the right long term decisions so that we get to our ultimate goal of net zero by 2050 i don t think it s a choice on what type of energy we provide it s looking at the long term and making long term choices that achieve the goals of affordability reliability and clean jim cramer but are some of these more natural obviously renewables inherently unreliable given in some parts of your territory you don t get a lot of sun and you don t get a lot of wind lynn good well renewables come with an operating profile that s intermittent jim just as you indicate we have the ability with solar to put battery storage to move the power around a few hours wind has a slightly different profile depending on the area of the country that you re in nuclear of course runs 95 percent of the time we have energy efficiency products that our customers can use and of course we use natural gas where reliability is needed so it gets back to that equation of a diverse supply which has always been the case in the electric sector i believe it will be the case in the future and that combination is what makes reliability work jim cramer well lynn you are a great steward of the last part of jim rogers career when he came around to understanding how important his company could be in a leadership position you are in a leadership position i want to thank you so much lynn good duk is the symbol i ve liked this

the lawsuit alleges musk is seeking to leave the deal because the market has turned downward as expected on tuesday twitter announced that it is suing elon musk three days after he announced his intention to exit his agreement to purchase the company the suit filed in delaware s court of chancery attempts to hold musk to his agreement to buy twitter for 44 billion musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests the lawsuit says having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away this repudiation follows a long list of material contractual breaches by musk that have cast a pall over twitter and its business twitter brings this action to enjoin musk from further breaches to compel musk to fulfill his legal obligations and to compel consummation of the merger upon satisfaction of the few outstanding conditions the suit cites several tweets from musk throughout the process noting that the businessman is ubiquitous on the social media network attorney raffi melkonian noted on twitter that 20 paragraphs of the more than 60 page complaint consisted of musk s tweets the lawsuit alleges musk is seeking to leave the deal because the market has turned downward so musk wants out rather than bear the cost of the market downturn as the merger agreement requires musk wants to shift it to twitter s stockholders the suit says this is in keeping with the tactics musk has deployed against twitter and its stockholders since earlier this year when he started amassing an undisclosed stake in the company and continued to grow his position without required notification it tracks the disdain he has shown for the company that one would have expected musk as its would be steward to protect since signing the merger agreement musk has repeatedly disparaged twitter and the deal creating business risk for twitter and downward pressure on its share price the suit also accuses musk of bad faith arguing that he isn t serious in his arguments about the company s bot problem since he had initially claimed he was buying the company partly to do something about the bot problem as its owner of musk s reasons for bowing out of the merger twitter calls them pretexts lack any merit twitter has abided by its covenants and no company material adverse effect has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur the twitter suit claims melkonian added on twitter that musk did not give twitter a heads up before his tweet that the deal was on hold musk by contrast has been acting against this deal since the market started turning and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process he has purported to put the deal on hold pending satisfaction of imaginary conditions breached his financing efforts obligations in the process violated his obligations to treat requests for consent reasonably and to provide information about financing status violated his non disparagement obligation misused confidential information and otherwise failed to employ required efforts to consummate the acquisition the suit also reveals that in march musk met with two twitter directors including founder and ex ceo jack dorsey later informing twitter ceo parag agrawal and twitter board chair bret taylor that he had in mind three options relative to twitter join its board take the company private or start a competitor as a result musk joined the company s board in april but switched less than a week later to attempt to buy the company the lawsuit also goes into further detail about the back and forth information twitter provided to musk over the bot dispute in recent weeks for one thing using one of musk s tweets noted that his own study about bot accounts had only included 100 followers compared to twitter s process which entails daily sampling for a total set of approximately 9 000 accounts per quarter that are manually reviewed as the calendar turned to june the lawsuit said musk continued to disparage the company which twitter claimed violated the merger agreement twitter had already provided a wealth of data sweeping far beyond the bounds of what might conceivably be deemed reasonably necessary to consummate the transaction twitter noted that musk while continuing to accuse twitter of misrepresenting its spam or false account estimate had offered not a single fact to support the accusation and twitter observed that defendants increasingly irrelevant unsupportable and voluminous information requests appeared directed not at consummating the merger but rather the opposite trying to avoid the merger the ceo agrawal around that time had attempted to schedule a meeting with musk and musk bowed out of a scheduled june 21 meeting knowing that his actions risked harm to twitter and its stockholders wreaked havoc on the trading price of twitter s stock and could have serious consequences for the deal musk leveled serious charges both publicly and through lawyer letters that twitter had misled its investors and customers but musk exhibited little interest in

collaboration and a proactive approach are essential in discovering new data security risks regulations and measures in the financial service industry given the fact that companies within the financial service industry use data for finding revenue streams providing personalized experiences and storing customer information it s essential to focus on data security data security is one of the key business goals in this sector as losing customer data can seriously harm an organization s overall reputation and success all banking businesses rapidly adopt different technologies leading to various exposures and challenges get the full series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on charlie munger in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more this post will introduce the five most significant current challenges and ways to solve them data compliance challenges managing data is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges of data security today the amount of data that financial companies are responsible for is often impossible even to imagine and keeping all that data secure and private isn t any easier however with numerous data privacy regulations popping up worldwide keeping up with all data compliance challenges has never been more challenging organizations even lose approximately 4 million in revenue due to a single data non compliance event what is data compliance data compliance refers to following specific data related regulations and standards that governments corporate governance or industry organizations set forth these regulations protect the privacy and security of people s personal and sensitive information by closely defining the rules and protocols for collecting storing managing and using online data these regulations can exist on a local federal or regional level therefore you ll come across data compliance guidelines and rules that affect only a particular area e g california the entire country e g the us or an even bigger entity e g the eu keeping up with the latest laws with data compliance laws customers worldwide can control how organizations use their personal and sensitive information although data compliance laws have been around for some time now the two latest significant laws are the gdpr and the ccpa the general data protection regulation gdpr is a data compliance law by the european union it focuses on providing companies with guidelines on collecting and processing the personal information of people living within the eu boundaries the california consumer privacy act ccpa is a similar law to the gdpr except it focuses on the citizens of california keeping up with the latest laws and regulations is a must for every company that plans to collect and interact with customer data companies need to be informed about the latest rules and regulations that could affect them high compliance costs becoming and staying data compliant is essential but expensive namely every company that decides to collect analyze or store customer data must pay for data compliance the total compliance costs can vary depending on the law and location for instance getting started with the gdpr costs a company approximately 900 000 more than 1 million although the maintenance costs vary the ccpa compliance costs aren t much cheaper they can range from 50 000 for small businesses to 2 million for large enterprises so even if companies want to be data compliant paying for all the expenses costs a lot technology compliance with technology playing a crucial role in how companies do business today technological compliance is essential for organizations that want to maintain their financial health around 66 of small businesses struggle with financial issues especially when paying for operational expenditures financial technology and apps could be the solution to alleviating these finance related chores but keeping up with the latest tech developments and innovations is also necessary for maintaining technology compliance in the long run data privacy maintaining data privacy is rapidly becoming one of the biggest challenges for all companies worldwide not just those in the financial service industry failing to keep data private can lead to unauthorized people accessing the data in question and exposing it which automatically leads to the damaging of compliance protocols therefore keeping data private secure and away from the prying eyes is critical especially for banking and financial companies that store valuable and confidential information regarding their clients finances preventing cyberattacks cyberattacks can damage data compliance by taking advantage of confidential client data they have recently been on the rise and preventing them has been a significant challenge moreover various cybercriminal activities are becoming more and more common as online banking services evolve financial service companies have to incorporate high quality systems to detect any suspicious activity and protect customer data at all costs to prevent cyberattacks from happening therefore companies must always be one step ahead if they want to keep cybercriminals at bay and protect their customers by keeping their data secure evolving organizations and customer needs in today s fast paced world customer needs develop and evolve rapidly organizations must transform to thrive and keep track of the latest developments and the latest customer requirements and requests since customer needs evolve so quickly organizations sometimes need to transform how they function quickly for instance the increase of online banking users is only one of the examples of how changing customer needs influence financial companies to enter the digital world and launch their first online banking apps and services new technologies create new liabilities we live in a tech driven world so new technologies pop up daily although tech developments primarily serve to help us create more efficient and streamlined operations reaching that point isn t so simple implementing tech driven changes and upgrading the existing systems are demanding processes that require plenty of time skills and resources therefore it s not uncommon for new technologies to create new problems for companies moreover introducing new technologies usually comes with accepting new liabilities as well that is a big responsibility and companies are encouraged to carefully think about their duties once they implement a new piece of technology as part of their system teaching employees proper data management the struggles don t stop once the implementation of new technologies is complete the most significant challenges begin since all employees need to learn how to navigate and use the newly implemented systems teaching employees proper data management is a detailed and time consuming process if you want to do it right data management practices associated with new technologies can go into great detail when using these technologies properly and utilizing all of their features it s vital to ensure every employee receives an in depth guide on using the newly acquired tools to prevent mishaps technology changes how companies operate because financial service companies are so reliant on technology specific tools and systems can often dictate how these companies and organizations operate daily also the impact of new technologies on operations is quite significant since they can affect data for instance the rising popularity of cloud data security influences many financial service companies worldwide to introduce these innovative solutions into their organizations while cloud based computing equips employees with more flexibility and freedom transferring all client data from one place to another is a challenging process for experts creating a safe environment for data is a long process data safety means protecting all digital information from cyberattacks including unauthorized access data breach corruption and theft data safety has three goals confidentiality integrity and availability that means the ultimate purpose of it is to protect valuable digital information and data with each technological change companies need to adjust their goals of maintaining a safe environment for online data with that said that isn t a one time job it is a long and ongoing process companies always need to come back to revise and upgrade cybersecurity threats a cyberattack is an umbrella term for any digital attempt to steal data disable computers use a system to launch further attacks or cause harm to internet users in a different way cybercriminals use various methods to launch a cybercriminal attack financial service companies have been the main target for a while now namely cybercriminals attack these institutions to drain bank accounts or transfer funds illegally the most common methods cybercriminals use are spoofing data manipulation third party services malware and data without encryption spoofing spoofing is a cybercriminal method where a person or a program falsifies data and identifies as someone else essentially it is impersonation spoofers do it to trick other people into giving them their confidential data which provides them with an illegitimate advantage to use the received information and gain some benefit as for the financial service industry spoofers typically call clients and introduce themselves as bank representatives they do it to get the credit card and account info from bank clients after which they can use the obtained data to access the funds data manipulation data manipulation refers to adding removing or modifying data in a database as a cybercriminal activity data manipulation explains the process of launching an attack to access networks systems documents files and even confidential data once the access has been granted cybercriminals make small unnoticeable changes to gain an advantage but still keep users in the dark when it comes to banking and financial accounts data manipulation refers to cybercriminals manipulating data by changing account owners and payment recipients or altering payment amounts and destinations third party services just because your company systems and networks have premium security features doesn t mean the data you have in your company is entirely safe it s safe to say you are working with some third party services and sharing at least a portion of your data with them if one of those third party services doesn t have robust security systems like you do they can easily get targeted by various cybersecurity attacks that can also put your data and security in danger since the cybercriminals will get access to the information you shared with the compromised third party service if you think the odds of such activity are low think again a staggering 92 of us organizations have experienced similar situations with third party services malware malware is probably the most common type of cyberattack malware is also known as a computer virus it includes installing malicious software on a system which then executes unauthorized actions such as disrupting the daily activities within a business locking important files ad spamming and redirection to malicious websites the malicious software types are numerous but worms viruses trojans ransomware spyware adware and malvertising are the most frequently used data without encryption recently everyone s been talking about the importance of data encryption however what happens if data isn t encrypted maybe you re lucky enough not to experience any consequences but no financial service company should rely purely on luck if the data isn t encrypted it s left in a readable form that means the data doesn t have any protection and anyone skilled enough to intercept the data during transmission can easily access the information therefore working with unprotected data puts you at a significant security risk since basically anyone can obtain your and your client s data third party vendors a third party vendor can be a person or company that offers specific services to other companies or customers since the financial sector is a highly interconnected sector due to the nature of its business high interconnectivity with numerous third party vendors is almost an obligatory feature of every company in this industry financial companies can receive all kinds of benefits when working with third party vendors whether they partner up with customer service agencies insurance brokers or other banks the possibilities are endless through these partnerships financial companies can offer better deals to their clients and allow them to solve all banking and insurance tasks in one place however working with third party vendors comes with a unique set of risks and challenges vendors can have security leaks choosing reliable and secure third party vendors is essential to keep your data protected however you can never be sure if vendor is doing everything to maintain the highest level of privacy and security so third party vendors act as a liability to their partners the reality is that vendors often have security leaks however because financial companies share and exchange their data with these vendors their security leaks easily translate as financial company leaks that s the primary reason banks and other financial institutions continually look for quality third party vendors who put data privacy and security first a potential security leak would break their trust with consumers who would redirect their loyalty to their competitors it s crucial to align your practices partnering up and working together with someone isn t as easy as it sounds it s a complex process that requires plenty of mutual understanding effort and communication the same goes for financial companies working with third party vendors working together on all aspects is crucial for ensuring data safety not only for professional reasons but also for clients we can t stress the importance of aligning working practices enough when businesses don t align their practices it s easy to make errors that can cost both companies a lot financial companies and their third party vendors will benefit from open communication and streamlined business processes including dividing the work to setting future goals reporting and monitoring practices are essential as you already know communication and the alignment of practices are essential to make a partnership between financial companies and third party vendors work reporting and monitoring are two crucial practices of this process with reporting and monitoring practices financial service companies can build a stronger partnership with their third party vendors which will allow them to streamline their processes they ll get an insight into valuable information that will enable them to make more informed decisions for the future nevertheless reporting and monitoring come with some obstacles too namely as partners financial companies can t get full access to the data available from third party vendors that means they can receive only a portion of data significantly limiting their possibilities companies work with many vendors financial and banking companies partner up with numerous vendors of course the exact number will vary from company to company but generally speaking many third party vendors are connected to a financial service company at all times when a company works with so many different vendors it s challenging to manage data properly and ensure the highest levels of safety keeping track of data available on so many different locations and platforms can quickly become overwhelming leading to errors in data security reducing the number of third party partners could be one solution but ensuring everyone implements robust security systems can be an excellent alternative data management data management is the fifth and final challenge of data security in the financial service industry like data compliance data management can significantly affect the level of security for that reason it s crucial to manage data properly and avoid data management mishaps at all costs what is data management data management is the process of collecting storing and utilizing data however the most critical feature of quality data management is doing it efficiently securely and cost effectively good data management should help companies organizations and individuals locate valuable data utilize it and keep it safe once that s done companies can optimize the use of the gathered data and make actionable decisions by analyzing the information they receive with more and more online threats popping up behind every corner securing robust data management strategies is essential for protecting the business and its clients increased volume of data companies worldwide have turned to digital management and the amount of data available online has constantly been on the rise for years now the volume of data usage keeps breaking previously set records and it doesn t show any signs of slowing down as a result companies must analyze and manage increased volumes of data which makes the whole process more complex and expensive data complexity is increasing technology keeps getting better and tech tools are becoming more advanced the tech advancement is breaking all expectations but that also means the data used during these processes is becoming more complex and extensive while you can expect that when dealing with demanding tasks and activities even the most sensitive data is becoming complex today so financial service companies should dedicate more time to data collection and analysis if they wish to gather accurate and informative results adopting new technologies ai artificial intelligence ml machine learning robotics cloud computing and numerous other innovative technologies are available to financial companies and clients each of these technologies influences how financial companies operate and their data management requirements since some of these technologies have only recently become available to the broader public companies are still trying to figure out ways to adopt these technologies into their existing systems most of them are demanding and difficult to master which creates an additional challenge for all financial service companies trying to keep up with the latest tech advancements nevertheless embracing this tech is vital to stay ahead of the competition meet consumer demands and safeguard business and customer data increased pressure on companies finally financial service companies belong to one of the most competitive industries with that said companies experience increased pressure to get as much available data as possible and do everything to analyze the gathered data effectively due to this industry s highly competitive environment companies are constantly under pressure to upgrade their technologies and introduce new elements that set them apart from the crowd failing to implement the latest tech could put them at risk of cyberattacks and other security threats that could harm their organization and customers conclusion to sum everything up companies working in the financial service industry are experiencing numerous challenges regarding data security from newly published data compliance laws to the increased cybercriminal activity it seems like an impossible task to keep track of everything going around and protect their business however addressing those challenges is paramount no matter how complicated it seems by singling out the five most significant challenges in data security we hope to give you a sense of clarity and help you detect your weakest points once you re aware of the challenges your company is struggling with it will be much easier to develop an effective and clever solution article by ben herzberg due about the author ben is an experienced tech leader and book

a sub adult female white shark named crystal last located in the gulf of maine near grand manan at the end of june has been tracked by researchers to a location near saint john on monday founder and expedition leader at ocearch chris fischer said when they first tagged crystal in north carolina they didn t know if she was a canadian shark or a new england shark the biggest thing we ve learned about her recently is that she is an atlantic canada shark said fischer we didn t know that until she made her move north when things started to get too hot down south and it was time to come up and start putting some pressure on those seals to make sure they don t wipe out our fish stocks he said crystal milled around a bit in nova scotia before heading to the bay of fundy the bay of fundy has big currents and lots of marine life according to fischer which is attractive to a number of sharks many other white sharks are showing up on satellite data off the coast of nova scotia and newfoundland and labrador which is where ocearch is heading for their next expedition in a week beginning in cape breton fischer s team would love to head to the bay of fundy but the current and tides make it too difficult to work there the bay of fundy has big currents and lots of marine life which is attractive to sharks according to ocearch founder chris fischer ocearch where will crystal go next fischer said it s impossible to tell where crystal will head next but he said white sharks repeat their migratory paths meaning crystal will be back year after year crystal is a sub adult meaning she s on the cusp of sexual maturity once that happens she ll only repeat her migratory path every two years instead of yearly he said crystal has a lot to reveal fischer said we could watch her transition from a sub adult to a full sexually mature adult in the coming years and then the big question will be if she does that is where is this atlantic canada shark giving birth he said where she gives birth will be fundamentally important so the area can be managed the only home for baby white sharks that fischer is aware of is in the new york and new jersey area just south of long island population growth fred whoriskey executive director of the ocean tracking network at dalhousie university said there is a lot of debate about whether the white shark population is growing or if people are just looking harder he said since a lot of the sharks popping up in canadian waters are juveniles this suggests dispersal if it is the case that more juveniles are dispersing from southern areas whoriskey believes this may be due to population growth canada is a spot that the sharks will come to in the spring to the autumn because we are a great producer of food at a time when our waters are warming up he said staying safe whoriskey said it s always important to be a little careful when swimming because the ocean is like the wild west there are precautions to take said whoriskey like not swimming alone and at night sharks hunt after dark he said and they have poor vision fischer said over half a dozen white sharks are pinging on ocearch s tracker in atlantic canadian waters but this only accounts for a small part of the white shark population he said people should remember that white sharks focus their attention on seals so if you see birds diving into the water they re after fish which means seals are probably also going after that bait increasing the chances for white sharks that s not a spot where you want to go swimming out into the middle of the food chain you want to find a nice quiet spot on the beach and leverage the ocean in those places he said when you see the food chain going off i recommend sitting down in a chair and watching because it s like being on a canadian safari
inflation jumped again in june on a persistent climb in gas food and rent costs notching another 40 year high and likely solidifying the federal reserve s plans for another big rate hike this month prices increased 9 1 from a year earlier up from an annual rate of 8 6 the prior month and the largest gain since november 1981 the labor department s consumer price index showed wednesday economists surveyed by bloomberg had estimated inflation would rise to 8 8 on a monthly basis consumer prices increased 1 3 the largest such leap since 2005 compared with a 1 rise in may ouch ian shepherdson chief economist of pantheon macroeconomics wrote in a research note of the latest surge in prices but this will be the last big increase amid signs that inflation is poised to gradually ease he along with other economists noted june likely marked its peak though a similar pronouncement in the spring proved premature stock market reaction the report bolsters the federal reserve s plans in two weeks to raise its key interest rate by a hefty three quarters of a percentage point for a second straight month as part of an aggressive campaign to curtail inflation the inflation figure and likelihood of a substantial rate hike disappointed already dour investors stocks ended the day lower with the broad s p 500 stock index down around 17 points or 0 50 while the dow jones industrial average fell more than 200 points or 0 70 what is causing inflation june s surge again was led by gasoline prices which increased 11 2 from the prior month and 59 9 annually the good news is unleaded regular averaged 4 65 tuesday down from 5 a month ago grocery prices rose by 1 from may and 12 2 over the past 12 months both gas and food costs have been elevated largely because russia s war in ukraine has disrupted global supplies of oil wheat corn and other commodities in june cereal prices rose 2 5 from the prior month and 14 2 from a year ago bread was up 1 6 monthly and 10 8 annually chicken costs increased by 1 5 from may and 17 3 yearly there were some encouraging signs bacon prices fell 1 9 its second straight large monthly decline and beef and veal prices decreased by 2 3 will food prices go down commodity prices have tumbled recently amid recession fears and ebbing consumer demand that already has pushed down gas prices and set the stage for more moderate food price increases within months says wells fargo economist sam bullard barclays economist pooja sriram however believes higher fertilizer costs for farmers could keep grocery prices fairly high throughout the year russia is the leading exporter of fertilizer and the ukraine war has driven up the cost of that commodity as well as its chief ingredient natural gas core prices which exclude volatile food and energy items increased 0 7 in june following a 0 6 rise the prior month that nudged down the annual rise to 5 9 from 6 in may the third straight monthly decline what is rent inflation rent climbed 0 8 monthly and 5 8 over the past year as people who hunkered down with family members during the pandemic moved into their own apartments there were some positive developments for summer travelers despite surging demand airline fares fell 1 8 while hotel rates declined 2 8 but they re still up 34 1 and 10 from a year earlier respectively there are hints that inflation will likely soften in the months ahead besides falling commodity prices pandemic induced supply chain troubles are abating wage increases may be moderating and retailers bloated inventories are triggering big discounts for shoppers also consumer purchases have started shifting from goods to services such as dining out and traveling now that the pandemic is broadly easing does the report raise recession risks the inflation figure does raise the risk of recession to some extent higher inflation leads consumers to rein in spending which makes up about 70 of economic activity and could mean bigger fed rate hikes which would hurt borrowing bank of america says the report is consistent with its call for a recession in the second half of the year is this close to the worst inflation since world war ii while inflation has hit a new four decade high and is painful for millions of americans it s hardly the worst in recent history in march 1947 u s inflation hit a dizzying 19 7 the spike was rooted in effects from the end of the war the elimination of price controls supply shortages and pent up demand according to a white house blog in a statement president joe biden called inflation unacceptably high but he added it is hitting almost every country in the world it is little comfort to americans to know that inflation is also high in europe and higher in many countries than in america but it is a reminder that all major economies are battling this covid related challenge made worse by putin s unconscionable aggression in turkey for example inflation reached an annual rate of nearly 80 in june and in the

the consumer price index rose more in june than economists had expected the dow jones industrial average gave up roughly 208 points today after the latest reading of the consumer price index cpi came in hotter than expected the cpi tracks the prices of a basket of daily consumer goods and services and is one way investors track inflation the cpi rose 9 1 on a year over year basis in june more than the 8 8 economists had been projecting the one sliver of hope of inflation potentially peaking in the report is that the cpi was driven by an 11 2 year over year increase in gasoline gas prices have started to come down in recent weeks the white house said this morning that they believe the report is out of date and does not reflect the full impact of nearly 30 days of decreases in gas prices that have reduced the price at the pump by about 40 cents since mid june still the report makes it likely that the fed will follow through with a three quarter percentage point increase to its benchmark overnight lending rate later on this month the more aggressive the fed continues to be with rate hikes the greater the likelihood of a recession the yield on the two year u s treasury bill has now surpassed the yield on the 10 year u s treasury bill which some see as a sign of an imminent recession the inversion today reached its widest level since 2000 as a result investors poured into recession proof stocks today these are the three dow stocks they bought the most gearing up for a recession nike nke 1 20 was the top finisher in the dow today with shares gaining 1 3 analysts have been quite bullish on nike assigning the athletic apparel brand which currently trades at around 105 per share a median price target of 130 per share with an incredibly strong brand nike has the ability to pass on higher costs brought about by inflation to its customers without alienating too many of them comfortable fitness clothes have also become more popular after many people gained weight during the pandemic and as the workplace becomes more casual according to analysts at the investment bank jefferies financial group the second best finisher in the dow was home depot hd 1 44 which finished the day up 0 72 home depot has thus far worked its way through inflation extraordinarily well in the first quarter of the year the retailer grew sales by close to 4 year over year as the company succeeded in passing on higher costs to its customers one potential explanation is that most people are spending more time in their homes which makes home repairs and fixing things more important than it used to be finally the consumer goods powerhouse procter gamble pg 0 08 finished the day 0 66 higher procter gamble is the parent company of brands like pampers diapers tide laundry detergent and bounty paper towels all things that consumers should keep buying even if their finances start to tighten up is a recession coming and should you prepare i think there is a pretty good chance the u s economy will experience some kind of recession in the near future but it may only be modest and it may actually help some of the issues plaguing the stock market and economy right now with gasoline and rent prices so high a modest recession could help get those back in line and make them more attainable for everyday consumers the key will be to look at how the labor market holds up but i don t think it s a bad idea to buy some more recession proof stocks my favorite of these three is procter gamble because their products are more of a necessity than nike s or home depot s p g has also paid a dividend for 132 straight years
the biden administration is warning pharmacies not to discriminate against women who may seek reproductive health prescriptions including some that might be involved in ending a pregnancy the department of health and human services said wednesday that pharmacies receiving federal money from programs such as medicare and medicaid cannot discriminate in how they supply medications or advise patients on prescriptions the agency noted that discrimination against people based on their pregnancy or related conditions would be a form of sex discrimination the announcement comes as the administration seeks to ensure reproductive health services for women following last month s supreme court decision that ended a constitutional right to abortion on monday the administration told hospitals that they must provide abortion services if the life of the mother is at risk the government said federal law on emergency treatment guidelines preempts state laws in jurisdictions that now ban the procedure without any exceptions now all states provide an exception for the life of the mother president biden also has signed an executive order to try to protect some access to the procedure but he also has acknowledged that his administration is limited in what it can do he noted earlier this month that an act of congress would be required to restore nationwide access to abortion services and he has urged americans angered by the supreme court s ruling to vote in november advertisement wednesday s actions like those outlined monday do not reflect the new policy they aim to remind care providers of their existing obligations under federal law we are committed to ensuring that everyone can access health care free of discrimination health and human services secretary xavier becerra said in a statement this includes access to prescription medications for reproductive health and other types of care the department s guidance to pharmacies outlined several hypothetical examples of potential discrimination they include a pharmacy that refuses to fill a prescription of mifepristone followed by misoprostol to help manage complications from a miscarriage after a pregnancy loss that combination of drugs also is commonly used in medication abortions a pharmacy that refuses to fill a prescription of misoprostol prescribed to help deal with severe stomach ulcer complications may be discriminating based on disability hhs said the agency noted that the pharmacy also may be discriminating if it refuses to stock the drug based on its alternate use hhs also cited as another example of potential discrimination a pharmacy that refuses to fill a prescription for methotrexate to halt an ectopic pregnancy which grows outside the womb and is not viable the federal agency said people who believe their rights have been violated should visit an online portal for the office for civil rights to file a complaint send questions comments to the editors
twitter is telling its employees that it s not planning any companywide layoffs but there could be some restructuring and organization changes as it heads into a legal battle over the potential sale to elon musk the san francisco company included the communication in a filing wednesday with the securities and exchange commission it also says twitter is losing workers at a slightly higher rate than in normal economic times but attrition is in line with current tech industry trends the company says it will monitor turnover to ensure that we can quickly identify any areas of concern and help mitigate where possible twitter said it had planned to offer packages to retain employees and on june 20 it had asked musk to agree to programs that had been approved by the board and its compensation committee the filing said that musk has not provided his consent to implement these programs the employee question and answer document attached to the filing says that teams across the company are making changes so it operates responsibly and efficiently in the current environment that means restructuring and organizational changes are possible as we continue to align with our revised business needs twitter sued tesla ceo elon musk on tuesday trying to force him to complete his 44 billion takeover of the social media company by accusing him of outlandish and bad faith actions that have caused the platform irreparable harm and wreaked havoc on its stock price back in april musk pledged to pay 54 20 a share for twitter inc which agreed to those terms after reversing its initial opposition to the deal but the two sides have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday that he was backing away from his agreement to buy the company twitter s lawsuit in delaware chancery court asserts that musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests part of musk s argument for terminating the deal is his allegation that twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team but in its lawsuit twitter reveals communications from musk starting shortly after the deal was signed showing his concerns about headcount and expense growth and his desire for more aggressive cost cutting twitter said musk refused to approve or even discuss twitter s proposed retention programs for key employees musk had notice back in early may of many of the actions about which he now complains for the first time the lawsuit says

nasa s first fully focused images from the james webb space telescope gaze into the origins of the universe and examine exoplanets that could harbor alien life the 10 billion telescope s sensors scrutinize targets near and far from a galactic arm of our own milky way to never before seen galaxies being born in the deepest reaches of space its spectrograph has also divined the chemistry of another planet s atmosphere from more than 1 000 light years away finding a gas giant called wasp 96b hazed with clouds of gaseous water the resulting images and data showcase the telescope s unparalleled versatility it s a moment of triumph for scientists around the world who now have a groundbreaking tool to aim at humanity s most existential mysteries but it s also a victory for the flight operations teams who shepherded the telescope through the first critical weeks of its mission this is their story launch 3 days in the black silence of space a drive motor on the james webb space telescope comes to life in a series of coordinated spasms the motor s subtle motions are unnoticeable on the spacecraft a foil encased rectangle slightly larger than a pickup truck but a major transformation is beginning it s december 28 2021 three days after launch and the james webb space telescope is now 350 000 miles from earth more than a hundred thousand miles farther than the average distance to the moon even at a cruising speed of 2 000 miles per hour it has a long way to go before it reaches its home an orbit around the sun called l2 these solar system sweet spots exist where the gravitational pull of earth and sun counter each other s influence making them efficient parking positions for long duration spacecraft l2 is especially suited for astronomy because it has a good line of sight to the sun for power and it s close enough to earth for reliable communications while also being able to peer in the other dark direction into the depths of space and time jwst won t be the same when it gets there the telescope packaged to fit inside a rocket fairing just 17 feet wide is carefully folded into a rectangular shape with only a solar array extended to form an l soon it will transform into a 69 5 by 46 5 foot engineering marvel built to look into the distant past of the universe this metamorphosis begins with a humble series of operating tests of a single motor a process that space engineers at nasa sometimes call flinching the motor provides the muscle to deploy the front sunshield pallet one of two masts that hold furled material that will one day open to protect the spacecraft s instruments from the heat from the sun but before the motor performs its vital duty it must prove out in a series of operating tests deliberate tentative moves that recall a butterfly trying out its limbs inside a chrysalis courtesy nasa in october 2019 technicians successfully performed a critical test on webb s five layer sunshield by fully deploying each of its uniquely sized layers to the same position that they will have while orbiting the sun a million miles from earth it will take the next two weeks for engineers to deploy every folded collapsed and compressed component of the telescope the tennis court size sunshield will unfurl from a pair of pallets the main mirror will unfold its hexagonal panels like the eaves of a dining room table the secondary mirror will extend almost 25 feet from the telescope s body aboard a lengthening tripod adding to the challenge is the lack of cameras onboard aimed at the telescope leaving engineers on the ground to monitor its progress using data alone executed continuously these deployments could take as little as five days but the engineers prolong the process on purpose of all the thousands of mechanical steps between launch and operation 344 are single points of failure spofs these steps if not executed properly would render the entire 10 billion telescope useless this space telescope is built to answer some of the most fundamental questions about our existence if it works as planned its suite of infrared cameras will capture things formed in the afterglow of the big bang the formation of far flung galaxies and the chemical signatures of alien planets by any standard it s the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built it s also the most expensive initial cost estimates set the jwst s price at 1 billion to 3 billion but between 2003 and 2021 nasa alone spent 8 8 billion on its development the european space agency which provided the ariane 5 rocket that lifted the jwst to space as well as two of its four science instruments paid around 700 million the canadian space agency paid more than 150 million for sensors and instruments the diplomatic cooperation was critical to the jwst s completion but under these circumstances a technical malfunction could mean diplomatic backlash too the telescope could potentially become the new global symbol for overpriced and underwhelming science projects courtesy nasa humanity s final look at the james webb space telescope as it heads into space in december 2021 putting the two sunshield pallets in place one at a time is this day s only ambition webb s 0 2 m medium gain antenna sends the motor telemetry to nasa run antenna arrays in australia which relay the data to the telescope s mission operations center moc at johns hopkins university in baltimore the moc or the mock consists of two central rooms where jwst operators from nasa and the telescope s manufacturer northrop grumman scrutinize banks of monitors sometimes four at a time the flight control room is earth s only direct point of contact with the spacecraft it s the exclusive domain of mission ops manager carl starr mom to the engineers and his command controllers these engineers send directions to the jwst cutting and pasting prewritten software instructions for the spacecraft and typing in any empty variables the adjacent engineering support room is the catch all place for subsystems engineers and the temporary home of the deployment team for the first two weeks after launch the team s two dozen deployment specialists are responsible for every step of webb s physical transformation into a telescope this requires obsessive attention to detail and an ability to suss real world problems from abstract sheets of figures we never move on to the next step until we absolutely get confirmation from our deployment team that everything is responding in a way that matches what we thought would happen says jwst observatory manager keith parrish did switches report their change of status did gear and ball bearing counters register the correct number of turns what are the temperatures and power consumption of each part courtesy nasa engineering teams at nasa s james webb space telescope mission operations center at the space telescope science institute in baltimore monitor progress as the observatory s second primary mirror wing rotates into position january 8 2022 after confirming that the pallet motor is healthy the onboard data proves to be consistent with expected readings engineers move on to the next step they flinch the motor via electronic signals sent to the metal windings around the brushless dc magnet more data affirmation enables the deployment team to clear the flight controllers to unlock the latches holding the sunshield s forward pallet in place the major action is set to begin the motor rotates its forward pallet into position toward the fore of the spacecraft a waking bird stretching one wing motor status is moving intones grumman engineer nanci shawger the day s deployment lead to the flight operations room engineers in the moc have access to a real time 3d simulation of the telescope showing its configuration based on incoming data but no actual eye on the telescope the forward pallet takes 20 minutes to unfold the engineers in baltimore confirm success at 1 21 p m concluding a four hour process from prep to deployment then they repeat the entire procedure for the aft sunshield pallet they begin flinching its motor and by 7 38 p m it s also in place so far so good courtesy nasa one of first images released from webb of stephan s quintet we see five galaxies four of which interact the left galaxy is much closer to us than the rest of the group these colliding galaxies are pulling and stretching each other in a gravitational dance building an emergency toolkit l 4 days on december 29 the flight controllers order the extension of the deployable tower assembly dta a two piece telescoping boom its design is reminiscent of a microphone stand but one made of an advanced graphite epoxy composite that keeps its shape and strength despite extreme temperature changes when fully deployed the dta will push the telescope s body four feet away from the spacecraft giving the jwst s mirrors and instruments enough elbow room to operate at a safe distance from vibrations and heat sources on the main body of the spacecraft any sensor reading from the jwst that s outside expectations such as an anomalous temperature reading or voltage draw triggers an informative alarm most of these are expected and discarded but during a true emergency a response team forms from experts in every onboard subsystem drawn from the deployment team this response team comes equipped with a slate of emergency software commands all tested ahead of time part of my job for a couple of years now has been to come to work every day and just try to figure out what could go wrong parrish says and then make sure to see if we have something in the toolbox that can fix it courtesy nasa the james webb space telescope fully assembled for the first time at northrop grumman s facility in redondo beach california august 25 2019 some solutions are simple like commanding a sticky mechanism to slide back and forth to clear a jam or adjusting the torque of a motor to lessen its force and prevent overheating other solutions are more complicated let s say a hinge jams one series of emergency commands tells the spacecraft to spin in and out of the sunlight in the hope that the rapid heating and cooling will expand and contract the metal and unjam the hinge that sequence is called twirl in another nightmare scenario a latch isn t unhooking from its assembly the reaction wheels can be flipped on and off in a jarring sequence that vibrates the telescope and shakes the hook loose that s a shimmy if we re doing those things we re not having a very good day parrish says to prepare for the dta s motor activation the moc engineers in baltimore activate release devices and configure heaters software and electronics the motor is made for deep space machined from high grade stainless steel and insulated with polymers it s difficult for heat to dissipate in a vacuum when activated it turns counterclockwise moving the ball screw and propelling the dta s pieces along the rollers with breaks for verification the 48 inch slide takes more than six and a half hours before completion a new issue emerges l 5 days on december 30 attention turns to the most risky part of this spacecraft deployment the sunshield by the afternoon the team hopes to release and roll the covers that protected webb s sunshield during launch the sunshield is made of wafer thin sheets of kapton a material invented in the late 1960s for use as insulation in a bunch of terrestrial electronics and coated with aluminum that gives it a silvery sci fi look kapton s main attribute is that it doesn t easily deform in extreme temperatures remaining stable from minus 452 f to a searing 752 f the moc staff releases the devices folding the cover and orders the motors to pull into a tight roll exposing the sunshield to space this takes about an hour concluding just after noon the team then takes the rest of the afternoon to prepare for the next day s critical step unfurling the sunshield itself the telescope s deployments so far have been similar to steps from previous missions with hardware used on mars landings and the hubble space telescope but unfurling this telescope s sunshield will be novel and risky nothing so large supple and flowing has ever been opened in space the sunshield material is tough but its deployment is worrisome to mission managers we re deploying a lot of floppy structure not like the deterministic rigid structures that we re all used to says mike menzel jwst s lead mission systems engineer so there are a lot of features in place to make sure the sunshield never drifts off and gets a mind of its own courtesy nasa engineers and technicians at northrop grumman inspect the sunshield before folding and packing it for launch february 1 2021 the numbers expose his understatement the sunshield deployment hardware includes about 140 release actuators along with some 70 hinge assemblies eight motors 400 pulleys 90 cables and scores of bearings springs gears and magnets more than 7 000 parts are involved with pulling the entire structure into place none more important than the 107 pins that have been holding the sunshield s cover in place since launch the pins are simple each one is wrapped in a fuse wire that when fired with a jolt of electric heat frees the pin to move and snap its corresponding wire but each is an spof if one pin doesn t release the entire sunshield will stay in place the only hedge against spofs is redundancy so the pins have cross fed electric triggers still there s just one chance for this to work to limit power drain the engineers release the pins in groups of five or fewer in columns running from the center of the shield to its edge a column of pins running down the middle of the shield fires first moving the cover a fraction of the way we did the next row and that part of the cover would unroll and the next row and this cover would unroll says james cooper sunshield manager for nasa goddard and a deployment team leader in the moc eventually the last group was a column down the edge to allow the cover to roll around out of the way it takes about an hour to deploy all 107 pins it s a seeming success but engineers at the moc see a potential problem in the power system each solar array on the jwst has five panels each with an operating time limited by its temperature a warmer panel is less efficient the panels are meant to produce power above 65 volts for the webb to operate at an optimal level but because of the time limits they re only producing power peaks of 58 6 volts it s enough to run the spacecraft but it requires the webb to nip from its rechargeable battery and though power supply wasn t an issue in firing the pins later operations demand more electrical juice than the array is producing it s a problem the engineers know will need to be fixed courtesy nasa webb s solar array undergoes testing in may 2020 the onboard anomaly l 6 days on december 31 the mid boom will drag half of the sunshield out of its pallet and form half of its distinctive kite shape the final preparatory step is to check whether the sunshield cover is rolled tightly on the far side of the pallet s edge out of the boom s way four switches along the cover s edge are meant to signal that the cover is clear these are simple just pairs of magnets that separate when the cover moves the deployment team analyzes the data on these switches but something is wrong two sets of em triggered says cooper and the other two didn t this is no expected alarm if the cover isn t clear of the sunshield the shield itself might not deploy correctly and it could ruin the mission all checklists screech to a halt i would say probably 50 people noticed it all the same time because we re all watching the same telemetry page says cooper it starts with everybody spinning around in their chairs then it s okay what s next there s always one person in the moc designated the anomaly coordinator or anco this fateful day the privilege belongs to nasa flight controller greg anderson it s his job to coordinate a troubleshooting brainstorm with a response team and present the fixes to senior mission management the response team examines a 3d digital model of the jwst the one derived from their incoming data it s the closest thing they have to a live look at the spacecraft in the meeting they re detectives as well as engineers looking for evidence that points to exactly where the sunshield cover is resting on an adjacent whiteboard anderson scribbles while everybody spews out their ideas according to cooper the gyroscopes and accelerometers of webb s inertial reference system are sensitive enough to detect any mechanical movement on board using those instruments the flight operators can confirm that some amount of mass moved on the spacecraft consistent with the cover release devices opening good news but not a definitive answer a fresh look at the digital model reveals that the cover if rolled properly would shade a few of the jwst s onboard thermometers lowering their temperature readings the detectives consult the thermal team engineers who have already noted a drop in temperature and learn that the readings are still trending down the only way that could have happened is if the cover was hanging off the edge of the structure making it cast a bigger shadow cooper says at his presentation to starr and other program management team members anderson reveals the final verdict the cover didn t roll quite far enough to trigger the sensors but the temperature data showed that it was out of the way he recommends that they continue operations and deploy the mid boom courtesy nasa the structure of the webb before the mirrors were mounted in 2015 the stowed deployable tower assembly dta is the black cylinder at the base of the structure at 1 30 p m the flight controllers order the telescoping boom to extend and four seconds later the first of five segments slides out this is the moment of truth for the sunshield cover response team if they re wrong they ll soon know for as long as 10 glacially slow minutes at a time the mid boom motors drag the silvery sunshield membrane out of the pallet the increments are planned we only move it so far a commanded range of motion explains parrish then the motor stops and says hey i just did this what do you want me to do next you want me to keep going and after three hours the boom completes its journey the response team sighs with relief as other motors heave at the cables attached to the boom s tip and the sunshield canvas unfurls much like a sail for the modern space age the mystery of what happened to the cover might never be solved we think that it just didn t roll up quite as tightly in zero gravity as it did in our ground tests cooper says there is another panel there that it could be resting on that could have prevented it from rolling all the way around to the backside so that s our best theory courtesy nasa if you held a grain of sand up to the sky at arm s length that tiny speck is the size of webb s view in this image the first photo released from the telescope it s the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the early universe ever taken making mom proud l 8 days after the moc takes a break on new year s day the mission managers use january 2 to troubleshoot the power system the original duty cycle for the five solar panels isn t delivering enough power to the jwst a team of northrop grumman engineers in california run the new numbers on ground test equipment before feeding the data back to the moc and by the end of the afternoon the commands have been sent to the telescope the new plan produces a power range of 65 volts to 69 volts plenty of margin for deployments and operation grumman s amy lo describes the results to reporters during a call the next day as hunky dory menzel is careful while speaking to the media even if he s delivering positive news it s not uncommon to learn certain characteristics of your spacecraft once you re in flight that s what we re doing right now menzel says during the l 9 press conference so far the major deployments we ve executed have gone about as smoothly as we could have hoped for as he s speaking the team is analyzing the first movements of the separation and tightening of the sunshield s layers because one thick awning would conduct too much heat the sunshield consists of five layers of metal fabric each thin sheet designed to a specific thickness and size the outermost layer facing the sun is coated with silicon to reflect as much heat back into space as possible when spread the sun facing side of the shield will register 185 f while the cold side will measure minus 387 4 f the telescope s detectors need to be kept this cold so that their own infrared signatures don t interfere with those of the faint incoming light they re receiving it s inevitable that a space pebble will puncture the sunshield but the real risk is if that hole spreads to prevent a tear spreading like a rip in the knee of an old pair of jeans engineers reinforced the layers of kapton every six feet with thermal spot bonding melting the material into a ripstop grid that prevents tears from growing much like the inseam stitches on those jeans tensioning that could take as long as four days the plan includes time for troubleshooting pauses that are not needed the flight controllers knock out all five layers in just 26 hours by the end six feet separate the outermost and innermost layers of the shield but the outermost layer is more than 500 degrees hotter in the moc the relief and joy are palpable in just under two weeks the team has accomplished three quarters of those 344 single point failures even better one of the hardest mechanical feats has been accomplished major milestone achieved starr declares over the radio when the tensioning is complete job well done sunshield team thanks mom says hillary stock grumman s sunshield deployment specialist who s at the top of the moc comms chain courtesy nasa this animation shows the process of deploying the webb s sunshield the future of seeing the past l 14 days the centerpiece of the jwst are its beryllium mirrors both given a lustrous sheen courtesy of a 0 12 ounce coating of gold dust this is not aesthetics at work but engineering gold more efficiently reflects infrared light at wavelengths ideal for spotting distant stars and peering into the churning clouds of radiation where they form all optical telescopes in history have used mirrors to gather light and the jwst is no exception there are two mirrors on board a primary to collect the light and a smaller secondary mirror the diameter of webb s primary mirror is 21 feet almost triple that of the hubble space telescope s primary mirror this larger size grants the jwst greater sensitivity wide mirrors can distinguish distant objects that appear close together what s known in the optics world as a fine angular resolution courtesy nasa six of the 18 beryllium mirror segments completed a series of cryogenic tests at nasa s x ray cryogenic facility at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama the secondary mirror is about seven feet across its convex shape gazing inward to collect the starlight from the main dish and redirect it to the telescope s instruments jwst s workhorse near infrared camera will reveal previously unseen planets stars nebulae and galaxies a mid infrared camera called miri will produce astrophotography akin to what made the hubble famous thirteen days after launch on january 7 the first of two folded wings of the main mirror will swing into position to move it flight controllers fire a pair of pins holding the port side wing in place and another two securing the hinge and then command the panels to rotate into position that takes five minutes but securing the piece with space rated hook latches takes hours the next day at 10 28 a m the last three hexagons are set into place then it s back to the hours of motor checks and long distance commands to secure it the capstone movement finishes at 1 18 p m and the moc erupts in a cheering standing ovation many of the engineers stay on their feet milling around excitedly liberated from their checklists the technical achievement is quantifiable of the 344 single points of failure operations only 49 are left most of these are related to focusing the mirrors or the scientific instruments courtesy nasa this animation shows the two folded wings of the main mirror moving into place jwst project manager bill ochs gets on the radio loop voice shaking with emotion the deployment team has done a phenomenal job over the last two weeks but really over the last 20 years to get us here he says there s still a long way to go on day 14 webb is still only 75 percent of the way to l2 the light webb will be capable of harnessing from there will reveal the universe as it was 13 8 billion years ago there s a lot to be learned about how quickly things in the universe formed simply by counting the number of stars in young previously unseen galaxies but webb will also hunt for alien life the telescope s near infrared camera is equipped with coronagraphs that can blot out the light of stars to detect their unknown planets another imager takes this idea a step further an onboard near infrared spectrograph uses the dispersal of light waves to divine the chemical makeup of their alien atmospheres so webb is more than an exoplanet hunter it s a tool to find planets in other solar systems that are as habitable as earth courtesy nasa nasa s james webb space telescope mission operations team celebrates after confirming that the observatory s final primary mirror wing successfully extended and locked into place january 8 2022 at the space telescope science institute in baltimore the bulk of the deployment team now leaves the moc for good its members replaced at their consoles by new teams with their own critical mission milestones one of the harder things about james webb is that it was so complicated and uncertain cooper says it was such a moving target that it was hard for any of us in a lead role to transition to a new job people who have been in those roles for a long time are like maybe i ll just take a month off and think but even with the success of the first two weeks the teams still within the moc are not letting their guard down now we ll start the emotional reflection after everything s deployed up until then we all just want to do what we gotta do says menzel don t congratulate us until it s all deployed courtesy nasa webb s nircam instrument captured the southern ring planetary nebula in the near infrared revealing new details about the dying star coda the end of the beginning over the next five weeks fresh teams of specialists in the moc aligned the primary mirror segments so they can work together as a single surface mirror phasing as it s known is unforgiving each mirror must be set with a precision of 1 10 000th the thickness of a human hair the motors controlling the mirror s position operate at a temperature just 40 degrees above absolute zero in february the james webb telescope reached l2 a million miles from earth the meticulous mirror phasing produced clearer and clearer results and on march 16 nasa and northrop grumman released an initial image it made famous an otherwise unremarkable star called 2mass j17554042 6551277 in the background of the glittering orange image are galaxies that have never been seen and are yet to be identified this test shot was just a warmup to the release of the first fully sharpened images in july the perils of deep space flight and the value of robust engineering became apparent on june 8 when lee feinberg webb s optical telescope element manager at goddard released a statement admitting that the mirrors had been struck by micrometeorites since launch we have had four smaller measurable micrometeoroid strikes that were consistent with expectations and this one more recently that is larger than our degradation predictions assumed he noted he added that the mirrors were working and that engineers could adjust the mirrors in case the damage interferes with imaging with the telescope still working scientists from around the world could relax rejoice and get in line nasa officials say they received more than a thousand research proposals from astronomers and have initially chosen ones looking at the first stars and galaxies to emerge in the cosmos humanity has some pretty deep questions about the universe and it s now time for the james webb space telescope to get the answers

article bill gates concerned about the significant suffering caused by global setbacks including the covid 19 pandemic announced wednesday that he will donate 20 billion to his foundation so it can increase its annual spending the donation combined with longtime board member berkshire hathaway ceo warren buffett s 3 1 billion gift last month brings the bill and melinda gates foundation s endowment to approximately 70 billion making it one of the largest if not the largest in the world depending on daily stock valuations in an essay on the foundation s website bill gates said he hopes others in positions of great wealth and privilege will step up in this moment too the gates foundation plans to raise its annual budget by 50 over pre pandemic levels to about 9 billion by 2026 the foundation hopes the increased spending will improve education reduce poverty and reinstate the global progress toward ending preventable disease and achieving gender equality that has been halted in recent years related world has 10 week supply of wheat expert tells un security council this is seismic according to the united nations development program 71 million people have been pushed into poverty since russia s invasion of ukraine in february mainly due to food and energy price surges households in the balkans the caspian sea region and sub saharan africa have been hit particularly hard the u n world food program reports that the number of acutely hungry people is now 345 million up 25 since the start of the war in ukraine despite huge global setbacks in the past few years i see incredible heroism and sacrifice all over the world and i believe progress is possible bill gates the foundation s co chair said in a statement but the great crises of our time require all of us to do more i hope by giving more we can mitigate some of the suffering people are facing right now and help fulfill the foundation s vision to give every person the chance to live a healthy and productive life co chair melinda french gates said the additional spending will help provide a more fair and inclusive recovery melinda gates arrives at elysee palace for the generation equality forum hosted by french president emmanuel macron on july 01 2021 in paris france photo by aurelien meunier getty images philanthropy has a unique role to play in helping people around the world recover from the pandemic and rebuild the underlying systems that left so many so vulnerable to begin with french gates said in a statement at the hunger pains the growing global food crisis webinar monday gates foundation ceo mark suzman said two decades of advances have been halted by the current global crises spawned by the russian invasion however the growth in agricultural productivity around the world remains mostly in place related wheat and barley shortage how russia ukraine war triggered a global food crisis we have the tools we have the science we have the knowledge suzman said what we need is the political will and the resources those resources include donations from philanthropic organizations gates foundation invests heavily in connecting agricultural advancements with the right countries offering drought resistant maize seeds or flood resistant rice to the areas that can use them most suzman said related gates foundation women s tennis partnering on health issues however philanthropy has its limitations he added suzman said the response from the world s wealthiest countries has not only fallen short of what is currently needed but it has even fallen short of what the world provided a decade ago during a similar crisis this is our most critical area of opportunity for human solidarity he said that actually has knock on effects to provide better political stability and broader economic growth which is what i think everybody wants to see in his essay bill gates wrote that polarization in the united states makes battling global crises tougher the political divide limits our political capacity for dialogue compromise and cooperation and thwarts the bold leadership required both domestically and internationally to tackle these threats he wrote polarization is forcing us to look backwards and fight again for basic human rights social justice and democratic norms related doctors must provide abortion if life of mother is at stake biden admin insists while achieving gender equality has long been one of the foundation s primary investment areas in his essay bill gates singled out the supreme court s overturning of roe v wade as a huge setback for gender equality for women s health and for overall human progress the potential for even further regression is scary he added it will put lives at risk for women people of color and anyone living on the margins
this is exhausting but i ll attempt to bring you up to speed elon musk tried to buy twitter for 44 billion twitter accepted this offer presumably because it was the best the social media company s directors thought they could do then musk changed his mind and said he was pulling out of the deal claiming that he couldn t tell how many twitter users were fake and then twitter sued musk to force him to go through with the purchase honestly in that description the dispute sounds almost normal but the musk twitter story is not normal it makes no sense at all in the most literal sense of nonsense making indeed the nonsense that it makes erodes every dimension of analysis including business strategy online celebrity contract law and internet culture if you try too hard to suss out what is happening and why you ll only fall inside a tesseract of bilge and the madness this entails from a distance though and through squinted eyes one can safely ascertain the outlines of this hyperobject of absurdity start with musk s apparent motivations he wanted to buy twitter because the company was poorly run and undervalued among his chief concerns was the quantity of spam content and fake accounts he perceived to be infecting the platform now he says the quantity of spam on the platform or his supposed inability to determine its extent is a rationale for ending the deal musk wanted to buy twitter to clean it up but he can t buy twitter because it needs to be cleaned up read elon musk baloney king and here are twitter s motivations the company asserts in a complaint filed yesterday in the delaware court of chancery that musk is a disdainful hypocrite who wants out of the deal only because the stock market tanked dragging down both twitter s value and musk s own fortune twitter is advancing this position so that a disdainful hypocrite will be forced to buy it twitter also accuses musk of causing the company to bleed talent by refusing to approve a retention plan for key personnel who want to run away because they don t want to work for musk but while the merger was in the works twitter fired its product chief and revenue product lead presumably because they had failed to help the company perform well enough to obviate the need for a sale and thus avoid the whole musk situation from the start read the elon musk placebo effect so musk is scaring off talent some of whom nobody wanted and the attrition has further damaged the company to make matters worse everyone knows that twitter has always been an absolutely garbage social platform riddled with bad actors acting badly among the worst of these is elon musk whose shitposts reach more than 100 million users and whose shitposting during the merger has materially worsened twitter s value as a company if musk does end up taking over twitter he ll surely degrade the service by promoting an anything goes free speech bedlam that allows for even more aggressive bullshit bullying and propaganda therefore he must not be allowed not to complete the purchase the very future of twitter depends on it it s like watching a pair of evil clowns debate one argues that twitter is a hell site that makes everyone s life worse and laments the damage that musk has done to it already the other holds that musk is a hell person who would destroy twitter if given the chance and laments the fact that he s trying to wriggle out of the opportunity to do so it s tricky to cut this gordian knot because elon musk is one of the few multibillionaires whose actions can t easily be mapped to rational choices his chaos instinct notwithstanding though musk is also a savvy businessman who via internet payments commercial spaceflight electric cars and other endeavors became the richest person in the world twitter would be a bargain at 44 billion if through actions noble or base its business could be transformed into something worth 10 times as much the fact that musk says he no longer wants to bother might just be his way of negotiating a lower price via legal settlement or perhaps it has no meaning whatsoever musk has already shown that he doesn t mind losing large sums of money so long as he gets to say and do the things he wants especially on twitter in that sense he s only being true to the spirit of the platform a lot of noise adding up to nothing

by michael do you remember what economic conditions were like in 2008 and 2009 well what is ahead of us is likely to be significantly worse there will be severe pain for those that get blindsided by this new crisis but those that choose to get prepared in advance will have the best chance of successfully weathering the coming storm this week we learned that the rate of inflation in the united states surged even higher last month and this is happening even though the overall economy is steadily slowing down at this point the vast majority of the population understands that economic conditions are rapidly deteriorating in fact one recent survey discovered that 70 percent of all americans now believe that an economic downturn is ahead of us most americans 70 already believe an economic downturn is on its way according to a new survey from magnifymoney the online survey was conducted between june 10 and 14 and included 2 082 respondents sadly it is likely that a recession is already here the u s economy contracted during the first quarter of 2022 and the atlanta fed s gdpnow model is currently projecting 1 2 percent growth for the second quarter two quarters of negative growth in a row would mean that we are officially in a recession at this moment but many experts are warning that much worse is ahead and we continue to get more evidence of this with each passing day for example it is being reported that the number of vehicle repossessions is exploding and many of these vehicles were just purchased during the mini boom that we witnessed in late 2020 and early 2021 lucky lopez is a car dealer who has been in the business for about 20 years in recent meetings with bankers where he bids on repossessed vehicles before they go to auction he has noticed some common characteristics of the defaulted loans most of the loans on recently repossessed cars originated during 2020 and 2021 whereas origination dates are normally scattered because people fall on hard times at different times loan to value ratios or the amount financed relative to the value of the vehicle are around 140 versus a more normal 80 and many of the loans were extended to buyers who had temporary pops in income during the pandemic those monthly incomes fell sometimes by half as pandemic stimulus programs stopped and now they look even worse on an inflation adjusted basis and as the prices of basics in particular are climbing it is very alarming to read things like that unfortunately as bad as things are already the outlook for the months ahead is even worse the following comes from zero hedge finally a chicago fed survey on the outlook for the us economy decreased to minus 60 in june the worst reading since the survey began and worse than at the depths of the covid lockdowns in 2020 so if a major economic downturn is in our future what should we be doing well the following are 5 things that you can do right now to get prepared for the severe recession that is ahead 1 make sure that you have a source of income last year if you didn t have a source of income it wasn t that big of a deal thanks to an unprecedented shortage of workers the number of job openings surged to a record high it was so easy to get a job and so if you felt like taking some time off you could always jump back into the employment pool later but now things are changing very quickly the number of job openings is plunging and layoff announcements have started to spike when the music stops playing you don t want to be one of the people without a chair so unless you have your own business i would greatly encourage you to make sure that you have secure employment while you still can if you wait it will be much more difficult to find a good job later 2 build up your emergency fund when a recession hits it is extremely important that you are able to continue to pay the bills no matter what happens when economic conditions deteriorate bad things happen some people lose their jobs and others lose their businesses if you get hit with some bad luck you don t want to be in a position where you could suddenly lose everything during 2008 and 2009 many americans lost their homes because they suddenly could no longer pay their mortgages don t let that happen to you now is the time to build up a very large emergency fund cutting your spending will help you to do that i know that it is not easy to reduce your spending but later on you will be glad that you did we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us 3 get out of debt after you have built up your emergency fund getting out of debt should be a high priority i would start with eliminating anything that has high interest rates such as credit card debt mortgages student loans and other debts that have lower interest rates should be lower on the list those that are lean and mean will have the best chance of getting through this crisis in good condition 4 stock up on essentials now prices are going to keep going higher so that means that the things that you are going to need during the months ahead will not be any cheaper than they are right now don t spend money on unnecessary items but for the essentials that you use on a regular basis it is a good idea to stock up right now while you still can 5 maintain a positive attitude this is so important have you ever known anyone that was truly successful in life that had a negative attitude about everything yes bad things are going to happen but we need to believe that we can make it through whatever challenges we are going to face being depressed and defeated because economic conditions have deteriorated will not get you anywhere but if you approach each day with a positive attitude you will give yourself the best opportunity to make it through the storm of course most americans will have an extremely difficult time staying positive as things get worse and worse already there is so much anger and frustration out there and joe biden s approval ratings just keep getting worse and worse just check out these absolutely dismal numbers just 18 of americans say president biden should run for reelection in 2024 according to the latest yahoo news yougov poll the lowest number to date nearly two thirds 64 say he should bow out and for the first time more democrats now say biden should pass on a second term 41 than say he should pursue one 35 the survey of 1 672 u s adults which was conducted from july 8 to july 11 represents perhaps the starkest evidence to date of the president s deteriorating position with voters including those in his own party things aren t even that bad yet and only 18 percent of all americans want biden to run again at this point so what will those numbers look like once this new economic downturn becomes quite severe we will soon see things happen in this country that are absolutely unprecedented but we don t have to let events overwhelm us so i would encourage you to stay positive and to get prepared while there is still time to do so the clock is ticking and time is quickly running out

federal health officials reminded u s pharmacies on wednesday that they must comply with federal civil rights laws in the decisions they make about supplying and dispensing medicine this comes after multiple news reports of pharmacists refusing to fill some prescriptions for medications used for abortion after the supreme court ruling overturning roe v wade the guidance clarifies that pharmacists may not discriminate against pharmacy customers with regard to supplying medications making determinations regarding the suitability of a prescribed medication for a patient or advising patients about medications and how to take them according to a press release from the department of health and human services we are committed to ensuring that everyone can access health care free of discrimination said hhs secretary xavier becerra in the release this includes access to prescription medications for reproductive health and other types of care the guidance to pharmacies says an example of such discrimination would be if a pharmacist refused to dispense prescriptions for mifepristone and misoprostol to a patient who had a first trimester miscarriage these drugs are used to assist with the passing of the miscarriage according to hhs but they are also used for medication abortions early in pregnancy and such abortions are now banned in some states the department aimed its guidance at the roughly 60 000 retail pharmacies in the u s reminding them that because they receive federal funding through several programs such as medicare and medicaid they cannot discriminate based on race color national origin sex age and disability further they may not discriminate based on current pregnancy past pregnancy potential or intended pregnancy and medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth misoprostol is also used for stomach ulcers so if pharmacy refused to stock that drug or dispense it to a patient with severe or chronic stomach ulcers that could constitute discrimination based on disability according to the guidance another example in the guidance concerned contraception if a pharmacy stocks contraception like condoms but refuses to dispense hormonal forms of contraception such as the pill that could constitute discrimination on the basis of sex hhs officials distributed to reporters a compilation of news stories about pharmacists refusing to fill doctors prescriptions in states that have restricted abortion after the supreme court ruling on june 24 such as louisiana but also in states where abortion is still legal like virginia a doctor quoted in the new orleans times picayune said she prescribed cytotec the brand name for misoprostol to make it easier to do an iud insertion the pharmacy called her to ask if the prescription was for an abortion even after she clarified it still refused to dispense the drug hhs also shared news reports about pharmacies refusing to dispense methotrexate a drug that is commonly used to treat cancer rheumatoid arthritis crohn s lupus and other autoimmune diseases methotrexate can also be used to end ectopic pregnancies which are potentially fatal reports in the la times and other outlets featured patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and lupus who were refused refills on their methotrexate prescriptions or had trouble getting them senior health officials would not comment on those specific news reports or cases on wednesday but said the goal of the guidance was to provide clarity and support for pharmacists in their work one official said the guidance made it clear that federal law obligations should come first if there s a conflict with state laws but she added that if there was a specific conflict with state law that would have to be investigated in each case patients who believe they were discriminated against at a pharmacy are encouraged to file a complaint at www hhs gov ocr complaints copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

photoschmidt investment thesis the broad based selloff in stocks and other assets so far this year is starting to shape into the early beginnings of a buying opportunity the growing challenge is figuring out which of the sold off assets are an investment opportunity given the emerging picture of the end of the post ww2 era and the beginning of a new one which is yet to fully take shape by focusing on the vanguard ftse europe etf nysearca vgk as a case study i want to highlight the reasons why the broader eu is likely to be a poor investment opportunity the latest piece of bad news from the eu economy namely germany experiencing its first monthly trade deficit since 1991 may not register as a reason to be alarmed by the broader market it is seen as a temporary situation mostly caused by high energy prices if one looks closer at the implications as well as some other accompanying data points it is in fact perhaps the most negative sign for the eu economy so far this year it amounts to a sizable part of a larger puzzle that suggests the eu s industrial core is failing under the pressure of the fallout from the economic war with russia the rupture in economic relations with russia takes on an ever more permanent shape while efforts to get major energy exporters from the middle east to fill the void are being dashed as it turns out everyone is more interested in positioning for the growing asian energy market combined with other factors like russia s growing reluctance to accept euros for its exports across the world as well as the wider picture of the eu economy suggests that the euro currency is likely to perform extremely poorly in the next year or two against the dollar in the longer term it may become entirely unviable the eu economy will see a massive deterioration in the process investors should be weary in considering exposing themselves to the eu market directly or indirectly about the vanguard ftse europe etf the reason why i chose this exchange traded fund etf in particular as a case study is because it offers very broad exposure to the western eu economic core with all sectors of the economy well represented before i briefly introduce the etf s basic profile i want to highlight a somewhat recent article published on seeking alpha on this etf which takes the view that the vanguard ftse europe etf is a buy though i disagree i also want to encourage readers to explore opposing perspectives the article highlights the fact that the etf is trading at a significant discount compared with the vanguard s p 500 voo the overall thesis seems to be that even in the face of somewhat poor economic prospects in the eu many european companies have been doing alright in terms of their overall performance and can be up to the challenges of the future my overall view is that most european companies are set to suffer as shortages most notably in energy amplify as the ukraine war drags on at the moment natural gas supplies are at the forefront of worries as we approach the end of the year assuming that the eu will go through with its ban on russian oil a continent wide shortfall in liquid fuel supplies may emerge in the coming winter in addition to the potential shortfall in natural gas supplies industrial disruptions may cause a cascading effect where certain shortfalls may lead to other shortfalls along the eu s complex industrial supply chain vanguard ftse europe etf investment returns vanguard as the chart above suggests there has already been a substantial correction in the share price of the etf this year in my personal view the selloff in no way prices in the possible outcome of a worst case scenario where the eu will not only experience a severe energy shortage this coming winter but perhaps a few decades of energy insecurity going forward as its relationship with what has been by far its most important energy provider is unraveling very fast with permanent consequences looking at some of the top stocks that make up the fund it is hard to argue how any of them can successfully thrive if the worst case scenario which is growing more likely to occur with every day that passes plays out vanguard ftse europe etf top four holdings vanguard nestlã s a otcpk nsrgy otcpk nsrgf for instance is dependent on the full proper functioning of europe s supply chains for its operations throughout the continent in the event that industrial operations are halted in order to preserve natural gas in the winter there is no way that it will be able to continue producing its wide ranging array of goods some may argue that since it is in the food business it would be exempt from energy rationing but most of its food products are not essential food products so it may not be the case even if it will not be asked to stop operations in order to conserve natural gas it may find it hard to secure affordable transportation next year if europe will see liquid fuel shortages after the russian oil ban kicks in roche otcqx rhhby otcqx rhhbf might seem like a decent defensive stock in case of harsh energy shortages in europe if we examine its supply chain vulnerabilities it becomes more evident that it may not be the case in the event that the eu petrochemicals industry is hit with a lack of natural gas or oil specialty chemicals that are often derived from wider industrial activities can be impacted both the diagnostics as well as pharmaceutical products can see a potential impact as a result of wider industry disruptions as well as potential transport issues down the line asml holding n v asml can see an increase in energy related costs same as all the other companies that are based and have significant operations in europe in addition to that it is faced with a growing list of restrictions on its sales to nations that would otherwise purchase its products with these sales restrictions in place there is always a chance that it can lead to the emergence of competing companies especially in china where there is a feverish effort being made to close the tech gap shell plc shel otcpk rydaf might be thought of as a company that could potentially benefit from higher oil gas prices on the other side of the equation there is the risk that it can see many of its gas stations in europe run dry and its refineries can be squeezed by excessively high input prices both in terms of crude oil it has to purchase as well as other costs such as electricity prices and so on there is a chance that these costs might actually cancel out the profits that shell will earn from lng and its upstream operations it is nevertheless perhaps one of the best positioned companies of the top four represented in this etf the reality is that it is hard to fathom how european companies can thrive within the context of astronomically high energy prices energy insecurity a growing path of sanctions restrictions in relation to major economies of the world like china russia iran as well as other problems mostly internal in nature yes exports to the u s help but with american consumers also starting to struggle it is unclear whether it can continue to be a growing market for eu goods many of these companies have international exposure with sales and production facilities all over the world which is the only bright spot for european business the euro area is experiencing a widening trade deficit gap the german trade surplus issue has been a subject of much debate and political rhetoric in the past few years there is a good reason for it since the euro currency was adopted germany s trade surplus ballooned germany s economic strength was seen as the saving grace of the euro currency project even as countries like italy greece and spain started to struggle last decade germany yearly trade surplus macrotrends the recent deficit is mostly blamed on the surging price of energy imports eu trade data however suggests that there has been no jump in import growth in the past few months it is very likely that the eu has been paying more for energy imports but it has been seeing far less robust growth in other import growth according to eurostat the value of imported energy is up by 146 in the past year while the value of imported manufactured goods is up by 29 export growth on the other hand has been slowing down in the past few months which is the more worrying trend in my view eu imports exports growth eurostat the fact that import growth rates are mostly sustained at a higher pace by rising energy prices means that eu exports are automatically made more expensive because of higher energy input costs higher product costs will make most eu exports uncompetitive the trade gap will only rise until the euro adjusts in order to bring the eu economy back into balance the problem with reaching that balance will be that the weaker the euro gets the more expensive energy imports will become in euro terms given that the eu is likely to suffer from high energy prices and energy supply instability for the foreseeable future the factor that is the main cause of the widening trade gap will not dissipate therefore there is nowhere for the euro to go but further down the recent announcement of the first monthly trade deficit in decades by germany is just a symptom of the intensification of this problem euro currency faces multiple headwinds the factor i identified and explained so far namely rising energy costs is the main factor that caused the widening eu trade gap not only because of the higher costs of energy imports but also because those higher costs make eu goods more expensive to produce is a major headache for the eu economy the euro is set to suffer as a result as i pointed out given that it is caught in a vicious cycle where it is set to adjust lower in order to rebalance trade even as its weakening will worsen the trade balance due to higher energy import costs in euro terms there are however many other negative factors impacting the current strength level of the euro as well as its future prospects the main flaw of the euro explained in an abbreviated version is that it brings together too many states with too many different needs without a corresponding fiscal mechanism in place to help smooth out the resulting problems many root causes have to do with the fact that countries like germany are home to many global brands which will benefit from a euro currency that is perpetually weaker than what the euro would be if it were to exclusively reflect germany s economy italy on the other hand with mostly regional brands anchoring its economy perpetually suffers from having a euro currency that is too strong to allow its industries to make headway on the global market thus germany is caught in a virtuous cycle while italy in a vicious one with no way to get out however germany s virtuous cycle is not unbreakable in fact the latest trade data suggests that it just might have broken it meaning that the euro might just have to readjust to levels more reflective of economies like italy and spain than germany s economy until recently we should keep in mind however that a weakening german economy will mean a further knock on effect on the already struggling eurozone economies which means that those economies will themselves see growing struggles despite a weakening euro which should help them somewhat the ecb is stuck on many levels with no room to shift into a defense of the euro countries like greece and italy continue to need support in order to finance their debts a broad based weakening of the eu economy for the reasons mentioned above also makes it hard for the ecb to contemplate a serious effort to defend the euro there is therefore nothing fundamental that is currently backing the euro aside from sentiment and institutional entrenchment in the global financial system the future of that institutional entrenchment of the euro within the global financial system may have suffered a significant perhaps even terminal blow this year when the russians stopped accepting euros for their gas exports to the eu since then they also started demanding ruble payments for wheat exports this amounts to a decline in euro denominated transactions across the world to the tune of tens of billions of euros year the fact that russia is no longer looking to accumulate euro denominated fx reserves due to the freezing of its central bank assets that were denominated in euros dollars and a number of other currencies is also a cause of concern russia will probably reject most euro transactions eventually for all its trade transactions it seems intent on decoupling its economy from the western dominated financial system at the moment all the negative fundamental trends as well as its future prospects are yet to truly take a heavy toll on the euro it did see a significant decline versus the dollar in the past few months for now at least the institutional entrenchment factor seems to be keeping it from going into freefall euro to usd exchange rate ecb germany s economic model cracking from multiple sides meaning that the euro will no longer be supported by a solid economic core in order to understand the implications of the latest negative german economic data it is important to understand the model that made germany a euro era economic success story even as many countries in the south of the eurozone faltered the most important ingredient sitting at the base of it all was the fact that germany has many global brands that provided a strong basis for export growth a euro currency that has been reflecting many weaker economies such as italy s certainly helped to keep german exports competitive the massive trade surpluses that germany has been running in the past two decades would have sent its national currency soaring dampening its export growth being tied to the rest of the euro area prevented that from happening the euro currency was not the only important factor eu enlargement allowed german companies to move just enough of their operations to lower wage markets in its immediate vicinity to keep wage pressures at home down while intermediate product input costs were also kept down as they were increasingly produced in visegrad group countries or other former communist states that are close enough to viably integrate into germany s industrial supply chain the economic relationship in the area can be summed up as the west providing capital while the east provided affordable labor as well as a significant new consumer market for that capital average gross wages in the area have doubled in the past decade or so which reduced the wage advantage that the region provided to german capital significantly the migration of labor from east to west also slowed dramatically energy costs were kept in check even as the massive reduction in coal and nuclear power use put pressure on the system that is where russian gas comes into play summing it all up there are upwards producer price pressures that are converging the energy price shock that started about a year ago and intensified since the war in ukraine is just the last act along the way to a complete breakdown of the german economic model that started with the adoption of the euro currency the damage seems permanent with russia aggressively pushing its energy exports east while it also seems that eu policymakers may have overestimated their capacity to attract major energy exporters to the eu market investment implications the euro seems doomed to continue losing value for the foreseeable future the eu consumer is being pushed to the breaking point by higher energy costs eu exports are losing momentum as producer costs are rising very rapidly making goods produced in the eu more expensive on the global market the geopolitical factors that are causing a decline in euro currency demand as a reserve currency and as a means to conduct international transactions continue to unfold geopolitical issues are also plaguing a growing number of international economic relations with more and more nations facing either eu sanctions or extraterritorial sanctions imposed by the u s germany s stunning reversal of its trade surplus situation which just a few years ago was decried as being a major cause of eu and global trade imbalances is only a symptom of the dramatic transformation we are seeing in regard to the current shape and trajectory of the eu economy it used to be that the euro crisis was seen as a story of two eurozone economies the weak south versus the solid north with the seeming collapse of the german model that lasted since the adoption of the euro it seems we now just have an economically weak eurozone with few prospects for improvement while the downside risks keep mounting the vanguard ftse europe etf may be down more than 20 ytd as i write this but it is by no means a buying opportunity as a result of this year s selloff the only positive aspect that one could claim in regards to european companies is that they are likely to benefit from low interest rates for the foreseeable future given that the ecb is unlikely to aggressively tackle the inflation issue or defend the exchange value of the euro low interest rates will in no way make up for the outright horrible business environment that european companies are facing when we are reduced to prospects of energy rationing at household and industry levels it is hard to see a bright future for the european continent or for its businesses

federal health officials reminded u s pharmacies on wednesday that they must comply with federal civil rights laws in the decisions they make about supplying and dispensing medicine this comes after multiple news reports of pharmacists refusing to fill some prescriptions for medications used for abortion after the supreme court ruling overturning roe v wade the guidance clarifies that pharmacists may not discriminate against pharmacy customers with regard to supplying medications making determinations regarding the suitability of a prescribed medication for a patient or advising patients about medications and how to take them according to a press release from the department of health and human services we are committed to ensuring that everyone can access health care free of discrimination said hhs secretary xavier becerra in the release this includes access to prescription medications for reproductive health and other types of care the guidance to pharmacies says an example of such discrimination would be if a pharmacist refused to dispense prescriptions for mifepristone and misoprostol to a patient who had a first trimester miscarriage these drugs are used to assist with the passing of the miscarriage according to hhs but they are also used for medication abortions early in pregnancy and such abortions are now banned in some states the department aimed its guidance at the roughly 60 000 retail pharmacies in the u s reminding them that because they receive federal funding through several programs such as medicare and medicaid they cannot discriminate based on race color national origin sex age and disability further they may not discriminate based on current pregnancy past pregnancy potential or intended pregnancy and medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth misoprostol is also used for stomach ulcers so if pharmacy refused to stock that drug or dispense it to a patient with severe or chronic stomach ulcers that could constitute discrimination based on disability according to the guidance another example in the guidance concerned contraception if a pharmacy stocks contraception like condoms but refuses to dispense hormonal forms of contraception such as the pill that could constitute discrimination on the basis of sex hhs officials distributed to reporters a compilation of news stories about pharmacists refusing to fill doctors prescriptions in states that have restricted abortion after the supreme court ruling on june 24 such as louisiana but also in states where abortion is still legal like virginia a doctor quoted in the new orleans times picayune said she prescribed cytotec the brand name for misoprostol to make it easier to do an iud insertion the pharmacy called her to ask if the prescription was for an abortion even after she clarified it still refused to dispense the drug hhs also shared news reports about pharmacies refusing to dispense methotrexate a drug that is commonly used to treat cancer rheumatoid arthritis crohn s lupus and other autoimmune diseases methotrexate can also be used to end ectopic pregnancies which are potentially fatal reports in the la times and other outlets featured patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and lupus who were refused refills on their methotrexate prescriptions or had trouble getting them senior health officials would not comment on those specific news reports or cases on wednesday but said the goal of the guidance was to provide clarity and support for pharmacists in their work one official said the guidance made it clear that federal law obligations should come first if there s a conflict with state laws but she added that if there was a specific conflict with state law that would have to be investigated in each case patients who believe they were discriminated against at a pharmacy are encouraged to file a complaint at www hhs gov ocr complaints copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

us inflation rockets to 41 year high federal reserve set for even bigger interest rate hikes to cool rising prices us government inflation at 9 1 in june a level not seen since november 1981 60 probability of fed hiking rates by whole percentage point at next meeting that would be biggest rate rise since december 1980 the us federal reserve looks set to intensify its painful prescription of interest rate rises after inflation in the world s biggest economy soared to its highest level for more than 40 years in a report that sent shock waves through financial markets the us government said that inflation climbed to 9 1 per cent in june a level which has not been seen since november 1981 investors were last night pricing in a 60 per cent probability of the fed hiking rates by a whole percentage point at its next meeting in two weeks time that would be the biggest rate rise since december 1980 and would follow an increase of 0 75 percentage points last month speculation that the fed would take such an aggressive step mounted after the bank of canada which is also facing an inflation battle yesterday announced a full percentage point hike chris zaccarelli chief investment officer at independent advisor alliance said inflation in the us was now staggeringly high it s higher than expected and shows that inflation is going quickly in the wrong direction he said america s increasingly aggressive response to inflation has already seen the dollar steamroller rival currencies in recent weeks and analysts warned that it could get even tougher the euro yesterday briefly dipped below the level of the dollar for the first time in two decades hitting 0 99 shortly after the data was published sterling also temporarily lost ground slipping towards two year lows of around 1 18 the turmoil also spread to the oil market where brent crude dipped to 99 61 a barrel stocks were volatile too with the ftse 100 ending 53 49 points or 0 7 per cent lower at 7156 37 while in new york the s p 500 sold off for a fourth day in a row the market moves were pared back later in the session with some experts suggesting that inflation was now hitting its peak and playing down talk of a percentage point increase us president joe biden said that the inflation figures were unacceptably high but insisted the data did not reflect more recent falls in fuel prices the fed has been increasing interest rates to try to cure the scourge of inflation by cooling demand soaring commodity costs and supply chain bottlenecks that have driven the initial spike in prices could prove temporary but a red hot labour market with nearly two vacancies available for every one unemployed person is pushing up wages threatening to prolong the crisis however the fed s medicine to cure the problem is to squeeze consumer and business borrowers this could have the unpleasant side effect of tipping the economy into recession the effects of us interest rate hikes are also felt around the globe squeezing borrowers with dollar denominated debts as well as importers of dollar price goods including oil us rates had hovered around zero since the start of the pandemic in early 2020 but with inflation soaring much more quickly than the fed anticipated the central bank dosed the economy with increases of 0 25 percentage points in march 0 5 percentage points in may and 0 75 percentage points in june the latest move was the biggest increase since 1994 markets expect that the latest inflation print will cement another hike of at least the same scale again the fed has not increased rates by one percentage point or higher since december 1980 under the leadership of paul volcker who was a central bank chairman noted for his ultra hawkish approach to cooling america s price spiral in stark contrast to the fed the european central bank which is being wracked by record inflation of 8 6 per cent still has an interest rate of minus 0 5 per cent though this is widely expected to move later this month

inflation s relentless surge didn t merely persist last month it accelerated for the 12 months that ended in june the government s consumer price index rocketed 9 1 the fastest year over year jump since 1981 and that was nothing next to what energy prices did fueled by heavy demand and russia s invasion of ukraine energy costs shot up nearly 42 in the last 12 months the largest such jump since 1980 even if you toss out food and energy prices which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price surge so called core inflation soared 5 9 over the last year advertisement consumers have endured the pain in everyday routines gasoline is up 61 in the last year men s suits jackets and coats 25 airline tickets 34 eggs 33 and breakfast sausage 14 under chair jerome h powell the federal reserve never expected inflation this severe or persistent yet after having been merely an afterthought for decades high inflation reasserted itself with ferocious speed as shortages of labor and supplies ran up against a propulsive rise in demand for goods and services across the economy in february 2021 the consumer price index was running just 1 7 above its level a year earlier from there it accelerated past 2 in march past 4 in april and 5 in may by december consumer prices hit the 7 year over year barrier and on and on it went 7 5 in january 7 9 in february and the increases have topped 8 every month since march the u s has endured worse inflation but not in many decades post world war ii inflation peaked at nearly 20 in 1947 a result of the lifting of wartime price curbs supply shortages and pent up consumer demand the inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s peaked at 14 8 in march 1980 before the fed exorcized high prices with aggressive rate increases that caused brutal back to back recessions in 1980 and 1981 82 for months powell and some others characterized high inflation as merely a transitory phenomenon while the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession faster than anyone had expected no longer now most economists expect inflation to remain painfully elevated well after this year with demand outstripping supplies in numerous areas of the economy so the fed has radically changed course by imposing a succession of large rate increases the central bank is making a high risk bet that it can slow the economy enough to rein in inflation without weakening it so much as to trigger a recession advertisement the overall economy looks healthy for now with a robust job market and extremely low unemployment but many economists warn that the fed s steady credit tightening will probably cause a downturn what s caused the surge in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs economic output plunged at a record shattering 31 annual rate in 2020 s april to june quarter everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a severe recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed rates among other things by spring of last year the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants bars shops airports and entertainment venues suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic advertisement critics blamed in part president biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others assigned greater blame to supply shortages and some argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets is high inflation affecting just the u s not by a long shot prices are rising just about everywhere in the world in part a consequence of russia s invasion of ukraine which has elevated energy and food prices and in part because of the supply chain bottlenecks that have driven u s prices up eurostat the statistical service of the european union says it expects year over year inflation to have hit 8 6 last month in the 19 countries that share the euro currency up from an annual increase of 8 1 in may the international monetary fund has forecast that consumer prices in the world s advanced economies will jump 5 7 this year the most since 1984 the imf foresees 8 7 inflation in poorer emerging markets and developing countries the highest such rate since 2008 how long will it last no one knows for sure elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services a recovering job market employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and a healthy average of 457 000 a month so far this year means that many americans can afford to keep spending the fed foresees inflation staying above its 2 annual target into 2024 but relief from higher prices might be coming oil prices have been tumbling on fears of an economic downturn jammed up supply chains are showing some signs of improvement at least in industries including transportation commodity prices have begun to fall pay increases have slowed and surveys show that americans expectations for inflation over the long run have eased a trend that often points to more moderate price increases over time advertisement what s more the fed s pivot toward an aggressively anti inflationary policy could reduce consumer demand inflation itself is eroding purchasing power and might force some consumers to shave spending at the same time new covid variants could cloud the outlook either by causing outbreaks that force factories and ports to close and further disrupt supply chains or by keeping more people home and reducing demand for goods how are higher prices affecting consumers the strong job market is boosting workers pay though not enough to offset higher prices the labor department says that after accounting for higher consumer prices hourly earnings for private sector employees fell 3 6 last month from a year earlier the 15th straight drop there are exceptions after inflation wages rose more than 4 for hotel workers and 3 for those working in bars

in two weeks advertisement that would match its most recent increase which was the biggest since 1994 a growing number of traders are even suggesting the fed will go for a monster hike of a full percentage point the latest inflation report certainly creates more certainty that the fed is going to be pretty aggressive in the july meeting hainlin said traders see a 67 8 chance of a full point hike up from zero a month ago according to cme group the risk is that rate hikes are a notoriously blunt tool one that takes a long time for the full effects to be felt if the fed ends up too aggressive with them it could cause a recession in the meantime higher rates push down on prices of all kinds of investments shock and awe from the fed might cause a lot of collateral damage to the economy without really providing near term inflation relief said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments the fed probably needs to temper people s expectations about what they can do he said all told the s p 500 fell 17 02 points to 3 801 78 the dow dropped 208 54 points to 30 772 79 and the nasdaq lost 17 15 points to end at 11 247 58 advertisement smaller

expectations for fed action and it got as high as 3 22 immediately after the release of the inflation report it remains higher than the 10 year yield which fell to 2 91 wednesday down from 2 95 late tuesday that s a relatively rare occurrence and some investors see it as an ominous signal of a potential recession advertisement the inflation data also sent immediate jolts into stock markets across europe with prices for all of them weakening after the report s release u s gold for august delivery ended 0 6 higher even with the swings wall street s reaction was more muted than it was after the last report on inflation a month ago the reading on the consumer price index or cpi showed an unexpected acceleration in inflation that dashed some hopes that inflation was peaking and it sent the s p 500 down 2 9 since then parts of the economy have already slowed as a result of inflation and the fed s actions combating it particularly the housing market prices for oil and other commodities have also regressed as worries about a recession pull down expectations for demand advertisement while some will draw parallels with the shockingly bad may cpi report the backdrop is markedly different commodity prices have fallen sharply and we ve seen clearer signs of an economic slowdown both of which will contribute to weaker price pressures ahead said michael pearce senior u s economist with capital economics or as the chief investment officer of global fixed income at blackrock put it high prices is the cure for high prices high inflation is pushing households and businesses to pull back on spending and the reduced demand should ultimately help pull down inflation rick rieder wrote in a report besides interest rates which affect how much investors are willing to pay for stocks

file the twitter splash page is seen on a digital device on april 25 2022 in san diego in a regulatory filing wednesday july 13 2022 the company is telling employees that it s not planning any companywide layoffs but there could be some restructuring and organization changes as it heads into a legal battle over the potential sale to elon musk ap photo gregory bull file twitter is telling its employees that it s not planning any companywide layoffs but there could be some restructuring and organization changes as it heads into a legal battle over the potential sale to elon musk the san francisco company included the communication in a filing wednesday with the securities and exchange commission it also says twitter is losing workers at a slightly higher rate than in normal economic times but attrition is in line with current tech industry trends the company says it will monitor turnover to ensure that we can quickly identify any areas of concern and help mitigate where possible advertisement twitter said it had planned to offer packages to retain employees and on june 20 it had asked musk to agree to programs that had been approved by the board and its compensation committee the filing said that musk has not provided his consent to implement these programs the employee question and answer document attached to the filing says that teams across the company are making changes so it operates responsibly and efficiently in the current environment that means restructuring and organizational changes are possible as we continue to align with our revised business needs twitter sued tesla ceo elon musk on tuesday trying to force him to complete his 44 billion takeover of the social media company by accusing him of outlandish and bad faith actions that have caused the platform irreparable harm and wreaked havoc on its stock price back in april musk pledged to pay 54 20 a share for twitter inc which agreed to those terms after reversing its initial opposition to the deal but the two sides have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday that he was backing away from his agreement to buy the company twitter s lawsuit in delaware chancery court asserts that musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests part of musk s argument for terminating the deal is his allegation that twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team but in its lawsuit twitter reveals communications from musk starting shortly after the deal was signed showing his concerns about headcount and expense growth and his desire for more aggressive cost cutting twitter said musk refused to approve or even discuss twitter s proposed retention programs for key employees musk had notice back in early may of many of the actions about which he now complains for the first time the lawsuit says
technology explainer what happens next in the musk twitter saga file the logo for twitter appears above a trading post on the floor of the new york stock exchange nov 29 2021 ap photo richard drew file the associated press in the latest twist in the twitter elon musk saga the company has sued the billionaire tesla ceo in an attempt to force him to complete his 44 billion takeover twitter claims in a lawsuit filed tuesday in delaware that musk s outlandish and bad faith actions have caused the social media platform irreparable harm and sunk its stock price legal experts say twitter inc has a strong case but the coming court battle could be long and contentious and the outcome uncertain so what s next for twitter and musk in the battle over the social media company s future why did twitter sue elon musk advertisement in short twitter wants to complete the deal both sides had agreed to and says musk s reasons for backing out are just a cover for his cold feet after the takeover no longer makes financial sense for him in april musk pledged to pay 54 20 a share for twitter which agreed to those terms after reversing its initial opposition to the deal but the two sides have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said friday that he was backing away from his agreement to buy the company saying twitter did not give him enough information about how many spam accounts are on the service among other reasons twitter s lawsuit asserts that musk refuses to honor his obligations to twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests having mounted a public spectacle to put twitter in play and having proposed and then signed a seller friendly merger agreement musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to delaware contract law is free to change his mind trash the company disrupt its operations destroy stockholder value and walk away the suit states musk agreed to pay 38 above twitter s stock price at the time that he offered the take it or leave it deal the lawsuit says but soon after the stock market stumbled and shares of tesla where most of musk s personal wealth comes from lost more than 100 billion of their value advertisement has musk responded not formally although he has tweeted after twitter filed the lawsuit musk who has more than 100 million followers tweeted oh the irony lol without explanation earlier in the week he had taunted twitter over the anticipated lawsuit suggesting that the trial court discovery process when both sides have to hand over evidence would finally reveal the internal spam bot data he s been demanding what happens next barring the unlikely event of the two sides settling the case is headed to trial and a judge could start making decisions this summer twitter has told employees it asked for an expedited trial to be heard in september because it is critically important to get it resolved quickly delaware prides itself on being very fast in responding to urgent issues where there is a lot of public or shareholder attention said lawrence cunningham a law professor and corporate governance expert at george washington university but it could still end up dragging for weeks or longer especially if either side tries to stretch it out twitter would probably want to get things done fast elon i don t know cunningham said why delaware twitter filed its lawsuit in the delaware court of chancery which frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter and tesla that are incorporated there the court describes itself as the nation s preeminent forum for the determination of disputes involving the internal affairs of the thousands upon thousands of delaware corporations and other business entities the twitter musk case in that sense is unusual because it involves a business suing an individual advertisement what are they arguing about the spam bot question will likely be a central theme since that is the main pretext through which musk wants to back out of the deal and might be a richer argument than people think said donna hitscherich a columbia university business professor twitter claims in its lawsuit that musk started out saying he wants to buy twitter to rid it of crypto spam he viewed as a major blight on the user experience and take it private because purging spam would otherwise be commercially impractical but when the stock market went south twitter claims musk shifted his narrative suddenly demanding verification that spam was not a serious problem on twitter s platform and claiming a burning need to conduct diligence he had expressly forsworn does the spam issue present a material breach of twitter s obligation in the deal as musk claims because the company didn t give him sufficient data to determine how many of the platform s 229 million accounts are fake or is musk breaching his obligation to follow through with the contract he signed that s what the court will determine could musk be forced to buy twitter that is certainly a possible outcome though some experts say the court may not go that far that said the general sentiment favors twitter in the suit in a case with potential relevance to musk s legal fight the chancery court last year forced private equity firm kohlberg co to go through with its 550 million buyout of decopac a company based in minnesota that calls itself the world s largest supplier of cake decorating supplies to professional decorators and bakeries the case was emblematic of the court s common though not uniform resolution of enforcing contractual obligations on buyers advertisement other options include musk being forced to pay the 1 billion breakup fee each side agreed to if deemed responsible for the deal falling through or he might have to pay off a larger amount without actually buying the company for 44 billion if he s walked away from the deal there ll be damages and it s not necessarily limited to the breakup fee hitscherich said delaware courts have been very picky about interpreting what counts as a valid reason for backing off of a deal cunningham said the gap between what musk knew about twitter in april and the state of the company today has to be revolutionary and there s little evidence of that he said associated press writer marcy gordon contributed to this story

by ben paviour and katharine derosa the median home price in virginia surged 40 during the past five years to hit an all time high of 401 000 in may according to the virginia realtors association that in addition to rising interest rates means a homebuyer paying a typical mortgage will end up forking over an extra 700 each month for a median virginia home compared to a year ago the association said the data presented wednesday to lawmakers on the virginia housing commission drove home the commonwealth s deepening affordability crisis the problem is especially acute in northern virginia home to some of the most expensive housing markets on the east coast but impacts the entire state pandemic era sales have been especially strong in suburbs and what one association economist called zoom towns places like nelson county or the northern neck that have access to both broadband and nature but offer reasonable once a week commutes to bigger cities at the same time virginia continues to see an out migration to states like north carolina that have cheaper homes and jobs with comparable compensation rising interest rates and steep prices have helped cool home sales recently but experts told lawmakers they expect prices to stabilize not drop significantly because there is a shortage of housing stock and as homebuyers get priced out they re likely to rent instead fueling a rise in those costs and an uptick in evictions as state and federal protections forged at the beginning of the pandemic run out the reality is it s still going to be a very competitive housing market all around virginia for quite some time virginia realtors chief economist ryan price told members of the housing commission wednesday price said half of homes are currently being sold in eight days or less after being put on the market about a quarter are on the market for three days or less he said a lot of those are one day a lot of those are one hour the problem has economic reverberations cnbc gave virginia a grade of d for cost of living as part of its rankings for best states to do business which was released on wednesday the commonwealth was no 3 in the ranking down from the top spot last year though the data has not yet been collected for 2022 price said he believes the median income in virginia is no longer high enough to support the median monthly mortgage payment on a 30 year fixed rate loan a worker would have to earn about 96 000 to afford the median 401 000 home according to back of the envelope math price provided the commission there was some good news though inventory is picking up across the state particularly around charlottesville loudoun county and the new river valley but the current rate of new construction is not enough to keep up with heavy demand for rentals and housing virginia faces a shortage of about 200 000 affordable housing units according to a study published last year by the legislature s research wing the joint legislative audit review commission as a result of higher housing prices virginians from arlington fairfax and alexandria are fleeing to areas that offer similar wages but lower costs of living one of the more popular out of state destinations is wake county north carolina which encompasses the city of raleigh according to internal revenue service data cited by hamilton lombard a researcher at the university of virginia s weldon cooper center wake county has a typical house price about half that of fairfax but if you re starting a job in wake county you re only taking about a third of the pay cut lombard said so there s a strong financial incentive business owners are following workers to their new homes lombard said for example someone who owns a deli in arlington could see people moving to areas like nellysford and set up shop there there s a lot more options for them than there were 10 years ago lombard said industry representatives cited a variety of obstacles to meeting the growing demand for more housing including laborious and unpredictable permitting strict zoning laws rising costs for supplies and labor as well as local opposition the housing commission is expected to take up the topics at future meetings

the first half of 2022 has been traumatic equity markets have suffered one of their worst six month periods ever government bonds are undergoing a rare significant decline and the world of cryptocurrencies has experienced the rude awakening that many had long predicted for it yet soaring above all the financial market turmoil is the us dollar which is now the strongest it has been in 20 years having appreciated against many other currencies including the euro from a standard currency valuation perspective the dollar has reached the point at which many investors might seriously consider selling it it is probably around 20 overvalued against most major currencies such as the euro and yen and that simply does not happen very often but currencies usually don t reverse course for valuation reasons rather it normally takes action by policymakers to trigger a decline consider the 1985 plaza accord whereby france west germany japan the united kingdom and the united states agreed to intervene in currency markets to weaken the dollar against the franc deutsche mark yen and pound or consider us secretary of the treasury robert rubin s public reversal from a strong dollar policy in 1998 and us authorities decision to tolerate a sharp depreciation of the dollar against the euro in the early 2000s in all of these cases policymakers stepped in to engineer or assist a dollar decline the dollar s current strength might seem remarkable considering the fractiousness of us politics and some of the structural issues facing the us economy from endlessly recurring balance of payment and current account deficits and an aggressive stance against major foreign exchange reserve holders to culture wars over guns and abortion there is more than enough to keep us society at a boiling point but now that the us federal reserve is tightening monetary policy to try to bring inflation back under control investors once again appear to be favouring the dollar as their safe haven in theory higher inflation in a country is supposed to erode its currency s purchasing power but under today s conditions as in so many other periods i experienced during my days as a currency analyst markets have a choice of betting on the fed getting inflation under control or investing elsewhere in an uncertain world for most the choice is obvious moreover despite the dollar s current overvaluation it could strengthen even further unless some new headwinds appear what could these be first and most obviously the fed could decide that it got things wrong and suddenly start easing its policy stance again such a move might seem unlikely yet it is worth noting that the us bond market is undergoing a dramatic reversal and the us money market is now starting to price in fed interest rate cuts from levels higher than they are today beyond this year as a very successful macro fund manager once said to me if there is one thing that you can be sure about with the fed it is that it will change its views at some point a second possibility is that other major central banks start to outpace the fed with their own policy tightening as has happened during previous periods of dollar decline but given the state of most other economies this scenario seems unlikely that leaves two other possibilities one reason why the dollar s rule lives on despite what is happening in the us and the world is that there are no significant strategic alternatives to it the euro for example suffers from persistently recurring issues stemming from the makeup of its member states not to mention the absence of a single euro bond that encompasses the entire union some commentators would argue that the chinese renminbi represents a plausible alternative but until china encourages more widespread use of its currency and allows that usage to be liquid and free the renminbi cannot pose a major threat to the dollar s hegemony true at their annual conference this year the brics brazil russia india china and south africa discussed how they might promote wider use of their currencies but we have heard this talk before and there is little reason to think that such lofty ambitions will be realised anytime soon historically the dollar s strength has usually started to reverse when the sitting us secretary of the treasury declares that the currency is too strong and raises the possibility of a us intervention in the market to weaken it

randomized double blind placebo and active controlled crossover study to evaluate the intranasal abuse potential of pf614 compared with immediate release oxycodone and placebo in non dependent recreational opioid users is being conducted by dr glen apseloff from ohio clinical trials this trial is designed to test and confirm that manipulating and snorting pf614 will not result in subjects liking the product as a recreational drug dr nily osman chief medical officer of ensysce commented this human abuse potential hap study is a critical step in seeking to establish that unlike the current opioid analgesics on the market which can be abused through nasal inhalation pf614 does not carry this risk our clinical development of pf614 is rapidly advancing with the initiation of this hap study the trypsin activated abuse protection taap proprietary drug delivery technology that is used with pf614 requires endogenous human trypsin in the small intestine for its activation and as such substantially reduces the risk of misuse abuse and diversion through inhaled and iv routes by those who use recreational drugs our goal is to bring to market a responsible analgesia solution that will alleviate suffering for those who experience severe pain dr lynn kirkpatrick ceo of ensysce offered as we reported previously we believe the features of pf614 will make it unattractive to those who wish to enjoy opioids for recreation our first two studies already demonstrated that pf614 requires exposure to trypsin to become activated to release oxycodone and more recently reported pf614 circulating in the blood does not convert to oxycodone since the trypsin enzyme is found only in the small intestine and not in nasal passages we believe drug abusers will not experience the same effect as they do with snorting other opioid products the data to be used for labeling claims is expected by october 2022 and will show the distinction between pf614 and other opioids currently on the market we look forward to also evaluating pf614 in a human abuse potential study following oral administration later this year the pf614 103 study which examines the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic e g maximum drug liking and take drug again of pf614 compared to crushed oxycodone and placebo in recreational drug users has a primary outcome of measuring the maximum effect emax for drug liking the eligible subjects receive one of the 3 following treatments pf614 100 mg crushed oxycodone hcl ir 40 mg placebo powder in a randomized double blind crossover manner following a fasting
