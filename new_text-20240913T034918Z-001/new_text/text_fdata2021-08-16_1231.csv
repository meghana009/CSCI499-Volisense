at the height of the pacific war a strange theory about how long emaciated soldiers would live gained currency among starving japanese troops fighting u s forces on the island of guadalcanal soldiers who could manage to stand on their own two feet would live for 30 more days it said those who could not stand but could sit up would have three more weeks the men who urinated while lying down would die in three days and those who could no longer talk would succumb in two according to the theory predictions based on this unscientific and inhumane theory always proved accurate yasuo obi a second lieutenant of the imperial japanese army who survived the battle says in his memoir titled ningen no genkai human limits one notable fact about the imperial japanese army s combat in southern fronts including the grueling battle on guadalcanal which was called gato starvation island is the large numbers of deaths from starvation or diseases caused by hunger reckless campaigns that lacked viable plans to secure adequate food and other vital supplies for operations were pushed under fanatical slogans stressing a bite the bullet spirit the most ghastly example was the battle of imphal japanese troops attempted to seize imphal in india by advancing from burma now myanmar the campaign required japanese troops to cross a large river and a mountain range they were told to get food by capturing enemy food stocks when they ran out of supplies some senior officers were dismissed after expressing their opposition to the reckless campaign to the commander after the battle began two division commanders were discharged over slower progress in the offensive than planned one division commander decided on his own to retreat as he grew infuriated about receiving no food supplies not even a grain of rice according to a book by japanese historian akira fujiwara on the topic of starvation among japanese soldiers titled uejini shita eireitachi japanese soldiers who died of starvation even after the campaign was aborted many of the japanese soldiers collapsed one after another as they retreated the route of their retreat later came to be known by the distressing name of hakkotsu kaido skeleton highway japan s decision to start a war with the united states and britain was a reckless gamble driven by foolish disregard for differences in national power many campaigns staged by japan during the war were also marked by various kinds of foolhardiness japanese wartime leaders never made a cool headed decision to stop the war along the way and start peace negotiations the asahi shimbun aug 15 vox populi vox dei is a popular daily column that takes up a wide range of topics including culture arts and social trends and developments written by veteran asahi shimbun writers the column provides useful perspectives on and insights into contemporary japan and its culture

dethrone ethereum after its latest upgrade last fall randi hipper decided to as she put it recently go in depth with the crypto space after hearing about nfts on twitter and other social media platforms hipper then a 17 year old senior at xaverian high school in new york city began releasing her own digital artworks cartoonish and self referential pieces showing her cruising in a car with a bitcoin license plate or riding the coney island wonder wheel hipper comes up with the concepts and collaborates with digital artists including a teenage boy in india who goes by ajay toons offering the works for sale through the nft marketplace atomic hub an nft or a nonfungible token is a digital file created using blockchain computer code it is bought using cryptocurrency such as ether or wax and exists as a unique file unable to be duplicated often just to be admired digitally right now i m trying to do one drop a week said hipper who now goes by miss teen crypto and has since turned 18 i try not to overload my feed my collectors the 40 year old digital artist known as beeple may have grabbed headlines last spring when one of his works sold at christie s for 69 million but nft markets like atomic hub nefty blocks and opensea are filled with creators barely old enough to drive they promote their work not through blue chip galleries or auction houses but on social media in the nft world anyone can post online market themselves on twitter and build a following from a young age said griffin cock foster who is 26 and lives in new york city he and his twin brother duncan founded the nft marketplace nifty gateway duncan cock foster said the comparison i like to make is it s similar to the way tiktok is causing people to be discovered at a really young age in june nifty gateway did a drop called nifty next generation it featured the work of jstngraphics a 17 year old from washington state and solace an 18 year old from soledad california both teenagers have been making nft art for less than a year and first drew attention by selling through the online auction site superrare the works of both artists which ranged in price from about 1 000 7 250 sold out i was tossing out random stuff to see what was going on said justin bodnar jstngraphics who makes surreal landscapes and what he described as tron style art then i got onto superrare and things started blowing up solace whose real name is carlos gomez began making nfts on a borrowed ipad because he didn t own a home computer i saw how digital art was being put out there it was being seen by people and valued he said i come from poverty my whole life nfts changed my life forever solace and jstngraphics seem like oldsters compared to benyamin ahmed a 12 year old boy from suburban london who released an nft collection last month the project weird whales featured 3 350 pixilated whales each with distinct traits some rarer and thus perceived to be more valuable the collection sold out and earned ahmed tens of thousands in crypto i got interested in the nft space because originally i thought it was cool as an online flex he told the website decrypt such improbable success stories have inspired enterprising young people to join the nft boom for some it s a fun after school hobby for others it s a perceived gateway to a career as a full time artist or crypto entrepreneur magnus aske was a 19 year old sophomore at babson college in wellesley massachusetts when he got sick with covid 19 last march around the time of the beeple sale he spent his 10 days in quarantine learning everything he could about nfts and came up with a project involving the antiquities collection of a foreign country his classmate had connections within the government for me it s not even about the money it s working with a team seeing something through from ideation to creation and seeing a sale said aske who is now 20 and studying finance and entrepreneurship josh kim is a rising senior at colby college who founded the cubby an online marketplace for college students to sell their art kim plans to introduce nfts in the coming months which he said will further the site s mission to help young creators achieve financial success or at least earn extra money while in school indeed for some teenagers making nfts and other forms of digital art has become the new summer job a modern take on bagging groceries or working at a fast food restaurant one 15 year old in new york city draws custom art for users of twitch the livestreaming platform popular with gamers it s mostly for spending money he said griffin cock foster likened the teen experimentation with nfts to kids hacking around with napster in the early 2000s adding they had a preview of what the world was going to look like pay attention to what teenagers are hacking around on on nights and weekends and in the summer the most popular and successful young nft artist is victor langlois a transgender 18 year old who goes by fewocious or fewo to his fans he makes digital art that chronicles his difficult childhood and struggles with gender identity and his transition last summer fewo started selling work on superrare and built a following there and on nifty gateway soon he came to the attention of noah davis the digital art specialist at christie s who arranged an auction of his work in june the online sale of five lots titled hello i m victor fewocious and this is my life earned 2 16 million turning langlois into an art world star victor has been alive about as long as artists are making art before they get to christie s davis said understanding nfts and their value as digital objects comes naturally to a generation raised online davis added i consider myself pretty digitally native but i can still recall floppy disks that s cuneiform tablets to victor he grew up completely immersed in this for hipper and others like her fewo is such a role model for gen z she said he came into nfts and blew my mind the fact that he was able to create a platform for me it s inspiring when the stock market was booming and bitcoin was above 60 000 earlier this year hipper said one of her nfts sold for 1 000 these days her art sells on atomic hub for as little as 125 wax or 21 she views her pieces as tradable collectibles similar to pokemon cards a common outlook among young creators indeed nft works can sell for as little as 1 brent lomas who founded the queenly nft a site that sells the work of lgbtq artists tracks the nft space closely and said that low prices are a deliberate strategy by young creators who in many cases are appealing to collectors their own age it s partly to get virality lomas said these kids are pretty savvy they can look at other drops and model their work after it if you re young and you get social media and meme culture it is possible for you to go viral with your first drop and get attention and make money davis said that fewo was selling pieces for tens of dollars only last year for a digitally savvy teenager earning that kind of money for making nfts beats mowing grass it s unique to our present moment davis said if you can make movie theater money for your summer vacation from your creativity i can t think of anything more utopian or american than that hipper estimates that so far she s earned a few hundred dollars max because she has to pay her artists but she said for now the money is secondary to learning the ropes i wanted to perfect my skills knowing how to do a drop she said you need to know how to set up your store how to create a template she added i just graduated high school my plan is to go full time crypto

bloomberg democrats are betting republicans will blink and agree to raise the debt ceiling before it expires a risky wager after a weeks long standoff that threatens the health of the financial markets and continued u s government operations should market turmoil and a federal shutdown ensue this fall it could overshadow democrats efforts to push through president joe biden s 4 1 trillion economic agenda and serve a blow to the party heading into next year s midterm elections democrats last week passed up the chance to muscle a debt ceiling hike through the senate on a party line vote opting instead to go through the normal legislative process perhaps attached to a stopgap government funding bill that will require the acquiescence of 10 republican senators democrats have said they shouldn t have to bear all the burden for a growing debt that is at least in part a result of tax cuts they opposed when republicans were in charge it s a strategy that strikes some political watchers on the left as ill advised or even insane senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and most of the gop oppose the majority of biden s spending and tax plans and vow they won t help raise the debt limit while he s pursuing them democrats could have as mcconnell suggested simply included a provision in their budget resolution allowing a party line debt limit hike instead they are seeking to set a precedent that neither party should hold the debt limit hostage dan pfeiffer a senior adviser to president barack obama during the last debt limit crisis suggested in a recent column democrats should have used the budget process to bypass the gop on debt and raised the limit high enough that biden wouldn t need to come back to congress before the 2024 presidential election they haven t taken that advice treasury secretary janet yellen has warned congress needs to act after returning from the august recess crunch time for democrats writing the massive package that republicans strongly oppose at the same time lawmakers must pass stopgap legislation to keep the government open past sept 30 whether democrats will put the debt limit suspension on the needed government funding legislation or take a more complex route is something zach moller a former democratic senate staffer who works for the centrist researcher third way is watching closely i am not totally sure where this is going to end up moller said risky business a decade ago just getting close to a historic debt default rattled financial markets resulting in the first ever credit downgrade of federal debt and tanking stocks consumer confidence and approval ratings for both then president obama and congress unlike the 2011 fight which happened after republicans took the house in a tea party inspired wave democrats are in charge of both chambers of congress and the white house and they are heading for a midterm election in which republicans have already returned to warning about debt deficits and inflation concerns they shelved under former president donald trump without those special budget protections from a filibuster democrats have no easy way to avoid a default on bills racked up by congress without at least some gop help any efforts toward a possible compromise have so far sputtered top senate budget committee republican lindsey graham of south carolina dropped plans to propose attaching gop backed budget process reforms to a debt hike instead he signed on to a letter with other republicans and mcconnell saying they wouldn t back increasing the debt limit there s been no hint either of a budget deal that would tie republican spending priorities like higher defense spending to a debt limit increase nuclear option there is at least one other option the nuclear one democrats have yet to float it but there might not be a starker moment to end the senate s 60 vote rule than to prevent a catastrophic government default at least two senate democrats kyrsten sinema or arizona and joe manchin of west virginia have said repeatedly they would not end the filibuster a default however would make that position tougher to hold changing the senate s filibuster rule would require just a simple majority via a process known as the nuclear option former senate majority leader harry reid a democrat deployed it to nix the 60 vote rule for most nominations mcconnell extended it to include supreme court picks forty six gop senators signed on to a letter saying they would not vote to increase the debt limit but the letter and senate procedure leave republicans some slim wiggle room it s rare but not unheard of for senators to vote to end a filibuster but against the final bill that very maneuver happened in 2014 during a previous debt limit fight averting a crisis but that came in obama s second term when republicans didn t have the leverage of threatening to tank the economy prior to his re election there are meanwhile still some republicans talking about a compromise senator john kennedy of louisiana said he never thought schumer would pursue the debt limit as a democrat only package and said he s working on a proposal that would seek to pair an overhaul of the budget process with a debt limit hike democrats however aren t inclined to sign on to such a deal they didn t demand concessions under trump over the debt and they insist republicans return the favor in case of emergency if republicans don t blink and washington instead plunges into a shutdown scenario in the middle of a pandemic and a historic debt default there are various break glass strategies that could be employed each has its drawbacks democrats could try to amend the budget resolution after the fact something that would be extremely messy procedurally and at minimum require yet another all night vote a rama with unlimited politically fraught amendment votes and precious wasted time or the white house could again look at untested maneuvers to raise the debt limit which obama considered and rejected the last time around one would have relied on the 14th amendment provision saying the federal debt cannot be questioned another would have exploited the ability of the treasury to mint platinum coins of any denomination say 1 trillion each and deposit them into the federal reserve the mintthecoin hashtag periodically gets some play on twitter in reference to the scheme obama himself has called the debt limit crisis the scariest night of his presidency it remains to be seen if this one will be biden s 2021 bloomberg l p

the daily lobo talked to the maxwell museum of anthropology to get updates on how it s doing amid the covid 19 pandemic along with the start of school coming up maxwell is gearing up to reopen to the public on aug 17 with some new exhibits and opportunities this q a addresses current and future happenings at the museum with director carla sinopoli q can you discuss the museum s current and future operations cs we will see what they will be as the pandemic continues to develop so when we were shut down in march 2020 we shifted to a lot of online activities online exhibits online posts events and so on and we want to continue doing that even as we physically reopen because that was a way to engage a much larger audience than we normally do we were really getting people from all over the world to know more about unm and our collections and what we do but we are also returning to doing these physical exhibitions and and we have our brazil exhibit which is a tribute to the brazil national museum that burned down in 2018 as our first new temporary exhibition that will be opening on tuesday we still have up from before our closure the amazing photography exhibit by rapheal begay who s a diné photographer who recently earned his bachelor of fine arts here at unm and it s called a vernacular response these are really his photographs of his time on the navajo reservation and if people haven t seen that exhibit it s just incredibly beautiful and that will be up through october and then we are in conversations with the wheelwright museum about hosting their current exhibition called indigenous women borders matter at unm in december featuring the work of contemporary native women artists that s currently at the wheelwright museum and may be traveling down here so we have a lot of exhibits planned we re kind of going to start slowly on our public events so we won t be having a big grand opening occasion this week we want to make sure it s safe before we invite large crowds of people into the museum so probably in early november is when we re thinking we ll do a big lecture around the brazil exhibit but that s not solidified yet our other big fall event of the year is a navajo rug auction which takes place the third saturday in november out at santa ana pueblo at the prairie star restaurant wine bar in bernalillo and then we work with a trading post in arizona the burnham trading post that brings down textiles from weavers and markets them sells them there the weavers get 80 of the money which is great because as you can imagine native artisans have really suffered during the pandemic and we make a little bit of money it s really fun they usually bring a couple hundred textiles and other artifacts and it s an auction so if folks haven t been to auctions those are fun to go to so that s kind of what we re doing we have a pretty full schedule of exhibits planned for the next two years that will roll out every few months we re also going to begin planning for renovating our two ancestors and people of the southwest exhibits which have been both up for a number of decades now and are due for an overhaul so we re going to be busy we are offering a free student membership program from when we open to the end of the month the first 75 students that come in will get a free membership in the maxwell museum and that will include special invitations to all our events but also some behind the scenes tours of the collections we d love students to become members of the museum members get a 20 discount in our gift shop if you haven t been we have a very nice gift shop which may be open on tuesday we re in the final stages of doing some upgrades to the gift shop so our goal is to have it fully open enjoy what you re reading get content from the daily lobo delivered to your inbox subscribe q how does your staff feel working with the university s covid 19 regulations and during the pandemic overall cs i think we did not open as early as some museums did around the state because we were concerned about keeping everyone safe we re a fairly small space but i think everyone is feeling comfortable with the mask regulations we certainly support that and i can speak for myself and i think for all the staff that we were very pleased when vaccines were mandated on campus we are committed to keeping our visitors safe we host a lot of k 12 classes including students who are too young to be vaccinated so it s a high priority for us to be sure that everyone follows safety regulations and guidelines q do you have any current collections or future collections that particularly stand out to you cs we recently received an archeological collection from a site called treasure hill which is a mimbres period archeological site down near silver city and it is a very important collection because it comes from the work of an archeologist named laverne harrington who owned the site and protected it from looting for many decades and carefully documented the materials and she has passed the collection onto the university of new mexico and the maxwell to be held in trust and cared for properly that s an exciting one we re going to begin processing this year working with volunteers and perhaps students to catalog it and organize it and get it in good shape we recently have also accepted a collection of native american baskets that was just brought in we ve had a lot of interest in donors finding homes for their collections this year i think as people are taking stock of their lives and their possessions during the pandemic a lot of people have reached out to us we haven t been able to accept many things we make sure the collections we accept are legally owned and ethically excavated and recovered and fit the mission of the museum so we turn down a lot of very generous offers as well but we ll be working on those collections and working on some of our central american textile collections too this year so there s always stuff to do here q do you have anything else you d like to tell the community cs i d like to tell the community just how excited we are to welcome people back to the museum i think i said in some email i sent out to our members that i ve spent a lot of hours wandering around the museum while we ve been closed and looking at the objects enjoying the collections and it s not the same when other people aren t there enjoying it too so i think we re just excited to see what the year will bring and to once again be able to welcome people back

right now when americans overpay for prescription drugs too many pharmaceutical companies don t use the profit nearly enough to innovate or research too many companies use it on buying back their stock inflate their worth drive up ceo s salaries and compensation and find ways to box out the competition president biden in remarks on prescription drugs aug 12 americans often complain about the cost of prescription drugs and politicians have responded with plans to put pressure on drug manufacturers in a speech that outlined his push to have the government directly negotiate the price of some drugs available through medicare president biden made a number of claims about the pharmaceutical industry some which are lacking context here s a guide to some of the president s statements we had previously examined a misleading pharmaceutical industry ad knocking proposed legislation in congress advertisement it s worth noting that although the overall cost of drugs spiked in the mid 2010s price increases have moderated in recent years according to the congressional research service prescription drug spending is forecast to remain at about 9 percent of national health care spending through 2028 down slightly from a previous average of about 10 percent of health care spending the key problem according to one 2020 study is that certain specialty drugs which can cost tens of thousands of dollars are a small percentage of total prescriptions but can account for almost 40 percent of retail and mail order prescription drug spending we pay the highest prescription drug costs of any developed nation in the world let me say that again of any developed nation in the world about two to three times what other countries pay biden appears to be referring to a 2021 rand corp study that compared u s prices for drugs with 32 other countries and concluded that u s prices were 256 percent of those in other countries but it s difficult to make such comparisons because the pricing mechanisms work differently as the study acknowledged advertisement in the united states pharmaceutical companies negotiate rebates and discounts with pharmacies health plans and the u s government rand did not have access to those numbers so it relied on the much higher invoice price although prices net of rebates and other discounts paid by manufacturers after drugs are dispensed are particularly relevant in the united states these prices are generally not available to researchers the study said rand came up with an average rebate to address this issue which reduced the disparity between the united states and other countries somewhat but the rebates could be substantially higher for some drugs although we applied an estimated adjustment to u s prices to approximate rebates and other discounts applied to manufacturer prices as one of our sensitivity analyses we recognize that the resulting prices will almost certainly differ from the actual net prices to payers for individual presentations rand said advertisement the pharmaceutical industry argues that americans get access to new drugs faster because prices have not been lowered by government fiat there s no easy way to put a price tag on that so that is another limitation of such international comparisons other studies noted the relatively quicker approval and uptake of newer typically more expensive drugs and presentations in the united states compared with other countries rand acknowledged our study does not address the trade offs between higher prices and earlier access to new drugs during our conversation she pulled out a vial of insulin from her bag in 2001 she said that single vial cost 32 a bottle today that exact same bottle with the same exact formula no changes costs 280 per bottle biden relies on an anecdote here from a woman named gail in denver but the price increase appears higher than the increases documented in the industry still it s an important issue a 2018 study estimates that care for people with diabetes accounts for 1 in 4 health care dollars in the united states new insulin products are often big contributors to higher prices but note that biden said gail was relying on the same exact formula over 20 years advertisement a recent investigation by the senate finance committee found that manufacturers have high list prices but then compete by offering large rebates to pharmacy benefit managers pbms companies that manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurance companies so the net price may actually decrease share this article share insulin manufacturers compete fiercely using rebates as bargaining chips to receive preferred formulary placement for their products and to block competition the companies undertake these bidding wars to maximize revenue and capture or maintain market share the senate finance committee report said pbms appeared to be complicit in this behavior there appeared to be little if any attempt by pbms to discourage manufacturers from increasing the list price of their products instead the committee found that pbms used their size and aggressive negotiating tactics such as the threat of excluding drugs from formularies to extract more generous rebates discounts and fees from insulin manufacturers right now when a drug company seeks permission from the fda the food and drug administration for a certain drug to get a patent it s allowed the patent it s allowed to exclusively sell that drug without competition for up to 12 years advertisement biden s point here is a bit garbled a patent lasts 20 years but it can take many years before a drug is formally approved by the food and drug administration eating up years of that twenty year period once the drug is approved there is an exclusivity period that can in certain circumstances add up to 12 years but that does not mean the drug does not have competition most new medicines still face competition from similar drugs made by other companies or even generics helping to push prices down even during that exclusivity period according to the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma avalere a health consulting firm found that in 2019 less than 1 percent of medicare part d prescription drug spending was spent on a single brand drug that was the only product in its therapeutic class another 8 percent was spent on single brand drugs that faced competition from another brand drug while single source brand drugs accounted for a significant share of 2019 part d spending the vast majority of single source brand drug spending was in usp classes that included other generic or brand drugs avalere says advertisement according to one study from 2016 to 2020 pharmaceutical companies spent 577 billion in stock buybacks and dividends 56 billion more than what they spent on all research and development over that same period of time biden is referring accurately to a house oversight committee report that examined the research and development spending of 14 drug companies between 2016 and 2020 but note that the figures include dividends many established publicly traded companies pay dividends to shareholders and there s nothing wrong about that stock buybacks are a more questionable practice because that is leftover cash that could perhaps be invested on something else rather than bolstering the share prices fewer shares generally means higher stock prices when you remove the dividends from the calculations the report shows that the drug companies spent 522 billion on research and development far more than the 219 billion spent on stock buybacks advertisement a common way to measure a company s investment in research and development is as a percentage of revenue the health care industry routinely is at or near the top of industries that invest in research and development with drug companies frequently leading the way among the companies in the standard poor s 100 the top three companies on the list are all pharmaceutical companies celgene bristol myers squibb and merck co spending 45 percent 31 percent and 25 percent of revenue on r d respectively and each of them

sitting in plush chairs in a discreet little corner at the capital club in dubai i felt like i was listening to the script of a hollywood movie sat opposite to me was dubai based businessman dariush soudi whose personal journey so far has all the ingredients that make for a typical blockbuster a tough early childhood in iran being bullied in school in england because of his dyslexia and accent which only toughened his resolve to succeed setting up a successful business in the uk attacked at knife point within his own house with his children thankfully behind closed doors in their rooms the trauma causing a life threatening heart attack arriving in a new country the uae with no money to start life anew at 44 surviving on two cups of coffee and a doughnut every day for six months and the journey back to becoming a prosperous entrepreneur no i did not make up any of that talking animatedly with a smile on his face soudi who regularly posts inspirational messages on social media addressing his audience as gladiators says he realised the fragility of life very early on which has made him take risks that not many can easily shoulder i am quite comfortable with taking risks because what s the worst thing that could happen you could die right but that could happen anyway so you can only give it your best shot he says having resolved early on that he wanted the best in life soudi says he pursued that path towards gaining wealth and abundance hence although he lost all his fortune after his first entrepreneurial stint in the uk he was determined to find success once again this time in dubai i arrived in dubai with 750 in my pocket so the year before i was buying ferraris with cash and credit cards a year later aged 44 all i had was 750 just after ramadan in september 2009 before that everybody was talking about the success of dubai but after september we had the global financial crisis so people thought i was crazy the funny thing was that i didn t even know what i was going to do after i landed i thought about what i m good at and i m good at setting up businesses so i became a consultant before september 2009 everybody was making money and so they didn t need a consultant but as soon as the recession hit people needed some support so what was a really bad time for everybody else was a good time for me he reveals the process of establishing himself was no easy task soudi says there was a time when he survived on just two doughnuts and a coffee a day since that was all he could afford undeterred he slowly established his business and set up his company be unique group which has diversified operations in digital sales and marketing employee training and retention hospitality as well as recruitment the company also plans to expand operations into establishing event venues that can cater to huge audiences via video conferencing the first such space being set up in collaboration with a local conglomerate in dubai is expected to open before the end of this year but the business venture that is currently claiming the attention of the businessman is his cryptocurrency trading platform launched in 2020 it offers a range of cryptocurrency trading services including spot over the counter otc futures and margin trading products according to soudi between january and june 2021 the platform saw trading values reach over 1 2bn with the amount growing on a monthly basis from 272m in may to 458m in june we have great traders but the main reason it s been very successful is because we ve been really good at customer service if there are any problems we just help them straight away block by block the cryptocurrency market has gradually crept its way into the mainstream investment landscape with its value topping 2 trillion for the first time in april 2021 ahead of its rout in may this year tokens such as bitcoin and ethereum have been the stalwarts driving the ecosystem s growth although extreme volatility bitcoin went from roughly 24 000 in december 2020 to a record high of around 65 000 in april and dropped back to roughly 29 700 in july driven by comments from tesla boss elon musk and tightening restrictions in china has caused concerns among some investors in recent months but the fundamental technology driving the adoption of cryptocurrency blockchain is here to stay with government and private sector pioneers across the world understanding the benefits of using a digital decentralised public ledger of transactions that is reliable safe and transparent the progressive gcc states particularly the uae and bahrain have announced ambitious plans to accelerate the use of blockchain in their dealings as they transition towards innovation and knowledge driven economies the emirates blockchain strategy launched in 2018 aims to transform 50 per cent of government transactions into the blockchain platform by 2021 by adopting this technology the uae government expects to save dhs11bn in transactions and documents processed routinely 398 million printed documents annually and 77 million work hours annually meanwhile the uae kyc blockchain platform set up in february 2020 by dubai economy in partnership with member banks is a national ecosystem for the exchange of verified know your customer data between licensing authorities and financial institutions in may dubai based freezone dmcc also launched its new crypto centre to support businesses operating in the cryptographic and blockchain sectors located in almas tower the dmcc crypto centre offers co working spaces for all types and sizes of crypto businesses including those developing blockchain enabled trading platforms to firms offering issuing listing and trading crypto assets a month later the bitcoin fund from canada listed on the nasdaq dubai exchange becoming the first of its kind to trade in the middle east as the region sees growing interest in the crypto space soudi is keen to leverage untapped opportunities with his new platform but according to him what makes it distinct from its peers is that the platform enables traders to become shareholders of the ecosystem and benefit from the generated revenues revolutionising returns we felt that we needed to have more of a unique opportunity to exponentially grow this platform so we decided to create our own tokens every time a person trades on the platform they actually get compensated in our tokens at the moment traders are just paying out commission to all the exchanges in the world in our case whatever they pay they get back in tokens as in shares in our platform so that will incentivise them to trade more explains soudi the tokens are valued at 10 cents each as part of the first phase of launch they are being offered at 2 5 cents with the price set to increase to 5 cents in stage two and 7 5 cents in stage three once the platform raises all the capital it requires 10m then the token s value will reach 10 cents with the market valuation post that set to be determined by trading volumes trading of the token will begin on the platform from september 1 unlike other exchanges every time you trade we give you tokens hence we are offering trading tokens it s never been done before so unlike other businesses where you see gradual growth we are looking at massive and fast growth because we are already of 1 2bn in six months elaborates soudi dividends to traders and investors will be paid out on a daily basis at the moment the platform has 40 000 registered traders primarily from far east europe and south america however soudi has his eyes set on this region as he strives towards a much more ambitious target i m hoping to get at least half a million traders there are 56 million traders on the planet we are looking for more traders but we don t want retail buy and hold type of traders we want hedge funds who have millions and trade on a daily basis we re looking for small investors who can help us grow with marketing so that we can just grow exponentially across the world the platform currently enables the trading of over 1 000 tokens with bitcoin predictably seeing the most movement followed by ethereum talking regulation a contentious topic that has come to the forefront in recent years is the lack of regulations governing the cryptocurrency space while some governments have started to provide regulatory frameworks and issue licences including the likes of abu dhabi global market adgm and the bahrain central bank soudi says they do not intend to apply for local licences we believe the future of finance will be decentralised finance defi and regulators around the world are trying to keep up with pace of development in the space to regulate it we are following their progress and determined to be compliant once any legal framework is released he stresses on its website the platform also clearly states our mission has much to do with the adoption of defi principles adds soudi the traders on our platform how the project should evolve so it s not in the hands of one or two people we are going to be a community owned exchange so everything is very transparent and everything is community led for the good of all the shareholders and stockholders looking ahead he projects that the value of the token will grow by 40 times in the next two years i see that we will go from 500m a month to 500m a day i ve been doing business for 35 years and i have never this kind of turnover it s just crazy soudi adds a different future one of the key lessons that the covid 19 pandemic has taught us is technology s ability to rapidly disrupt and transform the way we live and do business and with blockchain seeing strong adoption worldwide it s abilities to support economies and people is growing analysis by pwc late last year found that blockchain technology has the potential to boost global gross domestic product gdp by 1 76 trillion over the next decade the future of blockchain technology is very bright and i do believe i can use it to help the world we can provide wealth and spread wealth all over the world where briefly we were all contained by who we knew and what we knew within our borders now we can actually share wealth we have got know how and knowledge about wealth and all this information can now be shared and rewarded using blockchain technology so with this i can actually contribute to humanity and a better future says soudi focusing his attention on his crypto business will also afford soudi who regularly dons the hat of a motivational speaker more time to travel across the world on a personal level i can travel the world and do more lecturing motivating inspiring and educating and spend less time in the office running my bricks and mortar business it ll free me after 35 years of business to go and educate young entrepreneurs on how to make money and prosper they don t have to be one of the 80 per cent of companies that go down in the first year i did a talk some months ago and it s gone viral in america so the plan is to get back on stage again and educate the masses on abundance and prosperity his secret to success my journey has been one of relentless learning if you are constantly learning you will get to where you want to be

financial measures section of the accompanying management s discussion and analysis 2 please refer to supplemental table 4 production of the accompanying management s discussion and analysis for disclosure by product type message to shareholders commodity prices continued to strengthen through the second quarter as economies around the world began to reopen following the year long covid related lockdowns benchmark oil prices increased approximately 14 in q2 2021 compared to the previous quarter and european natural gas prices increased approximately 30 from the previous quarter driving an 11 increase in our quarterly revenue on production of 86 335 boe d which was up slightly from the previous quarter we generated 173 million of ffo in q2 2021 representing an increase of 7 over the previous quarter e d capital expenditures were 79 million in the quarter resulting in 94 million of fcf 1 and a payout ratio of 48 including reclamation and abandonment expenditures during the first half of 2021 we generated 172 million of fcf compared to negative 24 million in the first half of 2020 with the continued strength in commodity prices as reflected under current strip pricing we expect to generate significantly higher ffo during the second half of 2021 and now forecast annual fcf in excess of 400 million or over 2 50 per share for 2021 this significant improvement in fcf is not only due to higher commodity prices but is also the result of a more level loaded capital program compared to last year we continue to believe a level loaded capital program delivers more efficient operations and a more manageable production base some of the benefits from a level loaded capital program were evidenced during the second quarter as we realized a 20 reduction in our us drilling costs which is the result of a number of initiatives including executing the program in the spring versus winter and using an experienced drilling crew that worked on our canadian winter drilling campaign in q1 2021 the majority of fcf generated in the quarter was used to reduce our revolving credit facility over the past year we have reduced the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility by 326 million or 19 net debt at the end of q2 2021 was relatively unchanged from the previous quarter at 2 billion mainly due to an increase in derivative liabilities associated with higher commodity prices however our net debt to four quarter trailing ffo ratio improved to 3 4x from 4 0x in the previous quarter while this is still well above our comfort level it is a step in the right direction and moves us closer to our ultimate leverage target of 1 5x or lower we have made solid progress during the first half of 2021 with our production and fcf results exceeding budget expectations as we move through the second half of 2021 we will remain disciplined in our strategy with a continued focus on improving operational efficiencies and reducing debt production levels averaged in excess 86 300 boe d in 1h 2021 but are expected to moderate in 2h 2021 due to planned maintenance across several of our operating jurisdictions including extended turnarounds in ireland and australia our 2021 production guidance of 83 000 to 85 000 boe d remains intact and our e d capital budget remains unchanged at 300 million however we may still consider adding up to 50 million of incremental capital in q4 2021 if commodity prices remain supportive we have several projects lined up and ready to execute should we decide to invest incremental capital in q4 2021 however any new production associated with these projects would not contribute to 2021 volumes as we look to 2022 and start working through our budgeting process over the coming months it is our intent to remain financially disciplined and manage towards a similar production range as 2021 with a continued focus on striking the right balance between allocating fcf to the balance sheet and asset base we aim to achieve this through a combination of organic capital development and strategic acquisitions if and when the right opportunities become available as we have stated previously our long term goal is to return to a dividend paying capital markets model and we believe this balanced approach is the most appropriate way to achieve this we will continue to focus on debt reduction in the near term and once we are comfortable with our leverage ratio we will consider returning capital to our shareholders through the re instatement of a dividend as we believe the fcf capability of our asset base is supportive of the dividend capital markets model q2 2021 operations review north america production from our north american assets averaged 58 354 in q2 2021 an increase of 3 from the prior quarter primarily as a result of new production added from q1 2021 canadian drilling program during the second quarter we drilled one 0 2 net well and brought two 1 7 net condensate rich mannville natural gas wells on production in west central alberta and initiated our drilling campaign in south east saskatchewan where we drilled eight 6 9 net wells and completed six 5 4 net wells five 4 4 net of these wells were brought on production during the quarter with the remaining wells to be brought on production in q3 2021 in the united states we moved one of our experienced drilling crews from our canadian operations to wyoming and commenced our four 4 0 net well drilling program in april centered on turner horizontal wells in the powder river basin two of the wells were completed and brought on production in the quarter and are performing as expected the remaining two wells are expected to be completed and brought on production in q3 2021 drilling costs on this program were reduced by 20 compared to budget international production from our international assets averaged 27 981 in q2 2021 a decrease of 5 from the prior quarter primarily due to natural declines and downtime in ireland and australia in europe we drilled one 1 0 net natural gas well in the netherlands and continued our workover programs in france netherlands and germany in the netherlands we successfully drilled the nijega well 1 0 net which encountered a 16 meter gas column in the rotliegend slochteren formation and multiple thin sands with reservoir potential in the rotliegend ten boer formation the well was completed at the end of june 2021 and we expect to bring it on production in q3 2021 subsequent to q2 2021 we began inline testing of the rotliegend formation on the blesdijke natural gas well 0 5 net drilled in q1 2021 and achieved initial rates up to 7 0 mmcf d we plan on conducting further testing in q3 2021 and expect to bring the well onstream later in the year in germany we had strong operational performance and runtime across our operated and non operated assets and we continued to prepare for the start up of the burgmoor z5 well 46 working interest in q3 2021 in france our trucking operations in the paris basin continue to run smoothly following the transition of our paris basin oil production from pipeline delivery to trucking after the total grandpuits refinery ceased crude oil refining in q1 2021 the majority of the paris basin production is being delivered to the total le havre refinery in northwest france and to our parentis facility which delivers crude to various refineries in europe through the ambes terminal in southwest france additionally we started trucking some volumes to a refinery in germany and will continue to evaluate other shipping options to further optimize operations and reduce costs in central and eastern europe cee we successfully completed our 3 d seismic program in the sa 10 block in croatia with an additional seismic program planned for the sa 07 block later this year which will further enhance our knowledge of the region prior to our next drilling program planned for 2022 work is continuing to progress on the croatian gas plant on the sa 10 block in preparation for the tie in of the two successful gas wells drilled previously in ireland one of the 6 producing sub sea wells was offline for approximately 40 days during q2 2021 due to a stuck choke valve the valve has been replaced and the well was brought back on production at the end of june 2021 we continued to make preparations for the 21 day turnaround at corrib scheduled in q3 2021 in australia we had a 4 day shutdown in q2 2021 due to a vessel cleanout and we continue to plan for a 20 day scheduled turnaround in the second half of 2021 commodity

hong kong aug 16 2021 acn newswire according to the notice regarding the memorandum of understanding for capital and business alliance with shanghai lingkang consulting co ltd dated 21 june 2021 quantum solutions co ltd hereinafter referred to as the company signed a memorandum of understanding with shanghai lingkang consulting co ltd hereinafter referred to as lingkang in relation a business alliance including capital investment in the electric vehicle hereinafter referred to as ev sector in addition according to notice regarding the start of new business and capital and business alliance with fomm corporation dated 12 july 2021 the company announced that subject to approval by the board of directors of fomm corporation hereinafter referred to as fomm a japanese company the company

communications and ai the company is still discussing with lingkang and fomm the details of the respective capital and business alliances the company has not at this stage yet confirmed whether to cooperate with lingkang or fomm in any such alliance however it is the company s intention to develop and focus on the ev sector as the core business in china the reasons shift include 1 development of ev is a significant global trend take up of evs is expected to gradually replace the oil era of the past century plus and become mainstream in the next 30 to 50 years 2 japan s ev industry has been developing at a slow pace lagging behind that of china the united states and europe for nearly two to three years however the company believes that japan s ev industry will catch up with those countries in the next few years 3 there is currently no influential listed electric vehicle company in japan s capital market in stark contrast to the us and china s capital markets tesla from the us and byd from china have market capitalisations of more than us 100 million and us 150 billion respectively in addition there are many other listed ev companies in the us and china and their market capitalisations have already reached very high levels in the future as the awareness of the ev market increases the ev business is expected to become an important highlight in the japanese capital market 4 from the perspective of rapid emergence evs and autonomous driving the trend of intelligent ev internet and the overall development of the ev industry the demand for evs is expected to be very high 5 while fomm is a japanese electric vehicle brand the current japanese electric vehicle market is not mature therefore at this stage of development it is more practical to quickly enter a mature market to grow the company within a short period therefore the short term development strategy is to enter the chinese electric vehicle market generally regarded as the world s factory with the world s most compete industrial supply chain to produce automobiles more than 50 of global auto parts manufacturing is related to china in addition most of the world s major auto parts companies have invested in china therefore considering the stable auto parts supply and obvious cost reduction through elimination of import transportation fees and tariffs it is beneficial to set up production facilities in china in addition apart from the advantages stated above the chinese government has implemented favourable policies for the ev business and china is the largest market in the world when mass production starts in china the evs can be exported to other countries from the perspective of revenue generation setting up production facilities in china offers considerable benefits in summary the company plans to focus on ev development and its production in china the company s ev business will be developed in the general direction outlined below 1 short term strategy through mass production in china the company aims to reduce the selling price to less than 60 of current prices 2 mid term strategy focusing on japanese branded made in china small electric vehicles for small towns and rural areas of china 3 long term strategy many large internet companies in china have announced plans to enter the ev market the ev market in china is expected to be completely internet

kansas city mo there are plenty of places to turn for accurate information about covid 19 your physician local health departments the u s centers for disease control but not perhaps your local government s public comment session during a meeting of the st louis county council earlier this month opponents of a possible mask mandate made so many misleading comments about masks vaccines and covid 19 that youtube removed the video for violating its policies against false claims about the virus i hope no one is making any medical decisions based on what they hear at our public forums said county councilwoman lisa clancy who supports mask wearing and said she believes most of her constituents do too the video was restored but clancy s worries about the impact of that misinformation remain videos of local government meetings have emerged as the latest vector of covid 19 misinformation broadcasting misleading claims about masks and vaccines to millions and creating new challenges for internet platforms trying to balance the potential harm against the need for government openness the latest video to go viral features a local physician who made several misleading claims about covid 19 while addressing the mount vernon community school corporation in fortville indiana on aug 6 in his 6 minute remarks dr dan stock tells the board that masks don t work vaccines don t prevent infection and state and federal health officials don t follow the science the video has amassed tens of millions of online views and prompted the indiana state department of health to push back stock did not return multiple messages seeking comment here comes a doctor in suspenders who goes in front of the school board and basically says what some people are thinking the masks are b s vaccines don t work and the cdc is lying it can be very compelling to laypeople said dr zubin damania a california physician who received so many messages about the indiana clip that he created his own video debunking stock s claims damania hosts a popular online medical show under the name zdoggmd his video debunking stock s comments has been viewed more than 400 000 times so far he said that while there are legitimate questions about the effectiveness of mask requirements for children stock s broad criticism of masks and vaccines went too far youtube removed several similar videos of local government meetings in north carolina missouri kansas and washington state in bellingham washington officials responded by temporarily suspending public comment sessions the false claims in those videos were made during the portion of the meeting devoted to public comment local officials have no control over what is said at these forums and say that s part of the point in kansas youtube pulled video of the may school board meeting in the 27 000 student shawnee mission district in which parents and a state lawmaker called for the district to remove its mask mandate citing medical misinformation the district where a mask mandate remains in effect responded by ending livestreaming of the public comment period district spokesman david smith acknowledged that it has been challenging to balance making the board meetings accessible and not spreading fallacies it was hard for me to hear things in the board meeting that weren t true and to know that those were going out without contradiction smith said i am all about free speech but when that free speech endangers people s lives it is hard to sit through that after hearing from local officials youtube reversed its decision and put the videos back up earlier this month the company which is owned by google announced a change to its covid misinformation policy to allow exceptions for local government meetings though youtube may still remove content that uses remarks from public forums in an attempt to mislead while we have clear policies to remove harmful covid 19 misinformation we also recognize the importance of organizations like school districts and city councils using youtube to share recordings of open public forums even when comments at those forums may violate our policies company spokeswoman elena hernandez said the deluge of false claims about the virus has challenged other platforms too twitter and facebook each have their own policies on covid 19 misinformation and say that like youtube they attach labels to misleading content and remove the worst of it public comment sessions preceding local government meetings have long been known for sometimes colorful remarks from local residents but before the internet if someone were to drone on about fluoride in the drinking water for instance their comments weren t likely to become national news now thanks to the internet and social media the misleading musings of a local doctor speaking before a school board can compete for attention with the recommendations of the cdc it was only a matter of time before misleading comments at these local public forums went viral according to jennifer grygiel a communications professor at syracuse university who studies social media platforms grygiel suggested a few possible ways to minimize the impact of misinformation without muzzling local governments grygiel said clear labels on government broadcasts would help viewers understand what they re watching keeping the video on the government s website instead of making it shareable on youtube could allow local residents to watch without enabling the spread of videos more widely anytime there is a public arena a city council hearing a school board meeting a public park the public has the opportunity to potentially spread misinformation grygiel said what s changed is it used to stay local
amid the rising tide of infections across the united states dominated by the highly transmissible delta variant dr michael osterholm director of the center for infectious disease research and policy cidrap at the university of minnesota provided sobering remarks on the state of the pandemic on sunday osterholm was interviewed on nbc s meet the press program in response to a question from host chuck todd about the centers for disease control and prevention s cdc guidance for children under the age of 12 in light of rapidly rising infections and hospitalizations in this group osterholm stated i do believe we need to rethink it the data we have used to come up with recommendations for opening our schools is really from pre alpha this is a different virus in the sense it s much more infectious osterholm noted that though 50 percent of the country is fully vaccinated 90 million people who could have received the vaccine remain unvaccinated indicating that a substantial number of people remain vulnerable to the full impact of the virus add to this the fact that 48 million us children under the age of 12 are not eligible for the covid 19 vaccines and you have a situation where the virus has free rein to infect a large swath of the population and ample opportunities to mutate he explained that unlike with previous variants many infected people have acquired the delta variant during outdoor activities he said i would point out the other thing that helps you understand the infectiousness of this virus is the fact that we re now seeing more and more events with outdoor air you know months ago we were saying if you re outdoors you re pretty safe we have had a number of events happening where in fact people crowded together outdoors get infected now if that s happening outdoors imagine what happens to our kids when they re closely together in schools at this point we need to put everything we can towards controlling this virus over the weekend officials in lancaster county south carolina confirmed that a 16 year old had died from covid 19 this tragedy came on the heels of the largest school district in the state pausing in person school just nine days after the beginning of the school year due to several staff members and a student requiring hospitalization for covid 19 currently 142 students in the district have tested positive for the coronavirus the previous peak was 85 in january 2021 ware county georgia school district officials told the press that they had closed 11 of their schools for at least two weeks after an outbreak of covid 19 tore through their campuses a total of 76 students tested positive while 679 were placed in quarantine for possible exposure at least 67 staff had also tested positive and another 150 were likewise in quarantine those infected or in quarantine account for 13 percent of the student body and 23 percent of the faculty the closures came less than two weeks after school opened on august 4 dr osterholm noted that an important issue is the quality of the masks that are being used in addition to non compliance with masking the use of relatively ineffective cloth masks to combat a virus that is spread through the air is extremely problematic we ve not paid any attention really to giving the public the message that you need much more effective masking he said such as the n95 mask that we talk about or the kn95 for kids yet many state officials are fighting to ban even the limited protections such measures could offer the situation in texas is perhaps most emblematic of these dangers texas republican governor greg abbott and attorney general ken paxton are at war with municipal governments in several big metropolitan areas which are resisting their efforts to ban mask mandates meanwhile dallas county judge clay jenkins issued a dire warning over the weekend that there were zero icu beds left for children that means he said if your child is in a car wreck if your child has a congenital heart defect or something and needs an icu bed or more likely if they have covid and need an icu bed we don t have one your child will wait for another child to die your child will just not get on the ventilator your child will be careflighted to temple or oklahoma city or wherever we can find them a bed but they won t be getting one here unless one clears in his opening remarks osterholm provided important insights into the ominous state of the pandemic which compounds the dangers involved in reopening the schools he explained when you look inside this wave it s actually a series of different events going on first of all we have the southern sun belt states that we all know are basically at really dramatic case increases if you look at the state of louisiana right now they re tied with the country of georgia for the highest rate of infections in the world he continued but what we re seeing happen right now is while those states are starting to level off a bit we re now seeing in the southeast georgia south carolina north carolina kentucky tennessee southern illinois all start to take off we re seeing it in the northwest states like oregon and washington we re even seeing in the midwest increases he pointed out that the dramatic increase in covid 19 hospitalizations nationwide to 83 000 today driven mainly by the southern sun belt states compares to some 25 000 a month ago it gives you a sense of what s happened just in the last month and if these other states take off then the surge could sustain itself for at least another four to six weeks the cdc recently reported that the delta variant now accounts for more than 97 percent of all infections throughout the country in contrast the alpha and gamma variants have all but disappeared highlighting the aggressive nature of this new strain which has displaced all other versions of the virus in three short months according to the new york times covid tracker the average number of daily new cases has reached nearly 130 000 a 65 percent increase from two weeks ago deaths from covid 19 which lags infections have reached an average of 655 per day more than 4 500 per week an increase of 113 percent from two weeks prior children are being hospitalized across the country at higher rates than ever before and with more severe illnesses linda young a seasoned respiratory therapist with 37 years of experience told the washington post i have never seen anything like this even young healthy children without any underlying conditions are falling ill child hospitalization rates are soaring having exceeded the winter peaks by more than 20 percent and climbing the american academy of pediatrics which has been consistently providing critical updates noted approximately 12 000 covid 19 cases in the us in the first week of july among children 17 years old or younger that number climbed to 96 000 in the first week of august an eight fold increase these cases represent 15 percent of all new infections which implies that children are becoming a larger share of all covid 19 cases than at any previous time during the pandemic on saturday the number of children hospitalized for covid 19 in the country reached a new high of more than 1 900 additionally in the first week of august 310 children were admitted a rate of 44 per day now with many more schools being readied to accept students the lives of children their families and communities will be dramatically and tragically impacted this includes the health care sector which is once more facing a surge of cases that is driving hospital bed occupancy to overcapacity osterholm s assessment has significant implications as state after state prepares to resume in class instructions regardless of these rising trajectories throughout the pandemic politicians and state and local officials have attempted to dismiss the role children have played in perpetuating the pandemic while downplaying the infection s impact on children these assertions are no longer sustainable but that has not halted the reckless and criminal drive to reopen the schools dr osterholm stopped short of calling for workplace lockdowns and school closures as he previously did during the winter surge still his warnings paint a bleak picture of events for the next few months if such measures are not quickly adopted and implemented his assessment provides a clear but stark warning about what must be done to avert the impending disaster under these conditions the insistence of the teachers unions on reopening the schools is nothing short of criminal both american federation of teachers president randi weingarten and national education association president becky pringle have in recent days reiterated their demand that educators other school workers and students be herded into unsafe schools so that their parents can return to unsafe jobs to resume pumping out profits for the corporate elite not even the lives of defenseless children are to be spared in the mania to keep stock prices rising and ruling class wealth increasing and the so called unions serve as the enforcers of this policy of social murder this policy of mass death must be stopped the socialist equality party calls on educators parents and all workers to form rank and file committees to coordinate a national and international struggle to stop the reopening of the schools provide full income support to all workers impacted and demand full funding for remote learning until the pandemic is contained
this story was originally published by propublica sign up for their big story newsletter here in november 2017 with the administration of president donald trump rushing to get a massive tax overhaul through congress sen ron johnson stunned his colleagues by announcing he would vote no making the rounds on cable tv the wisconsin republican became the first gop senator to declare his opposition spooking senate leaders who were pushing to quickly pass the tax bill with their thin majority if they can pass it without me let them johnson declared johnson s demand was simple in exchange for his vote the bill must sweeten the tax break for a class of companies that are known as pass throughs since profits pass through to their owners johnson praised such companies as engines of innovation behind the scenes the senator pressed top treasury department officials on the issue emails and the officials calendars show within two weeks johnson s ultimatum produced results trump personally called the senator to beg for his support and the bill s authors fattened the tax cut for these businesses johnson flipped to a yes and claimed credit for the change the bill passed the trump administration championed the pass through provision as tax relief for small businesses confidential tax records however reveal that johnson s last minute maneuver benefited two families more than almost any others in the country both worth billions and both among the senator s biggest donors dick and liz uihlein of packaging giant uline along with roofing magnate diane hendricks together had contributed around 20 million to groups backing johnson s 2016 reelection campaign the expanded tax break johnson muscled through netted them 215 million in deductions in 2018 alone drastically reducing the income they owed taxes on at that rate the cut could deliver more than half a billion in tax savings for hendricks and the uihleins over its eight year life but the tax break did more than just give a lucrative and legal perk to johnson s donors in the first year after trump signed the legislation just 82 ultrawealthy households collectively walked away with more than 1 billion in total savings an analysis of confidential tax records shows republican and democratic tycoons alike saw their tax bills chopped by tens of millions among them media magnate and former democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg the bechtel family owners of the engineering firm that bears their name and the heirs of the late houston pipeline billionaire dan duncan usually the scale of the riches doled out by opaque tax legislation and the beneficiaries remain shielded from the public but propublica has obtained a trove of irs records covering thousands of the wealthiest americans the records have enabled reporters this year to explore the diverse menu of options the tax code affords the ultrawealthy to avoid paying taxes the drafting of the trump law offers a unique opportunity to examine how the billionaire class is able to shape the code to its advantage building in new ways to sidestep taxes the tax cuts and jobs act was the biggest rewrite of the code in decades and arguably the most consequential legislative achievement of the one term president crafted largely in secret by a handful of trump administration officials and members of congress the bill was rushed through the legislative process as draft language of the bill made its way through congress lawmakers friendly to billionaires and their lobbyists were able to nip and tuck and stretch the bill to accommodate a variety of special groups the flurry of midnight deals and last minute insertions of language resulted in a vast redistribution of wealth into the pockets of a select set of families siphoning away billions in tax revenue from the nation s coffers this story is based on lobbying and campaign finance disclosures treasury department emails and calendars obtained through a freedom of information act lawsuit and confidential tax records for those who benefited from the bill s modifications the collective millions spent on campaign donations and lobbying were minuscule compared with locking in years of enormous tax savings a spokesperson for the uihleins declined to comment representatives for hendricks didn t respond to questions in response to emailed questions johnson did not address whether he had discussed the expanded tax break with hendricks or the uihleins instead he wrote in a statement that his advocacy was driven by his belief that the tax code needs to be simplified and rationalized my support for pass through entities that represent over 90 of all businesses was guided by the necessity to keep them competitive with c corporations and had nothing to do with any donor or discussions with them he wrote by the summer of 2017 it was clear that trump s first major legislative initiative to repeal and replace obamacare had gone up in flames taking a marquee campaign promise with it looking for a win the administration turned to tax reform getting closer and closer on the tax cut bill shaping up even better than projected trump tweeted house and senate working very hard and smart end result will be not only important but special at the top of the republican wishlist was a deep tax cut for corporations there was little doubt that such a cut would make it into the final legislation but because of the complexity of the tax code slashing the corporate tax rate doesn t actually affect most u s businesses corporate taxes are paid by what are known in tax lingo as c corporations which include large publicly traded firms like at t or coca cola most businesses in the united states aren t c corporations they re pass throughs the name comes from the fact that when one of these businesses makes money the profits are not subject to corporate taxes instead they pass through directly to the owners who pay taxes on the profits on their personal returns unlike major shareholders in companies like amazon who can avoid taking income by not selling their stock owners of successful pass throughs typically can t avoid it pass throughs include the full gamut of american business from small barbershops to law firms to in the case of uline a packaging distributor with thousands of employees so alongside the corporate rate cut for the at ts of the world the trump tax bill included a separate tax break for pass through companies for budgetary reasons the tax break is not permanent sunsetting after eight years proponents touted it as boosting small business and main street and it s true that many small businesses got a modest tax break but a recent study by treasury economists found that the top 1 of americans by income have reaped nearly 60 of the billions in tax savings created by the provision and most of that amount went to the top 0 1 that s because even though there are many small pass through businesses most of the pass through profits in the country flow to the wealthy owners of a limited group of large companies tax records show that in 2018 bloomberg whom forbes ranks as the 20th wealthiest person in the world got the largest known deduction from the new provision slashing his tax bill by nearly 68 million when he briefly ran for president in 2020 bloomberg s tax plan proposed ending the deduction though his plan was generally friendlier to the wealthy than those of his rivals a spokesperson for bloomberg declined to comment johnson s intervention in november 2017 was designed to boost the bill s already generous tax break for pass through companies the bill had allowed for business owners to deduct up to 17 4 of their profits thanks to johnson holding out that figure was ultimately boosted to 20 that might seem like a small increase but even a few extra percentage points can translate into tens of millions of dollars in extra deductions in one year alone for an ultrawealthy family the mechanics are complicated but for the rich it generally means that a business owner gets to keep an extra 7 cents on every dollar of profit to understand the windfall take the case of the uihlein family dick the great grandson of a beer magnate and his wife liz own and operate packaging giant uline the logo of the pleasant prairie wisconsin firm is stamped on the bottom of countless paper bags uline produced nearly 1 billion in profits in 2018 according to propublica s analysis of tax records dick and liz uihlein who own a majority of the company reported more than 700 million in income that year but they were able to slash what they owed the irs with a 118 million deduction generated by the new tax break liz uihlein who serves as president of uline has criticized high taxes in her company newsletter the year before the tax overhaul the couple gave generously to support trump s 2016 presidential campaign that same year when johnson faced long odds in his reelection bid against former sen russ feingold the uihleins gave more than 8 million to a series of political committees that blanketed the state with pro johnson and anti feingold ads that blitz led the milwaukee journal sentinel to dub the uihleins the koch brothers of wisconsin politics johnson s campaign also got a boost from hendricks wisconsin s richest woman and owner of roofing wholesaler abc supply co the beloit based billionaire has publicly pushed for tax breaks and said she wants to stop the u s from becoming a socialistic ideological nation hendricks has said johnson won her over after she grilled him at a brunch meeting six years earlier she gave about 12 million to a pair of political committees the reform america fund and the freedom partners action fund that bought ads attacking feingold in the first year of the pass through tax break hendricks got a 97 million deduction on income of 502 million by reducing the income she owed taxes on that deduction saved her around 36 million even after johnson won the expansion of the pass through break in late 2017 the final text of the tax overhaul wasn t settled a congressional conference committee had to iron out the differences between the senate and house versions of the bill sometime during this process eight words that had been in neither the house nor the senate bill were inserted applied without regard to the words engineering architecture with that wonky bit of legalese congress smiled on the bechtel clan the bechtels engineering and construction company is one of the largest and most politically connected private firms in the country with surgical precision the new language guaranteed the bechtels a massive tax cut in previous versions of the bill construction would have been given a tax break but engineering was one of the industries excluded from the pass through deduction for reasons that remain murky when the bill with its eight added words took effect in 2018 three great great grandchildren of the company s founder ceo brendan bechtel and his siblings darren and katherine together netted deductions of 111 million on 679 million in income tax records show and that s just one generation of bechtels the heirs father riley also holds a piece of the firm as does a group of nonfamily executives and board members in all bechtel corporation produced around 2 3 billion of profit in 2018 alone the vast majority of which appears to be eligible for the 20 deduction who wrote the phrase and which lawmaker inserted it has been a much discussed mystery in the tax policy world propublica found that a lobbyist who worked for both bechtel and an industry trade group has claimed credit for the alteration in the months leading up to the bill s passage in 2017 bechtel had executed a full court press in washington meeting with trump administration officials and spending more than 1 million lobbying on tax issues marc gerson of the washington law firm miller chevalier was paid to lobby on the tax bill by both bechtel and the american council of engineering companies of which bechtel is a member at a presentation for the trade group s members a few weeks after trump signed the bill into law gerson credited his efforts for the pass through tax break calling it a major legislative victory for the engineering industry gerson did not respond to a request for comment bechtel s push was part of a long history of lobbying for tax breaks by the company two decades ago it even hired a former irs commissioner as part of a successful bid to get engineering and architectural services included in one of president george w bush s tax cuts the company s lobbying on the trump tax bill and the tax break it received highlight a paradox at the core of bechtel the family has for years showered money on anti tax candidates even though as the new yorker s jane mayer has written bechtel owed almost its entire existence to government patronage most famous for being one of the companies that built the hoover dam in recent years it has bid on and won marquee federal projects among them a healthy share of the billions spent by american taxpayers to rebuild iraq after the war the firm recently moved its longtime headquarters from san francisco to reston virginia a hub for federal contractors just outside the beltway a spokesperson for bechtel corporation didn t respond to questions about the company s lobbying the spokesperson as well as a representative of the family s investment office didn t respond to requests to accept questions about the family s tax records brendan bechtel has emerged this year as a vocal critic of president joe biden s proposal to pay for new infrastructure with tax hikes it s unfair to ask business to shoulder or cover all the additional costs of this public infrastructure investment he said on a recent cnbc appearance as the landmark tax overhaul sped through the legislative process other prosperous groups of business owners worried they would be left out with the help of lobbyists and sometimes after direct contact with lawmakers they too were invited into what trump dubbed his big beautiful tax cut among the biggest winners during the final push were real estate developers the senate bill included a formula that restricted the size of the new deduction based on how much a pass through business paid in wages congressional republicans framed the provision as rewarding businesses that create jobs in effect it meant a highly profitable business with few employees like a real estate developer wouldn t be able to benefit much from the break developers weren t happy several marshaled lobbyists and prodded friendly lawmakers to turn things around at least two of them turned to johnson dear ron ted kellner a wisconsin developer and a colleague wrote in a letter to johnson i m concerned that the goal of a fair efficient and growth oriented tax overhaul will not be achieved especially for private real estate pass through entities johnson forwarded the letter from kellner a political donor of his to top republicans in the house and senate all yesterday i received this letter from very smart and successful businessmen in milwaukee adding that the legislation as it stood gave pass throughs widely disparate grossly unfair treatment house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady r texas responded with a promise to do more senator i strongly agree we should continue to improve the pass through provisions at every step you are a great champion for this congress is not subject to the freedom of information act but treasury officials were copied on the email exchange propublica obtained the exchange after suing the treasury department kellner got his wish in the final days of the legislative process real estate investors were given a side door to access the full deduction language was added to the final legislation that allowed them to qualify if they had a large portfolio of buildings even if they had small payrolls with that some of the richest real estate developers in the country were welcomed into the fold the tax records obtained by propublica show that one of the top real estate industry winners was donald bren sole owner of the southern california based irvine company and one of the wealthiest developers in the united states in 2018 alone bren personally enjoyed a deduction of 22 million because of the tax break bren s representatives did not respond to emails and calls from propublica his company had hired wes coulam a prominent washington lobbyist with ernst young to advocate for its interests as the bill was being hammered out before coulam became a lobbyist he worked on capitol hill as a tax policy adviser for utah sen orrin hatch hatch then the republican chair of the senate finance committee publicly took credit for the final draft of the new deduction amid questions about the real estate carveout hatch s representatives did not respond to questions from propublica about how the carveout was added propublica s records show that other big real estate winners include adam portnoy head of commercial real estate giant the rmr group who got a 14 million deduction in 2018 donald sterling the real estate developer and disgraced former owner of the los angeles clippers won an 11 million deduction representatives for portnoy and sterling did not respond to questions from propublica another gift to the real estate industry in the bill was a tax deduction of up to 20 on dividends from real estate investment trusts more commonly known as reits these companies are essentially bundles of various real estate assets which investors can buy chunks of reits make money by collecting rent from tenants and interest from loans used to finance real estate deals the tax cut for these investment vehicles was pushed by both the real estate roundtable a trade group for the entire industry and the national association of real estate investment trusts the latter a trade group specifically for reits spent more than 5 million lobbying in washington the year the tax bill was drafted more than it had in any year in its history steven roth the founder of vornado realty trust a prominent reit is a regular donor to both groups political committees roth had close ties to the trump administration including advising on infrastructure and doing business with jared kushner s family he became one of the biggest winners from the reit provision in the trump tax law roth earned more than 27 million in reit dividends in the two years after the bill passed potentially allowing him a tax deduction of about 5 million tax records show roth did not respond to requests for comment and his representatives did not accept questions from propublica on his behalf another carveout benefited investors of publicly traded pipeline businesses sen john cornyn a texas republican added an amendment for them to the senate version of the bill just before it was voted on without his amendment investors who made under a certain income would have received the deduction anyway experts told propublica but for higher income investors a slate of restrictions kicked in in order to qualify they would have needed the businesses they re invested in to pay out significant wages and these oil and gas businesses like real estate developers typically do not cornyn s amendment cleared the way the trade group for these companies and one of its top members enterprise products partners a houston based natural gas and crude oil pipeline company had both lobbied on the bill enterprise was founded by dan duncan who died in 2010 the trump tax bill delivered a win to duncan s heirs propublica s data shows his four children who own stakes in the company together claimed more than 150 million in deductions in 2018 alone the tax provision for small businesses had delivered a windfall to the family forbes ranked as the 11th richest in the country in a statement an enterprise spokesperson wrote the duncan family abides by all applicable tax laws and will not comment on individual tax returns which are a private matter cornyn s office did not respond to questions about the senator s amendment the tax break is due to expire after 2025 and a gulf has opened in congress about the future of the provision in july senate finance chair ron wyden d or proposed legislation that would end the tax cut early for the ultrawealthy in fact anyone making over 500 000 per year would no longer get the deduction but it would be extended to the business owners below that threshold who are currently excluded because of their industry the bill would make the policy more fair and less complex for middle class business owners while also raising billions for priorities like child care education and health care wyden said in a statement meanwhile dozens of trade groups including the chamber of commerce are pushing to make the pass through tax cut permanent this year a bipartisan bill called the main street tax certainty act was introduced in both houses of congress to do just that one of the bill s sponsors rep henry cuellar d texas pitched the legislation this way i am committed to delivering critical relief for our nation s small businesses and the communities they serve
nearly 100 000 electricity customers of dte energy in the greater detroit metropolitan area were still without power on sunday afternoon as the impact of heavy thunderstorms that began last wednesday dragged on into a fifth day exposing the crumbling infrastructure in the motor city while the energy monopoly is patting itself on the back for restoring power to 80 percent of those affected by the storms some customers in detroit and surrounding cities are being told that their electricity will not be back on until wednesday residential customers have been forced to dispose of spoiled food in their refrigerators and freezers while those fortunate enough to have generators are spending as much as 50 dollars per day for fuel to keep their lights on and critical appliances and sump pumps running for most there is no hot water and for some who depend on well pumps there is no water at all a statement from dte energy gave little comfort to those still without electricity we understand how hard it is to be without power especially with the repetition of strong storms that occurred from july 1 to august 11 the company said that it has deployed 3 000 line workers along with more than 1 200 from other states as far as new york louisiana and florida as well as canada in response to mounting public anger over the decrepit condition of the electricity infrastructure dte energy and consumers energy have offered in insulting one time 25 credit on an upcoming monthly electric bill customers must have been without power during state authorized catastrophic conditions for 120 hours or more in order to qualify for the credit a report in clickondetroit said 94 112 dte energy customers were without power as of 2 pm sunday due to the series of severe storms on wednesday night and thursday morning however the anger of the public toward the energy company and the government was evident in statements from readers posted in response to the article one reader wrote i want to know who s going to pay 4 days now and counting this time 11 days now in 6 weeks i m an understanding person but this is ridiculous and dte needs to be held accountable so they give you some garbage credit and then raise their rates not sufficient give me a whole house generator and diesel to put in it and compensation for all the lost food time damage while dte can t control the weather they are responsible for the terrible infrastructure and returning our power when it goes out in a timely fashion this goes beyond the weather and points to dte as negligent another posted many of us who lost power have a well for water so no power means no water no drinking water no showers no flushing toilets we learned real quickly firsthand to appreciate running water this week reporter bill laitner of the detroit free press went out of his way to try to present michigan s attorney general dana nessel as a fighter for the public against the energy corporations by demanding that they issue the 25 credits to customers impacted by the outages nessel has been on record deflecting attention away from the energy corporations and issuing consumer alerts to remind michigan residents to look out for scams saying bad actors are seeking to take advantage of people who need repairs of course she did not refer to the corporate bad actors who are responsible for the damage in the first place laitner also went on to apologize for the utility companies who are playing catch up on two key challenges for reducing outages tree trimming and improving the grid the system of wires poles and the equipment that feeds the wires the free press advanced a series of excuses for why it was unreasonable for the public to demand reliable electricity saying that having electric power that s always there or nearly always no matter the weather or chance of equipment failures is a huge challenge for both dte energy and consumers energy it went on to lament over how michigan s electric giants must boost reliability in an era of unprecedented change as they re pushed at the same time to revolutionize their power generation amid tightening environmental standards and to meet the swelling demands of electric cars and computers however companies like dte energy are enormously profitable and are vastly underfunding electrical infrastructure in announcing the company s record 2020 earnings last february dte energy president and ceo jerry norcia knew full well he was not telling the truth when he said we were able to continue investments in our infrastructure and improve reliability to ensure our customers receive the energy they need however norcia was being truthful when he said the company delivered for our investors as dte energy earned profits of 1 2 billion and 1 4 billon for stockholders in 2019 and 2020 respectively meanwhile norcia himself received a total compensation of 11 million a 29 percent increase over 2019 which included 5 6 million in stock awards there were six dte energy executives who received an average compensation package of 5 4 million or an aggregate total of 32 4 million as has been pointed out by energy experts and consumer advocates instead of moving the electric grid underground dte energy takes down old wooden poles and replaces them with new wooden poles that are continuously getting knocked down by high winds this is doubly shortsighted under conditions of accelerated climate change exposing that the priority of electricity monopolies is not the interests of society as a whole but the profit pressure from wall street the storms that triggered power outages also resulted in a series of floods in working class neighborhoods throughout the region due to infrastructure neglect residents of the western detroit suburb of dearborn heights reported that their streets were caked with raw sewage after the more than four feet of flood water finally receded the neighborhood is located near ecorse creek which has repeatedly overflowed in recent years and it has flooded the streets six times this summer new homes have been built too close to the creek while the regional water management problems have been neglected and drainage systems have not been cleaned due to lack of state and local funding
arkansas restaurateurs already contending with a resurgent pandemic are also wrestling with the challenge of inflation which is putting pressure on thin profit margins and has caused some to raise menu prices ken vaughan the vice president of the arkansas restaurant association and president of the purple cow chain said the cost of beef for his restaurants is up 40 to 60 david alan bubbus founder of david s burgers echoed vaughan putting the beef price increase at 50 vaughan said the price of pork has risen about 20 cheese about 30 eggs 40 poultry 20 and produce 10 25 it s been very challenging he said casey copeland is room chef of the quapaw kitchens at saracen casino resort in pine bluff formerly chef de cuisine at the oaklawn jockey club in hot springs and president of the arkansas restaurant association he said crab legs that used to cost 8 to 10 a pound now are priced at 15 to 18 a pound big corporations like walmart have all the buying power and bought up stocks when everybody was stuck at home so they could have crab legs at home so we re seeing a direct reflection of things like that in the market he said he added that he expected those prices to come down eventually commodity inflation is of course a nationwide phenomenon wholesale food prices in june were up 9 6 compared with the previous year according to a national restaurant association analysis of bureau of labor statistics data last month the bls reported that the cost to the consumer for food away from home rose 4 2 during the last year the largest 12 month increase in that index since the period ending in may 2009 what s behind the higher costs a number of interlocking factors tied to the covid 19 pandemic which wreaked havoc on supply chains and worker availability in addition to driving up food costs the worker shortage has been felt by restaurants directly leading to wage increases and putting further pressure on the bottom line purple cow for example increased worker pay about 30 david s burgers raised pay by about 25 bubbus said restaurants around the country have employed a number of strategies to address the issue including raising menu prices cutting portion sizes and simplifying menu offerings the chipotle chain for example increased menu prices in june by about 4 purple cow has raised menu prices about 3 5 vaughan said and bubbus said tuesday that david s burgers had just approved a 50 cent increase in its best selling menu item the no 1 combo which he expected to go into effect last week the price of the no 1 combo a burger fries and a drink had stood at 7 99 since the founding of david s burgers 11 years ago bubbus said the nine restaurant central arkansas chain plans to increase the price of each third pound burger by 50 cents we really value the business of families and so we work really hard to keep our prices low he said as the company has grown it s acquired more buying power bubbus said and that has been partially responsible for its ability to keep prices low we ve been able to decrease our cost of goods sold through our buying power so it s kind of offset inflation if you will but it s out of control now both in labor and in food costs copeland said quapaw kitchens had avoided raising menu prices but it has simplified the menu vaughan said purple cow which has five locations had also simplified its menu removing higher cost items that weren t selling particularly well another potential strategy to cut costs reducing portion size hadn t been deployed by the restaurateurs i talked with and in fact purple cow whose onion rings were voted the best by arkansas times readers increased the portion size of that item when the chain raised prices vaughan said the company also has focused on wasting less food for example instead of automatically placing hamburger setups tomato lettuce onion etc on the plate servers now ask customers what additions they d like to their burgers and provide just those anywhere we can find cents in terms of the dollars vaughan said bubbus thinks the high cost of food may be a short term problem but higher labor costs will be a long term issue vaughan told me that the vast majority of purple cow s customers had been understanding about the challenges facing restaurants i think the consumer has really been loyal to the local businesses and we ve been very grateful for that

there is increasing confusion in america about how to handle the rapid spread of covid s delta variant the stock market can usually tell us how much fear is out there but this time wall street seems if not quite clueless then certainly heedless the broad averages have moved steadily higher in recent weeks caused more by nervous short covering than by any particular bullishness there have been no dramatic surges only a steady ratcheting ascent that suggests an army of bears have been hard at it trying to get short at a major top the irony is if they would just relax bull mania would end overnight since the rally is drawing its punching power more from buyers driven by desperation than from any other source with or without them though a very important peak s not likely far off delta lockdown worries are bearing down on markets and nearing the red zone as state governors respond with increasingly onerous restrictions on 140 million americans who have not yet been vaccinated one upping deblasio here in florida there are signs that serious trouble could be brewing in the nation s school systems in palm beach county last week more than 400 students were quarantined just two days into the school year although most of them have not tested positive for covid contact tracing has put their school year in limbo unfortunately such turmoil could prove to be a mere squall in comparison to the gathering firestorm in big coastal cities in new york city for one deblasio announced last week that the un vaccinated would be barred from indoor dining gyms bars and other places not to be outdone california s true blue mayors have already one upped him with edicts that go even further to restrict movement and commerce as of friday los angeles reportedly was considering closing grocery stores and much else to the uninoculated it is predictable that san francisco and chicago will not let l a s quarantine challenge go unanswered things have not yet reached the level of hysteria but once the reaction to delta has run its course if it ever does we can expect many businesses that survived the first lockdown to close forever crazed investors may have contrived to take the first tsunami of business shutdowns in stride but reckless obliviousness may not yield such benign results this time if blowing an epic stock market bubble can be described as benign the giddy rally of 2021 was based in part on the delusion that as long as amazon google netflix microsoft and a few other category killers were doing well then so was america a spectacular bull market has reinforced this absurd idea but it flouts reality since small businesses account for fully half of america s gdp shut down enough of them and the unemployment and falling revenues that follow will eventually take down the consumer economy and the online behemoths that serve it rental bubble it will also affect the real estate market especially rentals that have attracted big players such as invitation homes and zillow such companies have created a bubble of their own by paying outlandish prices for residential properties then remodeling the homes extensively to attract upscale tenants in a market as hot as home rentals has been why should they care about upfront outlays when they can count on a steady stream of ever rising rent payments over the next ten years the fatal weakness of this strategy is that tenants are necessarily those who cannot afford to own a home none of this recklessness will matter as long as stocks continue to rise some technical forecasters seem to think the bull market has a lot farther to go and that the dow industrials could double or even triple over the next five to ten years although it is impossible to show why this can t happen my gut feeling is that the so called everything bubble is about to pop it will very shortly be bucking not only seasonal headwinds but a notorious history of stock market crashes and panics in the september october period if past is prelude then the broad averages are setting up for a memorable plunge can we actually identify the top with technical analysis stop by the rick s picks trading room and find out for yourself shorting lesser tops and making money at it has been our specialty even if we ve yet to nail the start of the big one the 4461 25 hidden pivot in the e mini s p futures that was sent out to subscribers sunday afternoon is a good example at the moment it is working nicely for traders who bet it would contain friday s ebullience if only for a short while that is how we roll take a profit and swing for the fences with the 25 that remains you don t need to speculate to benefit from the stock market s nuttiness

geoffrey attardo first tried prozac to treat his depression when he was doing postdoctoral research at yale school of public health and was feeling the pressures of a new job in academia soon after he started the colors around him seemed brighter he had enough motivation to begin exercising more and he felt hopeful for the first time in a long while but about five months into the treatment colors started dulling again and his energy waned increasing the dose didn t help he eventually switched to a similar antidepressant called zoloft and has been on it for about 20 years though it makes him emotionally numb and never completely got rid of the depression it takes the edge off and keeps you from completely breaking down he said but it s not really a great way to live advertisement then this year attardo who is 49 tried a new treatment for depression ketamine a drug long used as an anesthetic and that works through a different pathway in the brain than the traditional drugs he d taken a few days after one of his first ketamine infusions he found himself awake at 9 a m a time he usually slept long past with much more energy than usual patient responses like attardo s after years of unsuccessful treatment with standard drugs are spurring a gradual and some would say overdue shift in psychiatry toward a new way of thinking about depression its causes and therapies the profession s long embrace of the monoamine hypothesis the idea that depression primarily results from abnormal levels of neurotransmitter chemicals in the brain and that drugs can restore the proper balance is giving way to a more complex understanding and alternative treatments from ketamine to psychedelics to magnetic stimulation the stubbornly high and steadily increasing rate of suicides in the u s is one factor driving the shift in april the national institute of mental health nimh awarded eight grants to test new ways to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a fast acting manner including ketamine and using magnets to activate parts of the brain advertisement overall an unofficial estimate shows the agency s funding for research involving novel antidepressants roughly doubled from 34 3 million in the 2007 fiscal year to 68 5 million in fy 2020 based on a search of the national institutes of health reporter database a search for transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression reveals an estimated ninefold increase to 21 4 million over the same period claudia lópez lloreda stat source nih reporter database nolan williams a psychiatrist and neurologist at stanford university received one of the new grants as well as another from the nimh to study magnetic stimulation in treatment resistant depression he said there is a push in the field to to think beyond the typical view of depression and consider new treatments we re enhancing view to have a multilevel understanding of the problem he said it s about incorporating it into a deeper more dynamic understanding nimh director joshua gordon told stat the agency recognizes that new treatments for depression are needed and that it is funding research to explore the underlying biology beyond the monoamine hypothesis when it comes to understanding depression there are fewer and fewer questions of importance with regard to the monoamine systems he said he noted that in addition to federal funding many startups and small companies are pursuing new treatments for depression currently almost all patients with depression are first treated with medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors a class of drugs that includes both zoloft and prozac they increase the amount of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain which controls mood emotions and cognition serotonin and two other neurotransmitters targeted by some antidepressants norepinephrine and dopamine are called monoamines because they contain one chemical group called an amine newsletters sign up for morning rounds your daily dose of news in health and medicine please enter a valid email address privacy policy the entire thinking of the approach to treating depression is pretty much confined in that little box said lisa harding a psychiatrist at the yale school of medicine the monoamine hypothesis came about by serendipity in the 1960s doctors found that certain drugs like iproniazid that was used to treat tuberculosis had an unintended side effect they messed with the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and affected patients mood the explanation for mental health disorders had previously eluded psychiatrists so they were overjoyed to have a lead to follow the theories arose because of the actions of the drugs said phil cowen professor of psychopharmacology at university of oxford who studies depression in retrospect it s simplistic but there wasn t really much else to go on claudia lópez lloreda stat source nih reporter database soon clinicians realized that some observations didn t mesh with the hypothesis antidepressant drugs took weeks to improve the symptoms of depression suggesting that the drugs may not be working through neurotransmitters exclusively then psychiatrists found that many people like attardo did not respond to monoamine antidepressants about 1 out of every 3 patients with depression is diagnosed with treatment resistant depression meaning at least two antidepressants failed to improve their symptoms even with these contradictions doctors faithfully stuck by the hypothesis as the central dogma the field got stuck in a cul de sac of just looking at said cowen then a study done by researchers at yale university in 2000 found that ketamine rapidly improved depression symptoms in seven patients although it was a small study it opened the door for researchers to explore other potential treatments for depression we ve now got a completely different option for the treatment resistant group said susannah murphy researcher at the university of oxford who studies how to improve treatments for depression the finding emboldened researchers to explore other drug targets and develop different therapies she added it put a lot more confidence back in new treatments researchers are now exploring those new treatments and in parallel are seeking to advance the biological understanding of mental health disorders in 2019 the fda approved spravato a nasal spray of a version of ketamine called esketamine for the treatment of adults with treatment resistant depression studies have found that ketamine works through receptors for another neurotransmitter glutamate which is also dysregulated in depression glutamate and its receptors underlie a process called synaptic plasticity in which brain connections strengthen or weaken this supports the idea that changes in synaptic plasticity underlie depression and by targeting glutamate ketamine could be reversing those changes along with ketamine other psychedelics like psilocybin have emerged as candidates for treatment resistant depression a small study published in the new england journal of medicine in april showed that psilocybin was as effective as a common antidepressant drug the psychedelic market is seen as so potentially lucrative that half a dozen companies in that space have gone public this year cybin which has a psilocybin formulation in a phase 2 clinical trial for major depression started selling shares on the new york stock exchange last week and five other psychedelics companies are already listed on the nasdaq psychedelics like psilocybin mostly activate receptors for serotonin similar to the typical antidepressants but studies show that psilocybin also can change levels of glutamate suggesting it too involves synaptic plasticity many clinicians and researchers say the field should move beyond a focus on neurotransmitters and look at activating entire neural circuits in the brain networks of interconnected neurons that perform specific functions there s not one neurotransmitter not one neural site where things go wrong it s some system level dysfunction in the brain said cowen a recent study analyzed patients with depression who underwent deep brain stimulation in which electrodes are implanted to pass current through specific brain areas or transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a noninvasive form of stimulation by looking at whether patients symptoms improved or worsened researchers identified a brain circuit that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex an area that controls emotion processing and is impaired in patients with depression that could be targeted to treat depression understanding and treating depression could even go beyond the brain as immune molecules such as cytokines that control inflammation could also be considered potential treatment targets one analysis found that patients with depression had different levels of neuroinflammatory molecules in the blood other clues come from observing patients treated with medications that target inflammation for other conditions such studies found that patients treated with drugs that suppress immune activity like those that target the molecule il 6 had reduced depressive symptoms while the paradigms surrounding psychiatry seem to be shifting new drugs and treatments still have a long road to approval and widespread use the drug development pipeline has been particularly fruitless for psychiatry which has a 6 2 likelihood of getting a drug from phase 1 clinical trials to approval as compared to infectious diseases treatments that have about 20 likelihood of approval even if new treatments are approved patients could encounter obstacles in accessing them especially populations that already have poor access to mental health care due to high rates of poverty and lack of insurance experts say many of the novel therapies are technically challenging to administer and require specialized facilities with trained professional staff and many psychedelics are still classified as schedule i drugs as illegal as street drugs like heroin some like ketamine can be abused and the long term effects of chronic use of psychedelics are not clear said gerard sanacora psychiatrist and director of the yale depression research program a number of states have moved to relax laws governing use of psychedelics in november 2020 oregon became the first state to decriminalize possession and legalize therapeutic use of psilocybin the active ingredient in magic mushrooms and california may soon be next in march of this year a law decriminalizing magic mushrooms ayahuasca and mescaline went into effect in washington d c recently rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y proposed an amendment to allow research into the therapeutic potential of schedule i drugs like psilocybin and ecstasy the research and law changes are giving many patients a reason for optimism attardo is eager to try psilocybin which data suggest could have a longer lasting therapeutic effect than ketamine whose benefits last just a few days for him just knowing that his depression can disappear like when he is taking ketamine or during those first few months on prozac gives him hope i m not trapped forever

by grace gedye calmatters the plea went out on instagram cultura comida y bebida was short staffed the carmel by the sea restaurant could no longer offer its oaxacan inspired lunch and might have to cut one evening of dinner service if it wasn t able to hire more kitchen staff within the week so the owners opened up a referral bonus program to the entire community anyone who introduced them to someone they eventually hired would receive a 200 gift card the new employee would too literally if one more person leaves sarah kabat marcy one of the restaurant s managing partners said i don t know what we re going to do after five years of little turnover the restaurant lost several employees in the past couple of months to larger operations including luxury hotel restaurants that could pay kitchen staff 37 per hour kabat marcy says she and her husband michael marcy who is also a managing partner increased their kitchen staff s pay by 20 they deserve it she said and the cost of living is high in the coastal city but there s no way they could match the wages of larger operations she said the profit margins are too thin the restaurant would go under in the meantime hostesses and servers have volunteered to help out in the kitchen the head chef s retired parents have even come in and helped make tortillas the restaurant has slimmed down its menu based on conversations with the kitchen staff about which dishes were easiest to prepare neither kabat marcy nor her husband have drawn paychecks from cultura in over a year kabat marcy took a second job during the pandemic so that the couple could pay their bills we re just on the hairs edge of staff totally burning out she said labor shortage across california businesses across the state are rebounding but are struggling to fill job openings especially in the service industry several factors may be at play including enhanced unemployment benefits uncertainty around child care and concerns about covid 19 exposure workers may also be trying to launch new careers or shift to jobs with more regular hours better working conditions and better pay but the gap is there according to state data employment increased by just 24 500 in june even though employers added roughly 73 500 non farm jobs meaning thousands of positions were left open that s translated into a boon for workers over the past three months wages for californian workers in the leisure and hospitality sector have risen much faster than wages for all private employees between march and may the most recent period for which data is available average wages for private employees rose by 1 2 while wages for leisure and hospitality workers increased by 5 7 according to the u s bureau of labor statistics still service sector workers are paid much less than workers in many other industries average weekly pay for californian leisure and hospitality workers in june for example was around 600 according to the bureau of labor statistics for all private workers it was almost 1 250 dara maleki owner of the pizza press a chain of newspaper themed pizza restaurants that has 15 locations in california says for every applicant he gets there s five employers going after the same person that s a sharp turnaround from last year when the statewide shelter in place order and subsequent pandemic restrictions caused mass layoffs in the service sector in april 2020 the u s hospitality industry lost approximately 7 7 million jobs or about half of the workforce according to federal data california saw a similar loss in april 2020 the number of people working in hospitality and leisure dropped by more than 45 according to state data now employers are scrambling to rehire those workers some are competing for applicants by increasing wages dangling incentives and adding benefits that haven t typically been offered in the food and service industry hiring incentives reign free founder and ceo of red door catering in oakland has been struggling to fill about 15 roles one challenge she says is that part time on call staff can actually make more money from unemployment benefits free already offered her staff health benefits vision and dental coverage unlimited time off and free lunch every day now she s considering extending employees mental health coverage and bringing a yoga instructor on site for class once a week larry cromwell who owns maribou salons a chain of four salons in folsom and roseville says he had always wanted to let stylists own shares of the company when he saw salons shutting down and stylists leaving the industry during the pandemic he knew he had to have a competitive employment package cromwell raised the price of salon services twice which translated into higher pay for maribou s stylists he also launched a program that allowed stylists to buy 1 6 of the company s stock if they meet several benchmarks pegged to the number of clients they see in a month for example and their rebooking rate and if they exhibit leadership qualities they receive quarterly dividends and as the company grows the value of the stylists shares grows too right now the chain has five stylists who are shareholders and is trying to motivate more to qualify and join the program another edge cromwell had over many salons when competing for new applicants is a 401 k program he launched in january 2020 more than half of the stylists are enrolled in the program which maribou matches at 4 employers are increasingly offering 401 k matching programs and retirement plans says vinny catalano senior vice president of employee benefits at lockton companies llc a large insurance brokerage he says that younger workers express a lot of interest in being able to plan financially for their future employers are starting to respond to that eventually cromwell hopes to add healthcare coverage for his employees that s a tough one he says because costs have gone up so much it s like the holy grail if i could do it i d be in heaven cromwell said that adding health benefits now would swallow up what remains of his slim profit margin but he still hopes to make it work sometime in the future if it s one of the last things i ever do i m going to get it retention and work flexibility the difficulty with hiring isn t concentrated in one region or one industry it s the number one issue that scott miller ceo of the fresno chamber of commerce says he s hearing about from member businesses some are doing standing daily interviews where people can walk up and interview for jobs on the spot without having applied something miller says he s never seen before in his career up in redding businesses are facing a similar situation says michelle nystrom regional director for o2 employment services a staffing company hiring has become so difficult that she s been pushing the employers she works with to focus on retaining their current employees with additional compensation she s also seeing workers including those in manufacturing demand flexibility or express interest in working from home for some industries covid showed them how flexible they can be for other industries it showed them how hard it is to be flexible nystrom says some manufacturers are looking at offering alternative work weeks like four 10 hour days or half days on fridays others are considering offering their employees paid volunteer hours that they can use on approved activities including helping out at their kids schools for positions like manufacturing they ve never had the luxury of going to their kids daytime performances or field trips nystrom said that s kind of a big deal signing bonuses mitchell sjerven who owns bouchon an upscale restaurant in downtown santa barbara had to shut down his restaurant twice during the pandemic and each time laid off staff the first time in the spring of 2020 he was able to hire all of his staff back after the second shutdown and layoff some staff had moved on to different jobs now

compared to the prior year this performance was underpinned by a strong cost working capital and capital expenditure performance despite the continued impact of the covid 19 pandemic and adverse weather events a notable gross margin recovery was recorded in the second half of the financial year supported by the combined impact of higher brent crude oil and chemicals prices offset by a stronger rand us dollar exchange rate our earnings were mainly impacted by the following non cash adjustments the net of which amounted to r15 4 billion net impairments of r28 7 billion mainly due to

cash generated by operating activities increased by 6 to r45 1 billion compared to the prior year this together with the asset divestment programme enabled the repayment of approximately r81 billion of debt including the settlement of our rand denominated banking facilities of approximately r4 billion actual capital expenditure amounted to r16 4 billion compared to r35 2 billion during 2020 the reduction in capital expenditure was carefully executed as a result of our optimised risk management focus whilst ensuring asset integrity and safety were not compromised our net debt to ebitda ratio at 30 june 2021 based on the revolving credit facility rcf and us dollar term loan covenant definition was 1 5 times significantly below the agreed threshold level although this ratio meets our targeted net debt to ebitda level we will continue with our efforts to reduce leverage and absolute debt levels further this will create valuable financial flexibility as we execute our future sasol strategy in the midst of an uncertain macroeconomic environment our objective remains to steer the balance sheet metrics toward restoration of our investment grade levels during the year bonds of us 1 5 billion r21 4 billion were issued and listed on the new york stock exchange at 30 june 2021 our total debt was r102 9 billion compared to r189 7 billion at 30 june 2020 during the year we utilised proceeds from our asset divestments to repay the us dollar syndicated loan a portion of our rcf and term loans reducing our us dollar denominated debt by almost r76 billion us 5 billion our gearing decreased from 117 0 at 30 june 2020 to 61 5 at 30 june 2021 mainly due to repayment of us dollar debt and a stronger closing rand us dollar exchange rate as at 30 june 2021 our liquidity headroom was r84 billion us 5 9 billion well above our outlook to maintain liquidity in excess of us 1 billion with available rand and us dollar based funds improving as we advance our focused management actions we have no significant debt maturities before november 2022 when the us 1 billion bond becomes due in line with our financial risk management framework we continue to make good progress with hedging our foreign currency crude oil and ethane exposure we have been successful in hedging our total oil exposure for 2022 which increases the certainty of future cash flows to reduce debt levels and

one of the biggest headaches that investors face in this climate is finding a steady income that has some protection against inflation this isn t a new thought we ve been wrestling with declining yields on most investments for more than a decade but for much of that time the big risk from inflation was what might happen in future rather than the immediate trend that risk no longer seems so far away prices are rebounding strongly as we emerge from the pandemic uk consumer price inflation hit 2 5 in june the highest for three years in the us the inflation rate is 5 4 a level it hasn t reached since 2008 yet central banks are saying they see this as transitory and so monetary policy is likely to remain loose this may yet be true and it s certainly hard to see how policymakers could justify tightening policy at this stage anyway regardless of what they actually believe but the risk that higher inflation expectations will take hold and bring us into a new era of steadily rising prices is evident in a way that it wasn t for most of the 2010s that means we are going to need to worry more urgently than before about which investments are going to respond best to inflation subscribe to

newsletter sign up this brings us to real estate investment trusts reits companies that own income producing real estate assets and receive preferential tax treatment in exchange for passing most of their rental income onto shareholders each year reits differ from real estate development companies in that even if they carry out some development work as part of their activities their main focus is supposed to be on owning and operating a portfolio for long term income other listed real estate companies often focus more on making capital gains from developing and selling properties and won t necessarily pay steady dividends real estate is an asset class with distinctively different properties to other major asset classes such as cash bonds shares or precious metals listed reits provide a simple liquid way for any investor to build a diversified portfolio in an asset class where direct investments require high minimum investments and are quite illiquid thus they occupy a very useful niche in the investment world between bond type investments that pay a fixed income and equities with dividends that are often less steady what inflation means for real estate investors often say that real estate should offer good protection against inflation as with many things in investment this statement is probably broadly true but is also a sweeping generalisation that disguises a lot of variation in returns and a good deal of uncertainty about what the future holds returns on real estate come from two things the rental income you receive and any change in the market value of the property so when we think about whether real estate will beat inflation we could be talking about either of these taking rental income first if the economy is solid and the real estate market is tight enough to allow inflation to be passed on through higher rent a property that is let on a short lease or allows for regular rent reviews will see its rental income keep pace with inflation more consistently than one that is on a long lease with limits to how much rent can be increased before the end of the agreement the market value of the property on the other hand depends on a combination of the rent it will pay and the rate of return that a buyer requires on a property of that type known as the capitalisation rate or cap rate cap rates will depend on a number of factors including the rate at which rents might grow and the risks associated with the property but will be related to some kind of interest rate or bond benchmark typically the yield on a ten year government bond is used as the risk free rate in calculations like these so if inflation takes off and growth remains fairly strong but central banks hold down interest rates and so bond yields remain negative in real after inflation terms then a good quality property with short leases will probably see rental income keep pace with inflation because rents can be increased steadily and capital values rise because the low real bond yields will keep cap rates low a property with longer leases may not pass on inflation into rents so steadily there may be lumpy increases as leases expire but capital values may still rise because cap rates remain low conversely an economy with high inflation and sluggish growth where the central banks begin raising rates aggressively to try to squash inflation might be very bad for real estate in the short term because landlords may struggle to push through rent increases while rising bond yields mean higher cap rates and so lower capital values all else being equal in short there are a lot of moving parts so it s no surprise that studies that try to determine whether real estate is a good inflation hedge seem to produce quite inconsistent results it also doesn t help that many of them try to measure how closely real estate returns move with inflation in the shorter term eg over a year rather than whether they will keep pace with inflation over three years or five years the first is the strict definition of a true hedge but the latter probably matters more to most investors broadly speaking historical data seems to suggest that real estate returns are not a perfect hedge in the strictest sense but that they should outpace inflation over time for example uk commercial real estate substantially outstripped inflation over the period from 1947 to 2009 according to analysis done for the investment property forum however during the 1947 1967 period of low inflation and the 1981 2009 period of declining inflation the majority of this return came from rental income in contrast during the inflationary 1967 1981 era capital growth became by far the more important part of returns this is important it tells us that in an inflationary world we can t necessarily expect a steady real increase in reit income but our total return including capital gains is likely to help us keep inflation at bay so given the likely scenarios for the world over the next few years i see reits as an important part of my portfolio that said picking reits that will either be able to pass on inflation have solid underlying growth prospects or are starting at attractive valuations will be important we are starting from a position where yields in general are comparatively low by historical standards and where the impact of the pandemic has had a serious impact on rental prospects much more than offices and shops the global reit market covers a wide range of different sectors and is more diverse than a lot of investors realise the traditional sectors are offices retail industrial and residential several of these sectors then span a number of sub sectors some include variations on a similar theme retail could be major out of town retail parks local shopping centres or individual high street properties which are all ultimately about consumption and leisure but are driven by different forces others are quite different the industrial sector includes warehouses and distribution logistics but also science parks occupied by technology and pharmaceutical companies other slightly smaller but well established sectors include healthcare another broad category that includes facilities as disparate as hospitals retirement homes and laboratories and hospitality ie hotels and similar more recent years have seen rapid growth in new niches such as self storage facilities infrastructure often telecoms towers and networks and data centres but there are also longer standing speciality reits such as timberland you ll also occasionally find quite esoteric reits or business trusts that work in a similar way that own less obvious real estate based assets such as golf courses since these tend to have few listed peers analysing them and knowing what to expect can be unusually tricky many reits today are diversified across more than one sector a reit that owns offices will often naturally end up owning some retail space as well established industrial reits or office reits have been expanding into growth areas such as data centres for some time while some retail reits are looking at converting some of their space into logistics to adapt to the threats of e commerce returns from all of these will be driven by the specific markets where the reit invests rather than the sector alone but we can look at long term returns for us reits by far the biggest market and with the best data to get some idea of trends between 1994 and 2019 residential reits ie apartment buildings not single private houses returned an annual average of 12 1 industrial returned 10 9 offices 10 6 and retail 9 8 diversified did worse at 8 maybe it pays to focus on a single sector if you break down the return between capital and income the income return is similar between sectors at 5 6 suggesting that investors did a good job of spotting which sectors had the best income prospects and bidding up share prices accordingly among smaller sectors healthcare did well 11 8 while hospitality did notably badly 5 1 all of which came from income self storage which has a longer history in the us than in the uk had an exceptional return of 15 2 driven by capital growth the income component was similar to other sectors this data is interesting in setting expectations anybody buying a hospitality reit should ask themselves why the sector has such a poor record and why their choice might do better but when it comes to what to expect now we re concerned about two main factors how lease lengths interact with inflation and how the pandemic has affected long term trends flexibility to respond to inflation lease lengths determine how rapidly rents can rise to reflect market conditions for example hospitality self storage and residential tend to have short lease terms ranging from almost day by day to around a year industrial and some retail operators tend to have middling terms a few years and office and healthcare tend to have longer lease terms a decade or so in some cases some longer leases will have provision for inflation busting rent increases built in some won t you ll also see some reits own buildings built for and let to a client on a long lease that spans many decades where the tenant is responsible for most operating expenses these are known as net lease reits their leases will often provide for inflation linked rent increases and may offer a steady real income stream which can be attractive the trade off is that the reit doesn t have the opportunity to shop the property around to potential tenants for bigger rent increases every few years if the real estate market is booming broadly we d expect reits with short leases to be able to pass on inflation most easily and thus investors might favour them especially if underlying demand for the kind of assets they hold is strong set against that the past couple of years have been good for reits that focus on logistics and data centres the shift to online retail and the growth of digital services had already been benefitting them but the coronavirus pandemic accelerated the trend thus prologis the largest us logistics reit and equinix which runs data centres are both up by about 120 since the start of 2019 this isn t confined to the us market uk listed segro which owns logistics space across europe has done similarly well as has singapore s keppel dc reit asian s first data centre trust in all these cases while historical earnings growth has been decent the share price has outstripped recent growth for example segro was on a trailing yield of around 2 8 at the beginning of 2019 which has now fallen to 1 7 meanwhile investors worry about the outlook for offices and retail reits and shares have fallen to reflect this land securities the largest uk commercial property reit a mix of offices and retail was on a yield of 4 6 at the beginning of 2020 it suspended dividends for much of 2020 as tenants ceased paying but has resumed at around 60 of the previous level it yields 3 9 and dividends should hopefully rise as the economy gets back on track these differences make reits very interesting investors can buy a fund such as the ishares developed markets property yield etf lse iwdp with a portfolio of around 300 stocks but there is also plenty of opportunity to build a portfolio with a mix of growth and value that will hopefully offer protection against inflation i ve outlined my holdings below the 11 reits in my portfolio i take the view that fears about the future of offices and retail are overdone people will work from home more and many weak retail companies will go bust but good quality space will still remain in demand rents may drop in some cases but reit share prices fell by enough during the panic to reflect that so i was a keen buyer of land securities lse land and british land lse blnd and i think they remain solid recovery plays even though i am not especially optimistic for the uk economy i also bought boston properties nyse bxp the largest us office reit which has rebounded more but remains below its highs in europe i hold aroundtown frankfurt at1 which predominantly owns offices in germany this is not a reit and it puts more focus on procuring and improving distressed properties i generally favour reits that focus on prime properties but this has a decent record of steadily growing dividends i ve been a long term shareholder in capital and integrated commercial trust singapore c38u which is a mixed office and retail reit the dismantling of hong kong s special status by china makes me bullish about the outlook for singapore as the obvious alternative regional base for many firms ascendas reit singapore a17u holds industrial assets including logistics science parks and data centres around 60 of the portfolio is in singapore with the rest in australia the uk and the us it offers a higher yield than reits of similar quality in markets such as the us and uk although it s important to note that properties in asian markets such as singapore and hong kong are typically held on a fairly long leasehold from the government rather than freehold hence any uplift in the value of properties that a reit owns due to growth or inflation is partly offset by the steady reduction in the remaining term of the lease notwithstanding my suspicion that hospitality is the long term laggard of the reit space i also bought into ascott residence trust singapore hmn last year this has a global portfolio of short and medium term accommodation as demand returns it should offer a decent yield on the current price i also hold starhill global reit singapore p40u a smaller retail reit with assets in singapore malaysia and australia i ve had this for a while because it s controlled by a fairly competent malaysian property group that i expect to source new properties for the portfolio over time this hasn t happened so far and my return on investment so far is modest but the shares look cheap now real estate investment in emerging markets is somewhat different to buying solid assets in developed markets you have to worry more about economic volatility corporate governance and in some places the security of private property rights so i mostly don t see it as part of a core reit income portfolio that said i think ascendas india trust singapore cy6u which owns it parks and logistics is an interesting growth prospect also on the growth theme it seems likely that healthcare research will be a huge investment focus after the pandemic and that should benefit firms that own offices and laboratories leased by science firms i hold alexandria real estate equities nyse are the largest and most focused us reit in this area finally timber is potentially an interesting inflation hedge and a play on housing demand both through the use of lumber in construction and the chance to sell land for development i hold rayonier nyse ryn one of four us listed timber reits
article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com it is said the future is not yet written but the biden administration has a draft ready for congress our federal tax group gazes into the made in america tax plan to find the many questions that await within the uncertainty of retroactive or prospective effective dates deferring income recognition and accelerating deductions may not be the best plan prepare to reexamine traditional tax planning strategies in april president biden introduced the american jobs plan a comprehensive proposal to increase investment in u s infrastructure concurrently president biden also announced his made in america tax plan the goal of which is to help fund the significant cost of this investment in u s infrastructure while no legislation has been produced the proposed tax plan includes significant changes to the u s federal income tax system such as an increase in the u s corporate tax rate an increase in the highest marginal u s federal individual income tax rate and an increase in the capital gains tax rate for certain high income individuals with tensions among and within the political parties it is unclear whether president biden s made in america tax plan will be enacted in its proposed form in some trimmed down version or at all it is also unclear whether any changes will be effective retroactively or prospectively for taxpayers engaging in transactions in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 this uncertainty can make tax planning more difficult than if there were certainty with tax rates generally it is well established that a taxpayer wants to defer income recognition and accelerate deductions however given some of the proposals in the made in america tax plan a taxpayer may consider tax planning that contradicts this fundamental principle to illustrate assume a high income taxpayer is selling stock of a corporation for cash in the third quarter of 2021 and that a portion of the taxpayer s cash proceeds will be held in escrow for one year after the closing date to protect the buyer against potential future claims traditionally the taxpayer would be advised to take advantage of the installment sale method under section 453 of the code recognizing the gain on cash proceeds received upon the sale in 2021 and recognizing the gain on cash proceeds held in escrow or earned under an earnout if and when they are ultimately paid to the taxpayer in 2022 or later years however one of the proposals in the made in america tax plan is to increase the capital gains tax rate that applies to high income individual taxpayers to the highest marginal individual income tax rate the taxpayer may need to consider electing out of installment sale treatment and recognizing the full amount of the cash proceeds including the amount held in escrow or earned under an earnout in 2021 unfortunately such a decision is not without inherent risk if the made in america tax plan is not enacted in its currently proposed form capital gains tax rates for high income individuals might not increase thus the taxpayer s decision to elect out of installment sale treatment could result in a liquidity problem the election could unnecessarily accelerate income recognition and tax on the full amount of the cash proceeds before the taxpayer actually receives the full amount of the cash fortunately the taxpayer should have until filing a 2021 federal income tax return including extensions to choose whether to elect out of the installment sale method unless the enacted legislation precludes such a wait and see approach as another illustration of how current uncertainty can impact both deal economics and tax considerations suppose that shareholders are selling 100 of the stock of a corporation for cash on december 31 2021 as part of the transaction large change of control bonuses are going to be paid to certain employees of the corporation traditionally the selling shareholders would want the corporation to accrue these change of control payments on or before december 31 2021 to take advantage of the corporate tax deduction associated with the change of control payments in the pre closing tax period however if the corporate tax rate increases as proposed in the made in america tax plan and is effective prospectively starting january 1 2022 the selling shareholders may want to consider deferring accrual of the change of control payments until after the closing achieving this deferral may be complex and may require amending contracts plans or other agreements currently in place but the benefits of letting the buyer take advantage of the increased tax deduction may be worth the effort if it gives the selling shareholders enhanced negotiation leverage in the transaction or enables them to share in the incremental corporate tax deduction via a purchase price increase lastly assume that instead of receiving all cash for their shares the selling shareholders in the previous example receive part of their consideration in the form of rollover equity in the buyer traditionally the selling shareholders would want to structure their rollover equity to take advantage of tax deferral under section 351 or section 721 however given the proposed increase to the capital gains tax rate for high income individuals in the made in america tax plan the selling shareholders may be in a position where it makes sense to avoid tax deferral and instead pay taxes on the rollover equity upon consummation of the transaction in 2021 at a lower capital gains tax rate the same may hold true for tax free reorganizations as well in certain situations for transactions occurring in 2021 it may make sense to avoid tax free

despite the biden administration s efforts to finalize an agreement before the inauguration of ebrahim raisi as iran s new president tehran has refused to return to the 2015 nuclear deal also known as the joint comprehensive plan of action the clerical regime s intransigence and washington s failure to exploit its economic leverage over tehran have created an impasse in the talks with tehran placing them on hold in an apparent effort to extract more concessions from washington raisi s inauguration comes as tehran continues to expand its atomic program without the proper supervision of the international atomic energy agency while indicating that it is unsatisfied with the direction of the negotiations the white house s failure to enforce sanctions fully particularly oil sanctions has given tehran much needed financial oxygen the regime in tehran is using these developments as leverage to put pressure on washington for further concessions thus the talks remain at an impasse created by u s policymakers iran also has made significant progress in expanding its nuclear program the clerical regime likely expects washington to make concessions beyond its jcpoa commitments unless president joe biden changes course washington s only path to a deal is to concede even more it is not too late however for washington to restore leverage over tehran here are four steps the biden administration can take to gain the upper hand first biden should replace rob malley the lead american negotiator in vienna with someone ready to be tough on tehran in recent months in his eagerness to revive the jcpoa malley has reportedly agreed to lift nearly all u s sanctions on iran including non nuclear sanctions tehran most likely sees malley himself as the architect of this policy tehran s perception of washington s weakness will not change as long as malley and his team are in place second washington should emphasize the maximum pressure campaign initiated by the trump administration it should enforce existing sanctions zealously and comprehensively particularly on oil and petrochemical products it should designate the remaining key entities in iran s economy such as the automobile companies iran khodro and saipa which produce more than 90 of cars in iran as well as the tehran stock exchange the biden administration should also increase political pressure on tehran by sanctioning raisi s cabinet members thereby sending a message that the international community should shun the islamic republic so long as it refuses to change its behavior third washington should initiate the process of sending iran s nuclear dossier to the united nations security council for its violations of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty the islamist regime in iran has failed to declare multiple nuclear sites and refused to answer the iaea s questions about them europeans resisted the trump administration s efforts to initiate the snapback process biden should see if his multilateral approach to foreign policy will offer washington a better chance of persuading europe to act fourth washington should forcefully push back against tehran s aggression in the region for example washington should target the leadership of iran backed shiite militias which have continuously fired rockets on u s positions in iraq the trump administration made a big mistake when it failed to turn its 2020 action against ghassem soleimani and abu mahdi al muhandis into a larger campaign of disrupting the tehran backed terrorist network in the region in response to the islamic republic s recent disruption of maritime trade in the persian gulf washington should use kinetic actions against the irgc s naval assets including vessels ports drones and missiles launch centers the goal should be to make tehran understand that the united states is ready to escalate tensions and it is tehran that will lose unless it changes its behavior to be sure the u s should refrain from reviving the fatally flawed jcpoa which would provide iran with billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for limited and temporary nuclear restrictions however those who favor reviving the deal should understand that salvaging it requires america to show that it is still capable of severely hurting the clerical regime the u s should deliver this pain before negotiations resume if it fails to act the biden administration will bring home a deal far worse than president barack obama s saeed ghasseminejad sghasseminejad is a senior adviser at the foundation for defense of democracies

sopa images lightrocket via getty images in recent filings paycom software nyse payc reported 30 y o y revenue growth assisted by expanding client bases and demand for human capital management software notably the stock s market capitalization is one third of adp s nasdaq adp due to continued strong revenue growth and market share gains interestingly the shares of all hcm solution companies including paychex paycor workday and adp have benefited from investor optimism in recent months despite the pandemic s continued impact on the travel tourism industry considering the high current valuation multiple of market leaders adp and paychex trefis believes that paycom stock has reached its near term potential we highlight paycom s stock performance with its peers and broader markets in an interactive dashboard analysis paycom software stock return 10 day return trefis think adp stock is expensive you should consider paycom stock after gaining 30 in the past quarter adp stock nasdaq ndaq adp looks fairly priced based on its current p s multiple of 5x however the market is pricing adp s competitor paycom software nyse payc at a much higher p s multiple of 30x does that make adp a better buy over payc comparing a slew of factors such as historical revenue growth returns and risk trefis believes that paycom software stock has more room for growth despite its higher p s multiple the price to sales or p s multiple for a company is higher when the sales growth is higher and it has a demonstrated ability to translate those sales to profits with an expectation to do so consistently in the past few years paycom s revenues have grown at an annual rate of 31 and its operating margins have consistently remained within the 28 30 range interestingly paycom s revenues are just a fraction of adp s 5 of adp but its market capitalization of 24 billion is about one third that of adp s 72 billion at 30 growth paycom s revenues can reach a quarter of adp s revenues in the next 5 years indicating a strong likelihood of a downtrend in the stock for the market leader adp our dashboard adp vs paycom is adp stock appropriately valued given its lower p s multiple compared to paycom details the fuller picture parts of which are summarized below revenue growth paycom software s revenue growth has been much stronger than adp s over the last three years with paycom s revenue expanding at an average rate of 31 per year from 329 million in 2016 to 737 million in 2019 versus adp s revenue which grew by 6 per year from 12 4 billion in fy2017 to 14 6 billion in fy2019 paycom s growth is driven by the acquisition of new clients and expansion of its product offering from traditional human capital management to integrated cloud based solutions adp on the other hand is the industry leader and handles 1 out of 6 payrolls in the u s thus adp s growth is dependent on macroeconomic factors such as gdp employment statistics wage growth etc paycom s client base increased by 50 from 17 800 in 2016 to 26 500 in 2019 supporting the strong revenue growth and earnings in the recent earnings release the company highlighted that it currently has a 5 market share and is in a good position to generate strong growth in the coming years returns profits coming to returns adp is the market leader in the payroll processing business and has been providing consistent returns to investors as dividends and share repurchases adp reports a lower operating margin mainly due to its peo business where employees of clients are co employed by adp in 2020 adp s employer services and professional employer organization reported a net margin of 30 and 12 5 respectively with a 70 share of total revenues the employer services segment is the primary earnings contributor for adp paycom sells human capital management software to organizations and generates a bulk of its revenues from payroll processing paycom s product offerings can be fairly compared to adp s employer services segment which provides technology based human capital management services thus paycom s 30 operating margin is comparable to adp s employer services segment margins consistent with high revenue growth paycom s operating income has more than doubled from 101 million in 2016 to 226 million in 2019 risk as neither of the two companies has considerable debt on their balance sheet market consolidation or technological disruption are the keys risks to their revenues and earnings as the market leader adp serves 860 000 clients and processes one in six american payrolls betting on the industry leader will provide consistent returns as the topline is less volatile and depends on macroeconomic factors with the topline being just a fraction of adp competitive rivalry can cause a sharper dip in paycom s revenues compared to adp however paycom has consistently grown by 30 y o y highlighting the company s edge over its competitors do adp s peers offer better gains adp stock comparison with peers

clinical data readouts by mid 2022 company will host a conference call and webcast today at 8 00 am et ness ziona israel aug 16 2021 globe newswire biomx inc nyse american phge biomx or the company a clinical stage microbiome company advancing novel natural and engineered phage cocktails that target specific pathogenic bacteria today reported financial results and provided a business update for the second quarter ended june 30 2021 biomx is approaching several important potential inflection points with expected phase 1b 2a or phase 2 data readouts in four distinct indications by mid 2022 including a first readout from our phase 2 acne study of bx001 expected in october said jonathan solomon chief executive officer of biomx following our 15 million equity financing in july which included participation by all of the members of our board of directors and an up to 30 million venture debt agreement biomx is well funded through these clinical data readouts and to at least mid 2023 entering a data rich period for our company we believe biomx remains uniquely positioned at the forefront of developing precision medicines that target pathogenic bacteria to address the significant unmet medical need remaining in indications such as cystic fibrosis atopic dermatitis acne prone skin and inflammatory bowel disease recent highlights and key upcoming milestones completion of a registered direct financing in july raising gross proceeds of 15 million on july 26 2021 biomx announced a registered direct offering of the company s common stock and warrants for gross proceeds of 15 million before fees and expenses and assuming that none of the warrants are exercised the offering closed on july 28 2021 30 million venture debt financing agreement with hercules capital biomx also announced today that it has entered into a 30 million debt financing agreement with hercules capital inc nyse htgc hercules a leader in customized debt financing for companies in life sciences and technology related markets the first 15 million tranche is available upon closing two subsequent tranches of 10 million and 5 million will become available upon the achievement of certain milestones the loan is for a term of 48 months and during the first 18 months biomx is expected to pay only interest on the principal the loan term and the interest only period may be extended to up to 60 and 30 months respectively upon satisfaction of certain milestones no warrants were issued in connection with the debt financing clinical program updates acne prone skin bx001 in may 2021 biomx announced completion of enrollment in its phase 2 cosmetic clinical study of bx001 bx001 is a topical gel that includes a combination of naturally occurring phage that specifically target cutibacterium acnes the study is evaluating reduction in cutibacterium acnes burden as well as improvement in the appearance of acne prone skin in 140 subjects with mild to moderate acne vulgaris the trial is a 12 week randomized single center double blind placebo controlled study topline results from study bmx 001 007 were on track to be reported following the 8 and 12 week treatment periods in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 respectively because enrollment in this study was completed two weeks ahead of schedule a decision was made to forego the interim 8 week analysis continue the blinded status of the study until study completion and conduct all analyses 8 week and 12 week at the same time hence we expect the full study readout will be available at end of october only a few weeks after the planned interim analysis inflammatory bowel disease ibd and primary sclerosing cholangitis psc bx003 on may 26 2021 biomx hosted a key opinion leader kol webinar focusing on bx003 the company s microbiome based therapeutic for ibd the event featured kol ryan balfour sartor m d who discussed the ibd treatment landscape as well as the unmet medical need for these patients dr sartor was also joined by biomx management who provided updates on the bx003 program for ibd and psc based on the previous promising results from the phase 1a trial of bx002 which showed that orally administered bx002 was safe well tolerated and met its key objective of delivering viable phage at high concentrations to the lower gut biomx plans to initiate a phase 1b 2a study to evaluate the safety tolerability and activity of bx003 in 60 subjects the goal of this study is to demonstrate reduction of the target bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae as measured in stool of target bacteria carriers results from this study are expected in the second quarter of 2022 cystic fibrosis cf bx004 in june 2021 at the 44 th european cystic fibrosis conference biomx presented preclinical data

yves here i have to confess to not noting the significance of the august 15 date as the anniversary of when richard nixon ended the bretton woods system by taking the us off the gold standard overseas this change was often called the nixon shock and please do not get romantic about the gold standard era first for you investor types it did not provide a secure base for currency values countries cheated all the time by devaluing their currency in gold terms second if you look at the history of the us it did not provide for a steady or low rate of inflation while the gold standard had a deflationary bias as proven out by the long deflation of the late 1800s and the rise of william jennings bryan the us had occasional years of sharp rises in inflation in the 5 to 14 range followed the next year by low inflation or deflation so the gold standard did not produce stability of real economy prices third as peter temin demonstrates persuasively in his book lessons from the great depression the ultimate cause of the depression was the campaign by the west after world war i to go back onto the gold standard which had fallen apart during the great war by barkley rosser professor of economics at james madison university in harrisonburg virginia originally published at econospeak it was also on a sunday with financial markets closed that august 15 1971 when us president richard nixon gave a surprise address to the nation on economic policy he made three announcements 1 a 90 day wage price freeze 2 a10 percent across the board tariff on all imports and most importantly 3 the closing of the gold window meaning the us treasury would no longer pay gold to somebody bringing us dollars to it the final end of the gold standard it was not quite the end of the post ww ii bretton woods system established in 1944 at a conference at that new hampshire town as the mostly fixed exchange rate system was maintained but that would end in early 1973 when the us dollar was set to float against other major currencies according to market forces which is what it has done ever since although with an occasional market intervention here and there later in 1973 would come the first opec led oil price shock and most observers consider that year to be the actual end of that post ww ii economic order which saw mostly solid growth in the leading economies of western europe north america and japan with a few exceptions notably the uk this move fundamentally reflected something that has continued a steady decline of the relative economic position of the us in the world economic system which was a peak at the end of ww ii when the bretton woods system was put in place then the us had half the world s gdp and basically had trade surpluses with nearly every nation in the world there was a dollar shortage and the us would set up programs such as the marshall plan to overcome this and provide financial assistance especially to war damaged western european economies but then in the 1950s while the uk went into a general decline losing its colonies and the global status of its pound sterling running chronic large trade deficits that led to several devaluations of the pound other nations grew rapidly with the common market being formed on the european continent and west germany and france and italy all growing solidly as well as japan of course by the early 1960s many of these nations had turned the trade situation around and were running bilateral surpluses with the us france s president de gaulle emphasized the change of status along with withdrawing from nato and developing its independent nuclear force de frappe he also demanded that the us pay france gold to cover the deficits in practice this meant that in the basement of the new york federal reserve bank somebody went into a room where gold was identified as belonging to the us and then moving it to another room down a hall or two where there was gold identified as belonging to france august 15 1971 put an end to this sort of publicity stunt but rising trade deficits and rising inflation pushed nixon who was looking at a reelection campaign the following year when he took 49 states to make his moves to put both inflation and trade deficits at least temporarily under control it is a curious thing that it is really quite rare for there to be a single day when something happens that leads to a systemic change of the world economic system i can only think of two days since of comparable significance one was november 8 1989 when the berlin wall fell which presaged the collapse of communism in eastern europe the end of the cold war and the move into transition of basically the entire soviet bloc with the soviet union itself splintering into 15 nations at the end of 1991 the paths these nations have taken since have been quite diverse and with widely varying outcomes but the global economic system was certainly changed i think another date of great significance was september 18 2008 although this was not accompanied by major public announcements but this was the most dramatic point of the financial crash that dragged the world into the great recession but it led to major changes in how central banks operate around the world led by the us fed making a not publicized decision to bail out the european central bank which in turn was struggling to prop up various major european banks that were getting dragged down in the crash the fed did a swap that put over half a trillion usd of european debts on its books which would be gradually unloaded over the next six months to be replaced by mortgage backed securities also something the fed had not had on its books before but various other tools were created or brought out then that have remained such as quantitative easing i supposed another possible one would be the day in late 1973 when indeed saudi arabia announced its oil embargo of the us during the yom kippur war which was followed by a massive increase in oil prices the first oil price shock but it was probably the case that such an increase was coming even if it might have arrived more gradually without that move but that move and the ending of the fixed exchange rate system earlier that year were arguably the outcome of nixon s speech a half century ago today

singapore aug 16 malaysia s currency fell to a one year low today and analysts forecast further pressure on the country s financial markets as the prime minister s resignation raised the prospect of protracted political instability and uncertainty advertisement pm tan sri muhyiddin yassin said he quit after losing the confidence of parliament though malaysia s king said he will remain caretaker leader until a replacement is found muhyiddin has no obvious successor yet and with his cabinet also resigning today investors worried a political impasse could delay raising the national borrowing limit and stymie much needed state spending while the covid 19 pandemic rages on the ringgit fell about 0 1 per cent to touch 4 2430 per dollar its lowest since july 2020 while the benchmark stock index slipped 0 4 per cent sovereign yields and credit default swaps were mostly steady advertisement the issue is that there is no clear replacement which raises uncertainty further and that means more economic stagnation said trinh nguyen a senior economist at natixis in hong kong with the ongoing political crisis it s very difficult to see malaysia engineer a different growth trend that means that it falls further behind regional counterparts such as vietnam muhyiddin s leadership has been precarious since he took power with a slim majority 17 months ago advertisement investors perception matters because foreigners hold about 40 per cent of malaysia s sovereign debt foreign money has been flowing out of the country as the pandemic and political instability have delayed economic planning and stalled attempts at tax reform malaysia s stock market has logged 25 straight months of outflows and lagged regional peers falling 8 per cent so far this year while benchmarks in indonesia thailand and singapore have gained roughly 1 per cent 5 per cent and 11 per cent respectively the gap between malaysia s sovereign bond yields and the yield on indonesia s traditionally riskier government debt has also come under pressure from foreign flows squeezing the difference at the ten year tenor to its narrowest in three years this month uncertainty is likely to weigh on the performance of local currency assets and the ringgit in the near term said analysts at citi who said 10 year yields currently around 3 23 per cent could rise above 3 4 per cent in coming weeks the priority for investors is for a stable leader to emerge as the economic outlook turns cloudy but the way through the political crisis is unclear king al sultan abdullah has said elections are not the best option however there is no candidate with the parliamentary numbers to take over we are at the macro level quite optimistic but the situation in politics is something that needs to be resolved soon to keep that in place said mohamed faiz nagutha asean economist at bank of america securities in singapore what s important for me is that there is a government in place the worst would be if over the long term some of the medium term policies were sidelined as a result of this situation reuters

mmboe to its reserves substantially increased fiscal year end proved reserves to 23 4 mmboe from 10 2 mmboe at fiscal year end 2020 positive reserve revisions net of production due primarily to the return to service of the delhi co 2 supply line and well reactivations at hamilton dome supply line and well reactivations at hamilton dome reserves based on trailing twelve month commodity prices that are substantially below current prices jason brown president and chief executive officer commented we were pleased to more than double our fiscal 2021 year end proved reserves with the acquisition of a non operated ownership interest in barnett shale natural gas assets in may 2021 the associated proved developed producing pdp reserves are anchored by a low annual decline of less than 10 and include potential upside through workover opportunities the acquisition of the barnett shale assets helped to diversify our production mix to include natural gas with favorable access to the gulf coast markets that offer premium pricing additionally we had positive reserve revisions this year at delhi and hamilton dome further demonstrating the strength and value of our existing long life producing assets we were encouraged by the return to service of the co 2 supply line to delhi in late 2020 that will allow resumption of normal injection levels and provide meaningful reservoir pressure support for the continued recovery and development of the field s long life reserves at hamilton dome the operator was able to return substantially all of the wells shut in due to the dramatic price drop caused by the pandemic adding to production and extending the life of the field hamilton dome reserves were also revised upward due to improved year over year pricing we look

reserves were 23 4 mmboe up from 10 2 mmboe at year ended june 30 2020 although both delhi and hamilton dome had positive revisions net of production the majority of the increase was due to the

35 natural gas at fiscal year end approximately 92 of proved reserves were classified as proved developed producing and 8 as proved undeveloped probable and possible reserves the probable and possible reserves are categories that represent potential recoveries from the co 2 flood developed in the delhi field greater than those included in the proved reserves consequently while the probable and possible reserves are 85 and 91 developed respectively and require de minimis capital expenditures they remain less certain of attainment and have more risk of recovery than proved reserves and should not be aggregated with other categories these categories of reserves reflect the incremental reserves associated with different engineering assumptions with respect to the percentage of original oil in place that can be recovered through co 2 enhanced oil recovery probable and possible reserves decreased approximately 1 and 8 respectively from the prior year primarily due to the movement of probable and possible reserves to the proved reserves category as a result of a positive change to the proved reserves life at delhi investor conference presentation evolution today announced that the

companies to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable and possible reserves that meet the sec s definitions of such terms estimates of probable and possible reserves by their nature are much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves these non proved reserve categories are subject to greater uncertainties and the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk when estimating the amount of oil and natural gas liquids recoverable from a particular reservoir probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered generally described as having a 50 probability of recovery possible reserves are even less certain and generally require only a 10 or greater probability of being recovered these three reserve categories have not been adjusted to different levels of recovery risk among these categories and are therefore not comparable and are not meaningfully combined company contacts jason brown president ceo jbrown evolutionpetroleum com 713 935 0122 ryan stash svp cfo rstash evolutionpetroleum com

toronto north american stock markets were flat monday as investors stayed the course in spite of the weekend s turbulence in afghanistan and the kick off of a canadian federal election campaign craig fehr investment strategist with edward jones said monday was characterized by low trading volumes and little volatility in equity pricing this came in spite of ongoing geopolitical turmoil in afghanistan as the taliban seized kabul as well as domestic uncertainty brought about by sunday s announcement by canadian prime minister justin trudeau that the country will go to the polls sept 20 those are typically some events that can cause some knee jerk reaction in the market and yet equities haven t reacted sharply fehr said it was a very very quiet day today which is consistent with what we saw for the entirety of last week and much of august the s p tsx composite index was down 34 65 points at 20 483 42 in new york the dow jones industrial average was up 110 02 points at 35 625 40 the s p 500 index was up 11 71 points at 4 479 71 while the nasdaq composite was down 29 14 points at 14 793 76 the canadian dollar traded for 79 56 cents us compared with 79 91 cents us on friday the september crude oil contract was down us 1 15 at us 67 29 per barrel and the september natural gas contract was up 8 cents at us 3 95 per mmbtu the december gold contract was up us 11 60 at us 1 789 80 an ounce and the september copper contract was down six cents at us 4 33 a pound fehr said it s normal for markets to be quiet in the dog days of summer in addition he said fundamentals remain quite positive which may be preventing investors from being spooked by the political situation in afghanistan the ongoing concerns about the delta variant or the upcoming canadian election we ve got a u s and canadian and frankly a global economy that while proceeding in fits and starts is still very much on the road to recovery fehr said so it s not overly surprising we would see equities look past a little bit of geopolitical uncertainty still fehr said he doesn t expect the current market stability to continue indefinitely he said it s likely some investors are in a holding pattern waiting for the end of summer which will likely bring with it an expected decision from the u s central bank on tapering off bond purchases i do think as we transition into the fall and people come back from vacation we re probably going to see some element of volatility and larger market swings come back into the picture fehr said this report by the canadian press was first published aug 16 2021
as requirements for vaccinations or negative covid tests begin to pop up so do fake vaccination cards much like underage teenagers who might score a fake id to get into their local college bar for a drink there are unvaccinated people who are looking to get fake vaccination cards as you would expect with the demand for fake vaccination cards some folks are looking to capitalize on the opportunity to supply them a father and son recently made headlines after they were arrested for attempting to use a fake covid 19 card to travel many states are forming covid 19 task forces to monitor for similar violations and warning the public of the consequences that can come with using or creative fake vaccination cards so far new orleans is the only city requiring vaccination cards or recent negative tests for entry into bars restaurants and other indoor venues in the city the new requirement begins on monday and officials believe it will only increase the temptation for those against the vaccine to seek out fake cards louisiana residents can use the la wallet app to verify their vaccination status outside of that there are no other databases that currently track vaccinations so it pretty much boils down to having the card this means that anyone with decent photoshop skills and the right card stock could craft a vaccination card without much fuss there have been numerous reports of people already charging between 25 to 200 for fake vaccination cards while it may be easy to make or purchase a fake card the risks are nowhere close to the reward especially since legit cards are technically free legal analysts have appeared on multiple news outlets to let people know that fake vaccine cards can constitute a federal crime and land you in prison for up to five years you may be thinking look i m not gonna make the card i m just buying it off the internet i m gonna use it so my kid can go to school i can go back to work i can get into a restaurant or some other public place because the law punishes the person who makes the card who sells the card but also anyone who takes that card knowing it s false knowing it s a fake and uses it for almost any other purpose page pate also says that federal statutes in 18 u s code 1017 make it a crime to use official u s government logos on any certificate instrument commission document or paper with wrongful or fraudulent intent if somebody makes a card like that and uses one of those symbols it can be the department of health and human services the cdc if they put those symbols on a card without proper authorization then they have committed a federal crime and it carries up to five years in prison and that would just be the beginning of your legal headache things like felony forgery could also land you into the type of federal hot waters that would have you dealing with the fbi earlier today someone got popped trying to ship thousands of cards to new orleans in the wake of the news that vaccination cards would be required starting next week in addition to looking out for those manufacturing or using fake cards authorities are asking people to report fake vaccination cards to their local police the 1 800 hhs tips or www oig hhs gov or the internet crime complaint center www ic3 gov

damien peters founder of wealth noir shares five insightful ways to set your children and grandchildren up for financial success you don t have to be on the forbes list in order to be smart about planning for your family s future generations down the line there are valuable tools to leverage including 529 accounts estate planning and life insurance but it s also critical to build financial literacy skills in this motley fool live video recorded on july 23 fool com editor desiree jones speaks with wealth noir founder damien peters about how to set up your kids kids for financial success the 16 728 social security bonus most retirees completely overlook if you re like most americans you re a few years or more behind on your retirement savings but a handful of little known social security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income for example one easy trick could pay you as much as 16 728 more each year once you learn how to maximize your social security benefits we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we re all after simply click here to discover how to learn more about these strategies desiree jones what are some tips for people thinking about planning for their family s financial futures you already talked about home ownership but what are some other financial planning that people should look into when it comes to their families damien peters generational wealth is very big for me i ll be honest during college there was a time where part of my tuition was paid by my mom taking some money out of our rental properties that we owned at the time and this literally generational wealth i was able to graduate undergrad without student loans i did have a scholarship for most of it but for the part that i didn t both of my parents had assets that they could take from and utilize there s a couple of different ways to invest for your children that make sense and i think are good options 529 accounts so these are specific accounts say very different but with some attributes similar to a retirement account around tax savings for example in my state here in maryland you can contribute money to a 529 account that you can actually use for private school in addition to college and you receive a tax write off for any money that i can contribute if you imagine if i want to send my kid to college i can essentially pay for that and get a huge tax write off because college is super expensive it s only going to be more expressive for investing in that each state is different but 529 accounts are really good vehicles for education particularly for more complex tactics that you ll see the wealthy use are you can create an ira or retirement account for your child if you have your own llc there are some rules you should really talk to a tax attorney about this this is not financial advice but you can create a retirement account for your child under your company as long as they perform some meaningful work for you for example they can be a model for advertising material they can shred papers for you they can do this this allows you to contribute money to their account that again will grow tax free it will not come into play when they apply for college it doesn t count against their financial aid package if they decide not to go to college or if we get a full ride the harvard or mit somewhere else they can use that money to later on buy a house they can use it for their retirement it sets them up to a very good position understanding the estate laws and how your own different accounts will be taxed differently an ira or a roth ira or 401k for example has different rules when being handed to a child when being inherited as opposed to a traditional 401k or ira understanding where to put money and where to draw for money in the future having an estate plan in place so who s going to get the money how are they going to get the money it s easy to say well i put their name on the beneficiary they re going to get it all what people don t understand is that probate court or the ability to actually access their inheritance can take months to years depending if it was not properly planned for in the first place so having an estate plan thinking about how you want to give your children your assets for example i have rental properties if i were to pass tomorrow my four year old son probably can t manage those i have an estate plan that indicates who will take those over who will control the money at what point in what age he will actually have access to all of this this is all structured put into place in a locked box somewhere so that god forbid something happens i know that my next generation is taken care of actually a common slogan we use at wealth noir is i want to pay for my grandchildren s college education and i don t know my grandchildren i may never meet them to be honest but i can still make changes now to plan for them then one good thing especially when you have children is having good insurance policies ensure that you have a life insurance policy that will cover any outstanding debts that you won t be passing a lot of debt or burden onto your children onto those around you and another big big thing is talk to your kids about money talk to everyone about money but talk to your wife talk to your significant other have a plan so that they understand what they need to do if you pass and vice versa talk to your kids have them understand the importance of saving and not spending all their money if they were to get 2 million inheritance that they shouldn t buy lamborghinis and pop bottles that maybe they should buy some rental properties or invest in the stock market or think about things long term but knowledge and financial literacy is one of the key things especially when you start looking at the wealth gap and other areas like that isn t passed down in addition to the capital but the education so that they understand what to do with it and that they can pass that onto future generation is really how you ensure that your current family your future family that you may not know about or ever meet are all taken care of i believe all the fords for example are doing quite well because of one entrepreneurial individual who had the foresight to think in a way to plan for several generations down that s something that i think is really important for everyone especially important in our communities and has multiplicative effects over time
there are good reasons why robinhood investors like these stocks so much popular robinhood stocks and dividends might seem to go together like orange juice and toothpaste robinhood investors tend to like growth stocks that don t pay dividends and might never do so however there are probably more dividend stocks among the 100 most popular stocks on robinhood than you might think and several of them offer not only solid dividends but decent growth prospects as well here are three popular robinhood dividend stocks you can buy right now bank of america with so many fintech stocks to choose from it could be a little surprising that bank of america bac 1 58 ranks as the most widely held financial stock for robinhood investors bank of america isn t a stodgy bank stock though its shares have soared nearly 60 over the last 12 months and are up close to 40 so far this year the company offers a solid dividend that currently yields around 2 although bofa didn t increase its dividend in 2020 because of the effects of covid 19 it has boosted the dividend payout by an impressive 180 over the last five years some investors might be worried that bank of america missed revenue estimates in the second quarter of 2021 this rare miss was due primarily to lower than expected trading revenue in the company s investment banking unit the good news is that bofa s core banking business performed quite well bank of america should benefit as the global economy recovers from the covid 19 pandemic the company s investments in technology differentiate bofa from its peers robinhood investors like this bank stock for a good reason johnson johnson no other stock on robinhood s 100 most popular list comes with the dividend pedigree of johnson johnson jnj 0 90 the healthcare giant is a dividend king an elite group of s p 500 stocks that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years j j s streak of dividend hikes stands at 59 years in a row its dividend yields north of 2 4 johnson johnson provides stability that s nearly unmatched the company s diversification across healthcare certainly helps j j is a leader in consumer health medical devices and pharmaceuticals it has 28 different platforms or products that generated more than 1 billion in sales last year roughly 70 of its total revenue comes from products that are either no 1 or no 2 based on global market share to be sure johnson johnson faces some challenges the company has been embroiled in high profile litigation on multiple fronts sales are falling for its former top selling drug remicade due to biosimilar competition however j j has survived and thrived through more difficult times over the last 135 years its overall business continues to deliver solid growth there are few dividend stocks including those that aren t widely held by robinhood investors that are better choices to buy and hold over the long term than johnson johnson pfizer johnson johnson isn t the only big pharma stock that robinhood investors like pfizer pfe 0 59 is even more popular currently ranking no 14 on the trading platform s top 100 stocks list although pfizer isn t a member of dividend royalty like j j is the company offers an attractive dividend yield of 3 3 that yield topped 4 throughout the first several months of 2020 however pfizer s shares have soared over 30 year to date causing its dividend yield to decline you can probably guess why pfizer stock has performed so well the company s covid 19 vaccine has become a massive commercial success pfizer expects the vaccine will generate sales of 33 5 billion this year with its partner biontech receiving half of the profits that total will make the vaccine the biggest selling drug or vaccine in the world there are some uncertainties about how long the covid 19 vaccine gravy train will last some key patents for several of pfizer s drugs also expire later this decade however pfizer has other drugs that should generate strong growth it also has a huge and growing cash stockpile that it could and probably will use to make acquisitions
