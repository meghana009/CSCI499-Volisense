a coming stock split could be just what it takes for elon musk to get into the prestigious dow 30 the stock market is nothing if not tenacious on monday investors got another reminder of how critical it is not to let their long term investment strategies fall by the wayside after having fallen sharply early in 2022 stock markets have powered back and the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 and s p 500 gspc 1 20 have reached their best levels in roughly six weeks index daily percentage change daily point change dow 0 27 95 s p 500 0 71 32 nasdaq 1 31 186 the dow jones industrials have traditionally included some of the giants of american industry and for much of their early history the average lived up to its name by focusing largely on industrial and manufacturing giants time has caused the dow to evolve to include stocks from a much broader array of industries though and for more than a decade there haven t been any automakers represented among the 30 stocks that make the dow s cut with the latest news of a stock split from tesla tsla 5 59 however some believe that might be about to change trillion dollar tesla keeps climbing shares of tesla finished monday up more than 8 that pushed the electric vehicle ev pioneer s market capitalization above 1 13 trillion cementing ceo elon musk s status as the richest person in the world tesla announced that it would seek authorization at its annual meeting of shareholders to do a stock split shareholder authorization is necessary because the company s articles of incorporation specify a limit to the number of outstanding shares tesla can have and so effectuating the split would require more shares than tesla is currently allowed to have nowhere in tesla s filing with the u s securities and exchange commission sec did tesla give the ratio it intends to use for its split however some believe that it may use the same 5 for 1 ratio that it used when it previously split its shares in august 2020 will the price be right the split ratio is essentially meaningless in terms of the actual value of the company a higher ratio just means more shares worth less per share however the ratio is extremely important if tesla wants to become part of the dow the dow jones industrial average is a price weighted benchmark and tesla s current share price of nearly 1 100 per share would give it such disproportionate weight in the dow that it would be impractical however a 5 for 1 split would bring tesla s share price to around 220 and that would be quite consistent with several other current dow components tesla isn t the first company to raise speculation about some big changes to the dow both alphabet and amazon com announced future stock split plans earlier this year and the ratios they chose would potentially put an invitation to the dow within reach for them as well still tesla has something that both alphabet and amazon lack a tie to the dow s industrial roots with the dow kicking out general motors upon its filing for bankruptcy in 2009 adding tesla would help the dow return to its automotive roots but with its 21st century ev twist it ll take several months for all these stock splits to sort themselves out in the meantime investors can expect plenty of share price volatility amid speculation of a potential invitation to the dow jones industrials
with san jose vice mayor chappie jones terming out this year three candidates are vying to represent the residents of west san jose ramona snyder president of the san jose downtown foundation board rosemary kamei a santa clara county board of education trustee and tim gildersleeve a paratransit operator are facing off for the district 1 seat on the san jose city council the area is surrounded by sunnyvale campbell saratoga and cupertino encompassing the winchester neighborhoods and santana row to the north all the way down to the westgate area with westmont high school at the southern border like the rest of the city district 1 residents contend with increasing housing costs homelessness and residential and commercial growth near urban villages residents here often worry about public safety quality of life and community engagement as infrastructure changes ramona snyder is pictured in this file photo photo courtesy of ramona snyder ramona snyder district 1 has very active and strong neighborhood groups that participate in city decisions snyder said so her no 1 priority is ensuring that resident concerns and desires are heard at the city level snyder 52 has not held an elected office before and works for entertainment company legion m she has raised 24 048 and spent 5 482 according to her latest campaign filings she is a moderate democrat endorsed by silicon valley biz pac former councilmember johnny khamis and mayoral candidate and councilmember dev davis she tends to lean more conservative in her positions as a community leader you learn more about what s going on within city politics and issues and what the residents are upset about snyder told san josé spotlight you also see your residents get frustrated because they feel like they re not being listened to snyder has lived in the district since she was two and served on numerous boards and commissions for over a decade like the d1 leadership group d1 decides participatory budgeting committee and on the city s art committee in that time she has seen the tangible impacts of her advocacy and leadership like the construction of two parks snyder said it was those experiences and her deep love for her community that prompted her to run it is not something i ve ever even put on my radar snyder said but i realized in order to make more of an impact you have to step up to a council position so that you can really represent your residents her top priorities are increasing policing mental health services particularly in an effort to solve the homelessness crisis and the city s housing stock snyder wants to increase the community emergency response teams so residents are prepared for any emergency or disaster i m coming in with a whole new perspective and think outside the box but with the know how and bridge building skills to get things done snyder said i want san jose to be the safest cleanest and most vibrant large city in america rosemary kamei is featured in this file photo photo courtesy of rosemary kamei rosemary kamei kamei a politico of 30 years said her priorities are quality of life housing and development especially affordable housing and public health and safety kamei has held a variety of seats from serving on morgan hill s planning commission and the valley water board of directors to teaching urban planning at san jose state university she said the diversity of those experiences is what makes her qualified to be the next councilmember in district 1 after being appointed to the santa clara county board of education in 2015 she won reelection in 2016 and 2020 i ve been in the nonprofit world and small business world kamei told san josé spotlight i bring a lens as a multi ethnic multicultural person who understand the change in communities and culture but also the struggles of making payroll for example kamei 63 said she s raised at least 30 000 and spent about 6 000 she is a democrat endorsed by the south bay labor council the current officeholder jones and several local democrats such as congressman ro khanna and state asm evan low she is considered more progressive in her policies she emphasized the district is in a unique location because it is bordered by many west valley cities and suggested having public annual joint meetings with each neighboring city so they could work together to move forward one or two local priorities partnering with other cities would also help address the homeless crisis she said because local cities wouldn t be working in silos kamei said she d also like to see more public outdoor events in the district such as farmers markets or music events i want to bring opportunities for people to engage with each other again kamei said especially because there s been a lot of personal isolation since the pandemic tim gildersleeve is pictured in this file photo photo courtesy of tim gildersleeve s campaign site tim gildersleeve gildersleeve 60 is a paratransit operator who quietly joined the race he has unsuccessfully sought a number of local and state campaigns since 2014 gildersleeve is a registered as no party preference which he believes sets him apart from other candidates he is not fundraising and said he will spend under 2 000 gildersleeve has not received any endorsements he said he s spent nearly two decades working with the poor elderly and disabled community as a paratransit operator which allowed him to see all of san jose and inspired him to run gildersleeve emphasized how central his christian faith is in his decision to run i take helping people as very important in my life by being a city council member i would have a greater opportunity to help many more people gildersleeve told san josé spotlight gildersleeve s priorities are ensuring police are adequately funded supporting affordable housing and providing additional services for the city s unhoused and mentally ill communities join san josé spotlight s election reader panel we re looking for readers to talk about what they want to see in city government and their next leaders if you re interested email power balance the election in district 1 is unique in that it could shift the power dynamic of the san jose city council jones a former apple executive has aligned with the business faction often voting with mayor sam liccardo the mayor lost his narrow 6 5 majority when labor friendly councilmember david cohen flipped the district 4 seat in 2020 now labor leaders are hoping to win another one in district 1 while business interests will likely spend significant amounts of money to save the seat the three candidates will face off in the june 7 primary hear from the district 1 candidates during san josé spotlight s forum on april 7 contact jana kadah at or jana_kadah on

wall street s regulator is considering changes to stock market rules to increase competition for orders and improve deals for retail investors according to its top official gary gensler and industry executives the u s securities and exchange commission sec is scrutinizing the practice of payment for order flow pfof in which wholesale market markers pay brokers like td ameritrade schw n robinhood markets hood o and e trade to route retail customer orders to them instead of to exchanges the sec review could lead to the biggest shake up of u s equity market rules in over a decade robinhood makes around 75 of its revenue from pfof the trading app and others say the practice on average gives retail investors a fractionally better deal than exchanges allowing them to drop commissions and democratize investing critics say payment for order flow can create conflicts of interest and also encourages brokers to add video game like bells and whistles to their apps and websites that prompt investors to trade more which boosts the broker s profit but is rarely the best investment strategy britain canada and australia have banned pfof and gensler suggested in august that the sec could go that route pfof drew new scrutiny last year when an army of retail investors went on a buying spree of meme stocks like gamestop and amc squeezing hedge funds that had shorted the shares many purchased the shares using commission free brokers like robinhood that accept pfof from a few powerful market makers the largest citadel securities says it controls 35 to 40 of all u s retail order flow virtu financial controls about 25 according to an analysis of sec data by bestex research the sec is exploring whether retail brokers are sending pfof customer orders to the wholesaler paying them the most rather than the venue that offers the best deal when one party is paying a platform for the order flow that can be in conflict with a retail customer getting best execution sec chair gensler said in an interview they re not getting order by order competition some brokers like fidelity say they can get good stock prices for customers and offer free stock trading without accepting pfof a robinhood spokeswoman pointed to a study by two massachusetts institute of technology professors who found robinhood customers enjoyed more than 8 billion in price improvements from 2020 2021 thanks to pfof a spokesperson for td ameritrade said the current market structure delivers great outcomes for investors and the company supports efforts to make it even better a pfof ban is on the table gensler told reuters but he said the practice is also just a symptom of a broader problem exchanges are not competing on an equal footing with the off exchange market where around 40 50 of trading takes place the national benchmark for measuring the best deal is flawed because it does not include these off exchange trades he added here s the focus around new market structure rules how might we promote a more level playing field gensler said the sec is also mulling making it easier for exchanges to compete with market makers for orders by allowing exchanges to offer sub penny pricing and by changing the definition of best execution said gensler and other industry executives several executives said they doubted the sec would actually ban pfof virtu financial ceo doug cifu said his firm would be one of many to challenge such a move in court pfof and rebates have really fostered incredible innovation and competition in the marketplace cifu told reuters adding that if the sec bans the practice they are looking at a very long fight he and other industry executives said the sec should enhance retail brokers disclosures so small investors are better informed on the pros and cons of pfof gensler said the sec was also reviewing disclosures as long as it is transparent and disclosed i don t see a conflict said kirsten wegner ceo of the modern markets initiative which represents automated trading firms competitive boost investor advocates support better disclosures and also want to boost exchanges competitiveness to improve the reliability of the national pricing benchmark known as the national best bid and offer nbbo current best execution rules require retail brokers to route customer orders to a venue offering the best price displayed on the exchange or better and market makers typically improve on the best price by a fraction of a cent exchanges cannot offer sub penny quotes but the sec is considering allowing it it is also mulling a rule similar to one in canada requiring retail brokers to execute orders on an exchange unless the off exchange price is significantly better said dave lauer ceo of financial platform urvin finance and one other industry source with knowledge of the sec s thinking wholesalers provide a 15 improvement on the nbbo spread but moving retail flow to exchanges would narrow nbbo spreads by 25 according to research by hitesh mittal ceo of bestex research institutional investors and market makers would better compete with exchanges for retail flow by narrowing the bid offer spread he said ty eliasch executive director of investor trade healthy markets who has also discussed the issue with the sec said he expects the agency to clarify that best execution requires brokers to obtain the best available price rather than a fractional price improvement i expect it will say to the industry you have to give the customers the best prices he said source reuters reporting by katanga johnson in washington and john mccrank in new york editing by michelle price and david gregorio

john rich executive chairman of mhp discusses how the company is distributing food aid and maintaining its business in ukraine amid the russian invasion podcast mhp s ukraine operations continue with help from industry 46 05 ann reus hello and welcome to the feed strategy podcast i m your host feed strategy senior reporter ann reus john rich is the executive chairman of mhp the largest poultry and feed company in ukraine i spoke with him on the eve of the one month mark of russia s invasion of ukraine about a range of topics including how his company has continued operating inside ukraine and the challenges it faces the situation on the ground in the country and how people outside ukraine can help with the humanitarian crisis there mhp is based in kyiv but rich spoke to me from the balkans headquarters of its subsidiary in slovenia where mhp s financial team has been based since the start of the war although men between the ages of 18 and 60 cannot leave the country the whole team was able to move because it is made up entirely of women i started our conversation by asking him what he s hearing from mhp employees who are on the ground in ukraine john rich i think the key message is that all our senior management including yuriy kosiuk chief executive officer and a major shareholder they are actively working around the clock day in day out coping with a war situation i mean these guys never sleep and our employees have an amazing to be able to support us in producing poultry at the beginning of the war we were producing right at the beginning we were at maximum capacity of course and we were producing around about 2 200 tons a day at that particular time what happened over the first two weeks was that exports stop of course because the blockade by russian naval forces of the black sea ports so all exports of our grains and all exports of our poultry ceased exports across the border into the eu slowed down then stopped completely as you know so in the first two weeks we had to transition the business from first of all there was a psychological thing when you enter war everybody including europe the whole planet was except for very good intelligence by our military services i m speaking about the western military organizations they could see that there was a war coming but generally people are in in these sorts of things these situations are in denial so we had to when the war started we had to transition the company pretty quickly from denial into acceptance because unless you re in acceptance you can t operate properly so that was the first challenge on the psychology side but luckily due to covid the communications systems between individuals working at home different locations etc were all very well established which allowed the company to mobilize its people to different areas and where they were basically needed to conduct operations and i think that in mhp s case there are two big sides to this story firstly of course we went from being an exporter responsible for probably 5 to 6 of total global exports of poultry and switched into pretty much over the period of few weeks into 100 of the production of ukraine and the reason for that is that all the eastern parts of ukraine are affected by war far more than we are which is on the west we re relatively unaffected so this meant that a lot of poultry people that were operating they ran into logistical problems they couldn t get feed there was rail infrastructure that was destroyed the far east was a disaster there was direct evasion so what s happened and the big pork producers in the east from the poltava region back towards the east ceased operating and so consequently the food supply chain failed so mhp had to take up the gap so 100 of our production capacity was focused towards ukraine for food security reasons we couldn t export so that was relatively easy to switch mind you of course that in these sorts of situations you tend to produce more bulk poultry it s not packaged because you don t have access to packaging materials and all the things that you ve got to do in a poultry business when you go into what i call a war type situation what happened there was that the poultry was as soon as there was carpet bombing and the what i call 19th century technology applied to the 21st century on cities in ukraine we had an enormous refugee crisis and enormous number of women and children had to be moved particularly hospitals and schools were bombed as you know you know the story what s been depicted in the press is accurate and so and then technically today we have probably up to 30 of our total population of ukraine is displaced and roundabout three and a half million women and children have left and so the whole company is changed into a humanitarian type company right now we give away pro bono up to 400 tons of our production per day just to stop people starving so there s production but it s the distribution is the key you can produce something but if you can t distribute it it s useless luckily mhp about 50 of the domestic market of ukraine before the war had the distribution capabilities because we own the largest cold chain distribution operations in ukraine were able to mobilize that towards distributing food to all destinations including the outskirts of these bombed out cities such as sumi kharkiv mariupol i might add is a complete disaster you see that every day from the popular press but what we ve been able to do is to distribute a lot of our ready to eat type products value added further processed type products we ve switched production into these dramatically so that people when they get those products in the outskirts of these bombed out cities then they can eat them immediately do you understand they re starving so this whole situation to put it blunt changing a business model into from where we were to a humanitarian aid type situation from within a country is we ll write the textbooks about it later for sure but it s been an enormous challenge but if it wasn t for the patriotism of ukrainian people volunteers the assistance of the red cross this could not have been done i mean it s about the will of the people this is something that really has come through it s not the fighting side of every male between 18 through to 60 is effectively in the defense forces it s not about that it s about everybody else that s not in that line of fire are doing their bit to fight a war and when it comes to food security we originally had a deficit of drivers because driving these trucks into these areas is a logistical nightmare because we have 20 000 or 30 000 people on the ground with mobile phones and through this sort of network we ve been able to pick which roads are working which bridges are bombed which aren t whether there s military forces in one area versus another area and all this has been critical in allowing us to distribute poultry products through to these red zones we call them but then getting them through the red zone we can t do in most cases the red cross has been able to get some product through at certain areas in eastern ukraine obviously the high conflict areas such as mariupol where the russian forces are starving the population out well not much we can do except feed the people that are escaping outside of that area and feeding them as they get out of that area but really it s been huge a huge challenge reus aside from its poultry operations mhp also has crop and grain operations rich said the company produces 2 5 million to 3 million tons of grain per year ukraine is a significant producer and exporter of grains especially wheat corn and barley as well as sunflower oil according to the ministry of agrarian policy and food of ukraine the country exported 23 1 million tons of corn and 16 6 million tons of wheat in the 2021 22 marketing year together ukraine and russia export approximately 29 of the world s wheat exports and account for 90 of the world s corn exports so will ukraine be able to continue producing crops amid this conflict rich if you remember ukraine produced around about 80 million tons of grain last year but normalized it s about 60 to 65 million tons so last year was exceptional but it s all in storage as you know we didn t get the opportunity to export it all and so consequently of course a lot of the storage is in port areas and they ve slowly but surely been destroyed so you know you ve got this issue first of all storage of the grains that we did produce last year have been locked up in the country and some of them are some slowly but surely being destroyed the second issue i suppose you know for the company is is that not only our storage is full but then we ve got to produce a crop and we have to produce a crop and there s two reasons for that first of all is what i call general food security of ukraine we have to do that and we have a moral obligation to do that not only for ukraine but also a moral obligation to do this for food security globally particularly big companies like us why because look mhp is one of the biggest agribusinesses in europe it produced just in ukraine alone over 800 000 tons of poultry we produce between two and a half to 3 million tons of grain a year we produce between 200 000 to 250 000 through to 400 000 tons of sunflower oil so you know and as you know this area of ukraine and southern russia of course the so called breadbasket produces 25 to 27 of global wheat supplies it produces 50 of all sunflower and sunflower byproducts such as oil globally and 20 of rapeseed products 70 of barley for europe these things are critical and see you ve got a third dimension here on one side for wheat in particular for consumption in the middle east north africa and also all the way to indonesia you ve got that aspect and then you ve got the aspect which affects our industry as poultry people and that is feed that was going from ukraine and black sea into europe and that was a natural no brainer because of freight costs so this is all stopped as you know and this is it s a clear and present danger unfortunately for all poultry producers in europe and the united kingdom so i suppose here s this the quick and dirty for the poultry industry for all my colleagues that i might add have been incredibly incredibly supportive in europe and the united kingdom you know it s funny how a war draws people together and certainly has in the poultry industry in this particular case but the message is fairly clear a lot of the estimates that are being produced by a lot of you know very senior analysts i might add seem to predict that ukraine is still going to be able to produce a relatively large amount of grain this season the fact is this from somebody that knows what s happening on the ground the eastern areas and the southern areas of ukraine are generally higher wheat producers and so that country was used is used for winter wheat and often because of climatic issues spring wheat those areas are out of commission frankly it s the russian occupied areas in some cases the russian forces have destroyed all the equipment all the infrastructure it s been a scorched earth policy when we move through to the central areas and the western areas we don t have occupied forces there at present so that means that the land integrity is ok in mhp s case as you know we farm entire land holdings about 380 000 360 000 is generally in operation this year we ll be able to plant probably around about 340 000 approximately in other words we ve lost you know maybe 10 000 or 15 000 hectares in that order which are under russian occupation in that case we re in pretty much good shape the company always has because it s been a very successful company and has always had enormous liquidity it had already purchased all its fertilizer requirements all its crop protection products well 90 of it we had all our diesel we ve got everything in place to sow and plant so with the winter crops we are tilling now and so that s business as usual for all our unoccupied lands which is as i said 90 and when we re looking at spring crops we will be sowing within the next two weeks so we are starting to plant in the western and central areas of ukraine so we are an outlier frankly some companies within the poltava region towards the east probably have 80 of their lands occupied so totally different story so the bigger people generally are all committed to planting at present and they have the resources to be able to do it but the 80 20 rule is that that it s the small farmers which is from 500 hectares to 20 000 hectares for the bulk of the production of ukraine and those farmers in relatively unaffected areas by the war they have serious issues firstly they have an issue of the simple unavailability of fertilizers whether nitrogen or phosphates they just simply not available they have the unavailability of fuel crop protection products all these sorts of things they don t have so with the spring crop that s coming through they can probably till it but then fertilizing it and doing everything else at present is out of the reach of the smaller farmers and not even that if they could buy fertilizer they no longer have working capital lines from banks to be able to fund it even though the ukrainian government is trying to solve this issue by providing some funds to these farmers the availability is a huge problem and therein lies what i say the key assumption that everybody s making is they think those farmers are going to be able to grow and export i agree with the ukrainian agriculture minister this morning i think this is going to be very very challenging so the markets the pricing they think that maybe ukrainian grain production could be down 27 30 my estimation is that at present if this war stays the same and there is no major movement by russian forces then even under these situations it could be very challenging to i think it ll be significantly lower than what most analysts are saying so what does that mean it s the law of supply and demand that drives pricing on one side and the hedge funds and derivatives on the other so where the hedge funds have positioned themselves and where that is at present i don t know because i haven t been studying it but as far as supplies are concerned i think that it will be challenging out of ukraine and with sanctions on russia it depends upon the leakage around the sanctions some countries don t have sanctions and they will be able to acquire russian wheat through the system but then it depends upon additional sanctions that will be brought in by the europeans and the united states government which may make it impossible for even people that don t have sanctions to be able to receive wheat so it s highly volatile it s a clear and present danger and i just think that presently ann the grain supply situation is going to be very very challenging for european and for united kingdom producers i mean forget bali i just don t see that happening as you well know global wheat supply stocks are low last year there was a shortfall of 8 8 million tons and prices went up 22 in 2021 the shortage i believe could be 10 times that because of what s happening in our area and if that s the case i don t know where prices are going to go but it s going to be very dependent upon the el nino effects in the southern oceans as you know australia s just come out of massive floods a lot of its grain produced at the end of last year in some areas it s only just been harvested and very heavily affected by weather damage which means is not suitable for normal flour production so you ve got that issue in australia canada so far so good but with but then the flip side across into soy corn cycle in the americas and el nino in the americas is developing as it s clearly been shown in some of the rabobank reports and if it continues like that and it could because of the volcanic explosions in tonga and the cooling of the pacific waters you know we could have a challenging situation in the americas so for poultry producers it s nervous times as far as raw materials are concerned we just hope that it stays at the status quo and we are allowed to grow our crops and then exporting them will be incredibly challenging all the ports are closed just remember all the grain and oil everything went out through the ports there s only 600 000 tons of rail capacity between ukraine and europe so you know some grain exports go out this way towards europe particularly oil production once we get the gauges sorted out we re running 19th century gauges between ukraine and europe unbelievable three different gauges it s just unbelievable for the 21st century so you know logistics are very difficult to get into europe it s not an easy situation to resolve and manage and that s if we assume the status quo alright and i don t think the status quo will be maintained forever i think that there will be one major attempt by russian forces to try and take ukraine otherwise it will be seen globally as a complete failure and leave political issues running all the way through to the kremlin so i don t know how all this is going to end but at present we re planning to plant as normal we plan to produce poultry as normal to set aside the food security needs of the nation if we had surplus that was possible to export say to the middle east we would try to do so but there s so many ifs here as far as that s concerned at present it s impossible anyway because of export bans and the company has other challenges which are not dissimilar to what poultry companies in europe have it s about working capital now in our country to plant normally we would have short term facilities available for us for working capital for cropping but of course because of the war and martial law in ukraine and central bank regulations we can t raise working capital from normal banking lines because of what we call conditions present under war so that means we have to fund everything now mhp had a very good liquidity position because it came off the back of an extremely good year last year but we have to be careful about how we spend that money because if you ran out of money there is you don t have access to facilities so extremely cautious about the application of funds in that particular case we ve got to fund the complete cropping program for the whole year internally ok which we can do but it means that you know the normal businesses as normal is not normal and ukrainian central bank has regulations where we have to repatriate money from outside of ukraine into ukraine and then once it s in ukraine you can t get permission to send it out of ukraine to pay interest to banks or bondholders it s a force majeure situation reus how much of your workforce have you lost to either those who have gone off to fight or who have had to leave rich yeah around about approximately now i think it s about between 10 and 15 of our workforce has left to join the armed forces it obviously changes day by day but we ve been able to mhp s in a unique situation just because of demographics of ukraine and post perestroika from basically originating from world war ii there are always more women than men so a lot of senior positions were held by women in fact our workforce was orientated just slightly above 50 were women what s happened is that before the men have gone to war a lot of women have been retrained to take the men s position then so at the beginning we were anticipating problems but what s happened is that with a lot of other businesses that are closed other people have come join our workforce and so consequently our labor situation is good we haven t had a problem we re in relatively safe areas too which makes it obviously much easier the biggest issue we had originally was drivers these drivers have got to go into very dangerous situations right life threatening day in and day out we had a drop in the number of drivers a lot of those drivers went off to join the military but what s happened is that there s been a redistribution of labor in ukraine so now we have no shortage of drivers because people have decided that their duty in life is to drive these trucks with humanitarian aid and poultry across the country to feed their people so now that s happening which means that the situation three weeks ago that was looking serious is now balanced so as long as we maintain the status quo labor force is intact all our production facilities are intact the distribution system is intact the only thing that did suffer significant damage was rented facilities in this particular case the biggest cold store unit in ukraine which is north of kyiv was 100 000 ton capacity we rented space there well it was destroyed it was in two parts and russian missiles ground missiles were fired into it and destroyed both the facilities completely in attempt to destroy the food production distribution channel and starve the population and i might add it was pretty effective because most supermarkets use these facilities for distribution or to store so this meant that mhp had to take a major role now in assisting supermarkets that still are operating throughout the country to distribute food as simple as that so apart from rented facilities and loss of product associated with it which were published in our rns on the london stock exchange i think that we have some storage facilities of course in the southern areas odessa etc regions which are inaccessible due to logistics that s logistics meaning you can t get in and out can be either due to a conflict zone which it generally is which either held by ukrainians or a conflict zone is held russians but but apart from that the operations are running relatively normal as i speak reus in one of your recent updates on the london stock exchange you said you had to shift your feed production to mostly corn diet due to the port closures and other logistics can you tell me some more about that and what s needed to make a switch like that rich i can actually and what actually happened is that at the beginning of this disaster we had to close all our oil plants so all our protein plants which is which is sunflower we use sunflower as you know as a protein source we re one of the few in the world that do so and we don t use soy for broiler production we do have a soy plant but we use soy in the parent stock operations so everything had to be turned off because we couldn t export oil ok so no product that was the first week then the next issue was the logistical challenges of trying to get source and get critical vitamins minerals enzymes all these sorts of things into ukraine that was a huge logistical challenge to be able to get our supply in situ for this your readers have been of enormous help all the big international companies have assisted in ensuring that we have continuity of supply and a large number of them have been providing it pro bono in other words that is their contribution the poultry industry s contribution to helping us feed our people that is laudable no question and the message to everybody that s helped in that regard and there s not a single company that i think has not given us enormous support it is enormous thank you for being able to assist us as a company a lot of these companies you know it wasn t so long ago a couple of years ago we re all at war against each other but at least this particular war has drawn europe together and certainly has drawn the poultry industry together i think that my message to all those international companies and supporters is an enormous thank you because they have been instrumental in assisting mhp maintain the food supply chain within ukraine because without that logistically getting food into the country is extremely difficult and you would have mass starvation and that is a reality so as far as that s concerned what has happened since this assistance we managed to be able to get a rail link operating between our soy oil operations and europe this meant that we could reopen our soy plant which we ve done and export the oil across the border that s allowed us to get soybean meal into the rations right which then meant that our rations are much more balanced obviously now balanced properly so we went through a period of a couple of weeks with without we were just feeding corn and not much else and of course that s a disaster as you know nutritionally but that is now no longer a problem we can produce what we need within the country now as long as these facilities remain operating in other words they re not directly targeted or the rail links as you know there s a number of rail links between ukraine and western europe as long as they are not targeted by russian military forces then we will be able to continue to feed the birds properly reus are the supply chain disruptions affecting the availability of feed additives and other ingredients rich it is but we ve managed in other words now we seem to have got on top of it but that s all because of international help frankly i mean international company help they ve been doing everything they can to channel everything via poland in particular and romania and this has allowed us to be able to get our vitamins and our minerals and all those sorts of things into the country to feed the birds so that has been instrumental in us being able to operate within our country reus what do companies like yours need right now to continue operating and feeding the people of ukraine rich we ve got the grain in situ right because mhp tends to store its full year requirements so grain s not the issue and we have protein meal so i think if it s possible to open our sunflower plants in the future because of better logistics between europe and ukraine that will be of great assistance so it s something that s it s all about logistics right it just was not built for mass transit of goods from ukraine into europe via rail instead of port so not much can help there except enormous amount of effort by all european institutions and also the ukrainian government to be able to try and make that happen mhp s biggest issue i think is that when you re giving away 15 or so of your total production pro bono of course that comes at a large cost so originally a few weeks ago we were trying to work out ways of how you maintain the integrity of the food supply chain and distribution chain within the country the biggest alright for food security and humanitarian reasons how do you maintain that when you have no help because people that donate right they won t donate directly to a ukrainian company it just doesn t work that way they might donate to the red cross but i think that what has helped in the last few days we ve come to an in principle collaborative agreement with the united nations world food programme those people are highly professional highly recognized they understand conflict zones that s what they were formed for they have resources in poland they have some sort of infrastructure in ukraine so what we ve decided to do is to work with the world food programme we re going to provide our logistics to assist essential things coming into ukraine and distributed and they will also assist in mhp maintain the integrity of the whole food chain in ukraine so it s support from within because supporting from outside is a very difficult issue you can donate a can of baked beans take it to the polish border but to get it to kharkiv is not easy not without mhp s distribution system because it s the largest and one of the few that s left operating this collaboration i believe will be instrumental in helping mhp being able to do this and of course you know this means that for the services that we provide at least we get paid for it do you understand because i mean you can t continue this forever if it s a war of attrition for years of course you re not going to have the financial resources to be able to provide a country pro bono with its humanitarian aid reus what do you want people outside of ukraine to know about the situation there rich there is one really important message but it s to do with corporate governance alright this is a situation without precedent since world war ii and it is the biggest war in europe since world war ii people will dance around the words but a simple war of europe and it has the potential to spread outside of ukraine as well but not today you know because i believe that the forces that are in place in ukraine are battling to try and take ukraine so i don t think that you know unless there were there were other what i call unthinkable things happening as far as weaponry was concerned i think that you know the risks to other neighboring countries today are probably relatively low due to the inability of the russian army to move there but the problem i have corporate governance wise is that we re a listed london stock exchange company and there s a number of other listed companies big people that are in our space in ukraine now all of us have the same problem but mhp has a unique problem the bigger companies that are listed which are predominately sunflower crushers in particular just export oil have just stopped and that s it mhp just can t do that because it s got to feed the people so it has a massive role in food security to prevent starvation in the country and people are starving no question in this country and they are under enormous cold stress because it s still cold there and everybody s forgotten about the fifth horsemen of the apocalypse and that was pestilence right disease covid is still raging there and all their women and children have got it so you ve got this dimension in our case right we have a number of corporate responsibilities right clearly set out our responsibilities right we ve always under the u k corporate governance laws to all stakeholders that s a simple statement we re going to treat all stakeholders equally however when you are dealing with corporate governance issues in a time of war this textbook has not been written alright so what does the word responsibility mean in war when it comes to partners and to stakeholders and my messaging this week to everybody globally across the planet is that corporate governance has to it s got to be a little bit interpreted and reinvented a different way let me explain why when we talk about stakeholders most financial people think ok that s investors bondholders and banks right this is what they think but now thanks to recent changes in over the last decade people now see employees as stakeholders they see suppliers as stakeholders you know all the people that you touch right you have a responsibility as a stakeholder which is which has been incorporated into the corporate governance law which is good it s good alright and definitely in the west and particularly in europe and the united kingdom there s been very very strong messaging by the authorities that this has to be which i think is a is a great thing in a case of war right what does it mean for mhp as a listed company today when it comes to stakeholders and here you know that we ve got 30 000 people that work for mhp within ukraine under duress ok then what people forget is that a lot of their families lived in those bombed out cities they might have worked in the western area but their families were in the east so all these families that are refugees have then come to live with them so all of a sudden you might have been an employee with two to three people in the family and then now they ve got 10 they re supporting but these are the stakeholders these families so this is a war situation with refugees that nobody thought about and then you ve got suppliers of mhp and what does that mean well it s not only materials you know plastics and this and that it s also farmers because farmers also supply mhp a large amount of sunflower as an example and soy because we re one of the biggest crushers in ukraine so these farmers they are our stakeholders as well and then on top of that mhp as you know land is leased in ukraine it s not purchased and it came from the old cooperative perestroika system so we have 200 000 land holders that we pay lease fees to every quarter which they rely on that money to survive in the villages so then when you add up all our stakeholders there s over a quarter of a million people so in a war situation right you ve got to support them right you have to support our staff so there s a humanitarian issue to this a massive one so then you get conflicts i believe the biggest issue is that we as a group right have to be together as partners and this togetherness is critical because we re all equal some needs are greater than others you know starvation children starving these sorts of things you know are they more equal do you understand this is the moral dilemma i believe of what when we wrote corporate governance law we never anticipated world war iii in europe so for us to me we ve got to treat everybody equally no question alright and this is sometimes hard to get across to finance institutions ok that might be sitting in their lounge chairs in new york you know this is a concept that they can t imagine because they re not there to see it and experience it so my thesis is this that everybody must be in this team equally together they must alright it is our moral obligation and you know i think that if we ve got this you ve got to remember that unity for all of us is the strength the best way for the country and our company to survive is through unity alright division is a weakness is a disaster and then the country and the company fails if there s disunity between all stakeholders and at stake here is just a bigger bigger picture at stake today what we re fighting for ukraine and what europe is now fighting for is our ability to maintain a democracy in europe for the future so this is a big deal it s about corporate governance alright at the end of the day the message has got to be everybody s got to be treated equally no question that all people have to understand that our social responsibility is here to the people of ukraine alright and also co laterally to people that we export to outside of ukraine that such as the mena regions in relation to food security is critical alright so everybody s got to work together to solve this particular problem and support each other that way you guarantee the continuity of the sovereign state of ukraine and preserve the companies within it reus if people want to help ukraine with charitable donations what groups should they give to rich red cross without question is doing a very good job because it s direct to people in need you know particularly on the medical front you ve had hospitals and schools bombed out i mean it s just dreadful these atrocities and the red cross is trying really hard to manage that and it s difficult and they re doing a very good job of trying to get into zones that we can t get into right and we assist the red cross that way we provide fuel where we can we help fuel buses getting refugees back out again all these sorts of things are often done with the red cross with the world food programme i think it s at present a much better and more centralized way to do this because what the world food programme is trying to do sure it s providing some food to the borders but logistically getting into the country is difficult and then distributing it is very difficult so i think that the best way to help mhp in many ways is to support the world food programme system because they have a mandate to be able to preserve the integrity of the ukrainian existing food system for the future ok in other words to preserve the ability of ukraine to feed itself that is critical and i believe in that mandate so my short answer is that by working with the world food programme and they re extremely professional people and been in business for a long long time as a united nations arm probably is one of the best ways that mhp and the country can be supported at this time where we re using the concept of feeding from within and distributing from within reus and if you would like to contribute to the world food programme you can do so at wfp org you can donate to the red cross at redcross org i would like to extend a big thank you to john rich mhp s executive chairman for speaking with me about the situation in ukraine and also thank you to the audience for listening this is ann reus for feed strategy

10 year government bond yield around or near zero markets were wondering if commitment to that policy was wavering amid concerns over rising inflation catril said but the central bank s move to buy the jgbs sent a strong signal that ycc is here to stay for a while yet that pushed the yen to a seven year low of 125 against the dollar on monday but it later regained some ground to a six year low

reuters photo file raindrops hang on a sign for wall street outside the new york stock exchange in manhattan in new york city new york us october 26 2020 reuters mike segar file photo by david randall davide barbuscia and saqib iqbal ahmed new york reuters the spread between the yields of five year and 30 year us treasuries turned negative for the first time since 2006 on monday as investors price in an aggressive rate hiking plan by the federal reserve as it attempts to bring inflation down from 40 year highs the shape of the yield curve is a key metric investors watch as it impacts other asset prices feeds through to banks returns and has been an indicator of how the economy will fare recent moves have reflected investor worries over whether the fed can tighten monetary policy to tame inflation without hurting economic growth investors watch parts of the yield curve as recession indicators primarily the spread between the yield on three month treasury bills and 10 year notes and the us two year to 10 year curve however these two have veered in opposite directions causing some confusion as to how accurate a recession signal they are giving other parts of the curve are lesser watched such as the spread between five and 30 year treasuries which inverted on monday and has also inverted prior to some recessions here is a quick primer explaining what a steep flat or inverted yield curve means and how it has in the past predicted recession and what it might be signaling now what should the curve look like the us treasury finances federal government budget obligations by issuing various forms of debt the 23 trillion treasury market includes treasury bills with maturities from one month out to one year notes from two years to 10 years as well as 20 and 30 year bonds the yield curve plots the yield of all treasury securities typically the curve slopes upwards because investors expect more compensation for taking on the risk that rising inflation will lower the expected return from owning longer dated bonds that means a 10 year note typically yields more than a two year note because it has a longer duration yields move inversely to prices a steepening curve typically signals expectations of stronger economic activity higher inflation and higher interest rates a flattening curve can mean the opposite investors expect rate hikes in the near term and have lost confidence in the economy s growth outlook what does an inverted curve mean the us curve has inverted before each recession since 1955 with a recession following between six and 24 months later according to a 2018 report by researchers at the federal reserve bank of san francisco it offered a false signal just once in that time the last time the 2 10 part of the yield curve inverted was in 2019 the following year the united states entered a recession albeit one caused by the global pandemic why is the yield curve inverting now yields of short term u s government debt have been rising rapidly this year reflecting expectations of a series of rate hikes by the us federal reserve while longer dated government bond yields have moved at a slower pace amid concerns that policy tightening may hurt the economy as a result the shape of the treasury yield curve has been generally flattening and in some cases inverting parts of the yield curve namely five to 10 and three to 10 years inverted last week the spread between five and 30 year us treasury yields on monday fell to as low as minus 7 basis points bps moving below zero for the first time since february 2006 according to refinitiv data the spread has collapsed from a positive 53 bps at the start of this month the 5 30 year spread inverted prior to the 2008 09 recession and prior to the 2001 recession but not prior to the pandemic induced 2020 recession yield curve inversions and recessions in the overnight index swaps ois market the yield curve between two and 10 year swap rates inverted for the first time since late 2019 and last stood at minus 4 bps according to refinitiv data the closely watched gap between yields on two and widely seen to predict a recession when it inverts was at 12 1 basis points the spread was at 24 basis points 10 days ago are we getting mixed signals still another closely monitored part of the curve has been giving off a different signal the spread between the yield on three month treasury bills and 10 year notes this month has been widening causing some to doubt a recession is imminent meanwhile the two year 10 year yield curve has technical issues and not everyone is convinced the flattening curve is telling the true story they say the fed s bond buying program of the last two years has resulted in an undervalued us 10 year yield that will rise when the central bank starts shrinking its balance sheet steepening the curve us benchmark 10 year yields pushed above the 2 5 marker to 2 55 monday hitting their highest since april 2019 in february they topped the 2 level for the first time since 2019 yield curve inversions and recessions researchers at the fed meanwhile put out a paper on march 25 that suggested that the predictive power of the spreads between 2 and 10 year treasuries to signal a coming recession is probably spurious and suggested that a better herald of a coming economic slowdown is the spread of treasuries with maturities of less than 2 years what does this mean for the real world while rate increases can be a weapon against inflation they can also slow economic growth by increasing the cost of borrowing for everything from mortgages to car loans aside from signals it may flash on the economy the shape of the yield curve has ramifications for consumers and business when short term rates increase us banks tend to raise their benchmark rates for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans including small business loans and credit cards making borrowing more expensive for consumers mortgage rates also rise when the yield curve steepens banks are able to borrow money at lower interest rates and lend at higher interest rates conversely when the curve is flatter they find their margins squeezed which may deter lending

san francisco and suzhou china march 28 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today announced the first patient dosing for its proprietary recombinant bispecific antibody targeting claudin18 2 and cd3 r d code ibi389 in a phase i clinical trial for the treatment of advanced malignancies the study nct05164458 is an open multicenter phase 1a 1b study evaluating the safety tolerability and efficacy of ibi389 monotherapy or combination therapy in the treatment of advanced solid tumors cd3 targeted bispecific antibodies cd3 bsabs or t cell engager tce are emerging novel therapeutic modalities in cancer immunotherapy in recent years tce redirects t cells to tumor cells by simultaneously binding tumor associated antigen taa expressed on tumor cells and cd3 expressed on t cells thus inducing t cell killing of tumor cells differentiated from conventional immunotherapies cd3 bsabs provoke a stronger immune response through cd3 activated t cells without the binding of the t cell receptor tcr to the major histocompatibility complex mhc peptide complex and also do not rely on t cell activated co stimulatory signals ibi389 has the potential to efficiently and selectively kill cldn18 2 expressing tumor cells increasing lymphocytic tumor infiltration and enhancing tumor immune response while possessing a low risk of crs cytokine release syndrome preclinical results showed that ibi389 exhibited significant antitumor effects and could bound to tumor cells even in cell lines with low cldn18 2 expression and is promising to treat patient populations with low to moderate cldn18 2 expression where conventional antibodies are found limited response the principal investigator of the study professor feng bi director of the department of abdominal oncology and director of the molecular targeted therapy research unit at west china hospital of sichuan university pointed out in recent years cldn18 2 has become one of the most topical r d areas in molecular biology and preliminary efficacy results in some clinical studies demonstrated encouraging druggablity of this target ibi389 bispecific antibody distinguishes itself from traditional monoclonal antibodies by encouraging t cell infiltration and killing of tumors thus enhancing the antitumor effect as a single agent we are looking forward to the positive results of ibi389 in patients with cldn18 2 expressing solid tumors dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent said ibi389 marks an exciting start for innovent in the tce field the scientists of innovent academy has accomplished sophisticated research screen and design work in drug discovery stage and the results of preclinical studies show that ibi389 has a potent anti tumor effect with a good safety profile we believe that as a differentiated molecule targeting cldn18 2 ibi389 will bring benefits to patients with advanced gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer even with low cldn18 2 expression about ibi389 ibi389 is an anti cldn18 2 cd3 bispecific antibody discovered and developed by innovent it induces immune synapse formations by linking cd3 molecules in t cell receptor complexes and cldn18 2 antigens on the surfaces of tumor cells therefore ibi389 stimulates t cell activation resulting in cytolytic protein production inflammatory cytokine release and further t cell proliferation which eventually leads to durable anti tumor effects about claudin 18 2 claudin protein is a critical component of tight junction complex molecules which play an important role in the life activities of the human body claudin18 2 is a member of the claudin protein family which is a highly tissue specific protein expressed only in differentiated epithelial cells on the gastric mucosa under normal physiological conditions previous studies have revealed that claudin18 2 is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer such as gastric cancer pancreatic cancer esophageal adenocarcinoma and colorectalcancer the unique feature of limited expression in normal tissues and highly specific expression in cancer makes claudin18 2 an ideal target for developing the immunotherapeutic for solid tumors globally there are many candidate therapies in clinical development the drug modalities under development include monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies antibody conjugated drugs and car t cell products however currently no drug targeting claudin18 2 has been approved about gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma gastric and pancreatic cancer are both malignant tumors of the digestive system that seriously endanger human life and health the latest global cancer statistics show that there will be about 1 089 million new cases of gastric cancer worldwide in 2020 accounting for 5 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 768 000 deaths accounting for 7 7 of the global cancer deaths there are about 495 000 new cases of pancreatic cancer accounting for 2 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 466 000 deaths accounting for 4 7 of the global cancer deaths according to the national cancer statistics released by the national cancer center of china in 2019 the incidence of gastric cancer in china in 2015 was about 403 000 accounting for 10 26 of the total cancer incidence second only to lung cancer at 20 03 with an incidence rate of 29 31 100 000 people and about 291 000 deaths accounting for 12 45 of the total cancer deaths behind lung and liver cancer with a mortality rate of 21 16 100 000 people in 2015 the number of cases and deaths of pancreatic cancer nationwide were 95 000 and 85 000 respectively ranking the 10th and 6th in the incidence and mortality of malignant tumors the mortality ratio of pancreatic cancer was 0 89 making it a true king of cancer despite the treatment progress in recent years drug resistance recurrence and metastasis are still inevitable the 5 year survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer is about 5 20 and the median survival rate is about 10 months pancreatic cancer has a worse prognosis with a 5 year survival rate of only 6 to 8 about innovent inspired by the spirit of start with integrity succeed through action innovent s

san francisco and suzhou china march 28 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today announced the first patient dosing for its proprietary recombinant bispecific antibody targeting claudin18 2 and cd3 r d code ibi389 in a phase i clinical trial for the treatment of advanced malignancies the study nct05164458 is an open multicenter phase 1a 1b study evaluating the safety tolerability and efficacy of ibi389 monotherapy or combination therapy in the treatment of advanced solid tumors cd3 targeted bispecific antibodies cd3 bsabs or t cell engager tce are emerging novel therapeutic modalities in cancer immunotherapy in recent years tce redirects t cells to tumor cells by simultaneously binding tumor associated antigen taa expressed on tumor cells and cd3 expressed on t cells thus inducing t cell killing of tumor cells differentiated from conventional immunotherapies cd3 bsabs provoke a stronger immune response through cd3 activated t cells without the binding of the t cell receptor tcr to the major histocompatibility complex mhc peptide complex and also do not rely on t cell activated co stimulatory signals ibi389 has the potential to efficiently and selectively kill cldn18 2 expressing tumor cells increasing lymphocytic tumor infiltration and enhancing tumor immune response while possessing a low risk of crs cytokine release syndrome preclinical results showed that ibi389 exhibited significant antitumor effects and could bound to tumor cells even in cell lines with low cldn18 2 expression and is promising to treat patient populations with low to moderate cldn18 2 expression where conventional antibodies are found limited response the principal investigator of the study professor feng bi director of the department of abdominal oncology and director of the molecular targeted therapy research unit at west china hospital of sichuan university pointed out in recent years cldn18 2 has become one of the most topical r d areas in molecular biology and preliminary efficacy results in some clinical studies demonstrated encouraging druggablity of this target ibi389 bispecific antibody distinguishes itself from traditional monoclonal antibodies by encouraging t cell infiltration and killing of tumors thus enhancing the antitumor effect as a single agent we are looking forward to the positive results of ibi389 in patients with cldn18 2 expressing solid tumors dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent said ibi389 marks an exciting start for innovent in the tce field the scientists of innovent academy has accomplished sophisticated research screen and design work in drug discovery stage and the results of preclinical studies show that ibi389 has a potent anti tumor effect with a good safety profile we believe that as a differentiated molecule targeting cldn18 2 ibi389 will bring benefits to patients with advanced gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer even with low cldn18 2 expression about ibi389 ibi389 is an anti cldn18 2 cd3 bispecific antibody discovered and developed by innovent it induces immune synapse formations by linking cd3 molecules in t cell receptor complexes and cldn18 2 antigens on the surfaces of tumor cells therefore ibi389 stimulates t cell activation resulting in cytolytic protein production inflammatory cytokine release and further t cell proliferation which eventually leads to durable anti tumor effects about claudin 18 2 claudin protein is a critical component of tight junction complex molecules which play an important role in the life activities of the human body claudin18 2 is a member of the claudin protein family which is a highly tissue specific protein expressed only in differentiated epithelial cells on the gastric mucosa under normal physiological conditions previous studies have revealed that claudin18 2 is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer such as gastric cancer pancreatic cancer esophageal adenocarcinoma and colorectalcancer the unique feature of limited expression in normal tissues and highly specific expression in cancer makes claudin18 2 an ideal target for developing the immunotherapeutic for solid tumors globally there are many candidate therapies in clinical development the drug modalities under development include monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies antibody conjugated drugs and car t cell products however currently no drug targeting claudin18 2 has been approved about gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma gastric and pancreatic cancer are both malignant tumors of the digestive system that seriously endanger human life and health the latest global cancer statistics show that there will be about 1 089 million new cases of gastric cancer worldwide in 2020 accounting for 5 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 768 000 deaths accounting for 7 7 of the global cancer deaths there are about 495 000 new cases of pancreatic cancer accounting for 2 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 466 000 deaths accounting for 4 7 of the global cancer deaths according to the national cancer statistics released by the national cancer center of china in 2019 the incidence of gastric cancer in china in 2015 was about 403 000 accounting for 10 26 of the total cancer incidence second only to lung cancer at 20 03 with an incidence rate of 29 31 100 000 people and about 291 000 deaths accounting for 12 45 of the total cancer deaths behind lung and liver cancer with a mortality rate of 21 16 100 000 people in 2015 the number of cases and deaths of pancreatic cancer nationwide were 95 000 and 85 000 respectively ranking the 10th and 6th in the incidence and mortality of malignant tumors the mortality ratio of pancreatic cancer was 0 89 making it a true king of cancer despite the treatment progress in recent years drug resistance recurrence and metastasis are still inevitable the 5 year survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer is about 5 20 and the median survival rate is about 10 months pancreatic cancer has a worse prognosis with a 5 year survival rate of only 6 to 8 about innovent inspired by the spirit of start with integrity succeed through action innovent s

are banks the best stocks to own and are they inoculated against the economic cycles kenyan banks have defied the ravages of the covid 19 pandemic to report huge profits for a second year is this a sign of post covid recovery or are there other underlying factors why so much profit in a highly regulated sector are banks the best stocks to own and are they inoculated against the economic cycles when the economy is doing well we borrow to invest or consume when the economy is doing badly we borrow to bridge the gap in our incomes in both cases banks make money from charging interest but it s more than that for kenyan banks let s try and objectively explain what s happening using crowdsourced knowledge and wisdom one we could argue the worst of the covid 19 pandemic is over after mass vaccination and people getting used to it the profits could signal things are getting back to normal after all the financial sector read banks determine the pulse of the economy didn t we shed off the masks and other restrictions two it s possible that we have borrowed a lot to recover from covid 19 induced losses that money has earned interest for banks the pandemic brought job losses as businesses closed down are we borrowing to revive such businesses three banks cut costs by merging branches and moving to alternative channels like internet banking i do not recall when i was last in a banking hall they also sent home workers because of the greater adoption of technology does this mean that banks are yet to feel the effect of online lending platforms that recently got into the radar of the central bank of kenya cbk or did they learn from them is kenya ripe for virtual banks technology seems to suggest that this is the future such online platforms should just get banking licences is that what cbk implied with the central bank amendment act 2021 the act which came into force on december 23 2021 if yes the future has arrived prematurely in the banking sector that is something to celebrate four banks did not pay dividends during the covid 19 period as advised by the central bank are they reaping the dividends of a good regulatory framework does the law allow shareholders to claim dividend arrears five the government has been borrowing heavily internally from banks such a demand raises interest rates and bank profits we know many banks found refuge in government paper at the height of the pandemic six could the adoption of a new accounting standard ifrs 9 have led to reduced provisions for loans hence the higher profits ifrs 9 gives banks liberty on how to deal with provisions for non performing loans seven an interesting observation is that some banks have lots of uninformed borrowers information asymmetry who just borrow and cry later over high interests such borrowers could have contributed to the banks bottom line eight could it be a sign that our banks are better managed and by extension good at reducing waste and making better investment decisions remember you do not just become a bank ceo congrats to my former students who are bank ceos nine banks might have benefited from regional diversification our banks have done the country proud by going beyond the borders into neighbouring countries they are real multinationals since countries reacted differently to covid 19 the economic effect was different and so was the impact on the baking sector ten what percentage of this profit is from other charges if you ever get a mortgage or a loan you are probably conversant with other charges yet most charges were waived during covid 19 eleven some say in whispers that ownership could be a factor in profitability who are the key shareholders of the leading banks in kenya twelve our banks could be making lots of money because they are too few they have successfully peddled a myth that kenya is overbanked the regulator raised the minimum capitalisation leading to some consolidation we need more banks particularly community banks microfinance banks could have played the role of community banks but they have not didn t we import the us constitution why not import some aspects of the american financial system like community banks finally what magic did president mwai kibaki do to bring down interest rates and stimulate the economy what did we learn from our bold attempt to control interest rates

new york reuters the u s treasury yield curve inverted on tuesday for the first time since 2019 as investors priced in an aggressive rate hiking plan by the federal reserve as it attempts to bring inflation down from 40 year highs here is a quick primer explaining what a steep flat or inverted yield curve means and how it has in the past predicted recession and what it might be signaling now what should the curve look like the u s treasury finances federal government budget obligations by issuing various forms of debt the 23 trillion treasury market includes treasury bills with maturities from one month out to one year notes from two years to 10 years as well as 20 and 30 year bonds the yield curve plots the yield of all treasury securities typically the curve slopes upwards because investors expect more compensation for taking on the risk that rising inflation will lower the expected return from owning longer dated bonds that means a 10 year note typically yields more than a two year note because it has a longer duration yields move inversely to prices a steepening curve typically signals expectations of stronger economic activity higher inflation and higher interest rates a flattening curve can mean the opposite investors expect rate hikes in the near term and have lost confidence in the economy s growth outlook what does an inverted curve mean investors watch parts of the yield curve as recession indicators primarily the spread between the yield on three month treasury bills and 10 year notes and the u s two year to 10 year 2 10 curve on tuesday the 2 10 part of the curve inverted meaning yields on the 2 year treasury were actually higher than the 10 year treasury that is a warning light to investors that a recession could follow u s treasury yield curve inverts the u s curve has inverted before each recession since 1955 with a recession following between six and 24 months according to a 2018 report by researchers at the federal reserve bank of san francisco it offered a false signal just once in that time according to anu gaggar global investment strategist for commonwealth financial network who looked at the 2 10 part of the curve there have been 28 instances since 1900 where the yield curve has inverted in 22 of these episodes a recession has followed the lag between curve inversion and the start of a recession has averaged about 22 months but has ranged from 6 to 36 months for the last six recessions she wrote the last time the 2 10 part of the yield curve inverted was in 2019 the following year the united states entered a recession albeit one caused by the global pandemic yield curve inversions and recessions why is the yield curve inverting now yields of short term u s government debt have been rising quickly this year reflecting expectations of a series of rate hikes by the u s federal reserve while longer dated government bond yields have moved at a slower pace amid concerns policy tightening may hurt the economy as a result the shape of the treasury yield curve has been generally flattening and in some cases inverting other parts of the yield curve have also inverted including the spread between five and 30 year u s treasury yields which this week moved below zero for the first time since february 2006 according to refinitiv data are we getting mixed signals still another closely monitored part of the curve has been giving off a different signal the spread between the yield on three month treasury bills and 10 year notes this month has been widening causing some to doubt a recession is imminent meanwhile the two year 10 year yield curve has technical issues and not everyone is convinced the flattening curve is telling the true story they say the fed s bond buying program of the last two years has resulted in an undervalued u s 10 year yield that will rise when the central bank starts shrinking its balance sheet steepening the curve researchers at the fed meanwhile put out a paper on march 25 that suggested the predictive power of the spreads between 2 and 10 year treasuries to signal a coming recession is probably spurious and suggested a better herald of a coming economic slowdown is the spread of treasuries with maturities of less than 2 years what does this mean for the real world while rate increases can be a weapon against inflation they can also slow economic growth by increasing the cost of borrowing for everything from mortgages to car loans aside from signals it may flash on the economy the shape of the yield curve has ramifications for consumers and business when short term rates increase u s banks tend to raise their benchmark rates for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans including small business loans and credit cards making borrowing more expensive for consumers mortgage rates also rise when the yield curve steepens banks are able to borrow money at lower interest rates and lend at higher interest rates conversely when the curve is flatter they find their margins squeezed which may deter lending additional reporting by daniel burns editing by megan davies nick zieminski and andrea ricci by david randall davide barbuscia and

in this installment of the tristate tax alert the focus is recent developments in new jersey both developments involve refund claims so this is a friendly reminder that new jersey s extended refund deadline due to covid 19 expires on april 1 2022 more on that below update from new jersey on the shechtel decision it has been more than a year since the new jersey division of taxation suffered a litigation loss when the new jersey appellate court held that the federal at risk rules of i r c 465 apply for purposes of determining a partner s gross income tax git liability shechtel v dir div of tax n 32 n j tax 180 app div 2020 cert denied 245 n j 258 2021 what that means is that for git purposes a partner with at risk losses must follow the same timing rules that apply under federal law as a result of the federal at risk limitations the taxpayer in shechtel had a suspended loss on his 2009 federal return that loss became available for use on his 2010 federal return but according to the division since the git statutes expressly prohibit individual taxpayers from applying losses from one tax year to offset income in another tax year the division would not allow the taxpayer to claim the suspended loss on his 2010 git return instead the division took the position that the suspended loss should have been claimed on the 2009 git return a return year that was closed to adjustment by the time of the audit as recognized by the appellate court the problem with the division s position is that the git statutes require that a taxpayer s accounting method for purposes of the git shall be the same as their accounting method for federal income tax purposes and i r c 465 is located squarely within the sections of the internal revenue code that are designated methods of accounting i r c 446 475 the appellate court further found there was no violation of the git prohibition on applying losses from one year against income from a later year because under the applicable federal accounting method there was no loss that could be applied in 2009 for federal purposes the loss did not become available until 2010 after an unsuccessful attempt to have the new jersey supreme court review the appellate court decision in 2021 the division issued its position on the shechtel decision in a january 19 2022 news release stating the shechtel decision determined that for new jersey gross income tax nj git purposes taxpayers should follow the irc section 465 at risk limitations taxation is considering proposal of a regulation on this subject the decision applies to partners in partnerships and sole proprietors however the decision is not applicable to s corporation shareholders in view of n j s a 54a 5 12 which provides specific language limiting shareholders losses in addition taxpayers may not use a loss following the at risk rules if they have previously used the loss for nj git purposes similarly situated taxpayers with facts and circumstances like those found in the opinion may amend their new jersey gross income tax returns amended returns may be subject to audit although a taxpayer may amend a return at any time in order to claim a refund the amended return must be filed within three years from the original due date of the return or two years from the time the tax was paid whichever is later additionally taxpayers may be required to provide documentation demonstrating that any loss disallowed pursuant to irc 465 was not used in a previous tax year for nj git purposes taxpayers will need to keep track of any new jersey and federal differences in basis the division s news release highlights that shechtel does not apply to s corporation shareholders that is because the git statute governing s corporations has its own version of an at risk limitation under the git the aggregate amount of losses or deductions of an s corporation taken into account by a shareholder of the s corporation may not exceed the shareholder s combined adjusted basis in the stock of the s corporation and any indebtedness of the s corporation to the shareholder n j s a 54a 5 12 a any loss or deduction of an s corporation which is disallowed under this provision may not be treated as incurred by the corporation in any succeeding taxable period with respect to that shareholder n j s a 54a 5 12 a as to potential refund claims the division advises no double dips will be allowed and taxpayers may not seek a refund under the reasoning of shechtel if they claimed the loss for git purposes in a previous tax year if you have a refund claim relating to the shechtel issue keep in mind that the statute of limitations on refund claims is still extended by executive order due to covid 19 the deadline for filing a claim with a statutory deadline on or after march 9 2020 is currently april 1 2022 see our prior alert on refund claim deadlines found here that means the 2016 and 2017 years should still be open for individual taxpayers for a few more days update from new jersey on sales tax refund claim requirements did you know new jersey has some fairly onerous requirements for perfecting a sales tax refund claim and last month the tax court denied a taxpayer s challenge to the validity of those requirements in solvay specialty polymers v director div of taxation docket no 009365 2019 n j tax court jan 19 2022 in solvay the dispute involved the taxpayer s failure to submit proof of payment of the sales tax sought in the refund claim according to the division s regulation at n j a c 18 2 5 8 proof of payment requires 1 proof of sales tax remitted to sellers is required and the division will accept copies of canceled checks if payment was made electronically the division will accept copies of bank statements with an itemization of all the transactions that make up the electronic payment a request for use of an alternative proof of payment must be requested in writing to the sales and use tax refund section and written approval received by the claimant prior to submission of such alternative proof of tax payment in support of the refund claim any approved alternate proof of payment must provide a trail between the documents presented by use of notation highlighting or other identification of the particular matching transactions the taxpayer in solvay produced letters from its vendors stating that payment of the tax at issue was received by the vendors in full as well as internal reports from the taxpayer s accounting system that provided the reference numbers necessary to trace line items on bank statements to particular payments and invoices however the division deemed the proof of payment inadequate under its regulatory requirements the taxpayer argued that the division s sales tax refund requirements are arbitrary and capricious and place too high a burden on taxpayers because they do not comport with modern business practices the tax court disagreed finding the regulations provide straightforward requirements to simplify the process for taxpayers in addition to the proof of payment requirement that was upheld by the tax court here is a summary of the so called straightforward requirements for perfecting a new jersey sales tax refund that taxpayers must comply with when filing a refund claim refund claims of sales and use tax must include documentation of all transactions to substantiate the tangible personal property or service that is the subject of the refund claim and the amount requested to substantiate the tangible personal property or service that is the subject of the refund claim and the amount requested the claim for refund on form a 3730 must be filed with documents such as invoices receipts proof of payment of tax and exemption certificates these documents must be provided in a format suitable to determine the correctness of the grounds for the refund and the amount of the refund or credit imaged documents which can be read with universal readable software such as adobe pdf and presented on cd may be submitted if first 1 the taxpayer submits a proposed plan for the submission to the sales tax refund section and received a written approval and 2 in claims of 25 or more transactions the images of the documents are presented in an organized manner which permits examination of the documents together with an electronic spreadsheet listing the transaction and the taxpayer retains the original invoices for division examination all sales purchase documentation must clearly identify the seller purchaser invoice number invoice date description of the transaction amount of the invoice excluding the tax and the amount of sales tax billed for the transaction for those transactions exempt from sales tax by the tendering of an exemption certificate the documentation relevant to all transactions with the issuer of the exemption certificate must clearly identify the purchaser cash receipts register tapes or other receipts that do not identify the purchaser are not acceptable when the basis of a claim for refund is the receipt of an exemption certificate from the customer after the seller has remitted the tax on their st 50 return then copies of the following documents are required 1 the exemption certificate 2 the initial invoice showing the amount of tax billed and 3 proof of issuance and use of customer credit or other proof of repayment of the tax to the customer amended quarterly returns are required for any period where the claim for refund results in the change of any of the figures previously reported the amended return s should be filed online at the time of submitting a refund claim refund claims of sales and use tax with 25 or more separate transactions or credit memoranda must be filed with a computer spreadsheet which should be edit locked the spreadsheet must include but is not limited to 1 the names of seller and customer 2 the location of the transaction for example delivered to pennsylvania shipped by carrier or customer pick up 3 the invoice number 4 the invoice date 5 the item sold purchased 6 the amount of the sale purchase subject to refund 7 the amount of sales tax or use tax claimed for refund and 8 a statement of the grounds for the claimed refund the computer spreadsheet shall be submitted with the refund claim on a compact disc or similar medium in common use receipt of a computer spreadsheet without simultaneous or prior filing of form a 3730 does not constitute the filing of a claim for purposes of statute of limitations the taxpayer must submit proof of payment as described above although not discussed in the solvay decision the regulations also provide that if a refund claim does not contain sufficient information the division will provide the taxpayer with guidance on the information required to demonstrate an overpayment if the taxpayer does not respond to the division s request for documentation within 30 days of receipt of such guidance the division will deny the claim while the taxpayer may refile the claim the regulations provide that the re filed claim has to be filed within the applicable statute of limitations n j a c 18 2 5 8 under the express provisions of the regulation taxpayers have a right to expect the division to provide notice of an incomplete refund claim if the division fails to comply with its own regulation and does not notify a taxpayer of missing information needed to support a refund claim and provide the taxpayer with 30 days to submit the information then the division should not be permitted to argue that any supplemental information received after the close of the statute of limitations was filed too late even so the prudent option for any taxpayer filing a sales tax refund claim is to comply with the requirements in the division s regulation and not omit any information or documentation that is required to support the refund claim

a coming stock split could be just what it takes for elon musk to get into the prestigious dow 30 the stock market is nothing if not tenacious on monday investors got another reminder of how critical it is not to let their long term investment strategies fall by the wayside after having fallen sharply early in 2022 stock markets have powered back and the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 and s p 500 gspc 1 20 have reached their best levels in roughly six weeks index daily percentage change daily point change dow 0 27 95 s p 500 0 71 32 nasdaq 1 31 186 the dow jones industrials have traditionally included some of the giants of american industry and for much of their early history the average lived up to its name by focusing largely on industrial and manufacturing giants time has caused the dow to evolve to include stocks from a much broader array of industries though and for more than a decade there haven t been any automakers represented among the 30 stocks that make the dow s cut with the latest news of a stock split from tesla tsla 5 59 however some believe that might be about to change trillion dollar tesla keeps climbing shares of tesla finished monday up more than 8 that pushed the electric vehicle ev pioneer s market capitalization above 1 13 trillion cementing ceo elon musk s status as the richest person in the world tesla announced that it would seek authorization at its annual meeting of shareholders to do a stock split shareholder authorization is necessary because the company s articles of incorporation specify a limit to the number of outstanding shares tesla can have and so effectuating the split would require more shares than tesla is currently allowed to have nowhere in tesla s filing with the u s securities and exchange commission sec did tesla give the ratio it intends to use for its split however some believe that it may use the same 5 for 1 ratio that it used when it previously split its shares in august 2020 will the price be right the split ratio is essentially meaningless in terms of the actual value of the company a higher ratio just means more shares worth less per share however the ratio is extremely important if tesla wants to become part of the dow the dow jones industrial average is a price weighted benchmark and tesla s current share price of nearly 1 100 per share would give it such disproportionate weight in the dow that it would be impractical however a 5 for 1 split would bring tesla s share price to around 220 and that would be quite consistent with several other current dow components tesla isn t the first company to raise speculation about some big changes to the dow both alphabet and amazon com announced future stock split plans earlier this year and the ratios they chose would potentially put an invitation to the dow within reach for them as well still tesla has something that both alphabet and amazon lack a tie to the dow s industrial roots with the dow kicking out general motors upon its filing for bankruptcy in 2009 adding tesla would help the dow return to its automotive roots but with its 21st century ev twist it ll take several months for all these stock splits to sort themselves out in the meantime investors can expect plenty of share price volatility amid speculation of a potential invitation to the dow jones industrials

by tami luhby and katie lobosco cnn looking for ways to fund its spending plans the white house is turning to a familiar target billionaires and other super wealthy americans as part of its budget proposal for fiscal year 2023 the biden administration is pushing a measure that seeks to ensure that those worth more than 100 million pay a federal income tax rate of at least 20 on their income including unrealized gains on assets which are not currently taxed under the present tax code growth in the value of assets is taxed only at the time of sale and at lower rates than the highest income tax rates for investments held for at least a year the rich often borrow against their holdings to build more wealth and fund their lifestyles while avoiding adding to their annual income tax tab and many have seen their portfolios swell in recent years as the stock market has boomed under current law when an american worker earns a dollar of wages that dollar is taxed as they earn it according to a white house fact sheet released saturday which notes that many wealthy people pay lower tax rates than middle class workers but when a billionaire earns income because their investments increase in value that gain is too often never taxed at all titled the billionaire minimum income tax the proposal only applies to the top 01 of americans with more than half the revenue coming from households worth more than 1 billion it is expected to raise 360 billion in the next decade the measure would allow the wealthy who are paying less than the 20 threshold to spread out the top up levy on unrealized income over nine years they would then have five years to make the top up payments on new income going forward which would also let them smooth out yearly variation in investment income the wealthy who don t have liquid funds to cover the tax could opt to pay later with interest and those already paying a tax rate of at least 20 on their total income including unrealized appreciation would not be affected paying for spending plans democrats have also restarted informal discussions on a more limited spending package with sen joe manchin a west virginia democrat who effectively killed the party s ambitious build back better plan late last year by refusing to support it manchin has stressed the spending needs to be paid for democrats past efforts to raise taxes on the mega rich have floundered oregon sen ron wyden s controversial billionaires income tax proposal to pay for build back better withered within days amid opposition from several members of the party last fall it would have taxed billionaires and the ultra wealthy on the gain in value of certain assets every year instead of when they are sold it s unclear whether biden s latest proposal is part of the discussions on capitol hill and whether it would receive support from all democrats in the senate which would be needed to pass a spending bill without republican votes sen kyrsten sinema a democrat from arizona has also balked in the past at raising taxes on the rich and corporations boosting taxes on the rich biden has long voiced support for raising taxes on the rich on the 2020 presidential campaign trail he called for reversing some of the republican backed tax cuts for high earners and corporations that former president donald trump signed into law in 2017 since coming into office biden has put forward several versions of the proposal each failing to get approval in congress he has not included a wealth tax which had been a talking point of his 2020 democratic primary rivals sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren last year biden proposed raising the top federal tax rate from 37 to 39 6 its pre trump level he called for subjecting earnings over 400 000 to the social security payroll tax which is currently limited to 147 000 of earnings he also called for increasing taxes on long term capital gains on those earning more than 1 million as well as taxing unrealized capital gains at death also he wanted to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 but not as high as the 35 top rate that existed before the republican tax breaks a version of biden s tax plan made it into the build back better legislation which passed the house last fall but failed to advance in the senate after manchin said he wouldn t vote for it under that bill the wealthiest americans would have paid a 5 surcharge on income above 10 million and an additional 3 levy on income above 25 million it would also have put in place a 15 minimum book tax on the corporate profits that large companies report to shareholders not to the internal revenue service this would have applied to companies with more than 1 billion in profits the legislation also included a 1 surcharge on corporate stock buybacks the white house budget released monday includes two earlier corporate tax proposals raising the tax rate to 28 and levying a 15 minimum book tax sparing the middle class though the democrats need to fund their spending plans biden has repeatedly pledged that his proposals would not raise taxes on anyone earning less than 400 000 a year economic models generally showed that his plans did not in fact directly raise taxes on most americans including one analysis from the bipartisan committee for a responsible federal budget and another from the penn wharton budget model but most economists also assume that workers would eventually bear some of the burden of an increase in the corporate tax rate while workers would not see a higher income tax rate their after tax wages could be lower if the corporate tax rate is increased the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

bitcoin bond was supposed to be the first chapter of the next era of sovereign finance but the project seems to be in disarray and analysis of the bond s structure shows that it s not really a great deal for investors bitcoin was marketed as the next major asset class for the balance sheet of the sovereign because of the questions surrounding the longevity of u s hegemony and the petrodollar that powers it meanwhile nations are still expressing confidence in u s treasury bills as stores of value for their treasury some countries are even opting for these t bill over gold even while protesting against a u s led globalized world data shows that since 2008 federal debt held by foreign and international investors has outpaced the price of gold while there was a slowdown during the mid 2010s it climbed back up as the decade came to a close and skyrocketed during covid it s not to say that many countries did not have an interest in gold far from it many states hit hard by covid 19 lined their balance sheets with the precious metal thailand japan and india all had double digit increases of their gold holdings throughout 2021 el salvador s leadership claimed the bitcoin bond would provide the country a new way to finance debt that wasn t tied to the international monetary fund and dollars it would also be an asset that grows in value on the balance sheet allowing for ambitious projects like a city powered by a volcano s geothermal power all this is possible provided that bitcoin hits 1 million within the next five years and there s one more caveat the bond itself will not be issued by the el salvadorian government but by lageo a subsidiary of the state owned electricity company cel el salvador says this is only a technicality it s still a debt of the sovereign with all the complications involved and bitcoin s fragile price this has been a terrible sales pitch for other nations the reality is data suggests nations don t really want anything aside from what they already have low yielding but safe treasury bills and some gold even china which always threatens to dump its holdings keeps a healthy supply on the books despite trimming the count nayib bukele s plan to create an alternative to state level financing bypassing the imf via bitcoin isn t without its merits the imf has long been criticized as a global loan shark and a lender of last resort if the plan works bukele gets financing at a rate preferential to the imf bitcoin washing debt like the green washing of the past might be the hip new thing for developing countries if there really is 500 million in commitments already lined up but states are conservative creatures especially in asia where bureaucracies can be slow moving and the memory of the asian financial crisis is still fresh despite the

san francisco and suzhou china march 28 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today announced the first patient dosing for its proprietary recombinant bispecific antibody targeting claudin18 2 and cd3 r d code ibi389 in a phase i clinical trial for the treatment of advanced malignancies the study nct05164458 is an open multicenter phase 1a 1b study evaluating the safety tolerability and efficacy of ibi389 monotherapy or combination therapy in the treatment of advanced solid tumors cd3 targeted bispecific antibodies cd3 bsabs or t cell engager tce are emerging novel therapeutic modalities in cancer immunotherapy in recent years tce redirects t cells to tumor cells by simultaneously binding tumor associated antigen taa expressed on tumor cells and cd3 expressed on t cells thus inducing t cell killing of tumor cells differentiated from conventional immunotherapies cd3 bsabs provoke a stronger immune response through cd3 activated t cells without the binding of the t cell receptor tcr to the major histocompatibility complex mhc peptide complex and also do not rely on t cell activated co stimulatory signals ibi389 has the potential to efficiently and selectively kill cldn18 2 expressing tumor cells increasing lymphocytic tumor infiltration and enhancing tumor immune response while possessing a low risk of crs cytokine release syndrome preclinical results showed that ibi389 exhibited significant antitumor effects and could bound to tumor cells even in cell lines with low cldn18 2 expression and is promising to treat patient populations with low to moderate cldn18 2 expression where conventional antibodies are found limited response the principal investigator of the study professor feng bi director of the department of abdominal oncology and director of the molecular targeted therapy research unit at west china hospital of sichuan university pointed out in recent years cldn18 2 has become one of the most topical r d areas in molecular biology and preliminary efficacy results in some clinical studies demonstrated encouraging druggablity of this target ibi389 bispecific antibody distinguishes itself from traditional monoclonal antibodies by encouraging t cell infiltration and killing of tumors thus enhancing the antitumor effect as a single agent we are looking forward to the positive results of ibi389 in patients with cldn18 2 expressing solid tumors dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent said ibi389 marks an exciting start for innovent in the tce field the scientists of innovent academy has accomplished sophisticated research screen and design work in drug discovery stage and the results of preclinical studies show that ibi389 has a potent anti tumor effect with a good safety profile we believe that as a differentiated molecule targeting cldn18 2 ibi389 will bring benefits to patients with advanced gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer even with low cldn18 2 expression about ibi389 ibi389 is an anti cldn18 2 cd3 bispecific antibody discovered and developed by innovent it induces immune synapse formations by linking cd3 molecules in t cell receptor complexes and cldn18 2 antigens on the surfaces of tumor cells therefore ibi389 stimulates t cell activation resulting in cytolytic protein production inflammatory cytokine release and further t cell proliferation which eventually leads to durable anti tumor effects about claudin 18 2 claudin protein is a critical component of tight junction complex molecules which play an important role in the life activities of the human body claudin18 2 is a member of the claudin protein family which is a highly tissue specific protein expressed only in differentiated epithelial cells on the gastric mucosa under normal physiological conditions previous studies have revealed that claudin18 2 is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer such as gastric cancer pancreatic cancer esophageal adenocarcinoma and colorectalcancer the unique feature of limited expression in normal tissues and highly specific expression in cancer makes claudin18 2 an ideal target for developing the immunotherapeutic for solid tumors globally there are many candidate therapies in clinical development the drug modalities under development include monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies antibody conjugated drugs and car t cell products however currently no drug targeting claudin18 2 has been approved about gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma gastric and pancreatic cancer are both malignant tumors of the digestive system that seriously endanger human life and health the latest global cancer statistics show that there will be about 1 089 million new cases of gastric cancer worldwide in 2020 accounting for 5 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 768 000 deaths accounting for 7 7 of the global cancer deaths there are about 495 000 new cases of pancreatic cancer accounting for 2 6 of the global cancer incidence and about 466 000 deaths accounting for 4 7 of the global cancer deaths according to the national cancer statistics released by the national cancer center of china in 2019 the incidence of gastric cancer in china in 2015 was about 403 000 accounting for 10 26 of the total cancer incidence second only to lung cancer at 20 03 with an incidence rate of 29 31 100 000 people and about 291 000 deaths accounting for 12 45 of the total cancer deaths behind lung and liver cancer with a mortality rate of 21 16 100 000 people in 2015 the number of cases and deaths of pancreatic cancer nationwide were 95 000 and 85 000 respectively ranking the 10th and 6th in the incidence and mortality of malignant tumors the mortality ratio of pancreatic cancer was 0 89 making it a true king of cancer despite the treatment progress in recent years drug resistance recurrence and metastasis are still inevitable the 5 year survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer is about 5 20 and the median survival rate is about 10 months pancreatic cancer has a worse prognosis with a 5 year survival rate of only 6 to 8 about innovent inspired by the spirit of start with integrity succeed through action innovent s

billionaires often pay a lower rate of taxes than average americans in part because the majority of their income comes not from a paycheck but from assets such as stocks these assets are not taxed unless they are sold and those capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than wage based income if a billionaire s stock holdings increase but they do not sell those assets the federal government does not tax those unrealized gains under the stepped up basis provision if a billionaire never sells stock that increases in value those investment gains are ignored for income tax purposes when assets are passed on to their heirs an analysis by the white house office of management and budget and the council of economic advisers released late last year found that 400 billionaire families paid an average annual tax rate of 8 2 percent lower than the rate for millions of americans in remarks outlining his budget priorities biden noted that firefighters and teachers were often paying higher tax rates than billionaires that s not right that s not fair he said the proposed billionaire tax would require the wealthiest americans to pay a minimum 20 percent tax rate on their full income the standard taxable income they earn from wages and what they have made in their unrealized gains in unsold assets if they are already paying that amount they won t be hit with additional taxes but billionaires who have not been paying taxes on their full income would have five years to comply with the new rules the white house plan was first reported by the washington post over the weekend
big oil windfall profits tax would protect consumers from giant oil companies taking advantage of world events to jack up prices washington d c economists and environmental groups are expressing support for the big oil windfall profits tax act legislation introduced by u s senator sheldon whitehouse d ri earlier this month to curb profiteering by oil companies and provide americans guaranteed relief from soaring prices at the gas pump new reports have emerged that big oil companies are planning on using windfall profits to pay large dividends to shareholders and buy back billions of dollars of their own shares juicing already generous executive compensation this underscores the need for a legislative solution to crack down on industry profiteering and put money back in americans pockets our bill has earned the support of economists and a broad cross section of the democratic caucus because it is an effective solution for getting americans some relief from rising gas prices said whitehouse meanwhile big oil companies are bragging to investors that they are flush with extra cash for shareholders and stock buybacks we need to send some of those wild windfall profits back to the working people who paid for them at the pump under the big oil windfall profits tax large oil companies that produce or import at least 300 000 barrels of oil per day or did so in 2019 will owe a per barrel tax equal to 50 percent of the difference between the current price of a barrel of oil and the pre pandemic average price per barrel between 2015 and 2019 a period when big oil companies were already earning large profits the quarterly tax will apply to both domestically produced and imported barrels of oil to ensure a level playing field smaller companies accounting for roughly 70 percent of the domestic production will be exempt so oil giants like exxon mobil and chevron cannot simply gouge consumers further without the threat of losing market share revenue raised from the windfall profits of big oil companies will be returned to consumers in the form of a quarterly rebate which would phase out for single filers who earn more than 75 000 in annual income and joint filers who earn more than 150 000 at 120 per barrel of oil the levy would raise approximately 45 billion per year at that price single filers would receive approximately 240 each year and joint filers would receive roughly 360 each year the legislation is cosponsored by senators jeff merkley d or elizabeth warren d ma bernie sanders i vt richard blumenthal d ct tammy baldwin d wi sherrod brown d oh jack reed d ri ed markey d ma cory booker d nj michael bennet d co bob casey d pa raphael warnock d ga debbie stabenow d mi and alex padilla d ca congressman ro khanna d ca 17 introduced the legislation in the u s house of representatives according to a recent poll by hart research eighty percent of voters favor a windfall profits tax on oil companies what the endorsers are saying a windfall profits tax on big oil is exactly what s needed to help average working people through this fuel crisis it s good policy and it s the right thing to do economist and former labor secretary robert reich in the midst of this economic and political crisis oil and gas companies are taking advantage of world events increasing their prices enormously despite no meaningful increase in their costs of production raking in record profits at the expense of ordinary americans a windfall tax whose proceeds are used to help consumers is an economically sound way to deliver relief with the benefits of price gouging thereby reduced some companies might even be discouraged from price gouging joseph stiglitz chief economist and senior fellow at the roosevelt institute as the world witnesses russia s horrific war and atrocities against ukraine big oil has seized this crisis as an opportunity for price gouging and profiteering the oil and gas industry is reaping massive profits while consumers everywhere are feeling pain at the pump the windfall profits tax will require fossil fuel companies to share their gains with families who are paying the price for a global crisis they didn t create that s basic fairness bobby mcenaney director of the dirty energy project for natural resources defense council for too long the oil and gas industry has been able to use the cover of inflation and international conflict to jack up prices for american consumers we applaud senator whitehouse for his leadership in ensuring that vulnerable communities don t pay the price for fossil fuel industry greed sierra club deputy legislative director mahyar sorour after russia s invasion of ukraine polluting industries wasted no time in exploiting a humanitarian crisis to increase their profits even while american families paid the price at the pump we applaud senator whitehouse s legislation that would hold the oil and gas industry accountable for driving up prices and provide direct much needed relief to families across this country who have been hit the hardest earthjustice legislative representative sara cawley this legislation will stop big oil s war profiteering and deliver much needed relief to consumers while families are feeling pain at the pump oil executives are making record profits because of the devastating war in ukraine big oil doesn t deserve a single penny extra by profiting during a time of war and crisis they helped create instead these windfall profits for a handful of executives should be used to help the consumers especially low income families who are paying all the costs we are glad to see congress putting families first now it s time for congress to pass this legislation that would help make big oil pay for a crisis they helped create at home and abroad jamie henn director of fossil free media we applaud senator whitehouse and representative khanna for their leadership in putting a stop to big oil s profiteering at the expense of ordinary americans as the us biggest fossil fuel companies report near record profits and seek to exploit the war in ukraine for political and economic gain america is getting a wake up call to end its reliance on volatile and destructive fossil fuels zorka milin senior advisor at global witness what the oil companies are saying as a result of our restored financial strength we

as bitcoin goes so goes the miners what happened the value of bitcoin mining related stocks jumped on monday as the price of bitcoin itself shot higher at 3 30 p m et the value of bitcoin was up 7 3 over the last 24 hours and 17 4 over the past week that s pushed shares of miners riot blockchain riot 5 82 as much as 15 higher and 10 3 up as of this writing competitor hut 8 mining hut was up as much as 13 6 and is now up 6 6 and computing supplier canaan can 5 83 was up 11 7 at its high and is currently 5 5 higher for the day so what miners are clearly set to make more money as the price of bitcoin rises because their costs don t go up significantly and their revenue will this is much like the commodity of a physical materials miner going up the other leverage they have is that miners tend to have significant bitcoin assets on their balance sheet which will also rise in value on a day like today to put the assets they hold into perspective at the end of 2021 riot blockchain had 4 884 bitcoins on the balance sheet and hut 8 mining was holding 5 518 bitcoins these assets are appreciating with the price of bitcoin and are certainly helping stock values today canaan is the one outlier from this list holding just 70 5 bitcoins and generating its revenue from selling mining machines to operators it may not have the same direct impact as miners do from the rise in bitcoin but this is a rising tides lift all boats kind of move for canaan now what today s move across the cryptocurrency market wasn t driven by any specific piece of news but rather a general uptick in bullishness for cryptocurrencies there were reports that the u k is set to announce some cryptocurrency regulations soon and they re expected to be relatively pro crypto in nature if that s true it ll be good for crypto values and digital assets continuing a positive executive order from the white house earlier this month while volatility will continue to be the standard for the crypto industry i think it s clear that we re heading to a more steady state for the industry investors and developers are getting more comfortable that crushing regulations won t come from developed countries and that will likely lead to even more investment i think long term these trends are bullish for the crypto industry but with that said i would expect extreme volatility to continue so don t expect values to go straight up like they have over the past week because they can reverse course just as quickly

analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and starbucks wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 3 2022 this video was recorded on march 16 2022 chris hill if you re looking for a new job we ve got a 95 billion company that s suddenly in need of a ceo brush up your resume motley fool money starts now i m chris hill joined once again by motley fool senior analyst jason moser thanks for being here jason moser thanks for having me chris hill after five years as ceo of starbucks kevin johnson is stepping down effective april 4th former ceo howard schultz is returning as interim ceo the board of directors has said they re going to begin their search and announce a new ceo in the fall they have made it very clear that schultz is there on an interim basis he s not there for a long term stint which i believe would be his third ceo but he s the interim for now and helping to guide this new process shares of starbucks are up about seven percent this morning jason this is my largest holding you would think if someone s largest holding is up seven percent they feel really good about that yet i don t it s because of the news that kevin johnson signaled to the board of directors a year ago that he was going to do this i am left wondering why they are just starting their search now when they ve had a year to consider who s going to fill his shoes jason moser chris it feels to me like you are viewing this as the coffee mug half empty chris hill that s exactly right jason moser i just want to make sure i wouldn t say i necessarily view it that way it s interesting news for sure it does seem like it came out of the blue now i will say in learning more about this this morning there was an interview with a board member melody hopson that i think clarified a little bit of the questions that you have here the board they say they weren t surprised by this they ve known about this for a year essentially part of the problem is that due to all of the restrictions and chaos over the last couple of years it s just not been very easy for businesses to get things done a lot of things have gone virtual but we re seeing that obviously change back now it s not the case anymore but she noted that they re not going to hire a ceo over zoom and hey listen i applaud that i thought that was really great to hear because it tells me that they are taking this very seriously they ve been giving this a lot of deliberate thought and they wanted to make sure that they approach this with no half measures so to speak it does sound unreasonable that yes the board did know about this a year ago it does sound reasonable that they ve just not had the ability to really go out there and search for the appropriate individual to fill mr johnson s role here now obviously that s changed and thankfully for them they can fall back on howard s shelter i m sure it s probably doing his best michael corleone there right now is just when i thought i was out they pull me back in at some point they re going to have to move on from howard that is nice to have him in the back pocket there so to speak it sounds like they re getting him for a song in i think what they said is compensation for this is going to be a dollar i suspect that he is very happy to come in here to fill this role very temporarily as the board ramps up its search hopefully they do take this very seriously and are able to find someone who can fill this role for a long time to come because this is one of the quintessential american businesses i mean tremendous brand obviously coffee it s a market that s not going anywhere as shareholders you and i both and i m sure all shareholders out there they want to see someone get in here and really help take this company to the next level kevin johnson has done a wonderful job but it sounds like he s ready to move on hopefully they re able to find someone sooner rather than later chris hill this could be the ceo hiring version of what we saw with disney plus where disney said they wanted to launch their streaming service in 2016 then they pushed it back to 2017 2018 finally when it came out in 2019 right before they launched it i think collectively as shareholders and as investors we looked at this and said you better nail this because we ve been putting it off long enough and they did right out of the gate if six months from now they make an amazing hire then all is forgiven but i do think two things in terms of the hire one they really need to nail this you can say that about any ceo hiring but i think the fact that they knew about this for a year and didn t have a plan in place other than what we re going to start our process once he leaves the other thing is i m assuming they re going to hire someone from outside the company because they ve got a cfo and chief operating officer who have been at the company for 20 years maybe either one is the right candidate for the job but it would be weird if six months from now they came out and said ok we ve done our search and it was someone within the company all along jason moser it does feel like they would be bringing someone in from the outside who knows who it could be all of a sudden you get domino s rich allison probably gets thrown on the radar here just because of his familiarity with that industry food and beverage he sees obviously getting ready to step away from domino s and i m kidding there i don t think that that s going to be the case it sounds like richard is ready to go off and do other things as well this would be a great gig i would think i m really actually entertaining the idea of throwing in my resume let s be clear i m not getting younger chris i drink a ton of coffee i feel like they get a lot of my money i m pretty familiar with that business i ve been covering it for a while i love starbucks i ll go there and interview i m all for not interviewing on zoom i d love to take a business trip and go checkout starbucks hq i don t think they ll have any issue on the demand side i think there are a lot of folks out here who d really love that gig it does feel like looking outside might be the way to go here but you never know it s funny how talent pops up sometimes on the radar and it s often somewhere where you just least expect it but it s going to be an interesting process for sure chris hill i would think the first phone call they place is to roz brewer the ceo at walgreens who was a longtime executive at starbucks and left about 15 months ago to take the top job at walgreens i m assuming she is going to be on the shortlist or at least in the conversation but we ll see jason moser i feel like she should be at the top of the list for that search it feels like starbucks would be a more enjoyable job than something like walgreens let s be frank here that name that s the starbucks name right there you ve got a ceo of a coffee company named brewer it just doesn t get any better than that the stars are lining up i would imagine they are placing a call to her to gauge her interest because she may have felt like that opportunity just wasn t going to be on the table here a year and a half ago and so it s very understandable that she took that job but given her familiarity with the business with the company with the culture i have to believe that she would be at the very top of list of consideration chris hill the last thing and then i ll let you go a lot of times when companies are looking at hiring the ceo one of the questions they ask is some version of what new plans would you bring to the table for our company in the case of starbucks one of the questions they are going to be asking candidates is yesterday we announced a plan and we d like your thoughts on how you re going to implement it because this plan is important to us and a plan that got overshadowed by the news of kevin johnson leaving in a couple of weeks and it s starbucks coming out and saying by 2025 they want to get rid of disposable cups which from an aspirational standpoint and an environmental standpoint i think is wonderful i think that s going to be difficult to execute completely because if you just think about people traveling and starbucks in airports and train stations and hotels and that sort of thing that might be tough to pull off but do you think this plan which appears important to the business do you think that makes it easier or harder or has no effect on their ability to get the candidate they want in the corner office this fall jason moser you mean the cup plan the big plan chris hill yes jason moser i agree with you i think from an aspirational view it s hats off that s a terrific goal i think it s going to be very difficult to execute in full just given the nature of the business and the convenience factor it reminds me of the plastic grocery bags it takes a little bit of thought on the consumer s part to change their behavior a little bit for example now i keep a grocery bag in my car so i can just avoid those bag but then also recently here in fairfax county they implemented a five cent plastic bag tax if you use those bags now it s interesting because you re on the honor system there today actually you pay that tax when you check out maybe there are some incentives maybe there are some creative ways that they can cut back the waste i think eliminating that wastefully is going to be next to impossible to do but i have to believe that it would be something that they would be asking that would be a very good interview question how do you approach that problem what is your philosophy there because you might have some ceos that are all on board and say yeah eliminate it 100 percent but then the other ceos may come in and say well that s aspirational but it s not very practical perhaps this is another way we could approach that problem i think that will be a terrific interview question and i m sure it will be asked and i m sure you ll get a wide range of answers but that s going to be something that starbucks is going to be one of many companies i think really trying to pursue strategies in cutting back on waste and becoming a little bit more environmentally friendly chris hill we ll start thinking about how you re going to answer that when they interview you jason moser i m already writing the notes down chris chris hill jason moser thanks for being here jason moser thank you chris hill shares of starbucks have done pretty well over the five years kevin johnson s been running the company one stock that s performed even better is intuit the financial software stock has risen 250 percent during the same time period for a closer look at intuit here s emily flippen emily flippen thanks chris emily flippen here i am joined by motley fool s senior analyst asit sharma and today we are going to be talking about a tax specialist intuit and thinking about it as an investment asit thanks for joining asit sharma emily so good to be back with you again emily flippen i had to kick off with a fun question here which is we re talking about intuit it is tax season asit have you started your taxes yet asit sharma well emily i actually have in my own idiosyncratic way about this time every year i get a call from my dad and he is something of a trader even though i ve tried to make him more of a long term investor over the years i got a call from him just a few days ago and he said hey son can you help me out i had all these cryptocurrency transactions i got to figure out how to account for them before i see the cpa that call from my dad which is different every year is always the trigger for me to start gathering my stuff together which i do a little bit of this weekend but to be completely honest have i in any bonafide way started my taxes no how about you emily flippen me being the anxious person that i am the moment i get all my forms i like to just get it out of the way and do it i have to say i don t have particularly complicated tax filings i m not making real estate investments at my age so there s really no reason why i should mess up my taxes but i will tell you what every year i seem to manage to do something wrong i imagine i speak for a lot of americans especially when i say that i do like to use simplifying software if you will talking to those live experts that intuit has made a very lucrative industry out of it s certainly the season to be thinking about intuit especially considering the fact that i think a lot of people are also maybe this is their call to start thinking about doing their taxes apologies if it hadn t crossed your mind and now you re stressed out asit sharma i d tell you that s the most emily flippen thing ever that you get your tax forms in you re ready to go which i ll get there one day given this interesting emily it s top of mind during tax season to think about investments like intuit they have their flagship product turbotax but over the years they ve evolved into other spaces they have a big self employed and small business tax software business in quickbooks online they also have a personal finance arm in credit karma which they recently acquired they even bought mailchimp recently to integrate with their small business software to help small and medium sized businesses market a little bit better this is not the old intuit that we re used to seeing this is a forward looking company these days would you agree with that emily flippen definitely i d say a lot of consumers may just be familiar with turbotax and maybe you have a sour taste in your mouth depending on your opinion about that software solution but it s important not to overlook the small and medium sized business market because that is intuit s fastest growing segment if you are somebody who works with the finances of corporations you may be familiar with quickbooks but if you re not you should know it is just as pervasive if not more so than turbotax s during tax filing season quickbooks is the go to accounting software for i d say the majority of small businesses in united states asit sharma agreed something that will be new to investors who haven t followed intuit for many years they actually are trying to extend a little bit beyond the small and medium sized business group with quickbooks online into something called the middle market which is typically depending on the definition you use a bit larger size market than the small medium sized company market it s also a lucrative space for them to play in these are companies by some definition to the one i use at least that have at least five or 10 million in annual revenue other definitions i ve seen say that middle market companies have at least 100 employees there are many ways to slice it bottom line intuit is starting to target larger businesses they re not going out and competing with big enterprise companies and trying to offer their accounting software to large corporations but they re expanding aggressively into what s a new realm for them i think that s important to recognize too because a company gets this big emily and we begin to ask the question how do they keep growing emily flippen i think that s a fair question to ask because i think if you re investing in intuit you re not doing so because you just think turbotax is that pervasive although they are still making so many improvements to that software like connecting with live experts being one of them advanced refund programs being another but you re really investing because you believe in their new verticals you mentioned that acquisition of mailchimp it was 12 billion acquisition by no means a small amount of money to spend that s their push into email marketing credit karma is another big one which is what they call under their five big bets unlocking smart money decisions pushing into things like insights financial product advise auto and home advice this is a lucrative industry a growing industry certainly offers the opportunity to grow into its top line faster than it s grown historically but it s also extremely competitive it s understandable that investors may have a bit of doubt saying credit karma but also intuit is coming into the space how are they going to be the winners asit sharma i think it s a fair suggestion that we consider where does this thesis perhaps begin to break a little bit to me it breaks if they don t keep up with cutting edge technology to draw all these various trends together this is a company now that s playing in tax small business accounting software personal finance email marketing as you mentioned emily one of the unifying threads that management likes to talk about is the emphasis on machine learning and artificial intelligence in each of these areas so that they can stay ahead of the curve and keep supplying their customers with ways to reach their own customers especially in the small business segment one of the answers to that is going to be technology i believe going forward i don t think we ve seen the end of intuit acquiring companies now we might not see large acquisitions of the size of credit karma as well as mailchimp in the near future i think they re pretty exhausted on that level but i wouldn t be surprised to see many more small bolt on acquisitions that fill those technology pieces that enable them to keep selling emily flippen ceo sasan goodarzi i think has that innovation focus that is both wanting to grow intuit while still maintaining its really stalwarts financial picture this is a company that has gross margins above 80 percent free cash flow margins consistently above 25 percent they are making money hand over fist in this industry which offers them a lot of opportunity to not only pay a dividend which they consistently do and raise but also reinvest into the business looking at that r d to say how are we going to be the winners in this space it s important that whatever new verticals they push into whether it be payroll management for small to medium sized businesses getting more into the enterprise clients getting more into financial advice for consumers that they maintain that strong margin picture they re in a well position to do so again being able to reinvest that cash is critical but it s worth keeping an eye on those margins overtime asit sharma totally agree i think that this strategic element that sasan goodarzi has brought in the few years he s been ceo plus cost discipline is going to be helpful to them i think they manage their fixed cost base pretty well we saw in this second quarter intuit grew its total top line by 70 percent year over year now they had revenue from acquisitions propelling that emily but when you take out those acquisitions their organic growth was still pretty strong it grew 39 percent year over year that type of revenue growth makes it easy to drop profit onto that bottom line but of course this is going to normalize this growth will normalize over the next few years i think they can still grow at maybe 15 percent rate annualized for the long term maybe closer to 20 percent that s pretty strong for business that is this big it s got room to grow but they re going to have to be pretty strategic as you mentioned attack the right verticals in their various markets and keep thinking about how they can innovate within their customer base i would add to that one last thing how well they can cross sell between these products taking a customer who is a turbotax user and being able to sell the personal finance products that come via the credit karma acquisition on through their whole product suite that s going to be an important piece to going forward emily flippen i will also add that i think a risk that investors should keep in mind is that for the most part intuit is a consumer facing business they have had a lot of backlash from consumers and tax filers about the lobbying the business does in particular to keep tax laws in the united states somewhat opaque it s important to keep in mind that that is an existential risks for this business and may be prohibitive for some investors asit sharma true one more i ll mention is that it been very easy for intuit to grow its tax practice between turbotax and small business taxes they actually have a group that s just focused on small corporate taxes they ve been able to grow quickbooks online among freelancers and entrepreneurs at a rapid rate but this next phase of growth is going to be harder when you break into the middle market there s already established software companies there that are pretty robust again it s not the same thing as competing with the really big guys in that corporate software market enterprise resource planning but there s competition they will have to show their metal against in the coming years if they want to expand that qbo quickbooks online product into the slightly bigger space emily flippen the last question here desert island asit if you had to choose between intuit paychex or adobe which are you buying and why asit sharma this is a hard question emily we were chatting in prep for this and you had a different list which i like because it made my answer easy i m a glutton for punishment this week so i chose the harder version which this is i will tell you i ve admired paychex for a long time because their revenue stream is very predictable they spend a lot of money on machine learning so they ve got bots which help them make their payroll process more efficient for their customers high margin business for a payroll company steady growth what s not to like about paychex now i think intuit is one level up versus paychex i think the strategy under sasan goodarzi and also his team in general his cfo michelle clatterbuck i think this is a well run company which is going to figure out how to keep growing even as a big enterprise over the next several years but now we come up against adobe which is a gold standard of exploiting intellectual property you have to love what they ve done with adobe creative cloud there s such a stalwart innovative business beautiful subscription model here s what i m going to say i m going to go with adobe but suppose i take a vacation in a year i get shipwrecked again i want to revisit this i think i m seeing some stuff in intuit that might change my mind if i were shipwrecked the second time on a desert island i

about three weeks ago china s top political leaders met in beijing and announced the country s new gdp goal for 2022 around 5 5 the lowest target in decades that appears perfectly excusable after all after two years of grappling with the coronavirus pandemic beijing is also dealing with rising debt turmoil in real estate markets and bankruptcies of large developers as well as continuing trade tensions with the united states but china s economy could be in even more trouble thanks to the ukraine crisis and beijing s coziness to moscow according to the institute of international finance investors have been pulling money out of china on a huge scale even as flows to other emerging markets have been holding up indeed a report by the institute of international finance iif says global investors have been withdrawing money out of china on an unprecedented scale since russia invaded ukraine in late february with the yuan likely to face more pressure in the coming months this is to be expected considering that china s trade ties with russia and ukraine are valued at 147 billion and 19 billion respectively capital flight data by china central depository clearing a depository for government bonds reveals that overseas investors holdings of chinese onshore bonds fell by 67 billion yuan us 10 5 billion in the month of february with macquarie capital projecting that march outflows will be even bigger the first 21 days of march has seen china record net outflows of 59 billion yuan through the northbound stock connect programme with hong kong putting it on a nearly 90 billion yuan monthly run rate and significantly higher than the 70 billion yuan of fund outflows recorded in march 2020 based on data from the taiwan stock exchange south china morning post scmp estimates that foreign investors have sold nt 450 2 billion us 15 7 billion worth of stocks in the four weeks since the start of the war on february 20 almost equal to the total equity sales by foreign investors for the entire 2021 credit demand has also been weakening with lending in february falling to 1 23 trillion yuan us 193 2 billion down sharply from a record 3 98 trillion yuan in january so why is the world fleeing from china first off the war has renewed fears in taiwan of increasing risks of military aggression from the chinese mainland which views the east asian island as a breakaway province to be reunited by force if necessary second china has lately been deepening ties with russia which could jeopardize its own economy if it acts as a buffer against sanctions by the u s and the west china russia relations have historically been marked by mutual wariness including a border conflict in the 1960s that reportedly pushed the two countries to the brink of nuclear war but the two have been cozying up ever since western sanctions on russia over its annexation of crimea in 2014 and third a hawkish fed has been weighing on multiple stock markets across the globe and taiwan s has not been an exception the ukraine crisis and china s apparent condoning of putin s actions may end up galvanizing the u s political establishment and the united states allies in a way that foreign policy debate ends up impacting china negatively hopefully china will be able to retain its position as the pre eminent em economy after all beijing s relatively strong currency allows it to handle near term volatility that would affect trade beijing has allowed the yuan to remain strong currently around 6 3 to the u s dollar but if necessary it could pump a lot of cash into the economy and supercharge exports by pushing the yuan lower beijing has also shifted its rhetoric over the past few weeks from embracing putin and a friendship without limits to advocating for respecting and safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries

plan drew immediate criticism from republicans who together with moderate democrats killed similar tax proposals in the 2022 budget the budget i am releasing today sends a clear message to the american people about what we value first fiscal responsibility second safety and security and thirdly the investments needed to build a better america biden told reporters at the white house we can restore fiscal responsibility by rolling back the trump tax cuts under my plan no one making less than 400 000 will pay an additional penny in taxes but the wealthy and corporations will finally pay

unusual said ned davis research chief global macro strategist joe kalish although cases are limited the decline in treasury bond futures thus far exceeds the median decline between the first and second fed rate hike since 1980 looking at past hiking cycles he said yields trend higher after the first rate increase and are flat to modestly higher in the weeks after the second hike credit spreads tended to meander in the weeks surrounding the second rate hike he added since 1980 rates were lifted at least twice six times and in each case the yield curve flattened between the first and second rate hikes kalish noted in cases with a short time span between hikes the curve flattened a median 13 bp a little more than what we have seen thus far although the curve is a lot flatter today than in most other cases in nearly all hiking cycles since 1964 he said the yield curve continued to flatten in the weeks and months leading up to the second rate hike and following that hike where do yields go from here mark dowding chief investment officer at bluebay asset management said although we can see how yields may rise further in coming days based on our medium term views in the short term it is possible that rates have sold off as much as they need to last year he said yields peaked at the end of march and we wonder whether there may be a repeat of this pattern in 2022 and while quarter point hikes may do little to slow growth or inflation in the coming year with real rates remaining deep in negative territory he said he believed the fed s plan to simultaneously do quantitative tightening would make the panel less inclined to become overly aggressive on rates especially against a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty but should the fed move to half point rate hikes it will create a more unpredictable situation financial markets have become addicted to policy support in recent years and could be vulnerable if retail faith in buying stocks is challenged in weeks to come dowding said a more aggressive fed creates a more challenging backdrop for risk assets he added a gradual hiking cycle appeared to constitute little risk to ongoing expansion but a more unpredictable path for rates will inevitably raise recession risks this uncertainty may also demand a more sustained increase in risk premia a factor that may also be supported by ongoing geopolitical risks which seem unlikely to disappear any time soon primary to come the california health facilities financing authority aa3 aa aa is set to price tuesday 1 050 billion of taxable social

by fu ying china daily updated 2022 03 29 07 47 jin ding china daily the 13th of march marked the 50th anniversary of ambassadorial diplomatic relations between china and the uk as the tenth chinese ambassador to the united kingdom i wish to share some personal perspectives on the relationship the uk recognized the people s republic of china in 1950 one year after its founding way ahead of most other western countries in 1972 when the international landscape was undergoing dramatic changes china and the uk established full diplomatic ties which opened the path for closer cooperation in economic trade cultural and many other fields the successful handover of hong kong in 1997 paved the way for smooth progress of the relationship in the years to come both sides should appreciate generations of efforts i served as the chinese ambassador in london between 2007 and 2010 and witnessed how the relationship advanced rapidly though there were some tough moments for me addressing difficulties and frictions in the relationship i generally had a good impression of the country and a pleasant experience during my three year tenure in the uk before leaving at my farewell reception at the mandarin oriental hyde park hotel in january 2010 i was already missing britain in the years since i have followed closely our relationship and it was always delightful to see new progress and achievement in exchanges and cooperation however i have also noticed some setbacks along the journey beijing would not accept some of london s criticisms and concerns over alleged human rights issues which it saw as unfair and normal progress of bilateral ties was inevitably affected when the differences became the focus in the relationship a closer look at the specific issues reveals that they are basically about china s domestic politics and policies rather than anything impairing the interests of the british people the divergent opinions reflected to some extent the divergent values and worldviews of the chinese and the british people which were rooted in their different history and political culture differences need to be dealt with through communication and exchange rather than being allowed to undermine the foundation and bonds of the bilateral ties it took both sides generations of strong and steady efforts to bring the china uk relationship where it is today in 1972 bilateral trade barely reached 300 million while in 2021 it topped 110 billion making china the uk s largest trading partner in asia the cumulative two way investment reached almost 50 billion over 500 chinese businesses have created more than 80 000 jobs in the uk london is now the world s biggest offshore rmb clearing center the success of our financial cooperation such as the shanghai london stock connect and the currency swap program speaks for itself new energy cooperation provides another new growth driver for china uk relations green cooperation is flourishing in battery capacity offshore wind power electric vehicles and so on most recently china s nuclear reactor design hualong one hpr 1000 passed the uk s generic design assessment gda the project once built will provide access to more reliable and clean energy for british communities people to people exchange and educational cooperation is another pillar in china uk relations i myself was a beneficiary in 1985 i went to study in the uk on a commonwealth scholarship that i shared with another student i arrived with several dozens of other chinese students most of us chose disciplines on practical knowledge and skills some studied strawberry cultivation or livestock farming others learned computer science or mechanical engineering many of them joined china s reform and opening up endeavor after they finished studies in the uk till this day whenever i visit the fruit section in chinese supermarkets the delicious looking strawberries remind me of my fellow students and our days in the uk in 2020 the uk overtook the united states to become the top destination for overseas chinese students a whopping 42 percent of the students who went abroad chose to study in the uk despite the impact of covid 19 on the flow of overseas students 130 000 uk student visas were issued to chinese students in 2021 which amounted to one third of the total number of international students in the uk we can expect even more robust china uk people to people exchanges when covid 19 eases changing circumstances challenge the old world order this brings me back to examine the difficulties in our relationship it is only natural that countries perceive some issues differently what matters is how to view and address them in an appropriate way countries can discuss or debate their differences but not take them as a reason to interfere in other countries internal affairs western countries have a habit of telling others what to do one of the causes for such behavior in addition to a sense of self righteousness is a fundamental lack of awareness of the new reality brought by modern day economic globalization and the inability to adjust their way of thinking and conduct accordingly yet it matters that these countries undertake such adjustments so that the world will keep moving forward following the end of the cold war the united states began trying to globalize the us dominated west centric order from the bipolar era which differs from the un centered international order despite their overlap this us led order has succeeded in generating economic globalization moving capital and linking markets production and other economic activities across the world beyond the boundaries of the western bloc but it remains a highly exclusive process otherwise dismissing non western values and political systems and putting first the security interests of the united states and its allies economic globalization has changed the world in profound ways making possible the rise of china and other developing countries in the meantime the united states which continues to claim predominance has made a series of blunders such as the international financial crisis of 2007 and failures in afghanistan and iraq these were signs that the us led order had begun to lose appeal a cause for growing anxiety in washington over the us stature in the world in 2010 china became the world s second largest economy its 2021 gdp accounted for over 18 percent of the global total up from 2 9 percent in 1972 china s progress fueled us fears about losing supremacy the us response instead of a healthy competition in the 21st century globalized world is to crack down and hold back china s growth targeting china not only in trade and technology areas but also highlighting political and ideological differences those differences had been there since half a century ago and did not hinder the progress of the western countries relations with china now when we face more common challenges and have wider consensus for global cooperation why the old differences have reemerged and become intolerable the answer as i tend to believe lies in a combination of factors first the inability of the us led order to adapt to new realities second a lack of understanding and accommodation among the western countries toward china and other emerging countries whose histories cultures and levels of development are different from the west and third i would admit the lagging consciousness and lack of sophistication when it comes to communicating to the world who we chinese are what we want and why we do things the way we do at the very moment europe and the asia pacific are witnessing serious conflicts caused by clash of interests the old order and way of thinking are being challenged by the changing circumstances and rising tensions around the world the relationship between china and the uk must adapt and adjust to make sure that it will not be trapped by the conflict of interests or clash of philosophies and be able to identify new opportunities for growth and cooperation look into the future by learning from history to this end we need to learn from history and free ourselves from the old mindset we need to respect and accommodate each other address issues through dialogue and consultation and expand cooperation no matter what may stand in the way as chinese president xi jinping underscored during his phone conversation with prime minister boris johnson last october to develop a sound china uk relationship trusting each other is the basis getting perceptions right is the premise and properly managing differences is the key a history of europe authored by professor j m roberts of oxford university in 1996 is one of the few books on the subject that treats russia as part of europe the book analyses why eastern and western europe grew apart and the possibility and prospect of reintegration however 30 years after the end of the cold war europe has been sadly hit again by military conflict which is causing huge humanitarian consequences on the continent the whole world is watching anxiously where this conflict may lead and calling eagerly for peace and proper solution among the many causes of the crisis there is also the traditional geopolitical mindsets of the parties involved being determined to push their security borders as further away as possible and to expand their own values based alliances at the expense of others it is this type of tension that has repeatedly cost europe the chance to come to unity failure to find a proper way out could drag the whole world back into the abyss of isolation and confrontation the early years of the 21st century saw a period of relative calm and cooperation among major countries economic globalization thrived bringing valuable growth opportunities that benefited china the uk and many other countries today economic globalization is not only challenged by protectionism and isolationism but also threatened by the possibility of being reversed due to vicious competition between major countries and regional conflict the world is once again facing the choice between peace and war and between integration and split the uk as an established industrial country constantly alert to shifting trends in the world must also be thinking whether history and disaster are bound to repeat themselves and whether they can be averted the uk s vision for global britain conveys its desire to participate more actively in global affairs and play a role compatible with its international stature i wonder how the uk would be managing its relations with china from such a global perspective china has come a long way in its development this is an important aspect of the changing dynamics in our world when i was ambassador to the uk i was often asked two questions what does china want from the world and what can china offer to the world now that i think about it people in the uk apparently saw the shift in china s world stature coming even before we chinese did my answers to those questions at that time were china wants to see enduring peace and stability in the world and china will offer to the world with its peaceful development it has been over 10 years since and the answers remain the same today s china is focused on national rejuvenation and common prosperity for its people to achieve sustained development china needs a world of lasting peace and to that end hopes to see a more inclusive and fair global system adapted and reformed for the well being of all in the world china and the uk are both permanent members of the un security council both support and champion economic globalization both want their voices to be heard and interests ensured as china uk relations enter the next 50 years we need to create positive dynamics between the two sides at the global level because how we perceive each other and define our relations will also play a part in shaping global trends we have a shared responsibility and obligation to resist the forces that try to send the world backward we live in a century of major challenges which can only be met through the joint efforts of china the uk and the rest of the global community for what is at stake is the common welfare of humanity china and the uk must work together on a full range of issues such as global financial stability climate change clean energy nuclear nonproliferation food security counterterrorism and cybersecurity i have no doubt that cooperation at the global level will in turn inspire efforts on the bilateral front both sides will stand to benefit the author is a former ambassador to the uk and vice foreign minister of china if you have a specific expertise or would like to share your thought

a version of this post was originally published on tker co peter lynch the legendary stock picker who ran fidelity s market beating magellan fund for 13 years made a prescient observation in a speech he gave to the national press club back in october 7 1994 it comes from the 38 minute mark of this video via dividendgrowth some event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up volatility will occur markets will continue to have these ups and downs basic corporate profits have grown about 8 a year historically so corporate profits double about every nine years the stock market ought to double about every nine years so i think the market is about 3 800 today or 3 700 i m pretty convinced the next 3 800 points will be up it won t be down the next 500 points the next 600 points i don t know which way they ll go so the market ought to double in the next eight or nine years they ll double again in eight or nine years after that because profits go up 8 a year and stocks will follow that s all there is to it peter lynch source cspan when he says the market lynch is referring the dow jones industrial average which closed at 3 797 on the day he gave the talk if you compound that by an 8 growth rate over 27 5 years which would get you to present day then you get 31 520 the dow closed friday at 34 861 which is pretty darn close for context a 7 growth rate would ve gotten you to 24 405 and a 9 rate would ve gotten you to 40 613 if you did this exercise with the s p 500 which closed at 455 on the day of lynch s talk then you d get 3 778 assuming an 8 compound annual growth rate the s p closed friday at 4 543 a 9 rate would ve gotten you to 4 867 according to s p dow jones indices s p 500 earnings per share eps were 30 11 for the 12 months ending q3 1994 around the time lynch gave that speech if you compounded that by 8 over 27 5 years you d get 250 s p dow jones indices estimates eps for the 12 months ending march 2022 was actually 211 which is close they estimate s p eps will be 246 in 2023 lynch was not predicting the precise point of the market in march 2022 he was talking about how markets trend over longer term periods while acknowledging short term volatility if you allow him some margin of error to account for unpredictable short term swings then you may be able to better appreciate how his thoughts speak to some fundamental market truths we often talk about here at tker i think three elements of what lynch said are critical for investors to understand story continues 1 some event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up volatility will occur this relates to tker stock market truth no 8 the most destabilizing risks are the ones people aren t talking about russia s invasion of ukraine is a good example for investors a conflict between russia and ukraine had not been a concern so markets weren t prepared for it this would explain why stocks went into a deep correction amid the initial news and buildup with these types of unforeseen events prices will swing wildly as markets digest every positive and negative development as the situation unfolds this stands in contrast to the risks everyone has been talking about like inflation and tighter monetary policy these risks had investors concerned for months before those fears were confirmed and the actual news eventually had a limited effect on market volatility 2 i m pretty convinced the next 3 800 points will be up it won t be down the next 500 points the next 600 points i don t know which way they ll go over time the stock market s biggest moves will be to the upside which relates to tker stock market truth no 4 and the long game is undefeated which is tker stock market truth no 1 but you

the 10 people who convened in moscow in mid february came from multiple countries and professions but they had one thing in common they were all directors on the board of yandex russia s largest internet company russia had not yet invaded ukraine and though much of the world was on edge people in moscow and on the board of yandex were incredulous that war was coming this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now yandex s board meeting in the russian capital the first in person meeting in two years was scheduled far in advance aside from the 11th board member the chairman who was videoconferencing in after catching covid 19 the meeting went ahead as planned it would turn out to be the last time that group of people convened as board members within weeks the ripples of the war in ukraine set off big changes across yandex s business and its boardroom not only did the russian stock market shut down but yandex s foreign listed shares on the nasdaq were suspended putting it at risk of defaulting on more than 1 billion in debt several of the company s businesses including the zen newsreader were put on the auction block and yandex s deputy ceo and executive director tigran khudaverdyan was sanctioned by the european union for his ties to russian president vladimir putin leading to his resignation from the company two other yandex board members both from the us also resigned weeks after the meeting esther dyson a well known tech investor and ilya strebulaev a stanford business school professor arkady volozh launched the yandex search engine with his childhood friend ilya segalovich in 1997 mikhail svetlov getty images perhaps just as surprising three other western board members at yandex stayed on vowing to support the management team and our extraordinary employees through these exceptional times and to safeguard the interests of our creditors shareholders users and other stakeholders as john boynton an american and the chairman announced in early march the fractured board has left yandex stumbling into an uncertain future as the company and some of its non russian directors try to balance competing principles and pressures and as the friction between the governments in russia and the us reaches a level not seen since the cold war it s a knife edge we re trying to walk here we need to be concerned about the health and safety of our employees one person close to the company said noting the potential risks in russia of speaking up in a way that is according to the law treasonous while yandex is registered as a company in the netherlands the majority of its operations and its 18 000 employees are in russia where referring to the events in ukraine as a war or invasion carries a penalty of up to 15 years imprisonment reports on monday that the russian oligarch roman abramovich and several ukraine peace negotiators had experienced signs of poisoning added to a general fear for people with ties to russia of doing anything that might be perceived as crossing its hawkish party line you need to be careful not to start offending people and harm the lives of those 18 000 people and all of those shareholders and creditors that got involved another person close to the yandex board told insider discussing the dilemma facing certain insiders does this give you great comfort as an individual raised in the west of course not the uncertainty at yandex is playing out as many american and european companies with business in russia grasp for the right approach some such as mcdonald s and starbucks have closed the doors of their stores in russia apple is no longer selling iphones and other products in russia but its online app store remains open for russians to download apps while apple has not commented on its app store rationale some observers have noted the value of keeping an information pipeline operating in russia s censored media environment as the largest internet search provider in russia with about 4 7 billion in 2021 revenue yandex has a particularly high profile role in the country that s further complicated its options and over the past several weeks divided its own board pressure from outside the boardroom dyson whom the washington post once described as the guiding spirit of the emerging computer industry in eastern europe and russia and strebulaev the stanford professor have not said publicly why they stepped down but both faced tremendous pressure from their networks to speak out against russia according to people close to the company strebulaev a dual citizen of the us and russia received letters from student groups at stanford urging him to get yandex to speak out against the war or to step down from the board one of the people close to the company told insider ilya and esther were feeling a lot of pressure to make a public comment and they felt the best way to do that was as individuals the person said esther dyson stepped down from the board of yandex in march kelly sullivan getty images by contrast charles ryan the other american board member who is a partner at a silicon valley venture capital firm and rogier rijnja a dutch executive who s worked for nike and apple both stayed on at yandex along with boynton dyson a former journalist was especially concerned about russian censorship stepping down has allowed dyson who speaks russian and once trained to become a cosmonaut a level of freedom not afforded to other board members speaking out for the first time last week dyson told radio free europe that the kremlin s influence on yandex search results has gotten worse over time a yandex food delivery courier walks in moscow with a bouquet of flowers in early march sopa images via getty images now you get more and more propaganda results before you get search results she told rfe first you have the advertising then the propaganda then you have the news you cannot get that information on yandex anymore she added later it s not like suddenly the sun sets and the next morning it all changes it happens like all these things somewhat gradually people close to the company pushed back against the idea that yandex is actively censoring its results while yandex does not censor its search results they said the government has legal grounds to restrict which news that aggregators in the country can surface and the government blocks certain websites in russia altogether soon after the invasion yandex added a warning to russian language users looking for news on ukraine that its search results might not be accurate other internet companies that operate in russia have also had to bend to local rules on monday the intercept reported that google has instructed its translators in russia not to use the word war in certain corporate texts in the country such as online policy pages about its advertising products and alphabet has said that some russians are unable to access google news for reasons outside of its control to zachary witlin an analyst with eurasia group the yandex board s internal debate over search results echoes the broader question about the most effective way to punish russia for invading ukraine you have one argument that is every link that can be cut off should be as a protest against putin s war said witlin who researches tech in russia and you have another argument that the state is depending on cutting off information from the russian public so actually it s a point of resistance to maintain ties as openly as possible witlin said the google of russia the past month of events has brought an unexpected turn of fate for the company often referred to as the google of russia which at one point even had offices in downtown palo alto california like google which started around the same time yandex began as a search engine and went on to launch products in news email website hosting and a marketplace today yandex is involved in services varying from self driving cars to streaming video boynton the boston based chairman helped launch yandex while running a computer supplies company called comptek in russia during the 1990s two of his employees the childhood friends arkady volozh and ilya segalovich created the yandex search engine in 1997 three years later comptek spun yandex out as a separate company russian president vladimir putin and yandex ceo arkady volozh mikhail svetlov getty images the russians have proven themselves to be among the best entrepreneurs in the world boynton said at a 2019 event in davos switzerland hosted by russia s roscongress foundation in addition to the math and engineering talent in russia boynton credited yandex s rapid growth to its corporate governance practices when we started yandex back in 2000 we added good business practices in the dna of the company said boynton who is the president of the investment firm firehouse capital and is part owner of three professional women s hockey teams for many years yandex s size and influence seemed to protect the company from meddling by the russian government even as other high profile homegrown tech companies like the facebook clone vkontakte succumbed to government takeovers but signs that yandex wasn t impervious to the kremlin were always there when yandex filed a prospectus to list shares in the us in 2011 it warned potential investors that businesses in russia especially high profile companies may be subject to aggressive application of contradictory or ambiguous laws or regulations or to politically motivated actions i think that the hope for those who still believed in yandex s future is that it was such a big company and such an exemplar of russian innovation that this gave the company a special status said eurasia group s witlin who researches tech in russia it gave it more bargaining power in trying to survive in that environment while it was understood that they had to comply with these regulations that optimism became harder to maintain after november 2019 when russia forced yandex to reconfigure its ownership structure volozh the cofounder and ceo moved his controlling shares into a family trust that would offload his governance rights to a public interest foundation controlled by three yandex represenatives and eight representatives from universities and non governmental organizations in russia most of which have close ties to the government two board members were added to the yandex board to represent the interests of the pif moscow restarts trading on march 3 as russian troops laid siege to kharkiv ukraine s second largest city and the number of civilian casualties in ukraine surpassed 1 000 yandex released its first official statement since the war started in an update on impact of current developments yandex noted that it was not a target of any of the sanctions imposed on russian entities by the us and european governments but it noted that businesses like its online marketplace as well as its data centers could be affected by western companies pulling out of russia yandex also warned that the suspension of trading in its shares meant that it could be forced to repay 1 25 billion in outstanding convertible notes at any time the yandex group as a whole does not currently have sufficient resources to redeem the notes in full the company said noting that only 370 million of its 615 million in dollar or euro denominated cash was held outside of russia meanwhile the rest of yandex s short term cash 47 billion rubles has been crushed by the plunging value of the russian currency over the next few weeks the company released a flurry of announcements chronicling the various ways the war in ukraine was affecting yandex on march 7 yandex said it had begun negotiations with bondholders regarding its convertible notes with yandex s valuation decimated and its shares frozen in both the us and moscow some of the board members felt a responsibility to stick around and resolve the situation with the creditors two people close to the company told insider to what extent financial and reputational damage from a potential default might have also driven the directors decisions remains unclear
learn about how the austin cookie company actually started in the d fw area which is also its biggest market example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video dallas sorry to put this into your head but we re talking about warm gooey cookies with the founders of tiff s treats which technically started in austin in 2000 but the idea and the first batch of cookies were baked up in a richardson house by a college student home for winter break how it began leon chen looking at his wife tiffany tiff chen says it started because this one my lovely wife now but she stood me up on a date tiff chimes in well i did but i also apologized i made this batch of cookies drove it over to his house and they just so happened to still be warm obviously leon fell in love with tiff and with the idea for a business they would start in an austin apartment tiff explains we were 19 years old 19 year old sophomores in college and there s just something to be said about being naïve we call it young and dumb and naïve we just didn t know what we didn t know and that actually served a really great purpose for us because we just kind of barreled through everything a new book about the business now these pioneers of warm cookie delivery have a new book hot off the presses in which they share some of their business know how their timing is good last year a record 5 4 million new business applications were filed in the u s all those new entrepreneurs might be hungry for advice from a couple who turned a little kitchen experiment into a 500 million sugar high yeah i think usually our biggest nugget of advice is be passionate about what you re doing if you want to do it and you want to be successful at it do what you can to make that the primary focus in your life and have the other things be kind of second to that so that you can really put focus on it the couple adds and never underestimate hard work it s going to be hard work and that s something that you can control you can work as hard as you re able and that will really pay off low points on the way to success it certainly paid off for them but there were low points like losing the lease on their first location in austin tiff recalls this was the most likely time we were going to go out of business and it wasn t for anything we did it was that we had lost our lease we didn t have enough money to lease another space no landlord in their right mind would have extended us terms on a lease and we just had nowhere to go she adds we ended up pushing forward and having a great outcome and finding that unbelievable landlord who would take a chance on us and finding a converted house and turning that into a kitchen as opposed to a normal restaurant space so it worked out for us but when we lost that lease and we had i think we had like 45 days to get out that would be one of my lowest and then they opened a second location in dallas but they say the cookies there were off at first the consistency went way off the cookies got huge like just giant they were bigger and they were darker and they were crunchier turns out the dallas ovens were too hot that taught the couple about consistency the importance of communication with staff and about being hands on leaders by the way that one dallas location apparently got north texans hooked we have like 24 locations it s our it s our biggest market and so we have more stores in the d fw area than we do in any other city managing the pandemic and what comes next the pandemic has brought many challenges to the business as far as managing concerns and communicating with employees the chens say one of the biggest challenges in the past few years though was keeping up with soaring demand everybody that was missing birthdays and anniversaries you have to remember how many occasions we all missed and people were just sending cookies we scrambled to hire we hired hundreds of people to keep up with that initial boost of demand and apparently many of those orders were people treating themselves we saw a big boost in self consumption and people especially nights and weekends just needing that comfort snack they sell a lot of cookies might they also eventually sell stock oh yeah that that would be something that we would definitely evaluate when the time comes they say their storefronts have already expanded to a handful of states and more expansion could be on the menu they say there s no reason we can t have warm cookie delivery in every state if they aren t where you are you can find some of their recipes in their new book along with some of their reflections on becoming successful in business they say the recipes don t leave out any secret ingredients but you do have to formulate them differently for home because we re talking about smaller batches so they re tweaked so that it is a home version of the tiff s treats recipe but we re certainly not leaving anything out to make it less good by the way they say the old standby chocolate chip is still the biggest seller for those of you looking for some business advice from the couple i asked them for 13 pieces of advice check them out below a baker s dozen of tiff s treats tips 1 say yes then figure it out when we started out we had no plan much less a formal business plan if we d taken the time to scope out the project and weigh the pros and cons of starting a business concept that had never been done before while we were sophomores in college there s no way we would have chosen to give it a go if we hadn t said yes to certain things then figured them out later about one hundred different times we wouldn t be in business today these days we re a lot more careful and measured in our decision making process but we continually remind ourselves and our team not to overanalyze every situation if you know what you need to do be confident that you ll figure out the how and say yes 2 launch first perfect later the number one mistake we see new founders and experienced leaders make is to try to perfect something too much before launching many times you have no idea what you need until you put it out there a good example of this is when we built the software for our company if we had tried to build what we thought was the perfect system it would have taken us forever by the time we launched it it would have already been outdated and needed to be redone immediately instead we built a system that did the basics of what we needed and over the years let the system evolve by adding features as our company has grown during this process we discovered that many things we thought we needed or thought were most important were soon replaced by new issues problems and opportunities we would have wasted precious resources time and money specifically if we d tried to build version 4 0 before launching version 1 0 one of the most underrated but learnable skills is how to iterate 3 find a niche and stick to it hands down the most frequent response we receive when delivering a box of cookies is they re still warm well of course they are that s what we do from the start we decided that delivering our cookies not only warm but also right out of the oven would be our niche this means that the cookies aren t baked in advance right before your order is due the cookies are put on a tray and popped in the oven once they come out of the oven we have a short window to allow the minimum cooling time for the cookies to keep their shape before they re packaged into a box just for you while still hot if we miss that window and let the cookies cool too long we have to start over again and bake a fresh set of cookies 4 trust your gut when facing a tough decision one that can go either way use your gut as the tiebreaker for any decision big or small we always go with our gut no matter what anybody else says or what any analysis shows 5 learn from your failures in our history we ve possibly had as many failures as successes at the end of each year we create top ten and not top ten lists of the ten best and ten worst things we did that year besides getting a cathartic laugh out of the worst things list it gives us a chance to reflect and see what we can learn from some of the more spectacular failures 6 get comfortable with hard work although there s a lot of great advice out there we continue to return to a foundational idea that s underrated because there s no trick or hack for old fashioned hard work here s what we tell ourselves and our team there is so much about life and business that is out of your control there will always be somebody who is smarter than you who is better connected than you who has more money than you and who might be luckier than you you can t control those things the only thing you do have control over is how hard you work 7 prioritize execution over ideas people often mistakenly think that business success is based on one great idea or a series of great ideas they say warm cookie delivery i wish i had thought of that idea this always makes us smile because we wish it were that easy to simply have a great idea and then everything else falls into place while bright ideas are essential execution is often overlooked in the early years coming up with ideas wasn t an issue getting everything done was that remains true today if you have no way to execute a plan there s no sense in dreaming it up 8 bring on the right people one ingredient that any successful business must have is the right people at the right time building and growing a business takes all different kinds of people and skill sets though our business has needed different things at different times the one constant requirement has been good people 9 make people happy at the core of what we do we connect people through warm moments people rely on us to be a part of special moments in their lives when we meet new people and they hear we started tiff s treats the first thing they usually do is share their warm moment their first or favorite tiff s treats experience we love this because it s extremely rare for any brand to be able to participate in one of the best moments of someone s life like the birth of a child few brands get to be part of something so amazing and personal but for some reason our brand does that is truly special and something we don t ever want to take for granted 10 make it right because we re involved in so many warm moments in people s lives it s important that we make it right no matter the situation in the business of on demand delivery and on demand gifting we re bound to make mistakes we try hard to minimize them but it still happens we have a company goal to keep our error rate to 0 35 percent or under which means we strive to be accurate 99 65 percent of the time even when the mistake isn t our fault we strive to make it right 11 protect the brand protecting the brand is something we regularly talk about within the organization it only recently dawned on us that when we re talking about protecting the brand we re actually talking about protecting it from ourselves more than anything else over the years we ve remained relatively simple in how we operate and what we provide as far as product and service we re careful when adding to our product offerings which must be in service of and not a distraction from being best in the world at warm cookie delivery this doesn t mean we avoid expanding our offerings but staying laser focused on what we do best has been a key to our growth we use protect the brand as our filter whether it s at the store level or the board level 12 be passionate walking down the halls of our office you ll see wonderful people who are here because they want the same thing to make history to build something that has never been built before we talk about it often with our team and have realized it s such an intrinsic motivating factor so we hire people who have a passion around building and creating something special together 13 adapt and grow in our experience there are two kinds of people those who are uncomfortable with change and those who hate it that s not entirely true but it s safe to say that change is an unsettling concept for most people which is why it s one of our values if change is something you can t get on board with and you re hoping for a job that remains basically the same from your first day to your last you re in the wrong place

were no amounts outstanding under any working capital loan we may also need to obtain additional financing either to complete a business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of shares of our class a common stock upon completion of the business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with the business combination based on the foregoing management does not believe that we will have sufficient working capital to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of an initial business combination or one year from this report over this time period we will be using the funds held outside of the trust account for paying existing accounts payable and accrued liabilities identifying and evaluating prospective initial business combination candidates performing due diligence on prospective target businesses paying for travel expenditures selecting the target business to merge with or acquire and structuring negotiating and consummating the initial business combination we believe we may need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating the business furthermore if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business undertaking in depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may have insufficient funds available to operate the business prior to the initial business combination moreover we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete the initial business combination or to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the initial business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such initial business combination our sponsor officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds from time to time or at any time in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion to meet our working capital needs the factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that result from our inability to continue as a going concern there is no assurance that our plans to consummate an initial business combination will be successful by october 21 2022 or by

anticipated effect on our business jobs act the jobs act contains provisions that among other things relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies we qualify as an emerging growth company and under the jobs act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private not publicly traded companies we are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards and as a result we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non emerging growth companies as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates additionally we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the jobs act subject to certain conditions set forth in the jobs act if as an emerging growth company we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to among other things i provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act ii provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non emerging growth public companies under the dodd frank

are you an order muppet or a chaos muppet that may sound like a silly question but michele gelfand a professor of organizational behavior at stanford graduate school of business is entirely serious when she asks it she categorizes cultures and personalities on a spectrum from tight to loose and then examines how those differences affect nations companies families and even individuals the two kinds of muppets first classified by dahlia lithwick in slate in 2012 make for a pretty good proxy for this split in the interest of scientific inquiry i took gelfand s 20 question tight loose quiz like bert big bird and kermit i m a rule follower i tend to get anxious about unknown situations and i m not big on spontaneous or rash decision making on the opposite end of the spectrum are muppets like ernie cookie monster and animal they re more creative but also quasi unpredictable and sometimes impulsive gelfand says she leans loose beyond learning your muppet type the loose tight model provides a useful way to understand why culture and individuals land in different places on the continuum the theory is deceptively simple when groups experience chronic threats think natural disasters famine invasions or other hardships stricter rules help them coordinate to survive they tighten up gelfand explains but groups that don t experience chronic threat can afford to be more permissive gelfand has been doing surveys and experiments across the globe to study the connection between threats and tightening but she wanted a tool that could measure different kinds of threats over time and track how they correlate to cultural responses as well as how they predict political and economic shifts surprised to discover that no such tool existed she decided to build one the result created with researchers in computer science and psychology at the university of maryland college park and published recently in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences is a threat dictionary an algorithmic tool that uses natural language processing to analyze texts the tool identifies language that shows when people feel threatened emotionally or physically and measures the magnitude of that perceived threat the 240 words that define danger other researchers have developed dictionaries on other topics but those efforts relied on people to come up with lists of words gelfand and her coauthors created their 240 word threat dictionary with text from twitter wikipedia and randomly chosen websites algorithms combed through the data selecting words and plotting them on a graph placing terms with similar meanings closer together the team then selected the words that most often co occur across these platforms they didn t just choose synonyms but terms that were often used in association with language that described threats for instance the term unrest is frequently used to describe an impending civil war this approach was more comprehensive than purely human attempts and it allowed the dictionary to capture how people actually write about threats the final list of words reads like an apocalyptic poem attack crisis fear frightening injury suffer toxic unstable quote adding a single threat related word to a tweet about covid increased the expected retweet rate by 18 the dictionary s 240 words aren t specific to any scenario and could be used to describe either interpersonal or external threats they could just as soon describe the terror of a zombie uprising as the drama of a middle school dance but they get at the underlying psychology of a society responding to threats that may be real or imagined the dictionary can also measure the relative magnitude of these threats and compare different levels of threat across texts and over time that could help organizations researchers and societies understand their cultures and intentionally adapt to a given scenario gelfand and her colleagues tested the threat dictionary by feeding it information from three types of historical threats that the u s has faced violent conflicts like world war ii natural disasters like floods and pathogens like covid 19 using a century s worth of newspapers as well as stock market data surveys that recorded attitudes toward immigrants and language used in presidential speeches the study examines how those threats predicted cultural political and economic shifts over the last 100 years gelfand and her colleagues found that when people feel threatened either by a natural disaster a disease outbreak or a human enemy they tighten up presidential approval rates go up as do ethnocentrism and conservatism but innovation suffers as cultural slack is picked up during threat heavy periods fewer patents were filed and stock market prices were lower the researchers also showed that threatening language is contagious adding just a single threat related word to a tweet about covid increased the expected retweet rate by 18 gelfand noted that there are exceptions to the threat tightening link she found that the u s and other relatively loose countries have been slower to respond to the covid pandemic and ultimately had more cases and deaths per capita generally loose cultures have had less threat in their histories she says the united states hasn t fought a war on its soil for over a century we haven t had chronic invasions on our territory so we re not used to sacrificing a lot of liberty for constraint it s just not part of our cultural dna other threats like 9 11 have caused americans to tighten up in the past but covid 19 was different the threat was invisible and abstract and in some loose cultures leaders ignored or downplayed the threat which interrupted the typical tightening that naturally occurs threats put us in a tight spot on the other hand gelfand notes that leaders can manipulate threatening language in speeches or social media and can artificially tighten groups in this way a threat dictionary can help shine a light on how societies react when they feel threatened by identifying when and how often threats appear politicians advertisements and news reports often use fear to manipulate voters or rally people behind a cause but it s hard to measure and study when and how much people feel threatened in cross cultural psychology we want to get as many measures as we can gelfand says that includes surveys but also more unobtrusive tools like the dictionary which she hopes will give researchers an empirical tool to evaluate this complex feeling more precisely and situate it within a larger social political and economic context it can also help elucidate how those cultural changes affect a company or nation by placing them in a larger social context researchers can correlate tightening or loosening with other indicators like stock market prices public opinion polling or investor behavior to see how threats affect different parts of society like the economy or immigration policy the possible uses for the threat dictionary are vast gelfand says it could be used to track when leaders inflate threats and which groups are labeled as dangerous researchers could analyze ceos or officials speeches for threat mentions and compare them to fmri images of what happens in peoples brains as they hear those terms social media users could use it to be more conscious of how they re participating in the spread of threatening messages and make choices about how much of that kind of language they want to see or what they want their kids to see gelfand s threat barometer can be used to track how much threat one is exposed to on social media the dictionary could also be combined with voting data to predict how a perceived threat might influence election results or it could examine how threatening language varies between different media outlets and how it affects the way they report the news tightness versus looseness is a trade off gelfand says and it has to be balanced if you become extraordinarily tight or extraordinarily loose that really causes a lot of problems unlike muppets who are entertaining because they rarely stray from their core characteristics people and cultures can adapt to respond more effectively to difficult situations gelfand hopes the threat dictionary could help nations companies and individuals understand when they need to pivot for more loose chaotic types this could mean tightening up to deal with a pandemic or war for the tighter orderly types this could mean loosening up to create environments that encourage innovation and creative problem solving the point she says isn t that one type is better than the other it s the ability to titrate the right mix that really matters culture s invisible but once we start measuring it we can talk about it gelfand says we can decide mindfully in what domains we want to tighten and in what domains we want to be loose

the idea is that joan bloggs suddenly feels like she has a chance to own a slice of the action at this lower price she buys a few shares and all of a sudden the stock is rising tesla s jump on monday night says there are many investors who believe the mind trick will work but it should be noted academic research suggests the sugar hit from a stock split announcement tends to be relatively short lived and many brokers already allow fractional ownership of stocks meaning retail investors daunted by the high price of tesla shares could already find a way to play the stock without outlaying four figures musk is a frequent tweeter and loves using the social media platform to lead his 79 4 million followers on a merry dance he ll hint at tesla and spacex development plans he ll lash out at the securities and exchange commission heck he even used twitter to infamously suggest he was about to take tesla private in a deal that never happened and landed him in just a little hot water while the tesla stock split announcement didn t come from musk s personal account the market thinks it s got his fingerprints all over it for good or for ill marc lopresti managing director of the strategic funds welcomed the stock split telling bloomberg that musk is one of the masters of market psychology advertisement but david trainer ceo of stock research firm new constructs accused the company of trying to make a stock whose valuation is completely disconnected from fundamentals even more attractive to unsuspecting retail investors this could further fuel the bubble in tesla s stock that has been brewing over the past two years he says veteran tech analyst dan ives from wedbush sees the stock split as a smart strategic move that will be a positive catalyst for shares going forward but ives who has a target price of us1400 on tesla suggesting almost 30 per cent upside from here also makes the case that tesla s fundamentals also look as strong as they have for some time demand for electric vehicles is running hot and supply chain issues have been exacerbated by the war in ukraine pushing up ev prices and margins tesla has already lifted prices this year with selling prices between 9 per cent and 28 per cent higher than a year ago and many in the market see its industry leading automotive gross margin of 36 per cent pushing higher in the next few years with tesla successfully opening its berlin gigafactory last week and planning the opening of its gigafactory in texas next week ives says two of the bigger clouds that had been hanging over the company are dissipating advertisement we believe demand is rapidly building for tesla s model y with 2022 so far looking like another breakout year for tesla and the ev industry ives says while logistical hurdles will be a near term cost burden we importantly believe tesla has the potential to further expand its auto gross margin and profitability profile over the next 12 to 18 months especially with more higher margin cars being sold and produced in china in a nutshell tesla has strong momentum into the rest of 2022 with the biggest overhang of berlin and austin opening ramping now in the rearview mirror does tesla s valuation which sits at more than 220 times earnings still look baffling absolutely and surging bond yields make the surge we ve seen in the past fortnight even more incongruous theoretically rising rates should put pressure on long duration stocks like tesla and other tech giants lisa shalett morgan stanley s chief investment officer in the us said on monday night that as the slope of five year and 30 year us treasury yield curve flattens dramatically and other yield curves head toward inversion the nascent rebound in mega cap tech stocks may stall we are not sanguine about stocks at current valuations and level of earnings expectations to say nothing of the execution risk in the fed s new policy path but even if tesla s valuation remains difficult to wrap your head around ives is right to point out that the fundamentals around tesla s position look strong with supply demand and market position all pointing to higher earnings over the next few years could the combination of improving fundamentals and a psychology driven stock split inflate the tesla bubble to record levels history says it would be dangerous to bet against the momentum musk has built around this stock

the following statement was extensively discussed and approved at a recent meeting of railway workers held to found the cp workers rank and file committee we strongly urge all cp rail workers who agree with the statement to join the committee by emailing cpworkersrfc gmail com and to share the statement widely with friends and colleagues we appeal to rail workers at other companies to contact us to begin building a rank and file committee at their workplace dear brothers and sisters we conductors engineers mechanics and yard workers at cp rail have formed the cp workers rank and file committee to lead an all out fight against the sabotaging of our struggle for better wages working conditions and pensions by the teamsters union the teamsters agreed in a backroom conspiracy with cp management overseen by the trudeau liberal government to a rigged arbitration process that will address none of our pressing concerns they then rammed this agreement down our throats without so much as asking our opinion about it we voted overwhelmingly for strike action last month because we wanted to wage a genuine struggle against cp the sixth largest railroad in north america cp is a highly profitable company that rakes in billions for its well paid executives and rich shareholders by brutally exploiting us under conditions akin to slave labour our strike vote showed our determination to put an end to being at the beck and call of management 24 7 under its arbitrary scheduling regime and draconian disciplinary procedures and to the pension cap but the teamsters had other ideas ensconced in negotiations with cp management since last september the union bureaucrats kept us in the dark about the bargaining process until the last minute and violating our democratic strike vote refused to issue a strike notice as soon as they were legally entitled to do so they handed the initiative to cp management who locked us out on the pretext that our strike would disrupt the economy the reality was that they were not prepared to let worker opposition impede bumper profits for cp s bay street and wall street investors from the high commodity prices produced by the imperialist powers decision to launch an aggressive war drive against and impose sweeping economic sanctions on russia a canadian pacific railway locomotive in calgary alberta photo by jason corbett cc by 4 0 for years prior to our strike vote we have laboured day and night for cp sacrificing our family and personal lives we confront a ruthless disciplinary system under which managers try to fire workers for the tiniest of infractions we deal with an unpredictable scheduling regime that results in us having to drive trains for 10 hours and more often with flammable and other dangerous cargoes after an hour or two of sleep we have no way of challenging safety concerns and the mistreatment of workers through the grievance procedure because management has intentionally backlogged it meaning that a complaint takes more than two years to resolve the teamsters unifor and other rail unions are complicit in this corporate dictatorship they negotiate collective agreements with the company that are violated on a daily basis but tell us to work now and grieve later with the result that cp is never held to account the teamsters bureaucrats used the threat of government back to work legislation to justify their acceptance of a pro employer government appointed arbitrator in a letter to the membership teamsters lead negotiator dave fulton said that the union knew that the trudeau government would force an arbitrated settlement so they decided to take control of the process in other words the teamsters decided to do the liberal government s dirty work and enforce cp s dictates on us because they didn t want our struggle to become a working class political challenge to trudeau and his big business government the establishment of our committee is part of an upsurge of working class opposition to this corporate union government dictatorship across north america our fellow railroaders at bnsf established the bnsf workers rank and file committee last month to fight the onerous hi viz attendance policy which allows the continent s largest railroad to determine almost every aspect of its workers lives what we fight for the teamsters and the pro capitalist trade unions as a whole long ago abandoned their role of defending workers interests the privileged bureaucrats who head the teamsters canada rail conference many of whom have not set foot in a rail yard or locomotive for years have only one concern their own careers they prioritize their corporatist relationships with company executives and government ministers over the interests of the workers they claim to represent this is why we are making the fight against the arbitration agreement the starting point for a rank and file rebellion of railroaders and their supporters against the unions sabotaging of our struggle our committee will advocate the following demands a 30 percent wage increase with permanent cola inflation is currently running at nearly 6 percent and cp s deep pockets are more than capable of providing us with wages that keep pace with price rises accurate train lineups visible to all workers we refuse to be bullied into driving trains after one or two hours of sleep due to the company s failure to create reliable lineups a return to the 40 hour workweek we regularly toil for 12 hours and more a day producing profits for cp we demand a healthier work life balance so we can spend time with our friends and families stop abusing the spare board as a pool of flexible full time labour and return it to its original function as a backup to allow workers to determine their own schedule and book personal time off whenever necessary hire more workers to guarantee adequate maintenance and stop the de manning of crews rail workers and the public should not be put at risk because cp wants to cut corners on safety de man crews and reduce maintenance on its aging lines so it can pay more to its corporate investors lift the pension cap the teamsters agreed to the cap in 2012 because cp said it was struggling now this multi billion dollar company is preparing to buy kansas city southern and create the first ever multi national railroad in the words of ceo keith creel if the company can afford this massive expansion it can afford to pay us a decent pension on which we can retire after decades of breaking our bodies for their benefit down time must be respected we demand an end to the practice of the company burdening us on our rest days with questions about safety or disciplinary procedures if investigations need to be done into an incident or breach of safety they should take place on company time worker control over safety scheduling and train speeds we will not tolerate the continuation of a rigged grievance procedure that never addresses any of our concerns we demand that railroaders have the right to immediately refuse work they deem dangerous without the threat of being pulled from service for spurious company led investigations that drag on for years workers should have the right to halt operations to prevent the spread of covid 19 no more surveillance cameras in our locomotives we demand an end to the constant surveillance of our every move and the intimidation of workers who speak up with petty disciplinary punishments no more secret bargaining and rigged collective agreements we demand that all future negotiations be livestreamed so that workers know what is being discussed we reject interference by governments at any level with our right to fight for decent wages and working conditions including through back to work legislation and anti democratic binding arbitration which always produces outcomes favourable to management if not its express wishes these demands are based on what we and our families need to live and work safely not what creel and cp s billionaire investors claim the company can afford to ensure that the cp workers rank and file committee fights for these demands we will organize our committee under the following rules our committee is completely independent of the teamsters unifor and all other trade unions membership in our committee is open to rank and file rail workers only union officials and company spies are not welcome the committee can only be an open forum for free democratic debate if it is controlled by the workers themselves not an army of petty functionaries with ties to big business and the state our committee does not appeal for support to any of the established political parties the new democrats liberals bloc quebecois and conservatives all serve the interests of corporate canada this fact was highlighted this past week by the ndp s announcement of a confidence and supply agreement under which it will prop up the trudeau liberals for the next three years so they can continue to participate in nato s proxy war against russia hike military spending and impose austerity on workers instead our appeal is to rail workers across north america as well as workers in all economic sectors to join us in a unified counter offensive for decent paying secure jobs for all unite the working class behind cp rail workers the struggle at cp rail is a key battleground for workers across canada the united states and internationally as the ruling elites prepare to plunge the world into a catastrophic war potentially fought with nuclear weapons they cannot tolerate any dissent by workers at home the arbitration deal that cp the teamsters and trudeau government are trying to impose on us will rob us of any right to strike perform work to rule or bargain for improvements for years to come if they succeed similar draconian methods will be employed against working people everywhere we issue a special appeal to our brothers and sisters at bnsf who have already established a rank and file committee to fight for their demands at cn canada s largest railway and at all class i railroads in the us let us organize a common struggle against the rampant profiteering and corporate union imposed dictatorship that currently dominates north america s railroads if creel and his corporate buddies plan on building a multi national railway to ship cargo and exploit workers from the canadian arctic to tropical mexico then we will build a multi national worker led counter offensive of canadian american and mexican railroaders to stop corporate profiteering at the expense of our health safety and very lives to do this we must reject canadian and american nationalism which the unions have used to divide workers for decades and facilitate company dictated attacks on working conditions jobs and wages we must also oppose the trudeau and biden administration s vast spending on the military and subsidies to the corporations and stock markets rail workers and all working people have no interest in supporting wars for profit and geopolitical influence we make a particular appeal to our most powerful allies the international working class workers everywhere are engaged in struggles for better conditions wage and pension improvements and against savage employers over 800 ferry workers in britain are currently fighting their overnight firing by the ship operator p o and their replacement by contract workers earning a fraction of the regular wage in spain tens of thousands of truckers are protesting exorbitant fuel prices and facing down a brutal state led crackdown by thousands of police officers the cp workers rank and file committee will do all it can to unify these struggles by supporting the international workers alliance of rank and file committees the iwa rfc was established last year to provide global coordination to the struggles of workers in every country and arm them with an anti capitalist socialist program we urge all rail workers who agree with this statement to join and help build our committee email us at cpworkersrfc gmail com
