lawyers for the tech billionaire said he s repeatedly asked to evaluate how many of twitter s 229 million accounts are fake detroit elon musk is threatening to walk away from his 44 billion bid to buy twitter accusing the company of refusing to give him information about its spam bot and fake accounts lawyers for the tesla and spacex ceo made the threat in a letter to twitter dated monday that the company disclosed in a filing with the u s securities and exchange commission the lawyers wrote that musk has repeatedly asked for the information since may 9 about a month after his offer to buy the company so he could evaluate how many of the company s 229 million accounts are fake twitter ceo parag agrawal has said that twitter has consistently estimated that fewer than 5 of its accounts are spam but musk has disputed that contending in a may tweet without providing evidence that 20 or more are bogus shares of twitter inc slid 1 5 monday likely incensing twitter shareholders who filed a suit against musk late last month for deflating the price of the stock shares of twitter are down more than 20 in the last month twitter said in a statement monday that it has been cooperatively sharing information with musk in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and noted that the deal is in the best interest of all shareholders we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms it added musk agreed to buy twitter for 54 20 a share back in april a number of musk s actions since including a public spat with twitter s ceo about the fake accounts on twitter has led some experts to question whether the billionaire wants to use his loud complaints to negotiate a lower deal price or even walk away entirely musk s lawyers wrote in the letter that twitter has offered only to provide details about the company s testing methods but they contend that s tantamount to refusing mr musk s data requests and constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement that gives musk the right to scrap the deal if he chooses this is a clear material breach of twitter s obligations under the merger agreement and mr musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement the letter says musk wants underlying data to do his own verification of what he says are twitter s lax methodologies the twitter sale agreement allows musk to get out of the deal if there is a material adverse effect caused by the company it defines that as a change that negatively affects twitter s business or financial conditions twitter has said all along that it s proceeding with the deal although it hasn t scheduled a shareholder vote on it last month musk said that he unilaterally placed the deal on hold which experts said he can t do if he walks away he could be on the hook for a 1 billion breakup fee musk s latest maneuver shows how he is looking for a way out of the deal or something that will get leverage for a renegotiation of the price said brian quinn a law professor at boston college but quinn said it s unlikely to hold up in court since he already waived his ability to ask for more due diligence i doubt he would be allowed to walk away quinn said at some point the board of twitter will tire of this and file a suit asking a judge to force musk to stick to the deal twitter has disclosed its bot estimates to the u s securities and exchange commission for years while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low if twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates mr musk does not understand the company s reluctance to allow mr musk to independently evaluate those estimates the musk letter says adding that he agrees not to disclose or keep the data the bot problem is a longtime fixation for musk who has more than 96 million twitter followers and whose name and likeness are often mimicked by fake accounts promoting cryptocurrency scams musk appears to think such bots are also a problem for most other twitter users as well as advertisers who take out ads on the platform based on how many real people they expect to reach musk s lawyers are arguing that he is entitled to data about the core of twitter s business model so he can prepare the transition to his ownership citing a june 1 letter from twitter in which the company said it only has to give information related to closing the sale musk s team says the company is obligated to provide data for any reasonable business purpose needed to complete the deal
the city s partnership with evolv a massachusetts based gun detection company is raising hackles with one of its top competitors whose honcho finds it troubling that mayor adams administration didn t contact his company with a similar offer that assertion comes just days after a spokesman for the mayor said city hall contacted a number of companies about gun detection technology evolv has two primary competitors ceia usa and patriot one patriot one technologies ceo peter evans said the fact that his company hasn t been considered for a pilot is concerning and troubling and suggested the reason behind it is because patriot doesn t exactly have the right connections in city hall i don t have any investor group who s got a personal relationship with the mayor evans told the daily news patriot one technologies ceo peter evans the competition evolv technologies has launched two free programs with the city since adams took office in january one at city hall in manhattan and another at jacobi medical center in the bronx evolv is the client of a lobbying firm moonshot strategies whose ceo jason ortiz did work for a pro adams political action committee that pac accepted 750 000 from kenneth griffin ceo of the citadel investment firm and 250 000 from robert granieri founder of jane street financial services as of last month both of those companies held sizable investments in evolv a security screening device by evolv technology is pictured outside new york city hall in lower manhattan new york on tuesday may 17 2022 evans told the news the adams administration s failure to contact them about doing a pilot program is myopic especially considering public and private entities typically test out new technology from multiple firms before committing to use it the mayor needs to expand his perspective and look at all the technologies evans said i would encourage the mayor to look more broadly there s more than just one solution patriot one has contracts to use its gun detection devices with the u s inspector general s office the kia auto manufacturer and the moody center in austin texas evans noted he added that his sales team has attempted to contact the adams administration but has failed to make any headway ceia did not return messages adams spokesman fabien levy noted both evolv pilots came to the city free of charge and their point of contact in city government has been phil banks adams deputy mayor for public safety as well as banks staffers beatriz almeida director of customer marketing for evolv technology demonstrates the evolv express weapons detection system which shows a green light to indicate that no weapons were detected in manhattan new york on wednesday may 25 2022 last month levy told the news banks and his team contacted a number of companies in addition to evolv but asked to name the companies levy demurred arguing it doesn t make sense to publicly name every company the city is doing research on he added that if any company is chosen for a paid program the normal procurement procedure would be followed under its procurement process the city is required to put out requests for proposals when city contracts are above certain dollar amounts although the city can also forego the competitive bidding process in the event of an emergency like covid or if there s only one contractor reasonably capable of performing a job while a free pilot program doesn t trigger the city s procurement process experts contend pilot programs like the ones evolv has been involved with could give a company an advantage over competitors when it comes to public relations john kaehny head of the government watchdog reinvent albany called it a brand boost and questioned why the process of selecting evolv for the pilot occurred at the city hall level and not at an agency like the nypd that suggests to everyone in government that they re the preferred vendor right off the bat he said when city hall gets directly involved in procurement you have problems you don t want to go there because the potential for pay to play for conflicts of interest is too high whether evolv s pilot program with the city gave it an edge over competitors is difficult to say however since evolv s weeklong city hall pilot the company s stock showed a modest increase from 2 47 a share on may 17 to 2 82 on monday evans noted in the high tech field he works in investors are constantly looking for the next big thing and that translates into a lot of pressure everybody s looking for the unicorn he said there s incredible pressure that comes from investors the evolv express weapons detection system flags a weapon that dominick d orazio evolv technology account executive wears on his hip while demonstrating the system in manhattan new york on wednesday may 25 2022 meanwhile evolv contends it s followed all disclosure requirements in a written statement company spokeswoman dana loof referenced many private venues the company guards in the big apple including citi field and lincoln center saying it helped protect 11 million people in new york last year that record provides us with references few others can match she said evolv s ceo peter george also recently touted his heavily ex cop laden salesforce as a big asset to the firm evolv technology ceo peter george just days after the news ran its story on evolv s connections to pro adams donors george appeared at the cowen s 50th annual technology media telecom conference to talk up his tech about a third of our salespeople were former police officers in fact the one here in new york was an nypd cop and he s a really good sales guy because he understands who we re selling to george said he has the secret handshake

prime minister marles said he has not received a formal invitation to meet with his counterpart at the shangri la dialogue a spokesperson from his office said the australian government has said that it welcomes the opportunity to resume ministerial dialogue with china china s foreign minister told state media outlet xinhua that beijing will continue an open attitude and carry out more trilateral or quadrilateral cooperation with australia and new zealand in the pacific as it tries to push a regional security deal with pacific island nations wang yi previously said any defrosting in china and australia s relationship would need to be sparked by concrete actions the australian government has left the door open for high level dialogue with china as the deputy prime minister prepares to head to singapore for a defence summit pictured chinese president xi jinping mr marles says he is hoping to organise discussions with united states defence secretary lloyd austin mr austin is addressing the conference about us indo pacific defence policy while china s minister of national defence wei fenghe will speak about beijing s vision for the asia pacific the summit will come a week after tensions between canberra and beijing heightened over an aerial incident in the south china sea region mr marles revealed on sunday a chinese j 16 aircraft flew dangerously close to a raaf p 8a poseidon conducting routine surveillance in international airspace prime minister anthony albanese called the may 26 incident an act of aggression and a dangerous act against the australian airforce china fires back at little bully australia after it s exposed for aggressive fighter jet fly by that damaged raaf plane by aidan wondracz and padraig collins for daily mail australia beijing has hit back at australia after the country slammed a chinese fighter jet for intercepting one of its spy planes in a very dangerous mid air incident with a graphic depiction showing just how close the two planes came it was announced on sunday that an raaf p 8a poseidon aircraft was carrying out maritime surveillance in the south china sea when it was intercepted by a chinese j 16 fighter aircraft on may 26 defence minister richard marles blasted it as a dangerous manoeuvre while prime minister anthony albanese raised his concerns directly with china a depiction of the incident showed the j 16 narrowly cutting in front of the p 8a and releasing aluminium strips that went into the plane s engine the global times which is the chinese communist party s mouthpiece published an opinion piece accusing australia of acting like a little bully the rising tensions between the two countries prompted mr albanese to make a trip to jakarta to meet with indonesian president joko widodo on monday with the pair set to discuss pressing issues such as trade climate change and regional security it was announced on sunday that an raaf p 8a poseidon aircraft was carrying out maritime surveillance in

the j 16 fighter jet while prime minister anthony albanese raised his concerns directly with the chinese government pictured stock image of a j 16 fighter jet the global times claimed the australian government had failed to address several questions about the operation in the south china sea for example where exactly in the south china sea is the area in which the incident occurred it read how far is it from the chinese islands and reefs in the region what is their purpose here furthermore what did the australian military aircraft do before the intercept the media outlet said it was the latest claim made by australia in its campaign of groundless accusations against china on february 17 the australian defence force adf said a chinese navy vessel directed a laser at a p 8a poseidon as it flew over australia s northern approaches the incident was slammed and the adf warned it could have endangered the safety and lives of their personnel the global times claimed there was evidence proving the p 8a was flying too close to the chinese vessel and said the australian military had become a professional for blackmail the global times said it was the latest claim made by australia in its campaign of groundless accusations against china this time marles also pretended to be the weak and said in front of a reporter s microphone that australia will not be deterred by china s intimidation the article read this is obviously a tone favored by american and western journalists and australian politicians are well versed in it and pick what they want to hear australia versus china trade war in october 2020 china imposed informal bans on australian cotton and coal a month later australian sugar barley lobsters wine copper and timber were added to the list six meat processors were banned from exporting beef to china in december 2020 australia lodged a complaint with the world trade organization over china s 80 5 per cent tariffs on its barley exports in the filing australia claimed china deviated from wto rules 26 times in march 2021 china imposed duties of between 116 2 per cent and 218 4 per cent on australian wine making it too expensive for chinese consumers this effectively killed the market advertisement the opinion piece said canberra s approach was inappropriate and unwise as china had never posed a threat to australia judging from the two recent incidents involving the ship and the aircraft we need to remind canberra that sinophobia does australia more harm than good it read it has been proven time and again that the more conscientiously canberra acts in front of washington the more easily the former will become a stepping stone mr marles said conducting surveillance over the south china sea is completely within our rights under international law this is a body of water which is deeply connected to australia because of our trade which goes through there he said we have made representations to the chinese government but we will not be deterred from engaging in the activities which we are entitled to at international law in the future mr marles said the crew was unharmed they responded professionally to the incident and returned the plane to the base what occurred was that the j 16 aircraft flew very close to the side of the p 8 maritime surveillance aircraft he said in flying close to the side it released flares the j 16 then accelerated and cut across the nose of the p 8 settling in front of the p 8 at very close distance at that moment it then released a bundle of chaff which contained small pieces of aluminium some of which were ingested into the engine of the p 8 aircraft australian chinese relations have struggled since april 2020 when then prime minister scott morrison called for world health organisation investigators in wuhan to have the same powers as un backed weapons inspectors the who was investigating the origin of the covid 19 pandemic a virus that effectively forced the world to lock down for two years prime minister anthony albanese left and defence minister richard marles right both criticised an incident between a chinese fighter jet and an australian surveillance plane in november 2020 it emerged that the chinese embassy in canberra had drawn up what became known as the list of grievances 14 black marks that were china s reasons for the bad blood with australia the list included the incessant wanton interference in china s affairs outrageous condemnation of the governing party of china and an unfriendly or antagonistic report on china by media in january three months before he became prime minister mr albanese said australia s relationship with china would remain difficult whoever s in government it will be a difficult relationship he said it will be difficult because the posture of china has changed

companies under us securities and exchange commission sec investigation focus on marshaling the facts defenses and related strategies during the course of the investigation and making presentations to the enforcement staff however there is also a parallel issue that companies often grapple with whether the investigation should be publicly disclosed in general public companies under investigation are not required to disclose the existence of the investigation to the public however even without an independent duty to disclose case law dictates that if a company speaks on an issue it has a duty to tell the whole truth the us court of appeals for the second circuit s recent decision in noto v 22nd century group inc is a wake up call for companies to consider disclosing an sec investigation when they have disclosed the transactions or activities that are the subject of the investigation where there has otherwise been no disclosure of the investigation itself failure to do so may result in the sustaining of fraud claims in private litigation for not disclosing an sec investigation in depth in noto the complaint against a public company and two executives alleged that the defendants failed to disclose an sec investigation into the company s internal control over financial reporting the company disclosed in sec filings that management had concluded that material weaknesses existed in its internal control over financial reporting and that it had undertaken remediation efforts ultimately in the form 10 q for the second quarter of 2018 the company disclosed that it completed its remediation plan that was targeted at eliminating the previously reported material weaknesses throughout the period of these disclosures the company was aware that the sec was investigating its internal controls after online commentators revealed the sec investigation and an alleged paid stock promotion scheme the company s price fell and the plaintiffs alleged they were harmed the district court dismissed the complaint ruling that the company had no duty to disclose the investigation the second circuit reversed finding that the complaint adequately alleged that the defendants violated rule 10b 5 b by not mentioning the sec investigation thus making the disclosure of the internal control deficiencies misleading defendants had a duty to disclose the sec investigation in light of specific statements they made about the company s accounting weaknesses because defendants here specifically noted the deficiencies and that they were working on the problem and then stated that they had solved the issue the failure to disclose would cause a reasonable investor to make an overly optimistic assessment of the risk indeed the nondisclosure remained a material omission even after the company represented that it had rectified the problem because the sec investigation was ongoing noto appears to be the first decision tying the duty to disclose an investigation to concurrent disclosures that the company has deficiencies and weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting a logical extension of the second circuit s reasoning would apply to disclosures made about an issuer conducting an internal investigation if in addition to conducting an internal investigation the sec were investigating the matter disclosing such an internal investigation without disclosing the sec investigation would appear to run counter to the court s rationale for sustaining the fraud complaint disclosure issues related to governmental investigations are not likely to abate but are expected to grow as the biden administration ratchets up enforcement actions across many fronts including financial reporting antitrust the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa false claims and consumer protection that is certainly anticipated to be the case with sec enforcement activity with tough pronouncements emanating from the sec division of enforcement s leadership and the white house boosting the sec s proposed budget by more than 11 from fiscal year 2021 and boosting the enforcement division s budget by 53 million we can identify several measures to consider in assessing the disclosure issues including ensuring that individuals who would have information about an investigation participate in the company s regular disclosure review process close collaboration between disclosure counsel and defense counsel to advise the company on whether there is a duty to disclose an investigation and or strategic reasons for making a voluntary public disclosure this collaboration would include advising on the requirements of accounting standard codification 450 to determine whether disclosure of a loss contingency from a lawsuit or government investigation when the loss is required and an assessment of the disclosure requirements under items 103 and 303 of regulation s k regular evaluation of the disclosure position and reassessment of materiality as the course of the investigation unfolds footnotes caiola v citibank n a 295 f 3d 312 331 2d cir 2002 meyer v jinkosolar holdings co 761 f 3d 245 250 2d cir 2014 in re vivendi s a sec litig 838 f 3d 223

justin higginbottom kzmu at the chalky slopes of the book cliffs in southeastern utah christine sandbach a graduate student at utah state university has a beaver in a cage that she s trying to get a read on whenever we interact with them we record their behavior so she just kind of turned away when i opened up the cage cover so that would be fearful says sandbach standing in a leafy oasis along the shallow price river sandbach is one a number of modern day trappers searching the state for beavers in a partnership between governmental agencies and university researchers but they aren t after pelts instead they re using the semi aquatic animal to lessen effects of drought in the region in sandbach s time trapping she s gotten to know quite a few of the large rodents it s interesting they really do have different behaviors we just released our last one he was super aggressive like the whole time he was a big male he was kind of scary he would hiss and lunge at us says sandbach but the beaver today is calm with her back turned sandbach named her ice baby after finding her in the cold waters of a high elevation canyon ice baby had contributed to an impressive complex which the land s owner thought was getting out of control although ice baby now finds herself some 60 miles south of her home waters she s actually lucky before this project usually the solution would be lethal removal says sandbach now the hope is that ice baby will go to work for the state prolonged drought is drying up sections of this river and threatening its fish including three endangered species sandbach and others think beavers can help photo utah state university graduate student christine sandbach releases a beaver into the price river in woodside utah on may 25th 2022 kzmu news justin higginbottom beavers are great for the environment says julie young a professor at usu working on this project everything kind of benefits or has the potential to benefit when there s beavers around creating more marsh habitats she says beavers build dams to create ponds they can dip into and avoid predators on this stretch of the price river there s a number of human made beaver dam analogues bdas to help ice baby get started the idea is that maybe if we have beavers out there and they have bdas they will dam up some water and let it trickle year round says young and that will help the fish young says researchers around the country are studying beaver benefits for example in colorado beaver made wetlands have acted as breaks for wildfires this project is a bit of a test case after all it s not an area you might think to find the animal what s unique about this is it is a desert river system and that s more rare says young she says there s some really nice dam complexes on the nearby san rafael river and that s what the price river could look like if beavers are in sufficient number and decide to dam it up she says there once was up to 200 million beavers in north america but the fur trade of previous centuries decimated that population luckily for beavers the price of their pelts have plummeted top hats made from their fur fell out of fashion a while ago there s still only 10 to 15 million beavers left on the continent as the west s population has expanded beavers are once again in conflict with humans this time with landowners that s where nate norman comes in he s another modern day trapper in a lot of ways it s similar to the old time trappers we re looking for the signs of where the beavers are moving and where they re active and then luring them into areas with either food or scent says norman a biologist with the beaver ecology and relocation center at usu although unlike past mountain men he s using non lethal methods he says the state passes on reports of nuisance beavers and he ll reach out to property owners to see if they d prefer relocation to extermination he also educates them on the usefulness of beavers we ve had some successes where people have been okay to leave the beaver on their site and not actually have them removed says norman he says in the last five years more landowners have had a change of heart toward beavers during ongoing drought ranchers have especially come around to the benefits of beavers building stock ponds to provide water for cattle they realized that when they go out and build a stock pond and it flows out in the springtime they ve got to go back up there and fix it but if a beaver builds a pond and it blows up in the springtime the beaver go fix it says norman beavers also help to grow riparian vegetation used for animal feed important as well during a drought back at the price river ice baby is acting a little less fearful she s in view of the water and gnawing at her cage sandbach points out an artificial dam so that is a bda right there that was built last year they used to have a ton of juniper and stuff and were way bigger but they ve gotten blown out with floods says sandbach sandbach says that workers built around 70 bdas last year in the state if ice baby likes this spot then her job is done so that s sort of the goal here is to have this feedback you build the bdas then translocate beavers the bdas make the habitat better for the beavers and then in turn the beavers maintain their bdas so there s no extra resources going into that sandbach sandbach opens the cage and

tesla s three for one stock split is official the friday announcement came just one day after tesla s shareholder meeting at its new headquarters in austin texas tesla said the stock split can help reset share prices so that employees have more flexibility in managing their equity and to be more accessible to our retail shareholders it s the second stock split for the company in less than two years this follows the recent stock splits from a string of tech companies including google shopify and amazon here is what the stock split will mean for tesla shareholders and why it could end up being a lucrative action when does tesla s stock split take effect tesla s stock split will take effect on august 25 investors who owned tesla stock on august 17 will receive an additional two shares after markets close on august 24 what is a 3 for 1 stock split a stock split means a single share gets split into multiple shares typically companies do 2 for 1 or 3 for 1 though amazon recently executed a 20 for 1 split the price of tesla shares after the stock split will get divided by three so if the split took place at friday s closing price of 865 a share the split adjusted price would go down to 288 tesla stock split elon s encore tesla pursues its 2nd stock split in less than 2 years buying a home how the 2022 housing market could be shifting in your favor tesla s market value wouldn t change as a result of the split because share prices would decrease at a proportional rate to the number of shares made available do you lose money when a stock splits since a stock s market value doesn t change shareholders don t lose any money because of a stock split is a stock split good generally speaking stock splits are a good sign because they mean that a company has done so well that the price of a single share is too expensive for an average retail investor should you buy before or after a stock split theoretically stock splits by themselves shouldn t influence share prices after they take effect since they re essentially just cosmetic changes but bank of america research analysts found that since 1980 s p 500 companies that announced stock splits significantly outperformed the index 3 6 and 12 months after the initial announcement over 12 months stocks that announced splits gained an average of 25 compared with a 9 gain in the s p 500 the research seems to suggest that it s better to buy a stock before it splits so you can have skin in the game before it shoots higher keep in mind that some of the outperformance is likely due to momentum the analysts wrote in a research note published after amazon announced its split on march 9 once the split is executed investors who have wanted to gain or increase exposure may start to rush for the chance to buy ultimately a company s underlying strength is what drives the direction of a stock they wrote since amazon made the split announcement five months ago its stock is virtually unchanged as of friday afternoon elisabeth buchwald is a personal finance and markets correspondent for usa today you can follow her on twitter buchelisabeth and sign up for our daily money newsletter here

according to hellenic shipping news petroleum tanker rates for routes originating in europe climbed to record highs in april 2022 tanker rates have exploded to multi year highs following an uptick in demand spurred by the u s ban on russian oil the oil tanker business is booming as supply struggles to meet up with demand market experts consider rising inflation and the ukraine crisis as the two biggest market risks this year runaway inflation has been corroding asset values limiting buying power and eating away at corporate margins while russia s invasion of ukraine has disrupted key energy and commodity supply chains causing massive price spikes consequently the dow jones transportation average has slumped 12 since the beginning of the year on fears of waning domestic demand but the oil tanker business is proving to be a different beast after a bleak 18 month period the tanker market is enjoying a bumper year thanks to a limited supply of fresh tonnage as well as an increase in oil demand pipeline and terminal operator kinder morgan nyse kmi has revealed that day rates for vessels that move oil and refined products between u s ports have improved after the united states banned russian oil and product imports this year according to kmi daily chartering rates are moving toward the bottom end of pre pandemic rates of 60 000 to 65 000 kinder morgan which owns about 16 jones act vessels says it has recorded a meaningful uptick in demand spurred by the u s ban following russia s invasion of ukraine kmi is not the only crude vessel operator that has expressed that sentiment nordic american tankers nyse nat has revealed that spot suezmax rates have increased significantly this year shipping rates tend to rise during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions operators demand higher compensation to send their vessels into dangerous waters and underwriters bump up the cost to insure ships and their cargo against potential threats increasing war risk premiums sanctions on russia s energy and maritime shipping sectors have forced crude oil buyers in europe to purchase their crude oil imports from other markets the united states imported 672 000 barrels per day of russian crude and refined products in 2021 of which 30 or 199 000 bpd was crude while 473 000 bpd was refined products according to allied s research analyst mr yiannis vamvakas demand for crude dropped massively in 2020 taking tanker demand down with it in the charter market now as global markets progressively returned towards normality during the following quarters demand for oil also improved however the rate of this improvement was much slower than what was initially expected under the current circumstances of a russian war with ukraine and western sanctions toying with global oil and gas markets it s not surprising that tanker stocks have outperformed the broader market by a wide margin related why nuclear energy is more relevant than ever among crude tanker owners kinder morgan has gained 22 1 in the year to date tsakos energy navigation nyse tnp has gained 40 2 frontline nyse fro has advanced 34 6 teekay tankers nyse tnk is up 79 7 euronav nyse eurn has jumped 47 7

that are booming according to hellenic shipping news petroleum tanker rates for routes originating in europe climbed to record highs in april 2022 thanks to geopolitical instability related to russia s full scale invasion of ukraine as well as rising marine fuel prices also known as bunker fuel dirty tanker rates for aframax sized vessels originating in the black sea in southeast europe more than tripled to 32 10 per metric ton mt in april 2022 from 10 11 mt price in january 2022 the tanker rates for routes originating in the baltic sea in northern europe rocketed to 41 38 mt in april 2022 up from 7 50 mt in january 2022 due to a global shortage of aframax ships the dirty tanker rate for the baltic uk continent ukc route jumped from 8 53 mt in january 2022 to 41 38 mt in april 2022 advertisement petroleum tankers are generally classified into two groups clean tankers and dirty tankers clean tankers carry lower sulfur petroleum products including refined petroleum products such as motor gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel and naphtha dirty tankers mostly carry crude oil but they can also haul high sulfur petroleum products such as residual fuel oil the high tanker rates in the black sea are mainly due to higher insurance risk premiums because the sea borders ukraine and russia the black sea also borders georgia turkey bulgaria and romania hsn says one cause for the high aframax rates at russia s baltic sea port primorsk could be higher demand for the smaller aframax ships on routes traveling from russian ports to china normally very large crude carriers vlccs are used to transport russia s ural crude oil to china by alex kimani for oilprcie com more top reads from oilprice com

bank regulators in the u s have steadfastly guided the transition to sofr secured overnight financing rate as a superior alternative to the scandal tarred libor or the london interbank offered rate libor which banks had used since 1986 was phased out on december 31 2021 sofr is considered a more accurate and risk free benchmark rate compared to libor for banks to price loans mortgages and other types of debt but sofr may not be the golden alternative it is touted to be in times of crises such as recessions sofr doesn t offer banks the cushion they got from libor to price in the additional risk they take on according to new research by urban jermann wharton professor of finance in a paper titled interest received by banks during the financial crisis libor vs hypothetical sofr loans he showed that during the 2008 financial crisis libor allowed banks to receive additional interest of up to 30 billion on loans of about 2 trillion that they would not have received under sofr his study covered the period between july 2007 and june 2009 specifically for this period which broadly covers the global financial crisis the 1 month and 3 month libor paid significantly more interest than hypothetical sofr rates the paper stated essentially jermann estimated how much the credit sensitivity of libor helped lenders during the financial crisis the 30 billion in interest income due to the credit sensitivity of libor is not a trivial amount the paper noted putting that in perspective on march 6 2009 when bank share prices tanked the top 20 commercial banks from 2007 had a combined market capitalization of 204 billion this additional income hedged banks increased funding costs and more generally provided support in a time of large losses jermann wrote when there is a crisis the interest rate on libor loans increases but not with sofr urban jermann the risk premium on libor loans acts like an insurance for banks jermann said during the financial crisis banks were prone to risks and some banks failed which explained the risk premium for banks unsecured borrowing in normal times libor loans are a little cheaper said jermann but then when there is a crisis the interest rate on libor loans increases but not with sofr in fact sofr stays low and it can even go down at the onset of the covid 19 pandemic in march 2020 libor increased relative to sofr for about a month and banks received higher interest income of about one percentage point than they would have under sofr to compensate for the increase in their cost of funds that was the insurance libor provided banks jermann explained bank lending is asymmetrical in that firms with lines of credit from their banks have their credit spread locked in even if their credit quality goes bad many bank loans are credit lines where the credit spread and the terms are determined up front said jermann if the credit quality of a business goes down the bank still has to continue lending money on the other hand if a firm s credit quality improves they can just go to another bank for a cheaper loan so it s asymmetric sofr exacerbates this asymmetry because it is not sensitive to credit risk with libor at least borrowing firms had to pay more if market wide credit risk increases the case for sofr jermann acknowledged that sofr is superior to libor in that it has a robust base of transactions about 1 trillion daily according to the new york federal reserve and it is not vulnerable to the types of manipulation that preceded libor s downfall sofr is based on a very liquid market he added sofr has a robust market and it doesn t really change much during crisis situations jermann also pointed out that sofr does not have to provide risk insurance because loans based on it are collateralized by government debt sofr is crisis proof he said in a crisis government debt is the safe asset libor on the other hand is based on unsecured lending where you sort of trust it he added regulators have pointed to more fundamental reasons for preferring sofr as the reference rate sofr is a much more resilient rate than libor because of how it is produced and the depth and liquidity of the markets that underlie it the new york fed said in a note as an overnight secured rate sofr better reflects the way financial institutions fund themselves today libor s days are numbered for other reasons too banks do not need libor as much as they did in earlier times because they no longer need the short term borrowing it supported in earlier times banks borrowed from each other to fulfill regulatory requirements to maintain a minimum amount as reserves the monetary policy has changed and now banks have excess reserves jermann said they don t need to lend and borrow with each other in the inter bank market the federal reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios for banks to zero in march 2020 as the pandemic s first wave raged we don t necessarily need only one rate we could have multiple rates urban jermann multiple reference rates while libor is no longer an option jermann said sofr shouldn t be made the sole alternative for the financial markets while sofr is not optimal for bank lending it works pretty well if you want one single rate he said but we don t necessarily need only one rate we could have multiple rates for instance sofr could be used for most derivatives transactions or interest rate swaps but smaller bank loans could use alternatives like the bloomberg short term bank yield index bsby which offers libor like credit sensitivity regulators have been critical of bsby believing that it would share libor s lack of robustness the paper noted banks wanted to use bsby but regulators discouraged them said jermann other credit sensitive alternatives are ameribor a benchmark rate the american financial exchange has created or axi cross the curve credit spread index which has been designed as an add on to sofr by professors at stanford university and the australian national university under sofr small and midsized banks will be especially disadvantaged jermann said in a letter to the federal reserve and other regulators a group of 10 banks had asked for the ability to use alternatives to sofr we object to the use of sofr as the one alternative index they had said a one size fits all approach may not be the most appropriate senator pat toomey r pa expressed similar sentiments in a congressional testimony last year

trkb by taletrectinib may help significantly reduce trkb related cns adverse events some common adverse events that are frequently reported in other ros1 inhibitors such as vision disorders edema headache dizziness and musculoskeletal disorders were observed less frequently in taletrectinib professor caicun zhou primary investigator and chief oncologist at shanghai pulmonary hospital stated taletrectinib is a potential best in class next generation ros1 inhibitor that is a much needed new option to treat both ros1 tki naïve and pre treated nsclc patients the trust study showed high objective response rates in both the first line and second line settings in ros1 positive nsclc with excellent potency against crizotinib resistant mutations including g2032r solvent front mutation we re excited to see that taletrectinib has also demonstrated intracranial antitumor activity in patients with brain metastases dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent stated the updated orr and dcr data of taletrectinib demonstrated its potential superior benefits in terms of both efficacy and safety for chinese patients with ros1 positive nsclc we are encouraged by the results and will move towards further clinical development of taletrectinib to explore the potential of the next generation ros1 inhibitor and benefit more nsclc patients in the future dr bing yan chief medical officer and co founder of anheart stated taletrectinib reported better brain penetration and intracranial activity in reference to other ros1 inhibitors with a favorable safety profile we look forward to advancing taletrectinib as we believe it is a potential best in class next generation ros1 inhibitor for both ros1 tki naïve and pretreated nsclc patients who are in need for new therapeutic options that have antitumor activity against resistant mutations and brain metastases ros1 oncogenic fusions are observed in 1 2 nsclc patients as well as in cholangiocarcinoma glioblastoma ovarian gastric and colorectal cancers cns metastasis occurs in 20 30 ros1 tki naïve and in up to 50 of crizotinib pretreated ros1 positive nsclc patients resistance to first generation ros1 inhibitors often occurs with secondary mutations such as ros1 g2032r solvent front mutation for which no fda approved therapy is available taletrectinib is a next generation cns penetrant selective ros1 inhibitor in march

by donna clapp from the may june 2022 issue you may have heard it is currently an employees market in terms of hiring and that is absolutely an understatement with media calling the time period in which we live the great resignation with an unemployment rate of 3 6 for march 2022 we have lower unemployment than we did pre pandemic when it was at 4 4 in march of 2020 this nationwide workforce shortage has become top of mind in terms of both business concerns and economic development strategies it s all really supply and demand said dennis donovan founder of wadley donovan gutshall consulting corporate site selection consultants you ve got baby boomers leaving the workforce limited immigration and heavy competitive demand well guess what that d be the reason for labor shortages but then of course we need to look at the fact that as a country we have not done a good enough job career pathing for some of the technical fields either so particularly in manufacturing just finding workers at all is so difficult right now i think communities are going to have to have workforce development as one of their most important pillars right now and a goal really should be to have the number of workers in positions mirror the percentage of diversity in the adult population of that region in fact in many communities the labor shortage has turned economic development strategy upside down because bringing jobs to the community has always been the focus but now developing a skilled workforce has become even more of a focus than ever before without creating workforce development programs that help attract train and retain workers economic developers risk corporations choosing other locations for their expansion and relocation projects in the past traditional measures of economic development have focused on the number of jobs being created and the amount of capital investment being made said todd greene chair of the board for the international economic development council iedc and executive director of workrise at the urban institute but we ve found that over time just meeting those measures has been insufficient when we think about economic growth of the entire community further analysis reveals that not everyone has benefited from traditional economic development approaches and in some cases these communities have very low rates of economic mobility and high rates of income inequality we know that bringing along all members of the community is going to be a more successful strategy and should be the goal of economic development targeting opportunity corporate leaders and economic developers are giving even more attention to programs and initiatives that target diversity equity and inclusion than ever before giving vulnerable communities new opportunities to grow these new initiatives call for new types of partnerships and collaborations between federal state and local governments educational institutions from high schools to universities and community outreach organizations one such recent collaboration in south carolina has helped the state attract a number of large corporate entities from basf to bmw while the apprenticeship carolina program has been in place since 2007 a recent collaboration seeks to increase the diversity of participants in the apprenticeship programs some of the things that we ve been doing on our team is we formed partnerships with the three urban league chapters of the state said amy firestone ph d vice president division of apprenticeship carolina since 2021 we have been collaborative partners in helping identify businesses to talk to about creating apprenticeships with the focus on diversity we have also developed pre apprenticeship program with the urban league and that s also the first ever pre apprenticeship program that we ve ever had with a community based organization south carolina s apprenticeship and pre apprenticeship programs are an example of unique partnerships that are creating highly skilled workforce pipelines from high school through to high wage jobs they require a tremendous amount of collaboration for example a recent apprenticeship launch with basf in pendleton sc was a collaboration between basf apprenticeship carolina readysc and tri county technical college elba lizardi basf seneca site director said the program aims to meet future talent needs for a skilled and diverse technician workforce with an emphasis on attracting more females to these roles our company wants to grow in diversity and inclusion at this site and globally she said we met our goal for 22 24 female leadership two years before our 2021 goal in 2019 so we set a new goal of 30 female leadership by 2030 and this program helps us make progress on achieving that goal note that it is a technical college in this particular collaboration not a university according to the world economic forum while all jobs are getting more technical the emergence of clusters of professions for the future shows a shift in focus from degrees to skills major it and business services companies are approaching community colleges for a well trained hands on ready to work and often industry certified workforce and they only have an aas rather than a bas it is not the degree but the technical and personal workplace skills said linda head sr associate vice chancellor external employer relations at lone star college in texas the good news is this allows for a larger workforce that can represent the diversity of our populations and help close the employment and opportunity gaps that currently exist all of this calls for a focus on upskilling or reskilling workers into these new roles and there are numerous regions around the country who are focusing on just that corporations are focused there too according to consulting firm deloitte whose recent survey found that many corporations since 2020 have made public commitments to address societal disparity and injustice and to expand diversity equity and inclusion initiatives for their current and future workforce addressing workforce shortage the brookings institution a public policy organization focused on research and development has been doing numerous studies on what will work in terms of adapting to this hiring crisis one of the examples they point to is the way employindy in indianapolis has been collaborating with employers and nonprofit partners to set up data sharing agreements with the state so they can target local populations that were displaced during the pandemic employindy has been sending weekly texts to new unemployment applicants to ask them to speak to a career navigator to discover how their skills may transfer to jobs currently available much like apprenticeship carolina careerwise colorado has worked with employers and educators in seven targeted industries to create youth apprenticeships a model that is currently expanding to washington dc new york city and elkhart county in careerwise colorado also recently launched a program they call equity first which is an apprenticeship program designed specifically to help employers meet their diversity equity and inclusion goals by providing anti bias and inclusive leadership training and support to corporations it s a business imperative to focus on diversity and inclusion and the equity first program was another tool in our toolkit to help us continue to advance our dei efforts said chris mast the mountain states leader for health at mercer a global professional services firm and one of the first of colorado s equity first partners while these programs examples are all driven by public entities there are some areas where corporate leaders are driving the initiative for example the chicago apprenticeship network was founded by aon accenture and zurich north america and has expanded to include more than 40 companies in various industries in a collaboration that includes educational partners and nonprofit partners according to the reports brookings has done apprenticeship programs that involve several partners are the least expensive and most effective programs making public private partnerships key to success this kind of applied learning that involves both classroom learning and on the job learning is an apprenticeship model that works well for both experienced workers and even younger workers you know 40 years ago we had these vocational school programs and we built capacity and then we stopped building them says annelies goger phd fellow at the brookings institution since the 1980s the u s has scaled back vocational education which reduced the options available to students who prefer hands on learning or can t afford a four year college degree it also reduced options for employers who want a stable pipeline of workers for trades technology crafts and even clinical professions and now we re like well why don t we have people that know how to do these things that is a good question and the answer is that we need to put funding streams back into those areas and expand on them of course i also think we should be looking at apprenticeship programs similar to those they have in europe that tap into younger students and expose them to more career paths to consider and more ways to train to get into those fields north carolina has taken on just this kind of initiative with its north carolina triangle apprenticeship program this enterprise looks to develop engineering and technology talent in the research triangle area with a four year program that starts in the 11th grade broad based efforts to equity access to these kinds of work based learning opportunities that start in high school have proven to be successful in creating a long term worker pipeline but if they are to affect the racial disparities in education and employment outcomes in a positive way they must be combined with other community wide efforts no single institution or sector is responsible for racial disparities in education and employment outcomes rather they are community wide challenges involving a myriad of issues from food insecurity to lack of access to livable wages to trauma and gun violence all with roots in the history of race in america said claire fiddian green president and ceo of the richard m fairbanks foundation and co chair of indiana s business equity for indy s learning and talent opportunities taskforce what s clear is that the status quo is unacceptable and that we must drive change in a collaborative cross sector fashion
do you think more gun control will stop the mass shootings that have taken place in buffalo new york uvalde texas and tulsa oklahoma new jersey governor phil murphy thinks so and has taken to twitter senator edward durr disagrees and replies the two have been sparring through twitter and thursday night i tweeted a poll asking my listeners and social media following the simple question that i opened up with do you think more gun control laws will stop mass shootings personally like so many others have said if you make it harder for people to buy guns they re only going to resort to getting them illegally it s not like they can t heroin is illegal yet we have an addiction problem i believe addiction like the shootings is much more of a mental health problem city of angels founder and ceo kevin meara a guest of my new jersey 101 5 show weighed in i had said that probably 70 of our kids would make it through alcohol and even heroin by doing an aa program or treatment and 30 of our kids are dealing with a mental health issue that s causing them to self medicate and they re not getting the help for that in these treatment centers meara was underestimating according to debbie wentz of the new jersey association of mental health agencies who told him the number was more like 70 of the kids with a substance use disorder also have a mental illness source adobe stock source adobe stock loading so how can we solve the mental health problem both in new jersey as well as the united states first off we need to make it more readily available to all people regardless of income or insurance coverage we also need more mental health counselors they are so backed up right now and there s a reason for that when you see all that the country s going through we also need to remove the stigma attached to mental health i once ran a poll asking do you think the school shootings are more of a mental health problem or a gun control problem what do you think opinions expressed in the post above are those of new jersey 101 5 talk show host steve trevelise only follow him on twitter realstevetrev you can now listen to steve trevelise on demand discover more about new jersey s personalities and what makes the garden state interesting download the steve trevelise show wherever you get podcasts on our free app or listen right now click here to contact an editor about feedback or a correction for this story nasty nj town nicknames have you heard of them dennis judi asked their listeners for the nasty nicknames they ve heard their towns referred to how many have you heard which ones would you add

key points question compared with estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr equations that include black vs non black race or cystatin c do egfr equations without race or cystatin c alter estimates of racial differences in risk of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy and mortality findings in this retrospective individual level data analysis of 62 011 participants decreased egfr was related to higher risk for all equations and within both racial groups compared with alternative equations the creatinine based egfr equation without race attenuated racial differences in the risk of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy and mortality at normal egfr and showed no significant racial differences in the risk at reduced egfr meaning among egfr equations without race the equation including both creatinine and cystatin c but not the equation including creatinine without cystatin c demonstrated racial differences in the risk of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy and mortality abstract importance at a given estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr individuals who are black have higher rates of mortality and kidney failure with replacement therapy kfrt compared with those who are non black whether the recently adopted egfr equations without race preserve racial differences in risk of mortality and kfrt at a given egfr is unknown objective to assess whether egfr equations with and without race and cystatin c document racial differences in risk of kfrt and mortality in populations including black and non black participants design setting and participants retrospective individual level data analysis of 62 011 participants from 5 general population and 3 chronic kidney disease ckd us based cohorts with serum creatinine cystatin c and follow up for kfrt

including black and non black individuals the egfr equation without race that included creatinine and cystatin c but not the egfr equation without race that included creatinine without cystatin c demonstrated racial differences in the risk of kfrt and mortality throughout the range of egfr the egfrcr cys equation may be preferable to the egfrcr equation without race for assessing racial differences in the risk of kfrt and mortality associated with low egfr introduction studies that used chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration ckd epi equations with creatinine alone or with cystatin c and included a coefficient for race black or non black to account for higher mean serum creatinine concentrations in black vs non black individuals documented racial differences in the association of a low estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr with risk of kidney failure with replacement therapy kfrt and mortality 1 however the use of race in gfr estimation and other clinical algorithms has been challenged because race is a social and not a biologic construct and does not fully capture the diversity within vs between racial groups 2 a creatinine based egfr equation that does not incorporate race was developed by ckd epi in 20213 and recommended for implementation in clinical laboratories by the national kidney foundation american society of nephrology nkf asn task force on reassessing the inclusion of race in diagnosing kidney disease 4 this equation had small biases compared with directly measured gfr in black and non black individuals with a median of up to 4 ml min 1 73 m2 lower and higher values than measured gfr respectively as a result of eliminating race from egfr black individuals are estimated to have a 2 0 higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease ckd and non black individuals a 1 5 lower prevalence compared with older equations that included race whether these changes alter the association of decreased egfr values with higher rates of kfrt and mortality within and between racial groups is unknown this is important for assessing efforts to reduce the higher risk of kfrt in black compared with non black individuals and tailoring risk reduction strategies across the full spectrum of egfr this study examined whether gfr estimating equations based on different filtration markers creatinine vs cystatin c vs both and equations that included or excluded race altered risk estimates for kfrt and mortality for black compared with non black participants methods chronic kidney disease prognosis consortium this study was approved for use of deidentified data by the institutional review board at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health the need for informed consent was waived by the institutional review board the chronic kidney disease prognosis consortium ckd pc is a research group consisting of investigators representing cohorts from around the world the consortium has been described elsewhere 5 investigators shared data for the purpose of collaborative meta analyses to study prognosis in ckd this study focused on cohorts that included both black and non black individuals had available creatinine and cystatin c 11 065 participants were excluded due to missing cystatin c data and participated in analyses relating egfrcr and egfrcys to the outcomes of kfrt and mortality the study included 5 general population cohorts atherosclerosis risk in communities cardiovascular health study multi ethnic study of atherosclerosis national health and nutrition examination survey iii and reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke and 3 ckd cohorts african american study of kidney disease and hypertension modification of diet in renal disease and chronic renal insufficiency cohort 6 11 data were collected from 1988 to 2018 information on race was provided in the original cohort data and was self reported by participants in most cohorts using fixed categories eappendix 1 in supplement 1 egfr equations measurement of creatinine and cystatin c followed previously reported methods 12 15 values from each cohort were calibrated to the extent possible using the available information serum creatinine assays were calibrated to the roche enzymatic method roche hitachi p module instrument with roche creatinine plus assay hoffman la roche ltd traceable to national institute of standards and technology creatinine standard reference material 967 16 serum cystatin c assays were calibrated to the siemens dade behring nephelometer traceable to international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine working group for the standardization of serum cystatin c and the institute for reference materials and measurements certified reference materials 17 18 seven gfr estimating equations developed by the ckd epi collaboration and recommended or discussed by the 2012 kidney disease improving global outcomes kdigo guidelines or the 2021 nkf asn task force were analyzed 1 4 the primary focus was on 4 equations 2009 egfrcr 2021 egfrcr 2012 egfrcys and 2021 egfrcr cys including those which calculate egfr after removing race as vs asr and using cystatin c cr cys vs cr as recommended in 2021 because the race coefficient for egfrcr cys asr is small results are presented in etables 4 and 6 and efigure 1 in supplement 1 as are those for 2 additional equations that were not recommended by the nkf asn task force egfrcr and egfrcr cys the modifier non black nb in egfrcr asr nb and egfrcr cys asr nb denotes omitting the black race coefficient from the 2009 equations without refitting other coefficients 2 the abbreviations indicate the year of equation development 2009 12 2012 13 or 20213 the filtration markers used creatinine and or cystatin c and the demographic variables included age sex and or race consistent with previous studies 3 4 all of the equations evaluated were developed by ckd epi therefore the abbreviations do not include ckd epi as a prefix egfrcr asr was defined as the reference because it is the most widely used of these equations 12 13 etable 1 in supplement 1 summarizes the nomenclature variables recommended use and performance of egfr relative to measured gfr for each equation etable 2 in supplement 1 shows the formulas used for each equation 3 4 outcomes the primary outcomes were kfrt all cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality six cohorts had data on kfrt defined as start of kidney replacement therapy or death due to kidney disease other than acute kidney injury mortality and cause of death were available for each cohort cardiovascular mortality was defined as death due to myocardial infarction heart failure sudden cardiac death or stroke statistical analyses analyses were conducted retrospectively within each cohort and meta analyses were performed across cohorts using multivariable random effects models eappendix 1 2 in supplement 1 egfr distribution analyses density plots and prevalence estimates were limited to the general population cohorts and confidence intervals were estimated by bootstrap for the association of egfr with outcomes egfr from each equation was modeled as piece wise linear splines with knots at 60 ml min 1 73 m2 and 90 ml min 1 73 m2 analyses were performed within each cohort using cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age sex and interaction terms for egfr splines and race non black vs black egfr spline coefficients were then combined across cohorts using multivariate meta analysis and hazard ratios with 95 cis estimated for each 1 ml min 1 73 m2 of egfr from 15 to 120 for black and non black participants separately compared with a reference of 80 ml min 1 73 m2 in non black participants log log plots ie visual inspection confirmed validity of the proportional hazards assumption using egfr categories by different equations differences between black and non black individuals for a given equation and egfr level were expressed as hazard ratios and differences in estimated 5 year risk point estimates were displayed at egfr values of 60 ml min 1 73 m2 and 30 ml min 1 73 m2 because they define ckd stages difference in estimated 5 year risk was calculated by combining the meta analyzed hazard ratio with the 5 year risk for the reference point estimated from the regards cohort for analyses of kfrt death was a censoring event to examine consistency across cohorts relative hazard ratios were calculated as the ratio of the hazard ratios at specific values of egfr for each egfr equation compared with egfrcr asr within each cohort eappendix 1 2 in supplement 1 in exploratory analysis the predictive discrimination performance of each egfr equation with demographic variables was examined using 5 fold cross validation c statistics separately within each cohort c statistics were summarized across cohorts as the median and interquartile interval change in c statistics between different egfr equations within each cohort was estimated with the user written somersd command19 and then with meta analysis across cohorts the significance threshold of each hypothesis test was set at 2 sided p 05 because of the potential for type i error due to multiple comparisons findings of the analyses should be interpreted as exploratory all analyses were conducted using stata mp version 16 statacorp results study populations for these analyses the 5 population based cohorts included 18 073 black participants and 38 017 non black participants 2 asian 8 hispanic 89 non hispanic white and 1 other race and ethnicity and the 3 ckd cohorts included 2700 black participants and 3221 non black participants 15 hispanic 78 non hispanic white and 7 other race and ethnicity for a total of 62 011 participants the mean sd age was 63 12 years and 53 were women with no missing data for age sex or race table 1 etable 3 in supplement 1 prevalences of decreased egfr by race and their ratios across equations the prevalences of egfr less than 60 ml min 1 73 m2 ckd stage g3 in black vs non black individuals were 11 vs 12 for egfrcr asr 17 vs 18 for egfrcys as and 13 vs 11 for egfrcr cys as compared with 15 vs 9 among black vs non black individuals for egfrcr as table 2 figure 1 etable 4 in supplement 1 as a result the black relative to non black prevalence ratios of egfr less than 60 ml min 1 73 m2 were 0 98 95 ci 0 93 1 03 for egfrcr asr 0 95 95 ci 0 91 0 98 for egfrcys as 1 2 95 ci 1 2 1 3 for egfrcr cys as and 1 8 95 ci 1 7 1 8 for egfrcr as comparison of risk associations for kfrt a total of 3265 kfrt events occurred over a mean sd follow up of 12 5 years in black participants and 13 6 years in non black participants the 5 year estimated absolute risks of kfrt were 7 3 95 ci 6 9 7 7 in black and 3 9 95 ci 3 7 4 1 in non black participants overall for all equations in both black and non black populations the risk of kfrt was significantly greater at lower vs higher egfr figure 1 efigure 1 in supplement 1 age and sex adjusted risks of kfrt were significantly higher in black compared with non black participants for egfrcr asr egfrcys as and egfrcr cys as across all egfr levels figure 1 for example the age and sex adjusted hazard ratio of kfrt at an egfr of 60 ml min 1 73 m2 compared with the referent of non black persons at an egfr of 80 ml min 1 73 m2 was 9 3 95 ci 4 9 17 9 in black vs 3 3 95 ci 2 5 4

73 m2 compared with the reference of egfr of 80 ml min 1 73 m2 were 3 0 95 ci 1 5 5 8 and 2 8 95 ci 1 4 5 4 respectively 5 year risk differences of 1 1 and 1 3 in contrast racial differences in kfrt risk were smaller for egfrcr as at values of 60 ml min 1 73 m2 or lower figure 1 with the black relative to non black participant hazard ratio of kfrt at an egfr of 60 ml min 1 73 m2 no longer significantly different hazard ratio 1 3 5 year risk difference 0 37 results were similar at an egfr of 30 ml min 1 73 m2 with absence of statistically significant racial differences in risk of kfrt for egfrcr as in contrast to the other 3 equations table 2 efigure 2 in supplement 1 similar patterns of significantly higher estimated risk of kfrt in black relative to non black participants were observed for egfrcr cys asr and egfrcr cys asr nb whereas egfrcr asr nb was similar to egfrcr as which showed attenuation of racial differences in risk etable 4 in supplement 1 comparisons of equations applied within each cohort showed that compared with egfrcr asr egfrcys as and egfrcr cys as resulted in similar estimates 7 of the 8 relative hazard ratios were close to 1 0 with confidence intervals including 1 0 figure 2 etable 5 in supplement 1 in contrast the comparison of egfrcr as with egfrcr asr resulted in relative hazard ratios significantly less than 1 0 in all 4 cohorts with data indicating lower black relative to non black participant hazard ratio estimates with egfrcr as comparison of risk associations for all cause and cardiovascular mortality decreased egfr was associated with significantly higher age and sex adjusted risk for all cause and cardiovascular mortality for all equations table 3 efigure 1 in supplement 1 compared with non black participants mortality risk at an egfr of 60 ml min 1 73 m2 was significantly higher in black participants for nearly all estimates for egfrcr asr egfrcys as and egfrcr cys as for example egfrcys as showed black compared with non black participant hazard ratios of 1 2 95 ci 1 1 1 4 for all cause mortality and 1 4 95 ci 1 2 1 7 for cardiovascular mortality with 5 year risk differences of 1 0 95 ci 0 4 1 7 and 0 71 95 ci 0 38 1 03 respectively in contrast when the egfrcr as equation was used risks were not significantly different in black compared with non black participants with hazard ratios of 1 0 95 ci 0 9 1 1 for all cause mortality and 1 1 95 ci 0 9 1 3 for cardiovascular mortality with 5 year risk differences of 0 04 95 ci 0 49 to 0 42 and 0 08 95 ci 0 19 to 0 35 respectively table 3 etable 6 in supplement 1 within each cohort comparing equations for all cause and cardiovascular mortality showed that similar to kfrt egfrcr as resulted in a smaller estimate of the black to non black participant hazard ratio relative hazard ratios significantly 1 0 for 13 of 14 estimates in figure 2 in contrast egfrcys as and egfrcr cys as were similar to egfrcr asr 25 of 28 relative hazard ratios not significantly different from 1 0 comparison of risk discrimination across equations when included in a model with age and sex the 5 fold cross validated c statistics for kfrt had a median value of greater than 0 78 for all egfr equations within race groups compared with egfrcr asr equations that included cystatin c in addition to creatinine had significantly higher cross validated discrimination in race stratified analyses or overall in race adjusted analyses 0 013 to 0 018 increase in the c statistic all p values 03 etable 4 in supplement 1 similarly equations that included cystatin c in addition to creatinine had higher discrimination for mortality and cardiovascular mortality compared with egfrcr asr 0 008 to 0 013 increase in the c statistic all p values 05 except p 06 for egfrcr cys etable 6 in supplement 1 within race groups or overall when adjusting for race the discrimination of egfrcr asr egfrcr as and egfrcr asr nb were not significantly different 0 000 with confidence intervals of 0 001 discussion this retrospective analysis of black and non black adults participating in 8 us cohort studies showed that decreased egfr values calculated with the egfrcr as equation were significantly associated with higher kfrt risk within each race group however this equation attenuated racial differences in risk of kfrt and mortality at decreased egfr values compared with the egfrcr asr egfrcys as and egfrcr cys as equations the egfrcr cys as equation which provides a more accurate estimate of measured gfr than these other equations 3 was significantly associated with both kfrt and mortality risk in both black and non black participants and demonstrated a higher risk of these outcomes in black relative to non black individuals these data suggested that egfrcr cys as may be preferred for measuring the higher risk of kfrt and mortality among black individuals at both normal and moderately decreased egfr because this equation was an accurate estimate of measured gfr and also documented the higher risk of kfrt and mortality compared with alternative egfr equations valid measures of the racial differences in the risk of kfrt and mortality are important for tailoring intervention strategies and documenting progress toward racial equity in kidney health overall the findings of this study support the nkf asn task force on reassessing the inclusion of race in diagnosing kidney disease recommendations that the new 2021 ckd epi creatinine equation without race the egfrcr equation 3 4 be implemented in clinical laboratories because creatinine remains the dominant filtration marker for estimating gfr and this equation discriminates risk well within each racial group however data presented here showed that adding cystatin c to the egfr equation without race is necessary to estimate racial difference in risk and improve accuracy at the individual patient level black individuals have higher rates of incident kfrt and mortality than non black individuals 20 21 egfr has been used to detect stage and treat ckd and to examine disparities in ckd prevalence and risk for adverse outcomes 1 22 most of the us literature has used egfrcr equations that include a race coefficient predominantly the mdrd study and 2009 ckd epi egfrcr these equations showed a similar or slightly lower prevalence of moderately reduced egfr in black compared with non black individuals in contrast to the higher kfrt incidence in black than in non black adults 23 24 possible causes for the discrepancy in racial differences in prevalence of reduced egfr vs incidence of kfrt have been documented including faster decline in measured gfr more severe albuminuria and other risk factors for ckd progression underdiagnosis and undertreatment of ckd as well as adverse social determinants of health racial discrimination and structural racism disproportionately experienced by black compared with white individuals in the us 4 24 26 consistent with findings in nhanes 3 the current study showed that the egfrcr as equation resulted in a higher estimated prevalence of reduced egfr among black individuals and lower estimated prevalence in non black individuals as compared with egfrcr asr this is likely due to egfrcr as having an approximate 4 ml min 1 73 m2 systematic underestimation of measured gfr in black individuals and similar overestimation of measured gfr in non black individuals 3 the higher prevalence of decreased egfr among black individuals based on egfrcr as has the potential benefit of increasing awareness of ckd and promoting earlier interventions to reduce disease progression in black individuals but also the potential harm of overdiagnosis however the lower estimation of racial differences in kfrt and mortality risk by egfr as could have unintended consequences for research and public health policies such as reduced emphasis on understanding existing risk factors for racial disparities in kfrt and mortality risk the present analysis focused on egfr because egfr is routinely used in clinical practice to assess the presence and severity of kidney disease and to assess the risk of progression to kidney failure risk tools such as the kidney failure risk equation are increasingly used in clinical decision making and benefit from the incorporation of other risk factors in addition to egfr 27 the current study built on this work to show that including cystatin c in the egfr equation may improve the predictive capability of egfrcr the egfrcr cys as equation had significantly greater discrimination of kfrt relative to egfrcr asr and egfrcr as these findings support the nkf asn task force recommendations to increase cystatin c testing because it is less affected by muscle mass and race group than serum creatinine this recommendation is further supported by its recommendation for confirmation of ckd in the kdigo 2012 guidelines 28 cystatin c has been standardized since 2010 18 improves risk prediction compared with equations that include creatinine alone 6 29 and is now integrated into early ckd detection guidelines30 and ckd curricula 31 limitations this study has several limitations first the study lacked specific information on factors that may differ between racial groups such as measures of social determinants of health and therefore could not statistically adjust for all potential causes for observed racial differences second there may be unmeasured heterogeneity in methods of measurement across cohorts although the overall results were consistent across all cohorts third insufficient numbers of individuals from racial and ethnic groups other than black and white preclude comparing outcomes across other race and ethnic groups 32 fourth other outcomes of interest such as cardiovascular disease events and heart failure were not examined fifth physicians decisions to start kfrt may have been influenced by serum creatinine and egfrcr reporting or other factors whereas cystatin c is not widely available in clinical practice sixth data on measured gfr were not available in all cohorts seventh none of the models underwent external validation outside the cohorts in which they were developed eighth this study assessed discrimination but not calibration which is important in assessing how accurately an estimated probability of an outcome can be applied to an individual patient conclusions in this retrospective analysis of 8 us cohorts including black and non black individuals the egfr equation without race that included creatinine and cystatin c but not the egfr equation without race that included creatinine without cystatin c demonstrated racial differences in the risk of kfrt and mortality throughout the range of egfr the egfrcr cys equation may be preferable to the egfrcr equation without race for assessing racial differences in the risk of kfrt and mortality associated with low egfr back to top article information

beijing june 7 xinhua the united states has tasted the bitter fruit of hyperinflation which has stayed above 6 percent since the beginning of this year while attributable to the sharp rise in global energy food and commodity prices caused by the ukraine crisis the hyperinflation is essentially a result of the unreasonable and irresponsible policies of the united states itself such as massive bouts of quantitative easing trade war against china global supply chain disruptions as well as escalating the ukraine crisis and providing huge fiscal subsidies for the pandemic response at home when inflation became too high to bear the united states chose not to address its root cause but to switch to aggressive quantitative tightening the federal reserve has raised interest rates twice this year including a record hike of half a percentage point the first of that size since 2000 the federal reserve also announced that it would start to unwind the balance sheet in june all these measures have failed to curb inflation significantly and the u s price surge remains in a historically high range inflation does not stop at the water s edge as indicated by recent statistics hyperinflation in the united states is spilling over fast and southeast asia has taken the brunt where inflation rates of many countries have climbed to new highs the rate in laos reached 9 9 percent in april when indonesia witnessed a five year high singapore saw its inflation at a 10 year high of 5 4 percent in march coinciding with a 14 year cpi record a roughly 5 7 percent rise from the previous year in thailand after a 4 9 percent year on year cpi hike in april the philippines suffered the worst inflation since december 2018 judging by the current numbers the situation in other southeast asian countries may seem relatively better but experts have warned that malaysia cambodia and vietnam will see inflation hit new records in the near future the big family of southeast asia is sharing the woes according to focuseconomics an information service company the regional inflation rate rose from 3 percent in february to 3 5 percent in march southeast asian countries are mostly developing countries where food consumption accounts for a relatively large portion of overall national expenditure therefore in addition to increasing people s living costs high inflation may also lead to a higher risk of social unrest as pointed out by mohamed faiz nagutha an asean economist at bank of america securities the high inflation rates in southeast asian countries have naturally evoked unpleasant memories the asian financial crisis in 1997 following the interest rate upsurge and dollar appreciation in the united states took its toll on the economic growth of southeast asian countries foreign exchange and stock markets plummeted like dominoes indonesia and thailand suffered the most severe losses with their gdp shrinking by 83 4 percent and 40 percent respectively within two years in the 2008 global financial crisis ignited by the u s subprime mortgage crisis the financial systems of southeast asian countries were hit hard again the singapore strait index fell by more than 45 percent the indonesian stock market had to be frozen indefinitely after a continuous sharp decline more than 8 million overseas workers from the philippines faced the threat of job loss and income reduction and about 1 million workers in thailand lived on the edge of unemployment now the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes will again exert pressure on developing economies in multiple aspects first of all the rate hikes will further raise financing costs and trigger capital flight both impacting the economic fundamentals of developing countries and complicating their post covid economic recovery secondly the higher cost of the u s dollar may add a greater burden to debt ridden countries as underdeveloped nations tend to have a higher foreign debt ratio thirdly in the foreign exchange market the rising dollar index may create depreciation pressure on other currencies thus triggering further inflation in other countries u s hyperinflation is seriously affecting the faltering world economy developing countries need to brace themselves for its long term impact many of them including southeast asian countries have already felt the pinch of the surge in commodity prices compounded first by the pandemic and then by the u s interest rate hike and balance sheet reduction as the world s largest economy the united states must shoulder its responsibilities for world economic recovery rather than push up inflation in developing countries the author is a commentator on international affairs writing regularly for cgtn global times xinhua news agency etc he can be reached at xinping604 gmail com

it also comes at a time when the great resignation is seeing workers moving laterally to competitors for better pay and benefits or choosing entirely new career paths human resources experts and industry analysts were not surprised by musk s demand because his past behavior shows a willingness to impose his will regardless of the cost market research however shows that organizations that continue to impose their will on their employees and refuse to adapt their management approach will lose their top employees to companies that provide more independence a poaching opportunity in an environment where the stock prices of tech companies have fallen dramatically over the past few months many organizations are watching competitors with less flexible work policies and other benefits some of those companies are looking at this as an opportunity to recruit away talent said brian kropp distinguished vice president with gartner s hr practice look elon musk is a very smart guy there may be 20 or 25 of employees who end up leaving and maybe those are the ones he wants to leave but a good chunk of that 25 are in demand at other companies kropp added

acknowledging what s bothering you and recognizing what s within your own control and what isn t credit card debt an insufficient emergency fund or an unstable monthly budget for example are all parts of your individual financial life that you have the power to improve volatility in the stock market surging inflation or gender pay gaps however are major societal issues that americans can t prevent another way to alleviate stress is to accept the fact that there are always going to be surprises that may come up harris says advertisement article continues below this ad give yourself grace and acknowledge just how much you ve accomplished despite the odds being stacked against you then start by making small steps toward your goals even if it s finding an extra 50 that you can use to stash away each month or use to pay down a high interest bill it can all add up to make a major difference for your wallet over time what i recommend people do when they are dealing with financial anxiety in many ways aligns with wise mental health practices says stash s anastasio we can focus on what s in our control and by putting more of our energy in that it s a natural way to help curb anxiety 2

pay depends on other people there were all these things that i knew i was good at chase says i had to create my own way to make sure that those ends stay together and aren t moving further apart 4 think carefully about your insurance policies having a safety net to protect your most valuable assets can be a crucial way to alleviate stress when emergencies happen experts say one area not to cut back on is insurance advertisement article continues below this ad choosing the cheapest policy could reduce your monthly expenditures until something happens and you have to fight an insurance company to get your claim paid harris says that s not a good place to be be sure to shop around compare quotes and policies from different vendors and check third party ratings to make sure you re getting the best possible coverage 5 prioritize taking care of yourself self care is crucial when it comes to managing the stresses of money and for wise reasons it s hard to make rational decisions when you re feeling panicked advertisement article continues below this ad remember that taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of your wallet consider setting aside a few hours each week specifically to pay bills or to look over your finances then stop yourself from worrying about your money outside of that window anastasio recommends it could also include going for walks or spending time outside harris suggests even better both of those activities are free it s about doing things that help you to mentally release harris says because walking is something that you

board of directors that you can bounce ideas off of harris says you want to build a team money has long been a taboo topic only until recently has it been one workers themselves are starting to discuss and women may be feeling the burden of carrying the torch for the many generations before them who were either shut out from their family s finances or limited in their career prospects normalizing conversations about money can be a way to limit its negative impact simply because it will help you know that you re not alone i ve seen so many stories over time including my parents where a wife or partner is kept in the dark anatasio says now i feel like we ve put this immense amount of pressure on younger generations of women to not make the same mistake be independent be smarter and don t let this happen to you but being independent gives the sense that you have to go it alone feeling like you re not alone is so unbelievably important whatever your financial anxieties are countless people are going through the exact same thing advertisement article continues below this ad visit bankrate online at bankrate com
after a mass shooting in parkland florida in february 2018 that left 17 people dead jpmorgan chase america s largest bank publicly distanced itself from the firearm industry its chief financial officer reassured the media that the bank s relationships with gunmakers have come down significantly and are pretty limited that was then this past september a new texas law went into effect that bans state agencies from working with any firm that discriminates against companies or individuals in the gun industry the law requires banks and other professional service firms submit written affirmations to the texas attorney general that they comply with the law what was jpmorgan to do sticking with its high minded policy of significantly reducing business with gun manufacturers would result in exclusion from texas s lucrative bond market texas sold more than 58 billion of bonds in 2020 and is currently the second largest bond market after california i ll come back to california in a moment jpmorgan chase had been among the top bond underwriters for texas between 2015 and 2020 the bank underwrote 138 texas bond deals raising 19 billion for the state and generating nearly 80 million in fees for jpmorgan according to bloomberg yet since the new texas law went into effect in september the bank has been shut out of working for the state jpmorgan s dilemma since texas enacted its law has been particularly delicate because its chairman and ceo jamie dimon has been preaching the doctrine of corporate social responsibility repeatedly telling the media that big banks like jpmorgan chase have social duties to the communities they serve so what did jpmorgan decide to do about financing gun manufacturers in light of the new texas law it caved to texas never mind that last year the bank s board granted dimon a special 52 6 million award which is almost three quarters of the fees the bank received from underwriting texas bonds between 2015 and 2020 on may 13 one day before the buffalo mass shooting and less than two weeks before the texas shooting jpmorgan sent a letter to the attorney general of texas declaring that the bank s policy does not discriminate against or prevent it from doing business with any firearm entity or firearm trade association based solely on its status as a firearm entity or firearm trade association adding that these commercial relationships are important and valuable the texas law barring the state from doing business with any firm that discriminates against the gun industry is the first of its kind in the country but similar laws described by gun industry lobbyists as find laws or firearm industry nondiscriminatory legislation are now working their way through at least 10 statehouses according to the giffords law center to prevent gun violence this year wyoming passed a law that allows gun companies to sue banks and other firms that refuse to do business with them the lesson here is twofold first pay no attention to assertions by big banks or any other large corporations about their social responsibilities to their communities when social responsibility requires sacrificing profits it magically disappears even when it entails financing gunmakers but secondly no firm should be penalized by pro gun states like texas for trying to be socially responsible how to counter texas law lawmakers in progressive states like california whose bond market is even larger than texas should immediately enact legislation that bars the state from dealing with any firm that finances the gun industry in other words big banks like jpmorgan should have to choose either finance gunmakers and get access to the texas bond market or don t finance them and gain access to the even larger california bond market what do you think robert reich former u s secretary of labor is professor of public policy at the university of california at berkeley and the author of the system who rigged it how we fix it read more from robert reich at
this post is also available in portuguese spain thailand germany japan netherlands the word has gone out that every government can buy a lot more weapons with either no debate at all or with all debate shut down by a single word russia do a web search for weapons buying and you ll find story after story about u s residents solving their personal problems the way their government does but search for the secret code words defense spending and the headlines look like a united global community of nations each doing its important bit to enrich the merchants of death weapons companies don t mind their stocks are soaring u s weapons exports exceed those of the next five leading weapons dealing countries the top seven countries account for 84 of weapons exports second place in international weapons dealing held by russia for the previous seven years was taken over in 2021 by france the only overlap between significant weapons dealing and where wars are present is in ukraine and russia two countries impacted by a war widely recognized as outside the norm and meriting serious media coverage of the victims in most years no nations with wars present are weapons dealers some nations get wars others profit from wars in many cases when nations increase their military spending it s understood as fulfilling a commitment to the u s government the prime minister of japan for example has promised joe biden that japan will spend a lot more other times its a commitment to nato that s discussed by weapons buying governments in u s minds president trump was anti nato and president biden pro nato but both advanced the identical demand of nato members buy more weapons and both had success although neither has come anywhere close to boosting nato in the way that russia has but getting other countries even to double their military spending is pocket change the big bucks always come from the u s government itself which spends more than the next 10 countries combined 8 of those 10 being u s weapons customers pressured by the u s to spend more according to most u s media outlets nothing is happening other countries are boosting their so called defense spending but nothing whatsoever is happening in the united states although there was that little 40 billion gift of aid to ukraine recently but in weapons company advertisement space outlet politico another big boost in u s military spending is coming soon and the question of whether to increase or decrease the military budget has already been pre decided democrats will be forced to either back biden s blueprint or as they did last year ladle on billions more in military spending biden s blueprint is for yet another big increase at least in dollar figures the favorite topic of the news generated by weapons funded stink tanks and former pentagon employees and military media is inflation so let s take a look at u s military spending over the years available data goes back to 1949 adjusted for inflation and using 2020 dollars for every year in those terms the high point was reached when barack obama was in the white house but the budgets of recent years far exceed any other point in the past including the reagan years including the vietnam years and including the korea years returning to the pre endless war on terror spending level would mean about a 300 billion cut rather than the usual 30 billion increase returning to the level of that golden day of conservative righteousness 1950 would mean a reduction of about 600 billion the reasons to reduce military spending include the higher than ever risk of nuclear apocalypse the immense environmental damage done by weaponry the horrific human damage done by weaponry the economic drain the desperate need for global cooperation and spending on environment and health and welfare and the promises of the 2020 democratic party platform the reasons to increase military spending include lots of election campaigns are funded by weapons dealers so of course there s no debate a debate that cannot be had must simply be declared over before it begins media outlets universally agree the white house agrees the whole of congress agrees not a single caucus or congress member is organizing to vote no on military spending unless it s reduced even peace groups agree they almost universally call military spending defense despite not being paid a dime to do so and they re putting out joint statements opposing increases but refusing to even mention the possibility of decreases after all that s been placed outside the acceptable range of opinion the original article can be found here

tom krisher and matt o brien the associated press detroit ap elon musk is threatening to walk away from his 44 billion bid to buy twitter accusing the company of refusing to give him information about its spam bot and fake accounts lawyers for the tesla and spacex ceo made the threat in a letter to twitter dated monday that the company disclosed in a filing with the u s securities and exchange commission the lawyers wrote that musk has repeatedly asked for the information since may 9 about a month after his offer to buy the company so he could evaluate how many of the company s 229 million accounts are fake twitter ceo parag agrawal has said that twitter has consistently estimated that fewer than 5 of its accounts are spam but musk has disputed that contending in a may tweet without providing evidence that 20 or more are bogus shares of twitter inc slid 1 5 monday likely incensing twitter shareholders who filed a suit against musk late last month for deflating the price of the stock shares of twitter are down more than 20 in the last month twitter said in a statement monday that it has been cooperatively sharing information with musk in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and noted that the deal is in the best interest of all shareholders we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms it added musk agreed to buy twitter for 54 20 a share back in april a number of musk s actions since including a public spat with twitter s ceo about the fake accounts on twitter has led some experts to question whether the billionaire wants to use his loud complaints to negotiate a lower deal price or even walk away entirely musk s lawyers wrote in the letter that twitter has offered only to provide details about the company s testing methods but they contend that s tantamount to refusing mr musk s data requests and constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement that gives musk the right to scrap the deal if he chooses this is a clear material breach of twitter s obligations under the merger agreement and mr musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement the letter says musk wants underlying data to do his own verification of what he says are twitter s lax methodologies the twitter sale agreement allows musk to get out of the deal if there is a material adverse effect caused by the company it defines that as a change that negatively affects twitter s business or financial conditions twitter has said all along that it s proceeding with the deal although it hasn t scheduled a shareholder vote on it last month musk said that he unilaterally placed the deal on hold which experts said he can t do if he walks away he could be on the hook for a 1 billion breakup fee musk s latest maneuver shows how he is looking for a way out of the deal or something that will get leverage for a renegotiation of the price said brian quinn a law professor at boston college but quinn said it s unlikely to hold up in court since he already waived his ability to ask for more due diligence i doubt he would be allowed to walk away quinn said at some point the board of twitter will tire of this and file a suit asking a judge to force musk to stick to the deal twitter has disclosed its bot estimates to the u s securities and exchange commission for years while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low if twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates mr musk does not understand the company s reluctance to allow mr musk to independently evaluate those estimates the musk letter says adding that he agrees not to disclose or keep the data the bot problem is a longtime fixation for musk who has more than 96 million twitter followers and whose name and likeness are often mimicked by fake accounts promoting cryptocurrency scams musk appears to think such bots are also a problem for most other twitter users as well as advertisers who take out ads on the platform based on how many real people they expect to reach musk s lawyers are arguing that he is entitled to data about the core of twitter s business model so he can prepare the transition to his ownership citing a june 1 letter from twitter in which the company said it only has to give information related to closing the sale musk s team says the company is obligated to provide data for any reasonable business purpose needed to complete the deal musk s bot count skepticism was also taken up monday by the chief legal officer of texas where tesla is headquartered attorney general ken paxton a republican said he s launching an investigation because he has a duty to protect texans if twitter is misrepresenting how many accounts are fake to drive up their revenue matt o brien reported from providence rhode island
gasoline prices in connecticut continue to skyrocket with the average cost in the state surging to 4 89 per gallon up from 4 65 a week ago and 4 20 a month ago according to aaa the statewide surge is in line with national and global trends no one has been spared from pain at the pump including u s sen richard blumenthal who said during a press conference monday that he paid 4 83 per gallon in hartford that morning and 5 07 per gallon in a different part of the state over the weekend i m angry he said just as every driver in the state is blumenthal while standing across the street from a gas station in hartford noted gasoline prices have soared this year due to increased demand as the u s attempts to shake off the covid 19 pandemic as well as russia s invasion of ukraine which has upended global markets but blumenthal also cited oil companies price gouging as another reason for high gasoline prices the big oil companies are profiteering blumenthal said they are making record profits causing consumers unprecedented pain during the first quarter of this year according to blumenthal the five top oil companies chevron exxonmobil bp shell and conocophillips reported profits 300 higher or about 35 billion than the first quarter of last year those additional profits are solely out of consumers pockets blumenthal said noting that the alleged price gouging isn t the only cause for why consumers are paying record prices at the pump but a substantive reason blumenthal said he is proposing a big oil windfall profits tax so at least 50 of those profits reported by the five major oil companies revert back to consumers in the form of a rebate money back in consumers pockets out of the excess unconscionable profiteering of the big oil companies he said blumenthal noted that big oil companies aren t using their record profits to invest in new ways to produce more oil to lower the price at the pumps but instead are engaging in stock buyback programs and paying out dividends to shareholders or are paying massive bonuses to their executives the buybacks are benefiting shareholders but not consumers blumenthal said adding that in addition to stock buybacks and executive bonuses those companies are also cutting jobs those buybacks help the people who own the companies but not consumers consumers would see rebates of at least 300 if not higher with the big oil tax blumenthal said blumenthal also proposed a price gouging prevention act empowering the president to declare a national emergency and enable the federal trade commission to investigate and sue major oil and gas companies the measure would give the ftc the authority to investigate whether companies are taking advantage of an international crisis to boost profits blumenthal said if it were to find a company engaging in price gouging the ftc could impose civil penalties equal to the profits the company made as a result of the gouging blumenthal said the ftc could also impose criminal penalties of 500 million or 10 million as a civil penalty per month these kinds of penalties would be hard hitting and powerful blumenthal said finally blumenthal is calling for the suspension of the 18 4 cent per gallon federal gasoline tax to ease the burden on consumers in march gov ned lamont signed legislation suspending the state s 25 cent gasoline tax from april 1 to dec 1 consumers deserve relief and they deserve it now blumenthal said there are steps we can take i call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join in this effort it s unclear whether there is bipartisan support in the u s senate where democrats have the slimmest of majorities at 50 50 with vice president kamala harris as tiebreaker enforcement at least in terms of the price gouging measure could prove to be difficult the office of state attorney general william tong recently said it has received 227 complaints of price gouging accounting for about 20 of the state s 1 156 gas stations fifty of those complaints were dismissed with no action while 103 complaints resulted in an inquiry a conversation a visit from an investigator tong said no retailers have been cited for price gouging tong said nevertheless blumenthal called on his colleagues in the senate to act on his proposals they will work he said they will be practical and effective ways to provide some relief not all of the price increases will come down immediately but they will send a message to big oil companies should be producing more should be using their licenses and investing in supply not stock buybacks or dividends or executive pay another measure that can be taken according to blumenthal is for president joe biden while he s in saudi arabia to call on members of opec to increase oil production this article was corrected to reflect connecticut s gas tax suspension was extended from june 30 to dec 1

trkb by taletrectinib may help significantly reduce trkb related cns adverse events some common adverse events that are frequently reported in other ros1 inhibitors such as vision disorders edema headache dizziness and musculoskeletal disorders were observed less frequently in taletrectinib professor caicun zhou primary investigator and chief oncologist at shanghai pulmonary hospital stated taletrectinib is a potential best in class next generation ros1 inhibitor that is a much needed new option to treat both ros1 tki naïve and pre treated nsclc patients the trust study showed high objective response rates in both the first line and second line settings in ros1 positive nsclc with excellent potency against crizotinib resistant mutations including g2032r solvent front mutation we re excited to see that taletrectinib has also demonstrated intracranial antitumor activity in patients with brain metastases dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent stated the updated orr and dcr data of taletrectinib demonstrated its potential superior benefits in terms of both efficacy and safety for chinese patients with ros1 positive nsclc we are encouraged by the results and will move towards further clinical development of taletrectinib to explore the potential of the next generation ros1 inhibitor and benefit more nsclc patients in the future dr bing yan chief medical officer and co founder of anheart stated taletrectinib reported better brain penetration and intracranial activity in reference to other ros1 inhibitors with a favorable safety profile we look forward to advancing taletrectinib as we believe it is a potential best in class next generation ros1 inhibitor for both ros1 tki naïve and pretreated nsclc patients who are in need for new therapeutic options that have antitumor activity against resistant mutations and brain metastases ros1 oncogenic fusions are observed in 1 2 nsclc patients as well as in cholangiocarcinoma glioblastoma ovarian gastric and colorectal cancers cns metastasis occurs in 20 30 ros1 tki naïve and in up to 50 of crizotinib pretreated ros1 positive nsclc patients resistance to first generation ros1 inhibitors often occurs

despite five years of advance notice that connecticut towns would have to submit affordable housing plans by june 1 less than half of them made the deadline the deadline established by a 2017 law that requires such plans every five years marked an important date for affordable housing advocates in connecticut as of last thursday just 46 of the state s towns had submitted plans to the office of policy and management nineteen percent of the towns proactively notified the office that they wouldn t meet the deadline and provided an anticipated date the state office of policy and management plans to determine appropriate next steps for reminding the delinquent municipalities of their responsibility spokesman chris collibee said but there didn t seem to be much appetite for zoning reform during the recent legislative session either not a single bill aimed at solving the problems made it to the governor s desk and advocates are now planning their next steps much of the opposition to zoning reform bills was centered on arguments that statewide reform would dilute local control opponents argued that towns were already working on their own plans and that legislators should wait to see the results before passing laws to mandate reform so the legislative session closed with no major zoning reform in a state that lacks tens of thousands of housing units that are needed to meet the demand from its lowest income residents advocates legislators and analysts said zoning reform bills failed this session in part because of the short session opposition based in local control arguments and a lack of understanding of what zoning reform would mean for connecticut as legislators and advocates plan another push for land use reform education that attempts to address misconceptions around proposed bills existing laws and types of housing developments will be a focus as they prepare for the next legislative session legislators said they agree that the state needs more affordable housing the fact of the matter to this day is we do not have enough housing in the state of connecticut period said rep quentin williams d middletown co chair of the housing committee the bills the bills house bills 5429 and 5204 sought to tackle what experts have long said are restrictive local zoning laws these laws make it harder for developers to build multifamily housing particularly in many of connecticut s suburban towns desegregatect a group that pushed for transit oriented development is a program of the regional plan association transit oriented development is a land use concept that encourages development near public transit stations during the legislative session lawmakers considered a bill that would have required towns to allow denser housing at least 15 units per acre within a half mile of a passenger commuter rail or bus rapid transit station certain types of land such as wetlands and steep slopes would have been exempt the bill died in committee the other major piece of zoning reform legislation last session would have required the state s office of policy and management to assess the need for affordable housing regionally in connecticut then towns would share the responsibility to plan and zone for that need a town s share would have been determined by its wealth median income compared to nearby towns percentage of housing stock that s multifamily and the poverty rate that bill was voted out of committee but didn t get a vote on the house or senate floors in argument against both bills opponents said the reforms would have hindered local control and imposed one size fits all solutions on municipalities what happened zoning reform met resistance much of which stemmed from fairfield county said rep joe polletta a waterbury republican and ranking member of the housing committee there s not enough support on either side of the aisle to pass such a bill he said the folks that have been opposed to the bill want to keep local control of zoning and the bill has not given them that option said polletta opponents have cited local control and decried a one size fits all solution to the state s affordable housing problem rep stephanie thomas d norwalk said in a march interview that the transit oriented development bill doesn t work for all towns for example some areas already have single family homes built near train stations she said while she said she supports the idea of transit oriented development thomas said the bill didn t account for the needs of individual municipalities and isn t the way to introduce the concept to connecticut i just feel so strongly that we cannot vote on a concept thomas said we have to vote on the actual language i am a huge proponent of affordable housing i also am a huge proponent of transit oriented development i just don t think the language of the bill is what makes sense rep frank smith vice chair of the housing committee said he thinks housing prices need to be contained through methods other than zoning reform he said he supports bills such as one that passed during the session to establish more fair rent commissions in the state the commissions receive rent complaints conduct investigations and hold hearings among other actions i always felt when it comes to housing it s always better to err on the side of local decision making said smith d milford erin boggs executive director of open communities alliance said reform takes time her organization pushed for the fair share bill as a part of a coalition of groups called growing together connecticut fair share is a big and meaningful proposal she said it s transformative and things like this don t happen in one year or two years pete harrison director of desegregatect expressed a similar sentiment he added that it s often more difficult for major legislation to pass during a short session that effort spring boarded things harrison said of the last session i feel like it s a really similar trajectory for us that we laid a really good foundation next session the regional planning association may look at other land use policies to support such as adjusting minimum lot sizes said melissa kaplan macey connecticut director at the association next steps new federal priorities may incentivize change the biden administration s newly announced housing supply action plan includes incentives that tie federal grant dollars to certain zoning reforms which experts say may push connecticut lawmakers to pass such measures land use might appear to be controversial to some but it s clearly a priority on the national level kaplan macey said meanwhile advocates and legislators are starting efforts to prepare for the next session williams and other democratic legislators are organizing informational sessions in the coming weeks a tour of sorts during which legislators will visit different types of housing developments across the state he hopes this will clear up any confusion about what those developments look like in a community as well as combat misconceptions about the state s existing affordable housing laws i think right now we ve focused on perceived solutions without having shared values and i think we have to create that shared experience first and then move forward together williams said education will also be a focus of growing together connecticut the group also has a focus on finding ways to revitalize cities and will spend the summer gathering input from community members on solutions they think would work for their neighborhoods boggs said desegregatect will be fine tuning its legislative recommendations and pushing awareness of the policies kaplan macey said none of the major major priorities got through and that s a good opportunity for all of us to say let s hold the state s feet to the fire harrison said there s going to be a lot more pressure and a lot more work together on getting stuff through the next session
elon musk warned twitter inc on monday that he might walk away from his 44 billion deal to acquire the social media company if it fails to provide the data on spam and fake accounts that he seeks this was not the first time musk had suggested publicly his acquisition of twitter may not happen but the warning delivered in a letter from musk s lawyers to twitter s chief legal officer vijaya gadde marked an escalation it accused twitter of being in material breach of its deal obligations musk s threats to tear up the deal have coincided with a plunge in many technology stocks including the electric car maker that he leads tesla inc amid concerns over an economic slowdown and higher interest rates in the face of raging inflation twitter shares ended down 1 5 per cent at 39 57 on monday a large discount to the agreed 52 20 deal price as investors bet musk will either convince twitter to agree to a lower deal price or walk away in the letter to twitter musk s lawyers reiterated his request for details on bot accounts and said he reserved all rights to terminate the acquisition as the company was in a clear material breach of its obligations by not providing him with the information twitter responded that it planned to enforce the completion of the deal on the agreed terms twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement the company said in a statement a self proclaimed free speech absolutist musk has said one of his priorities will be to remove spam bots from the platform he tweeted that the twitter deal was temporarily on hold in mid may saying he will not move forward with the offer until the company showed proof that spam bots account for less than 5 per cent of its total users he has said he believes spam bots constitute at least 20 per cent of the user base independent researchers have projected that 9 per cent to 15 per cent of the millions of twitter profiles may be bots in his letter musk said he needs the data to conduct his own analysis of twitter users because he did not believe in the company s lax testing methodologies twitter has said it stands by its projections and it cannot provide proprietary information on how it produces them he is trying to walk away from the twitter deal this is the first shot across the bow wedbush analyst dan ives said legal experts have told reuters the disclaimers twitter used in its projections on spam accounts give it some protection against potential lawsuits be they from musk over the deal or shareholders over the accuracy of the company s regulatory statements even if twitter s estimate is off musk would have to show that the san francisco based company was seeking to willfully mislead a high legal threshold it s fairly obvious that musk has buyer s remorse and he is trying whatever to get a reduction in price and i think he may succeed said dennis dick a proprietary trader at bright trading llc clinching a lower price to be sure musk may be able to walk away or renegotiate the deal even if the law is on twitter s side this is because any litigation is likely to be protracted and twitter may decide it makes more sense to agree to a lower price or receive compensation from musk rather than try to force him to complete the transaction in court several companies renegotiated or walked away from agreed acquisitions when the covid 19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and delivered a global economic shock in one instance french retailer lvmh threatened to walk away from a deal with tiffany co the us jewellery retailer agreed to lower the acquisition price by 425 million to 15 8 billion as part of the deal musk is contractually obligated to pay a 1 billion breakup fee a sliver of his fortune pegged by forbes at 219 billion if he cannot complete the transaction because the debt financing falls apart or regulators block it us antitrust regulators last week decided not to further scrutinize musk s acquisition of twitter making it unlikely that it would stumble on regulatory grounds the european union is still reviewing the deal in texas attorney general ken paxton announced on monday that he had begun an investigation into twitter for what he said was potentially false reporting over its fake bot accounts a potential violation of state law paxton asked twitter to turn over documents as part of the probe if twitter is misrepresenting how many accounts are fake to drive up their revenue i have a duty to protect texans paxton said in a statement

you are here beijing june 7 xinhua the united states has tasted the bitter fruit of hyperinflation which has stayed above 6 percent since the beginning of this year while attributable to the sharp rise in global energy food and commodity prices caused by the ukraine crisis the hyperinflation is essentially a result of the unreasonable and irresponsible policies of the united states itself such as massive bouts of quantitative easing trade war against china global supply chain disruptions as well as escalating the ukraine crisis and providing huge fiscal subsidies for the pandemic response at home when inflation became too high to bear the united states chose not to address its root cause but to switch to aggressive quantitative tightening the federal reserve has raised interest rates twice this year including a record hike of half a percentage point the first of that size since 2000 the federal reserve also announced that it would start to unwind the balance sheet in june all these measures have failed to curb inflation significantly and the u s price surge remains in a historically high range inflation does not stop at the water s edge as indicated by recent statistics hyperinflation in the united states is spilling over fast and southeast asia has taken the brunt where inflation rates of many countries have climbed to new highs the rate in laos reached 9 9 percent in april when indonesia witnessed a five year high singapore saw its inflation at a 10 year high of 5 4 percent in march coinciding with a 14 year cpi record a roughly 5 7 percent rise from the previous year in thailand after a 4 9 percent year on year cpi hike in april the philippines suffered the worst inflation since december 2018 judging by the current numbers the situation in other southeast asian countries may seem relatively better but experts have warned that malaysia cambodia and vietnam will see inflation hit new records in the near future the big family of southeast asia is sharing the woes according to focuseconomics an information service company the regional inflation rate rose from 3 percent in february to 3 5 percent in march southeast asian countries are mostly developing countries where food consumption accounts for a relatively large portion of overall national expenditure therefore in addition to increasing people s living costs high inflation may also lead to a higher risk of social unrest as pointed out by mohamed faiz nagutha an asean economist at bank of america securities the high inflation rates in southeast asian countries have naturally evoked unpleasant memories the asian financial crisis in 1997 following the interest rate upsurge and dollar appreciation in the united states took its toll on the economic growth of southeast asian countries foreign exchange and stock markets plummeted like dominoes indonesia and thailand suffered the most severe losses with their gdp shrinking by 83 4 percent and 40 percent respectively within two years in the 2008 global financial crisis ignited by the u s subprime mortgage crisis the financial systems of southeast asian countries were hit hard again the singapore strait index fell by more than 45 percent the indonesian stock market had to be frozen indefinitely after a continuous sharp decline more than 8 million overseas workers from the philippines faced the threat of job loss and income reduction and about 1 million workers in thailand lived on the edge of unemployment now the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes will again exert pressure on developing economies in multiple aspects first of all the rate hikes will further raise financing costs and trigger capital flight both impacting the economic fundamentals of developing countries and complicating their post covid economic recovery secondly the higher cost of the u s dollar may add a greater burden to debt ridden countries as underdeveloped nations tend to have a higher foreign debt ratio thirdly in the foreign exchange market the rising dollar index may create depreciation pressure on other currencies thus triggering further inflation in other countries u s hyperinflation is seriously affecting the faltering world economy developing countries need to brace themselves for its long term impact many of them including southeast asian countries have already felt the pinch of the surge in commodity prices compounded first by the pandemic and then by the u s interest rate hike and balance sheet reduction as the world s largest economy the united states must shoulder its responsibilities for world economic recovery rather than push up inflation in developing countries enditem the author is a commentator on international affairs writing regularly for cgtn global times xinhua news agency etc he can be reached at xinping604 gmail com

bloomberg developing nations are suffering the biggest hit from this year s oil shock many are dependent on imported fuel and are being crushed by a combination of high international prices weak currencies and competition from rich nations whose economies are rebounding from the pandemic higher fuel bills are exacerbating inflation in countries that are already struggling with soaring food prices the combination is leading to unrest and protests from citizens which democratic governments know from experience is one of the surest ways to lose popularity and power sri lanka laos nigeria and argentina are among emerging economies in asia africa and latin america that have seen long queues at some filling stations in the past weeks because of fuel shortages many governments are faced with the dilemma of either cushioning the blow of higher prices by increasing subsidies or lowering taxes both of which hurt state finances or allowing fuel prices to increase and risking the anger of consumers and businesses that can t afford the extra cost emerging unrest we could see a lot of unrest as emerging economies are more sensitive to fuel prices said virendra chauhan singapore based head of asia pacific for consultancy energy aspects while historically most of these have relied on fuel subsidies to appease the populace because of a large and burgeoning import burden it may be difficult to maintain these subsidies the crisis is mainly the result of the twin forces of recovering demand after the pandemic and sanctions on russia over its invasion of ukraine which disrupted global flows of energy especially to europe global benchmark brent crude traded near 120 a barrel on monday some 70 higher than its average price in 2021 after saudi arabia signaled confidence in demand and goldman sachs group inc predicted tighter markets as china emerges from lockdowns among the emerging economies bearing the brunt of higher prices are sri lanka and pakistan mired in its biggest economic crisis sri lanka is seeking help from the international monetary fund china japan and india to pay for its fuel imports as domestic supplies run low airlines flying to the country have been told to carry enough jet fuel for the return trip or fill up elsewhere surging inflation and fuel prices have edged pakistan into a similar economic crisis seeking a bailout from the imf but the fund insisted that the government in islamabad raise fuel prices to secure an agreement meanwhile foreign banks have stopped offering trade credit for oil imports read inflation forces desperate leaders to try and soften the blow in southeast asia myanmar and laos also face shortages of gasoline and diesel according to local media reports in myanmar restricted access to dollars has left buyers unable to pay for imports in laos long queues formed at petrol stations last month as the country struggled to secure sufficient fuel from its existing suppliers in thailand and vietnam forcing the government to institute rationing africa has been especially hard hit with kenya senegal south africa and even oil producing nigeria all reporting fuel shortages airlines operating in some parts of the continent have had to either cancel flights or fill up with jet fuel elsewhere part of the problem is that demand is rebounding from the pandemic in developed nations especially with the start of the northern hemisphere s summer driving season new york area gasoline inventories dropped to the lowest since 2017 last month according to the energy information administration meanwhile europe has been buying huge stocks of jet fuel in expectation of a pent up travel boom this summer and diesel to replace russian supplies europe is a large demand sink and it s not going to be easy to replace said chauhan emerging markets are going find it difficult to compete hunger and blackouts are the start of an emerging economy crisis the jump in demand hasn t been matched by a ramp up in refining capacity during the pandemic when demand slumped operations at refineries in countries such as the philippines australia new zealand and singapore were reduced and inventories run down now refiners are racing to rebuild inventories the problem for many is where to find the crude oil with rich nations buying up supplies from traditional sources such as the middle east some developing nations are being tempted to go for discounted russian oil despite the concern about angering the us and europe which are trying to pressure russia with sanctions russian lure sri lanka is trying to restart its only refinery with russian oil as the government tries to crack down on a growing black market for fuel laos industry and commerce minister khampheng saysompheng also said purchasing cheap russian oil could be an option according to local news heavy discounts for russian barrels purely from a price standpoint are attractive to some of these markets said peter lee senior oil and gas analyst for fitch solutions last month a record volume of russian oil headed to india and china for some poorer nations the effects of higher oil prices feeds into a downward spiral where fuel import bills hurt the economy and weaken the currency making oil imports even more expensive read one tank of gas devours 33 of brazilians monthly minimum wage sri lanka s rupee has dropped nearly 44 this year against the us dollar while pakistan s rupee is down more than 11 the result is an increasingly frustrated electorate that tends to blame the government when prices of food and fuel soar to cushion the blow some governments are increasing subsidies or cutting fuel taxes often at the expense of state finances mexico s gasoline and diesel subsidies are costing the government more than double the extra profit the oil producer gets from higher crude prices according to estimates by bloomberg economics south africa is among those that temporarily reduced fuel taxes even so motorists in the country are contending with an almost 80 increase in fuel prices since 2020 s pandemic induced low indonesia which saw president suharto resign in 1998 after bloody protests over fuel prices and inflation announced last month it would increase state spending by around 27 billion this year partly to pay for a 56 jump in fuel subsidies former pakistan prime minister imran khan was ousted in april after reducing fuel prices and then freezing them for four months costing the government 600 million a month in subsidies and jeopardizing an imf bailout read hunger blackouts are the start of an emerging economy crisis high prices and shortages of fuel not only anger voters they feed into wider economic problems farmers that can t secure or afford enough diesel can t plant as many crops further boosting food shortages and inflation higher ship fuel prices raise logistics costs and governments that sacrifice income to keep fuel taxes low have less to spend on other areas of the economy or have to increase borrowing just as interest rates are rising what the world is realizing post pandemic is there is a need to secure your own energy supplies said chauhan at energy aspects it s amplified the impact on a transition from an internationally traded fossil fuel biased supply chain to a domestic green energy transition 2022 bloomberg l p

democrats are warming to including school security measures in a compromise gun bill viewing the concession as potentially key to clinching a deal with republicans sen chris murphy a connecticut democrat leading bipartisan talks on the topic said that nothing should be left off the table when looking at ways to prevent mass shootings i m willing to vote for some things that frankly make me uncomfortable if republicans will vote to tighten up the nation s firearms he said mr murphy said that included putting more money toward bolstering security at america s schools the gop proposals are still in the formative stages one proposal floated is to streamline the approval process for military veterans to serve as school safety officers the democrats openness to hardening school security marks a big shift president biden and democrats initially balked at the idea arguing that it would not prevent mass shootings such as the recent tragedy in uvalde texas that left 19 children and 2 adults dead hardening schools would have done nothing to prevent this shooting senate majority leader charles e schumer new york democrat said shortly after the incident in fact there were guards and police officers already at the school yesterday when the shooter showed up the shooter got past all of them with two assault weapons that he purchased mr schumer and other democrats have long claimed that the only solution to mass shootings is tougher gun control laws that rigid stance has faltered in recent days with the senate split 50 50 between the parties democrats need at least 10 republican votes for a gun bill to clear the 60 vote threshold for legislation to survive in the chamber at the moment there are not 10 senate republicans willing to back an ambitious gun control measure such as banning military style rifles or assault weapons we re talking about common sense targeted reforms that are responsive to the tragedies in uvalde and elsewhere said sen john cornyn a texas republican if our schools need more resources to harden their infrastructure evaluate their physical security measures and make necessary improvements that s something we can agree on and something we need to do mr murphy and mr cornyn are spearheading the gun talks the discussions have centered on incremental changes to the background check system for gun purchases and federal incentives for states to adopt red flag laws that allow authorities to confiscate firearms from people whom a court deems dangerous we re not talking about banning a category of weapons across the board a ban certain high capacity magazines or changing the background check system by adding additional disqualifying items said mr cornyn if we re actually serious about finding common ground and building consensus those sorts of things will stand no chance of passing the senate house democrats however are not looking for a bipartisan deal speaker nancy pelosi california democrat scheduled votes this week on a package of gun control measures that will be dead on arrival in the senate named the protecting our kids act the legislation would raise the minimum age required to purchase a semi automatic rifle from 18 to 21 restrict ammunition magazine capacity to no more than 10 bullets and require existing bump stocks to be registered while banning the sale of new ones for civilian use haris alic can be reached at halic washingtontimes com

lawyers for the tech billionaire said he s repeatedly asked to evaluate how many of twitter s 229 million accounts are fake detroit elon musk is threatening to walk away from his 44 billion bid to buy twitter accusing the company of refusing to give him information about its spam bot and fake accounts lawyers for the tesla and spacex ceo made the threat in a letter to twitter dated monday that the company disclosed in a filing with the u s securities and exchange commission the lawyers wrote that musk has repeatedly asked for the information since may 9 about a month after his offer to buy the company so he could evaluate how many of the company s 229 million accounts are fake twitter ceo parag agrawal has said that twitter has consistently estimated that fewer than 5 of its accounts are spam but musk has disputed that contending in a may tweet without providing evidence that 20 or more are bogus shares of twitter inc slid 1 5 monday likely incensing twitter shareholders who filed a suit against musk late last month for deflating the price of the stock shares of twitter are down more than 20 in the last month twitter said in a statement monday that it has been cooperatively sharing information with musk in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and noted that the deal is in the best interest of all shareholders we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms it added musk agreed to buy twitter for 54 20 a share back in april a number of musk s actions since including a public spat with twitter s ceo about the fake accounts on twitter has led some experts to question whether the billionaire wants to use his loud complaints to negotiate a lower deal price or even walk away entirely musk s lawyers wrote in the letter that twitter has offered only to provide details about the company s testing methods but they contend that s tantamount to refusing mr musk s data requests and constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement that gives musk the right to scrap the deal if he chooses this is a clear material breach of twitter s obligations under the merger agreement and mr musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement the letter says musk wants underlying data to do his own verification of what he says are twitter s lax methodologies the twitter sale agreement allows musk to get out of the deal if there is a material adverse effect caused by the company it defines that as a change that negatively affects twitter s business or financial conditions twitter has said all along that it s proceeding with the deal although it hasn t scheduled a shareholder vote on it last month musk said that he unilaterally placed the deal on hold which experts said he can t do if he walks away he could be on the hook for a 1 billion breakup fee musk s latest maneuver shows how he is looking for a way out of the deal or something that will get leverage for a renegotiation of the price said brian quinn a law professor at boston college but quinn said it s unlikely to hold up in court since he already waived his ability to ask for more due diligence i doubt he would be allowed to walk away quinn said at some point the board of twitter will tire of this and file a suit asking a judge to force musk to stick to the deal twitter has disclosed its bot estimates to the u s securities and exchange commission for years while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low if twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates mr musk does not understand the company s reluctance to allow mr musk to independently evaluate those estimates the musk letter says adding that he agrees not to disclose or keep the data the bot problem is a longtime fixation for musk who has more than 96 million twitter followers and whose name and likeness are often mimicked by fake accounts promoting cryptocurrency scams musk appears to think such bots are also a problem for most other twitter users as well as advertisers who take out ads on the platform based on how many real people they expect to reach musk s lawyers are arguing that he is entitled to data about the core of twitter s business model so he can prepare the transition to his ownership citing a june 1 letter from twitter in which the company said it only has to give information related to closing the sale musk s team says the company is obligated to provide data for any reasonable business purpose needed to complete the deal

long time share copy link copy russia s invasion of ukraine is a major reason that u s drivers are paying record prices for gasoline but it s not the only cause of the spike numerous factors are pushing prices up with regular gasoline hitting a record 4 87 a gallon monday according to aaa s survey up 25 cents a gallon in just the last week gas prices were already expected to breach the 4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008 with or without shots fired in eastern europe or economic sanctions imposed on russia but now the national average is expected to hit 5 a gallon within the next two weeks said tom kloza global head of energy analysis for the opis which tracks gas prices for aaa video above rossen reports save 40 cents per gallon with this free gas app i think we reach 5 somewhere between this weekend and juneteenth father s day weekend he said it was back in march that prices first broke the record of 4 11 a gallon which had stood since 2008 that now seems like the good old days the national average has been rising steadily for the past month setting 27 records in the last 28 days more than one out of every five gas stations nationwide is now charging more than 5 a gallon for regular and just more than half are charging 4 75 there are 10 states plus washington d c where the average price is already at 5 or more alaska arizona california hawaii indiana michigan illinois nevada oregon and washington several more are within a penny of 5 so those states prices are likely only a day or two at most from crossing the mark that s because there s a number of reasons besides the disruption of russian oil exports driving prices higher according to kloza and making predictions about where prices will go has proved difficult as school let out and summer travel picks up so will gasoline demand and price he said anything goes from june 20 to labor day kloza said we could certainly see the national average approach 6 here s what s behind the record price surge russia s invasion of ukrainerussia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet in december it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets 5 million of them as crude oil very little of that went to the united states in 2021 europe got 60 of the oil and 20 went to china but oil is priced on global commodity markets so the loss of russian oil affects prices around the globe no matter where it is used the concerns about disrupting global markets led western nations to initially exempt russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion but in march the united states announced a formal ban on all russian energy imports and last week the eu announced a ban on imports of russian oil by ship which represented about two thirds of the oil european nations imported from russia russia s oil is slowly and steadily being removed from global markets china lockdowns endingone factor keeping oil prices somewhat in check has been the surge of covid cases and strict lockdown rules in much of the country that was a major drag on demand for oil but as the covid 19 surge has started to retreat the lockdowns are being lifted in major cities such as shanghai and more demand without increased supply can only drive up prices less oil and gas from other sourcesoil prices plunged when pandemic related stay at home orders around the world crushed demand in the spring of 2020 and crude briefly traded at negative prices in response opec and its allies including russia agreed to slash production as a way to support prices and even when demand returned sooner than expected they kept production targets low u s oil companies don t adhere to those types of nationally mandated production targets but they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre pandemic levels amid concerns that tougher environmental rules could cut future demand many of those stricter rules have been scaled back or failed to become law the biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling not less robert mcnally president of consulting firm rapidan energy group said earlier this spring people are more worried about high oil prices than anything else it takes time to scale up production particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other u s businesses they can t find people and can t find equipment mcnally added it s not like they re available at a premium price they re just not available oil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years at least until the recent run up in prices oil company executives would rather find ways to boost their share price than increase production oil and gas companies do not want to drill more pavel molchanov an analyst at raymond james said earlier this spring they are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial drill baby drill which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago corporate strategy has fundamentally changed one of the starkest examples exxonmobil last month announced first quarter profits of 8 8 billion more than triple the level of a year ago when excluding special items it also announced a 30 billion share repurchase plan far more than the 21 billion to 24 billion it expects to spend on all capital investment including searching for new oil not only is oil production lagging behind pre pandemic levels but u s refining capacity is also falling today about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be processed into gasoline diesel jet fuel and other petroleum based products state and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels some companies are closing older refineries rather than investing what it would cost to retool to keep them operating especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in asia the middle east and africa in 2023 and the fact that diesel and jet fuel prices are up far more than gasoline prices shows that refiners are shifting more of their production to those products economics mandate you make more jet and diesel fuel to the detriment of gasoline said kloza and with prices in europe even higher than in the united states both canadian and u s oil producers have increased exports of oil and gasoline to the continent that has also limited the u s supply strong demand for gasbut supply is only part of the equation for prices demand is the other key and while it s very strong right now it s still not back to pre pandemic levels the u s economy had record job growth in 2021 and while those gains have slowed they remain historically strong demand is getting another boost as the many employees who have been working from home for much of the last two years return to the office the start of the summer travel season on memorial day weekend likely sparked the typical annual increases in demand for gas and jet fuel u s airlines all report very strong bookings for summer travel even with airfares climbing above pre pandemic levels the end of the omicron surge and the removal of many covid 19 restrictions are encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping entertainment and travel come hell or high gas prices people are going to take vacations said kloza commuting may remain down slightly many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week and the total number of jobs is still a bit below 2019 levels but there will be periods most likely this summer with higher demand for gas than during comparable periods before the pandemic kloza predicts even before ukraine i was expecting to break the record kloza said now it s a question of how much we break the record by

the ut austin chemistry lab s essential work has been used in various coronavirus vaccines and even in vaccines meant to combat respiratory syncytial virus austin texas since covid 19 first started taking the world by hostage in late 2019 scientists across the globe have been working nonstop to unlock the virus mysteries and to provide a blueprint for battling the contagious disease and some of the best work in the world on this front has been taking place inside a lab at the university of texas at austin i wanted to go into science and specifically this field to try to contribute to vaccine development to hopefully make or contribute to a vaccine that would one day be used said dr jason mclellan on this week s episode of y all itics yeah to have our technology incorporated into all these different vaccines it s more than five vaccines it s a career high it s really exciting dr mclellan holds the robert a welch chair in chemistry at ut austin where he also serves as a professor of molecular biology now the technology he and his team have developed is being used both in vaccines against rsv respiratory syncytial virus which is especially dangerous to children and seniors and in the leading vaccines against covid 19 if you thought the development of a covid 19 vaccine was fast dr mclellan says that because of the work they ve done they ll be able to do it much quicker in the future even through means like delivering vaccines through a patch the goals now are to try to go from genome sequence of a virus to manufactured vaccine in 100 days he said it s about three months rather than 10 so maybe in the future you have a coronavirus emerge in southeast asia you need a couple of months of masking and social distancing and then everybody can get the vaccine that s tailored specifically for that virus even though he works with some dangerous material inside his lab dr mclellan told the jasons that s not even what truly scares him what keeps me up at night mostly is the anti vax and the misinformation campaign he said that s actually most scary and deleterious to human health if we had a similar sentiment and vaccine skepticism 50 years ago we might not have eradicated smallpox or polio so it s really unnerving interestingly enough dr mclellan actually put in a grant to the national institutes of health in 2017 in an effort to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine think about that for a second that would have been three years before the pandemic even started but mclellan now smiles when talking about how the effort was doomed that did not receive very good scores he said and the reviewer comments you know indicated that this work was not particularly impactful coronavirus outbreaks are regionally contained to where they first emerged so that was fun mclellan even tweeted a screen shot of that rejection no surprise then it since has become one his most liked tweets
