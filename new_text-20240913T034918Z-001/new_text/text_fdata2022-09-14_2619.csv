tuesday biden s press secretary karine jean pierre confirmed that the white house is scrambling to formalize agreements with shippers truckers and air freight workers to avoid a nationwide shut down the biden administration is scrambling to establish a clear contingency plan in the face of a looming mass railroad workers strike press secretary karine jean pierre confirmed on tuesday during the white house press briefing jean pierre said the administration is asking truckers and air shippers to assist should rail service cease and also is considering invoking emergency authorities jean pierre added that the administration is hosting daily interagency meetings to assess which supply chains and commodities are at highest risk she said we are working with other modes of transportation including shippers truckers and air freight to see how they can step in and keep goods moving in case of this rail shutdown jean pierre continued the administration has also been working with relevant agencies to assess what supply chains and commodities are most likely to face severe disruptions the white house has told railroads and unions that a shutdown is unacceptable and will hurt american workers families and businesses and they must take action to avert it a white house official told reuters speaking on condition of anonymity one key issue is ensuring continued distribution of vital hazardous materials that depend on rail transport such as chlorine for water treatment plants this official added in the face of the looming rail strike karine jean pierre told the media we are working with other modes of transportation including shippers truckers and air freight to see how they can step in and keep goods moving in case of this rail shutdown on tuesday jean pierre told the media we have made crystal clear to the interested parties the harm that american families businesses farmers and communities would experience if they were not to reach a resolution she went on we encourage folks to stick at the negotiation table to come up with a resolution this is important because of what this could mean to the american people what this could mean to american families railroads on monday stopped accepting shipments for hazardous materials such as chlorine and chemicals used in fertilizer so they are not stranded in unsafe locations if rail traffic stops the u s energy sector relies on railroads to move coal crude oil ethanol and other products the potential shutdown which could come as early as friday could freeze almost 30 of u s cargo shipments stoke inflation impede supplies of food and fuel cost the u s economy about 2 billion per day and cause transportation woes the u s energy sector relies on railroads to move coal crude oil ethanol and other products starting tuesday amtrak began suspending service on three cross country routes out of chicago going to san francisco the pacific northwest and los angeles respectively amtrak said in a statement monday evening service will also be disrupted for a route along a portion of one of those routes the company said between los angeles and san antonio calling the changes initial adjustments made in preparation for a possible freight rail service interruption later the week the move from the passenger rail comes as many of america s railroads have already stopped accepting shipments of hazardous and other security sensitive materials due to the looming threat of a strike friday the cancellations are intended to avoid potential disruptions should tens of thousands of freight railroad workers walk out while the lengthy trips are underway the two railroad unions involved in the prospective strike currently in talks with railroad carriers are demanding more quality of life provisions be put into a contract for the coming year covering attendance policies vacation and sick days a deadline by the unions has been set for friday for the carriers to meet their demand or they will strike amtrak workers were not among those in those contract negotiations however nearly all of the passenger service s routes outside the northeast run on tracks owned by freight railroads meaning that a walkout could disrupt passenger service compounding the crisis are burgeoning protests from tens of thousands of workers at america s ports and hospitals as they strike over low pay and staffing shortages amid a period of rampant post pandemic inflation these adjustments are necessary to ensure trains can reach their terminals prior to freight railroad service interruption if a resolution in negotiations is not reached amtrak officials said in their statement the passenger railroad said that it is pulling trains on the three long distance routes to avoid possible passenger disruptions in case of the walkouts which could see more than 60 000 railway staffers bring the nation s rail infrastructure to a standstill amtrak says a strike would significantly impact the more than 21 000 route miles it operates outside the northeast the affects however would likely be more minimal in the northeast the company says with a small number of its northeast regional departures would see service interruptions if a strike were to transpire amtrak owns and maintain about 700 miles of track chiefly in the northeast with the lion s share of the rest of its nearly 22 000 mile system being operated on tracks owned and maintained by freight railroads manned by many of the striking workers the passenger rail s preemptive maneuver echoes those of several america s most notable freight railroads in recent weeks such as union pacific who have already stopped accepting shipments of hazardous and other security sensitive materials in anticipation of the looming threat friday pacific one of several major national railroads whose operations would be halted by the potential pause said the move is meant to protect employees customers and the communities we serve a statement from the railroad s trade group said they were taking the unprecedented to ensure that no such cargo is left on an unattended or unsecured train during the potential unrest in accordance with federal guidelines amtrak is canceling trips on several of its routes in preparation for a unprecedented strike by 60 000 railroad workers a dispute that could lead to the first railroad strike in decades and likely hamper the country s already entangled supply chain top white house officials have been closely watching the freight rail labor negotiation knowing that a strike of such magnitude would create significant economic and political risk for the already embattled biden administration picture is a then campaigning joe biden on an amtrak train in ohio in september of 2020 however the unions representing the members of the train crews set to strike have argued that the railroad s new freight restrictions are designed to put pressure on congress to intervene in the crisis and forcibly stop the unions from walking out they slammed the move as completely unnecessary and no more than corporate extortion the railroads are using shippers consumers and the supply chain of our nation as pawns in an effort to get our unions to cave into their contract demands said the unions statement our unions will not cave into these scare tactics and congress must not cave into what can only be described as corporate terrorism top white house officials have been closely watching the freight rail labor negotiation due to the face that a strike of such magnitude would create significant economic and political risk for the already embattled biden administration officials however have so far failed to quell the emerging crisis despite efforts that has grown increasingly frantic as the friday deadline looms so far 10 of 12 of the nation s railroad unions representing some 115 000 workers have reached tentative deals with the railroads that will see them earn 24 percent raises over five years 5 000 in bonuses and one extra vacation day a year that deal though did not satisfy the two holdouts the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen and the smart transportation division the two groups the largest of the 12 represent more than half of all railroad union workers they are demanding the railroads to go beyond those aforementioned recommendations and soften strict attendance policies that they say make it difficult to take any time off and address increasing workloads after the railroads cut nearly a third of their workforces over the past two and a half years any disruption would further hamper a passenger rail and transportation industry already weakened by 2 1 2 years of the pandemic which has hit both commuter and freight rail lines especially hard the biden administration meanwhile is scrambling to head off the freight rail strikes which would further choke supply chains and trigger what the us chamber of commerce warned would be an economic disaster as the deadline rapidly approaches labor secretary marty walsh has nixed all travel plans to address the brewing crisis with the white house holding a steady stream of crisis meetings unions and railroads have until friday to agree contracts for the tens of thousands of workers or risk triggering widespread strikes and employer lockouts joe biden meanwhile is keeping a keen eye on the progress which recently hit a standstill with the two union groups despite several meetings led by the white house national economic council also on the edge are the country s more than 22 000 west coast port workers who man the highly trafficked twin twin hubs of los angeles and long beach they are also seeking better working conditions amid staffing issues and overwork that

will be joined by 15 000 nurses and 22 000 west coast port workers plotting mass walkouts as they seek better working conditions several us freight railroads said they were preparing for widespread strike and service interruptions friday a deadline set by two holdout labor groups in protracted talks with railroad carriers about better benefits the burgeoning strike would cause mass interruptions to the nation s expansive rail system which are used to ferry goods shipped and flown in overseas across the country and would costs carriers roughly 2 billion a day the holdout from workers that transport these products who on average earn at least 64 300 a year already disrupted the nation s passenger rail monday rattling commutes and cross country travel for thousands of americans in preparation for the walkouts compounding the crisis are burgeoning protests from tens of thousands of workers at america s hospitals as more than 15 000 nurses in minnesota staged statewide walkouts over low pay and staffing shortages registered nurses in the state currently make an average of 84 030 each year also on the edge are the country s more than 22 000 west coast port workers who man the highly trafficked twin hubs of los angeles and long beach they are also seeking better working conditions amid staffing issues and overwork that has become commonplace during the pandemic despite la workers earning six figure salaries biden administration officials are racing to prevent the strike by tens of thousands of freight railroad workers that could further disrupt an already strained supply chain and cause billions of dollars in economic damage the stakes for the rail system meanwhile are high economically while another blow to the already backed up ports spelling trouble for the country s supply chain which has yet to recover from backlogs sustained during the pandemic the widespread chaos could spark food shortages cause a spike in gas prices as supply dwindles and potentially ignite further inflation the rail cancellations are intended to avoid potential disruptions should tens of thousands of freight railroad workers walk out while the lengthy trips are underway as the protests threaten the country s already struggling economy and supply chain rail unions are threatening to strike if a pay deal is not reached by friday in action that could cost as much as 2 billion a day in lost earnings to the u s economy president joe biden seen here during a visit to boston s logan international airport on monday has been kept abreast of talks as a friday deadline looms the labor department announced that walsh had postponed travel to ireland so that he could remain involved in talks the parties continue to negotiate and last night secretary walsh again engaged to push the parties to reach a resolution that averts any shutdown of our rail system a labor department spokesperson said all parties need to stay at the table bargain in good faith to resolve outstanding issues and come to an agreement the scramble demonstrated the stakes involved as the country continues to build back from the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain shocks biden has already set up an emergency mediation board to head off a crisis that critics say has been years in the making minnesota nurses meanwhile began a three day strike on monday in protest of pay and staffing shortages in the largest private sector nurses strike in u s history supported by squad member ilhan omar who represents minnesota in congress and the democrat governor of minnesota tim waltz 15 000 nurses angered by conditions and pay went on strike overwhelmed by the passion and commitment of these nurses tweeted omar i ll stand with you mnnurses as long as it takes to get you the treatment you deserve waltz added nurses have put their lives on the line to care for minnesotans throughout this pandemic they deserve to be safe on the job and get paid fairly minnesota s nurses are seen on monday going on strike the first day in a three day stoppage over pay and staff shortages congresswoman ilhan omar who represents minnesota backed the strike saying on social media she supported the nurses fighting to get you the treatment you deserve supported by squad member ilhan omar who represents minnesota in congress and the democrat governor of minnesota tim waltz 15 000 nurses angered by conditions and pay went on strike minnesota s problem is particularly acute the washington post reported because of its aging population placing additional stress on the wards coupled with a low unemployment rate with less incentive for people to join the demanding and underpaid profession the average registered nurse in minnesota earns 84 030 a year or an hourly salary of 40 40 making the state the 13th ranked in the nation according to nurse journal in california registered nurses earn 124 000 southern and midwestern states pay the least with alabama nurses on 61 000 contracts expired in may and june and the union has been in negotiations with the hospitals and health authorities since march with workers saying they have been forced to work shifts short of up to ten additional employees despite the mass walkouts paul omodt a spokesman for the twin cities hospital group which represents four hospital systems where nurses are striking in the minneapolis st paul area has remained steadfast in not giving into the thousands of nurses demands nurses have steadfastly refused to go to mediation omodt said earlier this week their choice is to strike this strike is on the nurses conny bergerson a spokeswoman for allina health another hospital system in the twin cities where nurses are on strike said rushing to a strike before exhausting all options such as engaging a neutral federal mediator does not benefit our employees patients or the communities we serve the strike is set to continue for the next two days it is unclear how the protesters processions will continue if their demands are not met by wednesday the nurses 15 000 strong procession monday was touted on social media with a series of images showing nurses picketing a solution in that span however seems unlikely with the 22 000 strong minnesota nurses association saying that hospital administrators have continued to refuse solutions on understaffing and safety in contract negotiations brass for the nursing union added that members have increasingly been asked to take on more patients for bedside care to make up for labor shortages exacerbating burnout and high turnover the minnesota nurses association has proposed a 30 percent pay increase over the next three years arguing that inflation is at a 40 year high the national inflation rate currently sits at 8 3 percent falling from a high of 9 1 percent earlier in the year health care groups meanwhile have proposed a pay increase of 10 to 12 percent a proposal that was promptly denied by the protesters kelley anaas 37 a nurse who works in the icu at abbott northwestern in minneapolis told the paper that the staffing shortage weighed on her mind every day and her workload has increased steadily in the 14 years she has worked at the hospital she said nurses in her team were trying to see two patients at once and lead nurses were being appointed with less than one year of experience it eats away at you she said if that was my family member in that bed i wouldn t want to leave their side representatives of minnesota s private hospitals accused the unions of not doing enough to seek a solution omodt has insisted that the nurse s demands are unreasonable and financially infeasible the union s wage demands remain at 29 and 30 percent increases over three years which we ve told them is unrealistic and unaffordable the hospital group spokesman said earlier this month minnesota is far from the only state facing strike action in oregon 7 000 health care workers have also authorized a work stoppage while a strike among university of wisconsin nurses was narrowly averted this week in hawaii and california mental health care professionals are currently on strike amid protest at inadequate staffing in response to minnesota s strike hospitals bussed in replacement nurses to care for emergency patients and cancelled non essential appointments nurses picket outside north memorial hospital in robbinsdale on monday the first day of a planned three day protest meanwhile port workers on the west coast have also been clamoring for a new more lucrative contract after their last one expired in june since may 10 labor contract negotiations have been ongoing between the international longshore and warehouse union ilwu which represents roughly 22 000 west coast dock workers at some of the nations most trafficked ports of call including those in la long beach and oakland and about 70 employers represented by the pacific maritime association pma the previous agreement between the organizations expired in july with both sides indicating multiple times that they were not preparing for a strike or lockout and that operations would continue as normal during the negotiations however those talks have since soured as the western ports have seen unprecedented traffic during it peak summer season with july and august typically the busiest months for imports as retailers stock up on back to school and holiday goods workers have since argued that this increase in imports combined with previously mentioned railroad transportation disruptions and a diminished staff have resulted in significant bottlenecks at the ports and considerably longer container dwell times a phenomenon that surfaced during the pandemic and has since persisted the twin hubs of los angeles and long beach alone handle about 42 percent of all u s containerized trade with east asia the main exporter of goods to north america however this peak in activity arrived earlier in 2022 than anticipated as companies placed orders preemptively to account for potential transportation delays president biden met with the ilwu and pma in june and has since continued to observe negotiations which are currently at a standstill if they fail the president could be forced to enact the taft hartley act a cold war era law that allows the government to call for an 80 day cool down period amid

most people didn t know bump stocks existed until the las vegas shooting gun folks did of course but many of us just thought of them as novelties a tool you could use to facilitate something you could just as easily do with a rubber band or a belt loop advertisement unfortunately las vegas did happen and in the aftermath we ended up with a ban on the stocks now a gun rights activist is asking a federal court to overturn those rules a gun rights activist will urge a federal appeals court on tuesday to block a trump administration rule banning bump stocks gun accessories that allow semi automatic guns to fire many times in rapid succession michael cargill is asking the full 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans to reverse a decision by a panel of three of its judges upholding the ban which took effect march 2019 the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf which passed the ban and a lawyer for cargill did not immediately respond to requests for comment cargill argues that atf lacked the authority to reinterpret the statute he said that even if it did have the authority its interpretation would be wrong because a shooter using a bump must simultaneously push forward on a gun s barrel and pull back on its trigger in order to fire rapidly rather than simply holding the trigger the government has maintained that the agency is entitled to deference in interpreting federal law under the supreme court s landmark 1984 ruling in chevron usa inc v natural resources defense council inc unfortunately there was an opportunity this year to overturn chevron but the court didn t and that s a shame this would have made this case a slam dunk especially after bruen however following bruen it may still be enough of a challenge though i wouldn t hold my breath advertisement the truth is that under current law while there s no reason these should have been categorized as machine guns the atf has the ability to change the rules arbitrarily and that s an issue unfortunately it s unlikely the supreme court will decide now to overturn that authority the appeals court in question most definitely won t do any such thing since they have to use precedents set down by scotus still i want to be wrong about this the truth is that we re having more issues with criminals having full auto capable weapons now than when the rules on bump stocks were implemented while bump stocks were mostly just novelties full auto switches are popping up all over the place despite having been illegal all along clearly the bump stock ban is really making us all safer right of course bump stocks weren t an issue before las vegas and they likely wouldn t have been afterward either at least they wouldn t have been if not for the constant pontification of know nothing activists who blathered on endlessly about them in the media anyway so again i hope i m wrong and we see this get overturned it needs to be overturned i m just not sure it will be

a federal appeals court was told tuesday that there is no basis in federal law for a trump administration ban on bump stocks devices that enable shooters to fire multiple rounds from a semiautomatic weapon with a single trigger pull the ban was instituted after a sniper using bump stock equipped weapons massacred dozens in las vegas in 2017 gun rights advocates are challenging it in multiple federal courts at issue is not the 2nd amendment but whether bump stocks qualify as illegal machine guns under federal law the rule banning the devices issued by the u s bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives said that they do a reversal attorneys said of a position held prior to the las vegas killings advertisement opponents of the ban say the atf s rule doesn t comply with federal law and that it would take an act of congress to ban bump stocks nationally so far the ban now being defended by the biden administration has survived challenges at the cincinnati based 6th u s circuit court of appeals and the denver based 10th circuit decisions on whether the supreme court will hear appeals in those cases are pending it has also survived a challenge at the federal circuit court in washington a panel of three judges at the 5th circuit in new orleans also issued a ruling in favor of the ban but the full new orleans based court currently with 16 active members opted to hear new arguments it s unclear how quickly the full court will issue a ruling some judges raised the possibility in questions that they could await supreme court action in the other cases according to the atf bump stocks harness the recoil energy of a semiautomatic firearm so that a trigger resets and continues firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter the shooter must maintain constant forward pressure on the weapon with the non shooting hand and constant pressure on the trigger with the trigger finger according to tuesday s arguments but opponents of the atf rule argue that the trigger itself functions multiple times when a bump stock is used so therefore bump stock weapons do not qualify as machine guns under federal law they site language in the law that defines a machine gun as one that fires multiple times with a single function of the trigger the trigger is going to function multiple times richard samp arguing for a texas gun owner told the judges advertisement u s department of justice lawyer mark stern said the key is the action of the shooter you only have to do one thing stern told the judges your trigger finger isn t doing anything other than sitting still
peiter mudge zatko the twitter whistleblower and former security exec there who surfaced three weeks ago to tell the world that all is not well within twitter s security systems curiously amidst elon musk s legal battle over his aborted takeover bid had his day testifying before congress on tuesday there was nothing absolutely revelatory about zatko s testimony today before the senate judiciary committee at least in terms of his claims which he already made three weeks ago that he felt the company remained overly vulnerable to foreign operatives and bad actors infiltrating its backend as cnn reports zatko claimed in testimony to have tried to alert a twitter executive that he was fairly certain a foreign operative was now a twitter employee at a foreign office but the executive brushed it off allegedly saying well since we already have one what is the problem if we have more let s keep growing the office we already know that in recent years the fbi was on to two men one of them a foreign national and one of them a u s citizen who were doing the bidding of the saudi government from within twitter and the u s citizen was convicted last month but that case went back to 2014 and 2015 and zatko s employment at twitter only began last year so the parade of foreign operatives infiltrating twitter may be ongoing zatko previously claimed in media interviews that twitter executives don t understand where user data on the platform which includes ip addresses and the locations from which users tweet goes when it gets deleted or if it gets deleted at all and per cnn zatko testified today that twitter collects and retains all kinds of data that it doesn t properly keep track of and that executives don t seem to have a clue what data exists where it is or how it s stored zatko also made a remark that was surely designed to alarm the senators in the chamber saying it s not far fetched to say a twitter employee could take over the accounts of all of the senators in this room it should be obvious by now that anything senator josh hawley is super concerned about is not necessarily anything we should all be concerned about as he is an opportunist republican who did this and did this on january 6th but it was hawley today who called zatko s testimony really significant hawley said he was most concerned with twitter s alleged placating of the russian and chinese governments in their data requests u s sen josh hawley r mo questions peiter mudge zatko former head of security at twitter during senate judiciary committee on data security at twitter on capitol

photo by kevin dietsch getty images twitter responded to zatko s testimony saying today s hearing only confirms that mr zatko s allegations are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies a company spokesperson further told cnn that internal company data is managed through measures such as background checks access controls and monitoring systems and that all hiring is done independent of any foreign influence meanwhile ronan farrow published a piece in the new yorker today alleging that secret clients have hired some sort of investigative firm to dig up dirt on zatko via paid interviews with former colleagues of his this consultant is apparently seeking information on zatko s personality professionally and socially his strengths and weaknesses motives for his whistle blower complaint and any similar past complaints his need for attention a source told farrow twitter denied having any role in contracting with these consultants and the firms say that such research is just being done to guide stock trades for the clients zatko issued a statement to the new yorker saying my family and i are disturbed by what appears to be a campaign to approach our friends and former colleagues under apparently false pretenses with offers of money in exchange for information about us these tactics should be beneath whoever is behind them meanwhile twitter s shareholders voted tuesday to approve elon musk s takeover bid valued at 44 billion even though he is either trying to back out of it or trying to drive the price down via the delaware chancery court where the case is being heard by a judge on october 17 and even though it could damage his case to be doing so elon musk couldn t help himself today anyone know who the secret clients are let s out them on twitter rn haha

increased investor interest in 2022 was somewhat unexpected given that current law closed the door on the 15 and 10 basis step up available for oz investments made by december 31st of 2019 and 2021 respectively in light of this continued interest businesses and investors looking to avail themselves of the potential tax benefits afforded by oz investments in 2022 as well as current oz investors should be aware of several emerging considerations resulting from newly proposed bipartisan legislation s 4065 and its identical companion h r 7467 were introduced by senators cory booker d nj and tim scott r sc and representatives ron kind d wi and mike kelly r pa respectively in april 2022 as the opportunity zones improvement transparency and extension act the act as alluded to by the title of the act among other things this bipartisan act would improve the policy behind the existing opportunity zone statutes by allowing for fund of fund structures i e one qualified opportunity fund investing in another qualified opportunity fund increasing reporting requirements extending the deferral period by two years from 2026 to 2028 and modifying certain census tracts designated as qualified opportunity zones qoz enhanced reporting requirements a common complaint among regulators transparency advocates and social impact investors alike is the lack of reporting requirements imposed on current oz investments while robust reporting requirements were initially included in the draft legislation introducing the oz tax incentives in 2017 those requirements were removed from the final legislative language as enacted by the tax cuts and jobs act tcja the act provides for increased reporting by oz investors and qofs requiring both qualitative and quantitative information about the underlying oz investment to be reported to the irs for instance information about the number of jobs created by a particular oz investment would need to be reported as would the timing of investments the amount of investments the nature of the investment by requiring qofs to report all naics codes applicable to the underlying business and in the case of residential rental property the number of residential units the act gives teeth to these reporting requirements by imposing a penalty of 500 per day for each day the requisite reports have not been filed subject to caps on the amount of the penalty depending on the gross asset value of the qof in order to serve as a check on whether oz investments are serving their intended purposes the treasury department would be required to annually publish a report using the data reported to the irs and to issue a comprehensive report the 6th and 11th year since implementation under the tcja this is not the first time there have been legislative proposals to enhance reporting and accordingly investors looking to utilize the tax incentives through oz investment should be aware of the likelihood they will be subject to increased reporting and stricter scrutiny than the current requirements although improving policy concerns such increased reporting will likely lessen the appetite for some tax motivated investors taking aggressive tax positions within oz investment structures extend oz investment to 2028 currently investors with existing investments in qofs must recognize their initially deferred gain at the end of the 2026 as well as complete oz investment partly due to the two year delay in finalizing the regulations implementing the requirements for oz investment the act would provide an additional two years of tax deferral opportunity by requiring the gain to be recognized at the end of 2028 rather than 2026 one notable issue with the act as currently drafted is that it does not include extension of the election period for making an oz investment which under existing law must be made by the end of 2026 it is unclear if this omission was intentional and if not would likely be a technical correction if the act is adopted if such an extension is added investors would have an additional two years to make oz investments and have an additional two years before taxes are due on the invested capital gain revive the basis step up originally an oz investment would receive a 10 step up in basis if the investment in the qof had been held for 5 years as of the end of 2026 and an additional 5 for a total 15 if the investment had been held for 7 years as of the end of 2026 these benefits expired at the end 2021 if enacted the act would revive the 5 basis step up by reducing the holding period requirement to 6 years rather than 7 years when coupled with the extension of the act to 2028 an oz investment made by the end of 2023 would be eligible for the 10 basis step up since it would be able to meet the 5 year holding period requirement as of the end of 2028 and an oz investment made by the end of 2022 would be eligible for the 5 basis step up for a total basis step up of 15 since it would be able to meet the 6 year holding period requirement as of the end of 2028 in our view an increased deferral period investment timeline and revival of the basis step up would certainly lead to additional investment in qualified opportunity zones modification of qoz tracts likely in response to negative publicity surrounding some aspects of oz investment and the use of 10 year old census data the act would also remove certain higher income census tracts where the median family mfi income exceeds 130 of the national mfi subject to limited exceptions notably the act requires the use of 2020 census data in disqualifying tracts and therefore census tracts that qualified under the current law which used 2010 census data may be disqualified using 2020 data the act also provides a process for governors to appeal the removal of a particular high income qoz tract for existing investments the act provides grandfathering rules that permit existing oz investments in a disqualified qoz to continue to qualify under certain circumstances if implemented existing oz investment in the disqualified tracts will need to be particularly mindful of the requirements for pre existing businesses and be prepared for treasury to write new anti abuse rules to prevent speculative investment from qualifying as a grandfathered pre existing business these changes will likely quell many concerns about high income qozs that were not within the original intent of the qoz policy and achieve the goal of bringing capital investment in underserved communities funds to fund investment currently qofs are not allowed to invest in other qofs the act would permit feeder fund qofs under certain circumstances this revision is drafted to presumably lead to increased investment in disadvantaged areas since the legal and compliance costs associated with forming and structuring a qof and a qualified opportunity zone business qozb can sometimes be cost prohibitive for smaller projects by allowing one qof to invest in another qof project specific start up costs could be lessened and larger qofs would ostensibly be able to make more investments across more projects for instance if the capital stack of a project is 95 complete and a qof becomes interested in investing at the 11th hour under current law re structuring the deal to facilitate that qof s investment could sometimes be cost prohibitive in light of the 5 gap in the capital stack by allowing a qof to invest in a qof already in the deal those re structuring costs could be avoided increasing the social impact of the oz program as long as other market based qof investment constraints can be satisfied taken together the act will achieve certain policy objectives while expanding the ability for oz investment in several positive ways largely at the cost of increased reporting and information disclosure noll is a shareholder in the san antonio tx office of chamberlain hrdlicka she represents clients in a broad range of federal and multi state tax planning and tax controversy matters she is a co chair of chamberlain hrdlicka s qualified opportunity zones practice structuring transactions and advising clients on tax incentives to

with offices in new york pennsylvania california and georgia as detailed below the lawsuit focuses on whether the company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and or misleading statements and or failing to disclose that 1 medtronic s product quality control systems were inadequate 2 medtronic had failed to comply with numerous regulations regarding risk assessment corrective and preventive action complaint handling device recalls and reporting of adverse events 3 these failures increased the risk of regulatory investigation and action 4 as a result of the company s misconduct the fda would delay the approval of additional medtronic minimed devices including the minimed 780g 5 these delays in product approvals as well as the company s need to improve its quality control systems would negatively affect medtronic s financial performance and cause it to fall further behind its competitors and 6 as a result of the foregoing defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis medtronic is a medical device company among its products is the minimed insulin pump system for the treatment of diabetes the systems include the minimed 600 series models and the minimed 780g model medtronic is currently seeking regulatory approval for the minimed 780g model which uses an advanced hybrid closed loop system during the class period medtronic repeatedly assured investors that the minimed 780g model was on track for approval by the u s food and drug administration fda and would provide medtronic with the edge it needed to close a growing gap with its competitors in the diabetes market medtronic made these representations despite known issues with the minimed 600 series models indeed in november 2019 the company issued a warning that certain minimed 600 series insulin pumps might have damaged pump retainer rings which could cause the system to release too much insulin and instructed customers with damaged rings to contact the company for replacements on february 7 2020 the fda classified medtronic s november 2019 notification as a class i recall the most serious type of recall problems with the minimed 600 series mushroomed in october 2021 when the company expanded its recall to all minimed model 630g and 670g insulin pump systems whether or not any retainer ring damage was actually visible despite these serious issues with the 600 series medtronic assured investors that they expected the minimed 780g to drive growth consistent with these optimistic statements medtronic again assured investors that fda approval of the minimed 780g was imminent investors began to learn the truth about the company s minimed operations on december 15 2021 when medtronic revealed that it had received a warning letter from the fda regarding its northridge california facility the warning letter the warning letter followed an fda inspection relating to the company s minimed 600 series recall and focused on the inadequacy of specific medical device quality system requirements in the areas of risk assessment corrective and preventive action complaint handling device recalls and reporting of adverse events as a result of the warning letter including the resulting uncertainty about fda approval of the minimed 780g and other products in medtronic s diabetes operating unit the diabetes group medtronic lowered its guidance for its diabetes group now projecting that diabetes group product revenues would decline in the mid single digit range for fiscal year 2022 on this news the price of medtronic common stock declined 6 75 per share or approximately 6 from a close of 111 69 per share on december 14 2021 to close at 104 94 per share on december 15 2021 the financial fallout from the fda s findings continued to surface on may 26 2022 when medtronic reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 and provided guidance for fiscal year 2023 notably medtronic disclosed that as a result of the company s need to improve its quality control system and its expectation that the minimed 780g model which defendants had repeatedly identified as crucial to future growth would not be approved in 2023 the company expected revenues from its diabetes group to decline between 6 and 7 in fiscal year 2023 on this news the price of medtronic common stock

gaap measures kelly loyd interim president and chief executive officer commented fiscal 2022 was an exceptional year for evolution on the strength of two completed accretive acquisitions and disciplined capital management we enter fiscal 2023 with a much larger and diversified asset base a balance sheet that remains very conservative with minimal net debt and a strategic plan which continues to focus on maximizing total shareholder returns we are pleased to report that we were able to make these accomplishments without any dilution or material increase in corporate overhead during fiscal 2022 and the current quarter there were substantial increases in production revenue net income and adjusted ebitda we maintained our commitment to rapidly reduce the debt we incurred with recent acquisitions by paying down our credit facility by 16 million during the quarter and anticipate fully retiring remaining debt within the next few months fiscal 2022 was highlighted by the continued outstanding execution by our dedicated workforce and the payment of almost 12 million in cash dividends to our shareholders we will continue to support our shareholders through this focused initiative with an increased quarterly dividend as well as our newly announced share repurchase program mr loyd concluded we have a positive outlook for fiscal 2023 supported by our diverse portfolio of oil and natural gas properties located in key onshore regions of the united states our decision to diversify our product mix into natural gas was timely as natural gas prices have risen dramatically since those acquisitions and natural gas revenues grew to 44 of our fiscal fourth quarter revenue our two most recent and immediately accretive and strategic transactions are symbolic of how we look to grow our business over the long term importantly these transactions also expanded our geographic footprint and generated significant new cash flow while expanding our optionality for reinvesting cash flow to maintain and grow our asset base we remain committed to profitably growing evolution with an unwavering focus on creating and distributing value to our shareholders cash dividend on common stock on september 12 2022 the board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0 12 per share of common stock which will be paid on september 30 2022 to common stockholders of record on september 21 2022 this will be the 36th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on the common stock which has been paid since the quarter ended december 31 2013 to date the company has paid over 86 million or 2 61 per share back to stockholders in common stock dividends maintaining and ultimately growing the common stock dividend remains a company priority share repurchase program on september 8 2022 the board of directors authorized a share repurchase of up to 25 million of its common stock through december 31 2024 the company intends to fund repurchases from working capital and cash provided by operating activities as the company continues to focus on its goal of maximizing total shareholder return the board of directors along with the management team believe that a share repurchase program is complimentary to the existing dividend policy and is a tax efficient means to further improve shareholder return particularly during periods of higher commodity prices when production acquisitions can be less attractive the shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions through privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws the timing as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including management s assessment of the intrinsic value of the company s shares the market price of the company s common stock general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements the value of shares authorized for repurchase by the company s board of directors does not require the company to repurchase such shares or guarantee that such shares will be repurchased and the program may be suspended modified or discontinued at

the increase in oil production from 1 811 bopd in the prior quarter was the closing of the jonah field acquisition on april 1 2022 partially offsetting the overall increase was natural decline in the delhi field as well as extended downtime at evolution s williston basin properties in april 2022 due to severe winter weather net natural gas production increased 67 from 15 878 mcfpd in the prior quarter due to the jonah field acquisition ngl production increased from 1 121 boepd in the prior quarter due to the jonah field acquisition the overall increase was partially offset by extended downtime at delhi s ngl plant in april 2022 due to turbine issues evolution reported 42 0 million of total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 which was a 64 increase from the prior quarter oil revenue grew to 18 4 million from the prior quarter due to a 6 increase in sales volumes and a 17 increase in realized commodity price natural gas revenue increased three fold to 18 5 million from the prior quarter primarily due to the jonah field acquisition and an 80 increase in realized commodity pricing ngl revenue increased to 5 2 million due to the jonah field acquisition which was partially offset by decreased volumes at delhi due to downtime at the ngl plant in april 2022 the average realized price per boe increased 21 to 61 98 per boe compared to 51 17 per boe in the prior quarter this increase was primarily due to an increase in realized crude oil and natural prices lease operating costs increased to 17 3 million from 12 1 million in the prior quarter primarily contributing to the increase was the jonah field acquisition and increased charges in the barnett shale for water hauling chemicals repairs maintenance and production taxes depletion depreciation and amortization dd a expense increased to 3 6 million from 1 7 million for the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in the depletion rate and increase in production on a per boe basis the company s

current quarter was 14 9 million or 0 44 per diluted share compared to 5 7 million or 0 17 per diluted share in the prior quarter the overall increase in net income was substantially attributable to the jonah field acquisition and higher revenues attributable to increased commodity prices adjusted net income excluding selected items see non gaap information section later in this release for a

information section later in this release for more information including reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures total revenues increased 233 to 108 9 million from 32 7 million in fiscal year 2021 the increase was primarily due to a 145 increase in average daily equivalent production from 2 430 net boepd to 5 953 net boepd due the acquisitions of the jonah field williston basin and barnett shale properties the average realized price excluding the impact of derivative contracts per barrel of oil equivalent increased 36 to 50 13 per boe from 36 87 per boe in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a 79 increase in realized crude oil prices to 85 11 per barrel from 47 59 per barrel in fiscal year 2021 lease operating costs increased to 48 7 million from 16 6 million in fiscal 2021 primarily driving the increase were the acquisitions of the jonah field williston basin and barnett shale properties also contributing to the increase was co 2 costs at delhi that were 4 6 million higher due to a 68 increase in purchased co 2 volumes combined with a 51 increase in co 2 costs per mcf which was driven by a 79 increase in the average realized oil price the increase in purchased co 2 volumes was associated with higher nominations and less downtime of the co 2 purchase pipeline under the company s contract with the delhi field operator purchased co 2 is priced at 1 of the realized oil price in the field per mcf plus sales taxes and transportation costs as per contract terms dd a expense increased 56 to 8 1 million from 5 2 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to an increase in production depletion expense was 3 46 per boe versus 5 53 per boe in the prior fiscal year the integration of the properties in the jonah field williston basin and barnett shale together with the ceiling test impairments during the fiscal year 2021 contributed to the overall lower depletion rate per boe for fiscal year 2022 general and administrative expenses were flat at 6 8 million for both fiscal years with the 1 1 million collective increase in costs associated with additional personnel severance payments professional fees for accounting services and business development offset by a reduction in non cash stock based compensation related to the forfeiture of unvested shares in connection with severance net income was 32 6 million or 0 96 per

decrease from 112 5 mboe in the prior quarter contributing to the sequential decrease was a reduction of 36 in ngl production primarily due to extended downtime at the ngl plant in april 2022 related

an independent commission is recommending that the confederate memorial at arlington national cemetery be dismantled and taken down as part of its final report to congress on the renaming of military bases and assets that commemorate the confederacy panel members on tuesday rolled out the final list of ships base roads buildings and other items that they said should be renamed but unlike the commission s recommendations earlier this year laying out new names for nine army bases there were no suggested names for the roughly 1 100 assets across the military that bear confederate names retired army brig gen ty seidule the vice chair of the commission said the final cost for all of its renaming recommendations will be 62 450 030 the total for the latest changes announced tuesday is 40 957 729 and is included in that amount the latest group of assets includes everything from the arlington memorial two navy ships and some army vessels to street signs water towers athletic fields hospital doors and even decals on recycling bins according to the panel the bulk of the remaining costs or 21 041 301 would cover the renaming of nine army bases and about 450 000 for recommended new names at the u s military at west point in new york seidule said the panel determined that the memorial at arlington was problematic from top to bottom he said the panel recommended that it be entirely removed with only the granite base remaining the statue unveiled in 1914 features a bronze woman crowned with olive leaves standing on a 32 foot pedestal and was designed to represent the american south according to arlington the woman holds a laurel wreath a plow stock and a pruning hook with a biblical inscription at her feet that says they have beat their swords into plough shares and their spears into pruning hooks the pedestal features 14 shields engraved with the coats of arms of the 13 confederate states and maryland which didn t secede or join the confederacy some of the figures also on the statue include a slave woman depicted as mammy holding what is said to be the child of a white officer and an enslaved man following his owner to war and the latin inscription translates to the victorious cause was pleasing to the gods but the lost cause to cato and was meant to equate the south s secession to a noble lost cause seidule said the panel decided early on to propose new names only for the nine army bases it said that the navy secretary has the authority to rename the two ships which are the uss chancellorsville and usns maury the chancellorsville was named for the civil war battle and the maury was named after a confederate soldier he said the service secretaries can find new names for the handful of army ships and the air force s fort fisher recreation area in north carolina the panel recommended that the defense secretary rename fort belvoir virginia the panel s most sweeping recommendations were released in may and laid out new names for nine u s army bases that commemorated confederate officers fort bragg in north carolina fort benning and fort gordon in georgia fort a p hill fort lee and fort pickett in virginia fort hood in texas fort polk in louisiana and fort rucker in alabama the recommendations are the latest step in a broader effort by the military to confront racial injustice most recently in the aftermath of the may 2020 police killing of george floyd in minneapolis for years u s military officials had defended the naming of bases after confederate officers as recently as 2015 the army argued that the names did not honor the rebel cause but were a gesture of reconciliation with the south but in the aftermath of the floyd killing and the months of racial unrest that followed the pentagon and congress pushed for a comprehensive plan to rename the military posts and hundreds of other federal assets such as roads buildings memorials signs and landmarks that honored rebel leaders the secretary of defense is expected to implement the commission s plan no later than jan 1 2024 the panel also is recommending that the department set up a process to try and save money and efficiently change the names and it said the secretary of defense should authorize the military service secretaries and other leaders to remove smaller items such as portraits plaques and awards that honor the confederacy or those who served in it created in 2020 the naming commission first met in march 2021 and began taking name recommendations from the public in september overall the commission received more than 34 000 potential names for the nine army bases seidule said that some of the names that were not used can be used by the service secretaries as they determine new names for roads and other base locations and assets

financial assets that intersected with their congressional work or reported similar transactions by their spouse or a dependent child phillips craig and smith were the only members of the minnesota congressional delegation cited in the report phillips reported trades in 276 companies among which the times identified 34 potential conflicts craig reported trades that one of her children made in 19 companies with two flagged as potential conflicts and smith reported trades her husband made in four companies three of which were deemed potential conflicts during phillips first term he had trades in stocks and bonds of more than two dozen banking companies while serving on the house financial services committee according to the times analysis those included trades of wells fargo while his committee investigated the bank he also sold shares of four other banks before their executives testified before his committee a spokesman for phillips said the trades in question were made by the congressman s investment advisers without his knowledge he chose to stop communicating with these advisers after announcing his congressional candidacy in 2017 letting them act independently on his behalf and began searching for a law firm to move his stocks into a blind trust after he was elected in 2018 the spokesman said phillips heir to the phillips distilling co liquor fortune hired a law firm to move his stocks into a blind trust in january 2020 it took until july 2021 to transfer most of his assets because of legal and congressional requirements the spokesman said assets from two additional trusts of which phillips is the beneficiary are in the process of being moved to separate blind trusts pending approval from the u s house committee on ethics phillips is one of five

which would require all members of congress to do the same craig holman an ethics expert and government affairs lobbyist for the nonprofit watchdog group public citizen said phillips should have avoided the trades in the first place it has every appearance that he would know where the investments are going whether or not he is making those decisions said holman whose group is pushing to ban members of congress and their immediate family members from buying or selling stocks what any responsible member of congress should do is just not play in the stock market this is a political liability for them rep craig has also called for members of congress and their spouses and children to be banned from owning or trading individual stocks she sold her own individual stocks before being sworn into congress in 2018 a spokeswoman said the minnesota democrat did not know her college aged son was trading stocks in 2019 and reported his trades as soon as she became aware of them craig s spokeswoman said his trades of shares in the companies lyft and ford came while craig served on the house committee on transportation and infrastructure he used money his grandfather left him in his will and recorded small net losses on his trades according to craig s office as a mom i would be grateful if my college student son was not allowed to own or trade stocks and as a member of congress i m working to pass a law to force him to listen to his mother craig said in a statement smith s husband who has long invested in medical device companies owned shares in two insulin equipment manufacturers when she joined the u s senate in 2018 according to the times while in the senate smith has pushed to make insulin more affordable it isn t clear how cheaper insulin would affect those companies her husband sold his shares in march 2020 as the pandemic began and most stocks plunged smith s spokesman said it was a simple business decision like a lot of families my husband archie and i have two very different jobs and we keep them completely separate smith said in a statement archie s job is to invest in medical device companies which he has done most of his career since we moved to minnesota in 1984 i do not know about and have absolutely no role in any of his investment decisions republican party of minnesota spokesman nick majerus criticized smith craig and phillips saying in a statement that the times report raises serious questions about who they represent

significantly low with the dow jones dropping over expand right now it s not the journey that s a worry so much as the destination said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments if the fed wants to hike and hold the big question is at what level the s p 500 fell 177 72 points to 3 932 69 the drop didn t quite knock out its gains over the past four days the index is now down 17 5 so far this year the dow lost 1 276 37 points to 31 104 97 and the nasdaq dropped 632 84 points to 11 633 57 related massive rail strike could mean more supply chain issues all but six of the stocks in the s p 500 fell technology and other high growth companies fell more than the rest of the market because they re seen as most at risk from higher rates most of wall street came into the day thinking the fed would hike its key short term rate by a hefty three quarters of a percentage point at its meeting next week but the hope was that inflation was in the midst of quickly falling back to more normal levels after peaking in june at 9 1 the thinking was that such a slowdown would let the fed downshift the size of its rate hikes through the end of this year and then potentially hold steady through early 2023 tuesday s report dashed some of those hopes this piece of data just hammered home that the fed isn t going to have the data to do anything differently than continue on their rate raising path for longer said tom martin senior portfolio manager with globalt investments it just increases the chance of an actual recession related us hiring slowed in august as employers face high inflation sluggish spending many of the data points within the inflation report were worse than economists expected including some the fed pays particular attention to such as inflation outside of food and energy prices markets honed in on a 0 6 rise in such prices during august from july double what economists expected said gargi chaudhuri head of investment strategy at ishares the inflation figures were so much worse than expected that traders now see a one in three chance for a rate hike of a full percentage point by the fed next week that would be quadruple the usual move and no one in the futures market was predicting such a hike a day earlier the fed has already raised its benchmark interest rate four times this year with the last two increases by three quarters of a percentage point the federal funds rate is currently in a range of 2 25 to 2 50 the fed can t let inflation persist you have to do whatever is necessary to stop prices from going up said russell evans managing principal at avitas wealth management this indicates the fed still has a lot of work to do to bring inflation down related is inflation cooling off it depends where you live higher rates hurt the economy by making it more expensive to buy a house a car or anything else bought on credit mortgage rates have already hit their highest level since 2008 creating pain for the housing industry the hope is that the fed can pull off the tightrope walk of slowing the economy enough to snuff out high inflation but not so much that it creates a painful recession tuesday s data puts hopes for such a soft landing under more threat in the meantime higher rates also push down on prices for stocks bonds and other investments investments seen as the most expensive or the riskiest are the ones hardest hit by higher rates bitcoin tumbled 9 4 to be sure the stock market s losses only return the s p 500 close to where it was before its recent winning streak that run was built on hopes that tuesday s inflation report would show a more comforting slowdown the ensuing wipeout fits what s become a pattern on wall street this year stocks fall on worries about inflation turn higher on hopes the fed may ease up on rates and then fall again when data undercuts those hopes treasury yields leaped immediately on expectations for a more aggressive fed the yield on the two year treasury which tends to track expectations for fed actions soared to 3 74 from 3 57 late monday the 10 year yield which helps dictate where mortgages and rates for other loans are heading rose to 3 42 from 3 36 expectations for a more aggressive fed also helped the dollar add to its already strong gains for this year the dollar has been surging against other currencies in large part because the fed has been hiking rates faster and by bigger margins than many other central banks ap business writer damian j troise contributed veiga reported from los angeles

niels rasmussen chief shipping analyst at bimco noted a limited growth in the us economy and rising inflation despite stimulus attempts by the biden administration imports into north america have run well above the usual level for the market growth trend driven by lower spending on services during the pandemic and higher spending on goods related container market normalisation underway bimco those shifts are now normalizing somewhat and based on these calculations we are predicting that the market might drop 1 2 this year said rasmussen referring specifically to headhaul and regional import trades retail sales in the us have plateaued as they have in europe easing back from recent highs the expectation is that container demand will be hit by high inventories across us retailers related key spot container freight index rate falls 10 in a week retail inventories in in the us have grown very very fast since july 2020 in absolute terms but really the speed of increase in inventory has really has picked up this year said rasmussen both walmart and target have stated publicly that they are overstocked on certain goods and will need to run down stocks he added that also has a negative impact on forward volumes if there is a reduction in inventories with retailers and businesses in general said rasmussen on the spending side bimco noted a recovery in service spending in the us and gradual decline in spending on goods since the pandemic and lower rates of saving in 2022 credit card debts are increasing at the fastest rate in 20 years indicating that consumers are turning to debt to fund consumption overall the situation for consumers at least the average consumer is not fantastic said rasmussen all this adds up to bimco s forecast of a 1 2 drop in headhaul and regional trades this year although rasmussen called that prediction conservative it could go lower than that it really depends on how bad it turns for the consumer towards the end of this year forecasts from the likes of the imf give a range of outlooks but eyes should now be on the downside scenarios said rasmussen imf noted a potential energy crisis in europe as a downside risk for growth and russia s ban on gas exports to the eu looks set to bring that about in the coming months

pessimistic the aussie dollar has plunged 2 2 overnight which only serves to fuel domestic inflation higher cost of imported goods commodity prices other than gold held up remarkably well given the

economists had forecast a 0 3 gain the annual rate rose to 6 3 from 5 9 if there was any doubt the fed would hike by 75 points next week there no longer is indeed there is talk of 100 or at least of 75 being followed by another 75 in october don t fight the fed wall street had become optimistic on the inflation front as oil prices fell down 10 6 from july but the stickier elements of inflation are causing the pain food prices were expected to come down on falls in raw products and fuel costs but grocery prices actually rose in august and are up 13 5 year on year the biggest rise since the 1979 oil shock maybe tonight s ppi will confirm lower raw product prices suggesting grocery prices will fall on a lag rents housing rose 0 7 in the month to be up 6 3 year on year the biggest gain since 1990 healthcare was up 5 3 year on year 1993 indeed the price of everything in the cpi basket rose last month the only exceptions being used car prices and airfares but these are only small percentages of the overall calculation rents are one third while the subsequent plunge on wall street was not unexpected rumour has it institutions had taken a big bet on lower inflation in august by buying leveraged call options which had to be quickly sold or abandoned leaving the call sellers to quickly sell their long stock hedges this apparently exacerbated the falls which at the index levels were the biggest on the day since june 2020 and close to march 2020 further exacerbating the rout was the fact the big tech names were among the worst performers apple for example rose over 3 on

the fed will go harder and faster on rate hikes just as they have been saying they will the good news a la australia is that the s p500 has not fallen by as much as the four day rally to last night

two trends appear to be working against moderna right now you might think that investors would love moderna mrna 1 22 based on its business performance the company reported 4 7 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2022 nearly half of that amount 2 2 billion was profit moderna s cash position topped 18 billion at the end of q2 it s on track to sell 21 billion of its covid 19 vaccines this year the company also continues to pick up authorizations and approvals across the world for its new vaccine targeting the coronavirus omicron variant but all isn t well for the vaccine leader here s one picture that sums up moderna s biggest problem a complicated and concerning picture the above picture from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc is admittedly somewhat complicated that s because the picture displays eight charts for different age ranges and each of those charts shows two distinct trends the dotted lines on each chart depict the seven day average of new covid 19 cases per 100 000 population in the u s so far in 2022 the solid lines on each chart show the percentage of people in the u s who are fully vaccinated during the same time period regardless of the age range two things are clear from the charts first the number of covid 19 cases per 100 000 is declining quite a bit second the number of fully vaccinated individuals in the u s has essentially flatlined obviously lower numbers of covid 19 cases are great for the u s however they can reduce the sense of urgency for americans to be vaccinated this results in lower demand for moderna s covid 19 vaccines the vaccination trends appear to confirm that the demand is waning while moderna s financial results don t show any major problems its stock chart does the vaccine stock is down more than 40 year to date and is close to 70 below the peak level set in the summer of 2021 getting a boost from boosters investors fully realize that moderna s revenue and earnings will almost certainly nosedive in the near future unless the demand for its covid 19 vaccines rebounds the most likely way for that rebound to happen is with the company s omicron boosters another covid 19 wave could be in store indeed the white house warned several months ago that as many as 100 million infections in the u s could occur during the fall and winter season moderna s omicron booster holds the potential to be more effective at providing protection against omicron sub variants individuals in the u s and in other countries could be more eager to receive the new booster if there s a significant increase in covid 19 cases however even moderna appears to recognize that its market will decline going forward the company recently stated that it thinks the u s covid 19 vaccine market after the pandemic ends could be as much as 13 billion this estimate assumes a vaccination rate of around 50 and a price of 100 per dose while the global market would be larger many countries would be less likely to pay as much per dose moderna won t have this market to itself pfizer and biontech currently hold a greater covid 19 vaccine market share in the u s than moderna does novavax could also become a more formidable competitor with its protein sub unit vaccine the bigger picture the uncertainties with ongoing covid 19 vaccine demand make moderna an iffy proposition at best right now however there s a bigger picture for moderna that could still be attractive to some long term investors moderna s pipeline includes late stage vaccine candidates targeting three other viruses other than the novel coronavirus flu cytomegalovirus cmv and respiratory syncytial virus rsv all three of these could present significant market opportunities for the company moderna is also evaluating multiple programs in earlier stage testing that could open up new markets

tuesday s inflation report was a harsh reminder of how difficult it might be to reach the fed reserve s inflation target of 2 example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington president joe biden gathered a crowd of thousands at the white house tuesday to celebrate last month s passage of the inflation reduction act even as a new government report showed how hard it could be to bring surging prices down near prepandemic levels despite its name the law s impact on inflation is expected to be modest at best tuesday s economic report inflation at 8 3 year to year though just 0 1 from july to august was a harsh reminder of how difficult it might be to hit the federal reserve s inflation target of 2 a year even as gasoline prices have declined since june the costs of housing and food remain especially high in a way that suggests further fed rate hikes and more economic pain to bring down prices u s stock indices fell sharply on the inflation report with the benchmark s p 500 down more than 4 3 on tuesday still biden and congressional democratic leaders hailed the new law with the president raising his voice and taking off his jacket in campaign style at the event on the white house south lawn with this law the american people won and special interests lost biden said taking a victory lap for legislation that rounded out the last piece of his domestic agenda for his first two years in office the legislation which passed with only democratic votes in congress also included the most substantial federal investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over a decade and will cap prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket annually for medicare recipients it also would help an estimated 13 million americans pay for health care insurance by extending subsidies provided during the coronavirus pandemic the measure is paid for by new taxes on large companies and stepped up irs enforcement on wealthy individuals and entities biden in his remarks criticized republicans for voting against the measure contending they opposed a bill that would lower prices i believe republicans could have and should have joined us on this bill as well biden said after all this bill cut costs for families to help reduce inflation at the kitchen table the law may help lower prescription drug prices but outside analyses suggest it will do little to immediately bring down overall inflation last month the nonpartisan congressional budget office judged it would have a negligible effect on prices through 2023 the university of pennsylvania s penn wharton budget model went even further to say the impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero over the next decade in theory the law could reduce inflationary pressures because it would lower annual budget deficits by 300 billion over 10 years but by partially forgiving student debt and changing the repayment structure in an august executive order biden likely has wiped out those deficit savings according to the committee for a responsible federal budget an analysis by the fiscal watchdog estimates that the president s executive order on student debt would cost roughly 500 billion over 10 years completely eliminating any disinflationary benefit

according to available secondary sources product markets and refining operations refinery margins showed diverging trends in august in the us gulf coast usgc margins declined moderately with weakness mainly at the top of the barrel this was on the back of weaker gasoline domestic consumption which exhibited signs of a slowdown amid concerns over high inflation economic growth and the approaching end of the driving season in contrast refinery margins in europe and asia reversed trend following the steep losses witnessed in july this was mainly reflective of a continued decline in diesel availability as high operational costs for european refiners due to strong natural gas prices weighed on diesel production in asia strong diesel consumption in india and china and open arbitrage for diesel flows from asia to europe led to significant regional market support that resulted in higher refining gains over the month global refinery runs slightly extended the upward trend in line with

food and beverage companies keep running into supply chain issues for us food and beverage manufacturers many disruptions in their supply chains started with the pandemic when it comes to consumption patterns the initial covid impact has clearly receded spending on food service has recovered to normal levels and currently accounts for 52 of all food and beverage spending however demand continues to be dynamic as food inflation tightens household finances and leads some consumers to trade down from premium products to more budget offerings this requires food makers to review things like product ranges production volumes and marketing on top of that there are still plenty of other issues that food processors have to deal with supplier delays are business as usual for many companies with labour shortages one of the biggest supply side problems these shortages range from truckers to warehouse workers and from factory staff to grocery stockers and restaurant staff this situation is aggravated by the fact that absence at work due to illness is still higher than before the pandemic the lack of suitable workers is more pronounced in the us than in europe there are currently two job vacancies in the united states for every single unemployed american in the uk it is one vacancy for every unemployed briton while in germany there are 0 4 job vacancies for every unemployed german the temporary channel shift between food retail and food service has reversed since the start of the pandemic percentage of total expenditure on food and drink in the us monthly data trade faced setbacks and input prices spiked even though the food system in the us is largely a domestic affair it s not isolated from the things happening in the rest of the world international trade accounts for 6 of all consumed calories in north america compared to 20 in europe for us manufacturers elevated price levels of raw materials and non food inputs such as packaging energy and fuel are the result of strong domestic demand plus developments abroad larger backlogs in ports have caused additional difficulties for food producers over the past two years as they affected import flows of foreign ingredients and commodities like coffee and cocoa and export flows of us products longer lead times also made it harder to get the equipment parts and packaging materials needed to keep production lines running smoothly while the us is not particularly dependent on agricultural commodities from the black sea region the knock on effect of the war on global prices did trickle down to buyers of grains and vegetable oils in the us a series of frictions has put us food supply chains off balance port backlogs and commodity prices have come down but issues can spark up again over the summer of 2022 the impact of increased backlogs in ports and higher commodity prices has been easing backlogs in ports on the west coast have been significantly reduced and prices for commodities such as grains and vegetable oils have retreated stil l disruptions in ports could resurface as was recently shown by a week of trucker protests in the port of oakland and when it comes to seaborne trade there s less flexibility in the us than in europe given only a few ports are able to receive and handle large carriers on agricultural commodity markets volatility indicators have eased since 1q but could easily spark up again due to geopolitical or extreme weather events congestion in los angeles long beach significantly reduced as some pressure shifted to the east coast port congestion index based on number of containerships at ports 7 day moving average per month consumers experience higher food prices and more erratic availability some causes for supply chain disruptions may be subsiding but the impact on the food industry is far from over on the consumer level you could argue that the impact is currently even more severe than during the early stages of the pandemic back then products being out of stock posed a major issue for consumers but at the moment consumers continue to experience more erratic availability in combination with much higher prices in grocery stores these phenomena seem to be more prevalent in the us than in europe with relatively larger year on year price increases for food at home 10 2 in 1h22 in the us compared to 8 1 in the eu and more consumers experiencing issues with products being out of stock beverages are currently the most affected category according to iri many us consumers have experienced being unable to buy a product due to it being out of stock percentage of people who answered the question how often are you unable to purchase a product due to it being out of stock with occasionally frequently or almost always a closer look at potential solutions for food manufacturers many food companies in the us are accustomed to times when weather or trade related events temporarily derail some part of their supply chain however the current situation seems to be more pervasive as the underlying causes are broader and not bound to a certain region or subsector as a reaction to the current issues a range of options can be considered stretching from quick fixes to more profound strategy changes it will be a trade off between what companies might want to do and what they can do because creating a more resilient supply chain comes at a cost while these costs can be harder to bear in times of soaring input cost inflation the costs of shutdowns of production lines and empty shelves might be even higher 10 measures that food processors can take to cope and adapt with supply chain disruptions some can be deployed relatively easily 1 keeping more inventory of raw materials or finished products is a fairly straightforward option to improve continuity it requires more physical space and working capital but overall it s easy to implement the availability of cold storage facilities has been a bottleneck but has seen an influx of investment according to real estate company cbre 2 increasing wages is another quick and common solution and manufacturing workers have so far seen a 6 3 pay raise over last year above the national average of 5 2 meanwhile companies also look at their non wage benefits by for example introducing more flexible shifts this only really provides relief for the industry once it attracts additional people to the labour market 3 when inputs are abundant the stimulus to be frugal is low but higher prices and erratic availability create a need to further reduce waste both investing in better forecasting capabilities and getting clients to share their sales forecasts further in advance can help to improve planning 4 price increases and temporary shortages of ingredients ranging from sunflower oil to stevia certain starches and hydrocolloids have increased the need to reformulate products and use alternative ingredients these changes often become permanent as consumers expect consistency in product formulation 5 over the past year some companies have diverted goods shipments to different ports or made a modal shift from rail to road or road to air to avoid bottlenecks while these may have been ad hoc solutions at first some companies might stick to this to increase resilience or will use them again as a fallback option when interruptions reappear but others require more of a strategic reversal 6 allocating more capital to assets such as reefer containers tractors and trailers help to decrease reliance on third parties eventually companies will still find it challenging to get truck drivers in a tight labour market and will also find it difficult to operate as efficiently as specialised logistics providers 7 companies often mention that they look to diversify their supplier base to reduce risk the pandemic has sparked additional interest in dual sourcing and regional sourcing instead of inter national sourcing however sometimes diversification options are limited due to a lack of suppliers for specific raw materials or packaging this is also one of the reasons why the united states department of agriculture usda has reserved significant funds for improving the availability of suppliers processing capacity and infrastructure in food supply chains especially in meat and poultry processing 8 the business case for automation becomes stronger when labour is in short supply we ve discussed the pros and cons in this article 9 packaged food companies in the us have tended to divest factories to become more asset light but right now vertical integration can help to re gain more control and reduce dependency on co packers however it requires suitable takeover candidates can be costly and would often mean a strategy change 10 if market circumstances have changed significantly a relocation of production facilities can help to decrease shipping distances and costs as well as tap into more labour market potential this has been a factor in decisions for new production sites for companies like nestle and post still the selection of a production site is a lengthy process in which many other factors are considered in case production facilities can t be moved easily companies are more likely to invest in the attractiveness of local communities instead mounting headwinds for economic growth but labour shortages likely to linger the us experienced a technical recession two consecutive quarters of falling economic output in the first half of 2022 but we wouldn t term this a proper recession given the economy has added more than 3 5 million jobs since the start of the year and consumer spending has been rising instead the contraction was caused by weakness in trade and inventories which is going to reverse in the third quarter moreover the plunge in gasoline prices is improving consumer spending power and we expect to see the economy expand by 3 in the current quarter however inflation is running at 8 5 and the federal reserve is focused on raising interest rates in order to dampen economic activity and constrain price pressures the dollar is also strengthening adding a further headwind to us growth at a time when china s economy is struggling and europe s energy crisis is leading it to a recession we are concerned about the medium term outlook for growth it could feel much more like a real recession late this year and into 2023 the us housing market is already weakening with falling demand leading to declining transactions while rising supply is intensifying price falls a significant downturn in the us housing market would intensify the recessionary forces in the us the macro outlook implies rising unemployment which may contribute to a greater labour supply to release some of the pressures within the food sector that said many industries continue to experience worker shortages and even if vacancies do drop remember there are two vacancies for every american right now it may remain tricky to hire the right people after all there will still be more secure and fewer physical job options available for people who re enter the labour market this suggests worker shortages along the food supply chain won t be resolved imminently nonetheless recession and consumer caution suggest that consumers will be very price sensitive when consumers trade down this will be negative for some food producers but it can also imply that other food companies face even more difficulties to keep up as demand for their products increases one example is poultry which is generally seen as the most economic option in the meat aisle another example is frozen foods which can be a cheaper substitute for fresh products either way it remains crucial for food producers to be able to adjust their production volumes and product ranges quickly source ing

the federal reserve s open market committee announced today that it would pursue 40 billion in additional monthly stimulus in the form of quantitative easing meanwhile it will maintain its previous program of exchanging about 45 billion monthly in short for long term securities quantitative easing or qe is purchasing long dated government bonds and similar debt instruments the policy is certainly well motivated the u s economy is barely growing as the latest jobs report underscored predominantly because of severe regulatory and fiscal uncertainty under the circumstances while federal reserve chairman ben bernanke s urge to do something is understandable even commendable the economy would be better off today and in years to come if he were to remember the expression when you re stuck in a hole stop digging the need to do something one cannot contest bernanke s concern job growth has gone from slow to slower while the unemployment rate remains just above 8 percent rather than climbing briskly only because half a million americans have simply quit the work force since june president obama s economic prescriptions of massive deficit spending and heavy regulations have plainly albeit not surprisingly failed if that weren t bad enough president obama and congress seem content to slow the economy further possibly triggering another recession in 2013 by their refusal to defuse taxmageddon a slate of economically devastating tax hikes set to hit on january 1 as president obama and congress are unable or unwilling to provide timely economic help all eyes turn to chairman bernanke for their part bernanke and the wall street commentariat bear much of the responsibility for this prayerful behavior the airwaves are filled with mention of the many non traditional tools remaining at the fed s disposal actions it could take if economic conditions warranted references to non traditional tools are necessary because the fed has already exhausted its traditional tools for example the fed funds rate is near zero while the real funds rate the rate after adjusting for inflation is substantially negative qe 3 as wrong as qes 1 and 2 the fed pursued two previous rounds of qe in which it purchased various long term bonds it is also continuing a second round of a related exercise called operation twist under which it sells short term assets to buy long term assets the net effect on the economy has been imperceptible but the net effect on the fed is quite pronounced as its balance sheet has ballooned to 2 814 trillion today from 924 billion in mid september 2009 it is hard to see how another round of qe would help the economy long term interest rates are already at historic lows for example the 10 year treasury bond rate has wandered between 1 4 percent and 1 8 percent over the past three months and the conventional 30 year mortgage rate remains below 3 5 percent for comparison the average rate on the 10 year treasury bond during the 2000s was 4 3 percent and the average mortgage rate was 6 1 percent with rates this low even if qe put effective downward pressure on rates a dubious proposition the economy would be unlikely to benefit if a 3 5 percent mortgage rate is of little consequence there is no reason to believe that a 3 4 percent or even 3 3 percent rate would suddenly produce results nor would quantitative easing result in a burst of money creation as per traditional monetary policy because the fed now pays a quarter point interest on excess bank reserves with little growth in the demand for private credit banks have chosen to leave their additional reserves on deposit with the fed earning this paltry but completely safe return one might suspect that bernanke fears that admitting the fed s stimulus toolkit is empty would send shockwaves through financial markets the powerful presumption at the fed and in the markets is that competent central banks always have some magic potion to heal economic woes they don t and misleading the markets by hinting at such a potion is the opposite of the transparency that bernanke espouses what s the harm in trying another round of quantitative easing will not help the economy appreciably but what s the harm the immediate harm is the added noise in market signals and the added uncertainty about future fed actions and consequences also if the fed is able to depress long term interest rates artificially as the policy implies one ill consequence would be widespread distortions of various asset prices most obviously of long term debt obligations but also equity values and commodity prices immediately after a housing bubble a policy of intentionally distorting asset prices is a tough sell further consider what is at the heart of qe a central bank buying vast quantities of government debt historically governments have forced central banks to buy debt because the government has proven so irresponsible that financial markets will not buy the bonds necessary to fund government spending despite president obama s fourth consecutive trillion dollar budget deficit the u s treasury has no problem finding buyers for its notes and bonds the intent today is not to monetize debt in the old fashioned way motivations differ but are the consequences not entirely the fed still ends up with boatloads of government bonds qe consequences the real problem with qe beyond increased near term uncertainty is that the fed must at some point unload all these bonds it has bought the fed will buy bonds in soft markets and sell them when interest rates are already rising pushing interest rates up further faster the problem in short is that the fed will have failed to prop up the economy when it was weak only to risk killing the recovery once it really takes off this is the outcome to which former senator phil gramm and professor john taylor of stanford refer in their column the hidden costs of monetary easing in the september 12 2012 wall street journal the fed s concerns about job growth are well founded uncertainty over rising regulatory costs the threat of taxmageddon and recession in 2013 combined with the increasing uncertainty associated with an irresponsible and unsustainable fiscal policy have all contributed to ongoing economic weakness these matters must be addressed by the president and congress today the fed s responses attempting to overcome these washington headwinds are likely to do much more harm than good congress and the president must attend to job growth the fed should acknowledge that it can do no more and that it is in a hole having expanded its balance sheet dangerously and stop digging j d foster phd is norman b ture senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy in the thomas a roe institute for economic policy

jobs chart 5 decline in the cost of capital from repealing the estate tax chart 6 estimates of federal deficit change from repealing the estate tax introduction virtually from the beginning of government in human society death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable the passing of well to do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors most nations today impose death estate and inheritance taxes and the united states is no exception this ancient practice however is beginning to change motivated by mounting evidence that death related taxes may hold back the economic well being of the living several countries and american states recently have repealed their taxes on estates or significantly scaled them down the u s congress also is reexamining the wisdom of these taxes two bills one in the house and another in the senate call for outright repeal of the estate and gift tax 1 and dozens of others in both chambers propose significant modifications that give taxpayer relief support for these proposals still comes primarily from advocates of limited government but a growing number of liberals recently have shown a keen interest in repeal like so many critics of the estate tax these new critics are disturbed by the growing evidence that this tax reduces economic growth hurting the jobs and incomes of the very people that wealth redistribution was intended to aid increases the cost of capital slowing down research and development and the use of machines that would increase worker productivity and thus wages keeps interest rates on home loans and other major purchases higher than they should be and raises very little money in fact it may cost the government and the taxpayers more in administrative and compliance fees than it raises in revenue current wealth taxation policy stems from the mistaken view that redistributing income leads to the redistribution of economic power nearly a century of wealth taxation however shows that well to do americans including a great number of middle class families simply find ways of legally avoiding the tax collector not only do they save less and consume more of their income thus benefiting from the lower taxes on consumption but they also make less productive investments such as large life insurance policies and substantial charitable contributions thus reducing the chances that their death will leave a large taxable estate the policy of using the estate tax to redistribute economic power actually leads to a distorted distribution of consumption and a less productive economy both of these unexpected outcomes worsen the economic condition of the less economically powerful the founders understood the critical importance of reducing legal barriers to economic opportunity as the best public means of allowing every citizen to achieve economic fulfillment this understanding found a home in the original u s constitution where direct taxes on wealth and income were prohibited except in time of national emergency but soon after the ratification of the sixteenth amendment which lifted the ban on federal income taxation in 1913 the federal government began a 60 year effort to create a more democratic economy through the forcible redistribution of wealth that policy has imposed costs on economic growth as well as fundamental liberties it is time to repeal the estate gift and generation skipping tax the case for this turns on three factors the diminishing importance of the estate tax as a federal revenue stream the failure of the tax to achieve its public policy objectives principally the creation of economic benefits for lower income americans and the continuing damage the tax exacts on the economy in terms of jobs output and growth transcending all of these factors is the growing appreciation that wealth taxation infringes on fundamental liberties and is inconsistent with the principle of limited government if the estate tax were repealed the effect on the economy would be significant according to an econometric study conducted by professor richard wagner of george mason university the effect of the estate tax on the cost of capital is so great that within eight years a u s economy without an estate tax would be producing 80 billion more in annual output and would have created 250 000 additional jobs and a 640 billion larger capital stock an analysis by the heritage foundation using two leading econometric models also found that repealing the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect on the economy specifically the heritage analysis found that if the tax were repealed this year over the next nine years the nation s economy would average as much as 11 billion per year in extra output an average of 145 000 additional new jobs could be created personal income could rise by an average of 8 billion per year above current projections and the deficit actually would decline since revenues generated by extra growth would more than compensate for the meager revenues currently raised by the inefficient estate tax the estate tax has few friends other than tax attorneys and raises very little revenue at a heavy cost to the economy it generates complex tax avoidance schemes the hardest hit by the tax are small businesspeople who work hard to pass on an enterprise of value to their children and its bias against saving and wealth generation is the antithesis of the american dream how wealth taxes began in america current public policy on the taxation of intergenerational wealth stems from roots laid down in the american revolution and oddly enough in the revolutionaries efforts to create a society in which all citizens would be free to become as wealthy as their talents allow as with so many principles that trace back to the revolutionary period the liberty to acquire and dispose of personal property became by the 20th century subsidiary to another element of the country s founding the drive to create democratic equality of economic opportunity 2 the early years alexis de tocqueville paid considerable attention to the views americans held about wealth and economic opportunity when he made his famous tour of the early republic in 1831 on the one hand americans had a nearly universal disdain for aristocracy and any non republican show of wealth but on the other hand nearly everyone with whom tocqueville became acquainted wanted desperately to be rich i do not mean that there is any lack of wealthy individuals in the united states i know of no country indeed where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of men and where a profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property but wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it 3 a man was now praised for having arrived and risen without friends for having been the architect of his own fortune or for never having been borne on the shoulders of patronage for many americans the ability to make money not whom one knew or who one s father was or where one went to college now became the only proper democratic means for distinguishing one man from another 4 the democratization of acquiring wealth constituted the touchstone of the new civilization that the revolutionaries sought to build theirs was a battle against barriers erected in the old world to prevent the rise of the common man for centuries laws had been applied differently to rich and poor people the revolutionaries overturned this by embracing the legal principle of equality before the law extending it to all free americans and giving it the sharp legal teeth of natural liberty in one s life and property they freed labor and capital from taxes turned over to communities virtually all regulation of commerce and tried in many other ways to remove government from everyday life this truly was the age of the individual liberated from the oppressive economic and social networks that had surrounded the crown and that prevented ordinary people from rising the revolutionaries emphasized the importance of allowing the marketplace rather than birth and influence to be the measure of personal worth as gordon wood writes in his pulitzer prize winning history of this period nothing epitomizes the zeal of the revolutionaries for fundamentally altering the process of acquiring wealth better than the rapid abolition of primogeniture and the narrowing of entail the ancient practice of primogeniture settled the entirety of an estate on the first born male thus leaving the remaining male children and all female children without inheritance primogeniture made birth order rather than merit the principal cause of wealth thus dullards were as likely as commercial geniuses to end up ruling vast properties and exercising immense social and political influence entail nicely complemented primogeniture by making it all but impossible for real estate to leave a family no matter how desirous a family one day might be to part with the property or how badly they managed their estate together primogeniture and entail put a gigantic weight around the neck of economic progress and reduced the rate of commercial improvement to an obese creep thomas jefferson himself initially a victim of primogeniture and then its beneficiary upon the death of his older brother vigorously opposed both practices and saw legislation that he had written in 1777 abolishing primogeniture passed by the virginia house of burgesses in 1785 within a few years every new state government had followed virginia s lead and no subsequent state ever seriously considered allowing it for jefferson the reform of entail and abolition of primogeniture were two of the most important actions taken in the early republic to create a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy and a foundation laid for a government truly republican 5 even a cursory reading of the revolutionary texts underscores this unrelenting focus of the founders on removing barriers to the wealth creating process early american public policy was not aimed at redistributing wealth or at restraining its growth rather the early republic pursued a public policy of removing obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic self improvement if an egalitarian theme was present in early american public policy it was the theme of equality before the law which often meant the elimination of legal privileges that gave one class an economic advantage over another this attitude to wealth creation can be found in the constitution of the united states a straightforward reading of the following paragraph from article i section 9 appears to prohibit all direct taxes which would include a prohibition against taxes on income and wealth no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken 6 changing attitudes toward wealth and taxation national emergencies it was generally accepted during the 19th century that congress had extensive authority to bend the constitution during times of national emergency for example the writ of habeas corpus could be suspended in times of war or rebellion in order to advance the public good thus it appeared well within congress s emergency powers to impose taxes on wealth and inheritance to meet the wholly unexpected revenue requirements of the federal government during dangerous times congress wasted no time in testing its expansive wartime authority taxes on estates were imposed first during the quasi war with france 1797 1799 but repealed in 1802 still had it not been for the civil war it is possible that after 1802 the 19th century would have been an uninterrupted period of no estate or intergenerational wealth taxation but the expenses of the union government exhausted its revenue sources so quickly that president lincoln and the war congresses employed the emergency clauses of the constitution to enact the first modern intergenerational wealth tax the revenue act of 1862 revived the death tax of the quasi war congress and recrafted it into a true inheritance tax congress repealed the tax on wealth in 1870 7 wealth seen as an obstacle to economic opportunity while costly national emergencies occasionally challenged the idea of unrestricted wealth creation and ownership more important in the long run was a change of attitude in some circles toward the relationship between wealth and economic opportunity between 1880 and 1916 the party of lincoln overflowed with political warriors who saw no american problem that could not be solved by righteous citizens wielding the policy tools of the newly powerful federal government just as they had overcome the southern assertion of states rights they would be victorious over the growing concentrations of private economic power that they viewed as fundamentally threatening the bedrock american value of equal economic opportunity the reform republicans created many tools for achieving their new economic democracy but perhaps none was so important to this project as the income tax if the principal post war threat to the republic came from the great wealth that industrialization created for a few privileged people and from the opportunities this wealth provided for corrupting political institutions reformers needed above all else a legal means of redistributing wealth thus diffusing the political power that great wealth provided in 1894 congress took its first tentative step in this direction by passing the income tax act significantly the heart of the act was a definition of gifts and inheritances as income the supreme court wasted little time in striking down the income tax act in 1895 the court ruled8 that the act constituted a direct tax on certain forms of income that did not meet the constitution s requirement of apportioning such a tax according to population without a change in the constitution the court concluded all such efforts at taxing income would fail to pass constitutional review the constitutional obstacle was removed in 1913 with ratification of the sixteenth amendment 9 congress quickly passed an income tax in 1914 that levied a 3 percent rate on all incomes above 30 000 about 900 000 in 1996 dollars 10 it then launched the modern period of estate and gift taxation through the revenue act of 1916 the revenue act of 1916 established rules for valuing a decedent s estate for capturing taxable lifetime transfers into the estate and for determining those transfers made for inadequate consideration and those that became effective only upon death it created exemptions and deductions that continue to be a part of estate tax law today most important the act introduced progressive taxation into estate tax policy 11 this element clearly distinguished its public policy objective from earlier death taxes the central mission of federal estate and gift taxation would be the redistribution of wealth 12 after 1916 and despite a few efforts to retreat from estate and gift taxation immediately following world war i taxes on intergenerational wealth transfers became a permanent feature of u s tax policy the history of wealth transfer taxation between 1920 and 1976 consisted largely of expanding the tax base for estate and gift taxes and increasing the tax rates congress raised the top marginal rate for estate taxes to 40 percent in 1924 in 1932 the top rate rose to 45 percent and the gift tax became permanent the imminence of hostilities in 1941 caused congress to search for additional revenues and led to a further increase in the top rate on estates to 77 percent 13 figure 1 shows the rapid increase in estate and gift tax collections after the end of world war ii intergenerational taxes grew significantly in both amount and rate even when adjusted for inflation this growth probably stemmed as much from the demographics of the transfer taxes as from high tax rates the late 1960s saw the beginning of generational transfers from those americans who had weathered the storms of depression and world war transfers increasingly consisted of small businesses and farms as well as stocks bonds and liquid assets and as the number of taxable estates containing businesses grew so did the pressure for estate tax relief congress recognized in 1976 that a tax intended to diminish the power of great wealth more frequently ended up taxing ordinary americans who had accumulated taxable estates through nothing more than frugality entrepreneurship and plain hard work the tax reform act of 1976 addressed the concerns of these people through a number of policy changes specifically the act unified the estate and gift tax enabling taxpayers to apply unused gift tax allowances as deductions against their taxable estates lowered the top marginal rate to 70 percent and expanded the marital deductions for estates of moderate size and created special rules for estates consisting primarily of small businesses and family farms that allowed more of these entities to escape estate taxes altogether 14 congress s eagerness in 1976 to address problems with intergenerational taxation coincided with a growing understanding among many academics and politicians that high tax rates retard economic growth 15 this growing awareness led the congresses of the 1980s to reduce the economic influence of intergenerational taxes largely through tax cuts and more generous deductions the economic recovery tax act of 1981 in particular reflected this redirection in public policy for example the act created the unified credit that currently exempts the first 600 000 in an otherwise taxable estate from any tax liability 16 and it cut the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent in addition the act further liberalized the rules governing the tax valuation of closely held businesses and farms and lengthened the period of time for the payment of estate taxes by estates that contain such businesses with few exceptions tax and budget bills passed between 1981 and 1992 adhered to the policy changes contained in the economic recovery tax act of 1981 17 even in the largest tax increase in u s history the omnibus reconciliation act of 1993 it was apparent that revenue goals and not class warfare was the basis of the wealth tax provision while congress added two new rates 53 percent and 55 percent to the estate and gift tax these still did not go above ronald reagan s top rate and while two new income tax rates 35 percent and 39 6 percent were enacted they still were just over half as high as the nearly confiscatory rates that prevailed during the administration of dwight eisenhower in fact without notice wealth transfer tax policy has lost its ideological thrust its philosophical justification is disappearing its roots in public policy are growing shorter every year and its retention depends on its value as a revenue raiser but as we shall see later besides its damaging impact on wealth creation and economic well being as a source of revenue it is more trouble than it is worth 18 the estate and gift tax today current federal wealth transfer law is a confusing maze through which only the bravest taxpayers will travel without an experienced guide the federal government taxes intergenerational wealth transfers through the estate gift and generation skipping tax systems 19 the estate tax the largest component of the federal government s three part wealth taxation system is the estate tax current estate tax law itself has three basic elements 1 definition of the estate tax base or the gross estate of a decedent 2 deductions that can be made from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate and 3 the computation of estate tax liability the tax base estate tax law defines the gross estate of a decedent as the fair market value 20 of all personal or real property wherever situated and however tangible at the time of the decedent s death 21 this valuation of an estate s property attempts to quantify such property at its highest and best use however the valuation of a business or a farm on a fair market value standard may actually result in an artificially low value of an ongoing enterprise for example consider a start up business in a good part of town the owner suddenly dies and his son wants to continue the business if the estate tax value is determined by recent sales of other businesses located near it then it may be valued at an amount well above its actual worth based on the cash generated by the business which may even be operating at a loss in this early phase this makes a big difference to an estate since the business may have to be sold in order to pay the estate tax because the son is unable to raise a loan to pay the tax in 1976 congress recognized this negative potential of the fair market value rule and permitted estates containing small businesses and farms to be valued at their present use rather than at their market value 22 insurance policies special rules apply to the value of insurance policies contained in the decedent s estate if the life insurance policy is paid out to benefit the estate of if the decedent either held a property right in the policy or conveyed this property right within three years of death then the value of the policy is added to the gross estate a similar rule applies to annuities 23 joint property a property rights rule also applies to property owned jointly by the decedent and someone other than the decedent s spouse such jointly owned property is included in the gross estate to the extent of the ratio of consideration furnished with respect to property owned jointly with a surviving spouse only 50 perc ent of such property becomes a part of the gross estate 24 gifts gifts and other transfers of property made by the decedent well before death also may be included in the gross estate if the decedent retained the ability to influence the disposition and use of such property similar inclusion in the gross estate applies to gifts that occur only upon death however sales of property and other alienation of property from the decedent s control made throughout his or her life are not included in gross estate deductions once the total value of an estate has been calculated numerous deductions may be applied the result of these subtractions from the gross estate is the taxable estate the first category of deductions relates to direct expenses of the estate all costs of the funeral of legal claims against the estate of the executor s administration of the estate and of mortgages paid by the estate may be deducted 25 second the value of property passing to the decedent s surviving spouse may be deducted finally the estate may deduct the value of all charitable bequests to organizations recognized by the federal government as tax exempt tax liability the taxable estate that results from the application of these gross estate deductions is taxed according to a somewhat cumbersome four step process first the value of all taxable gifts made over the decedent s lifetime is added to the net estate second a before credits tax is calculated by multiplying this grossed up estate by the relevant tax rate third this before credits tax is reduced by subtracting the tax on all gifts made after 1976 and fourth various credits are applied to the remaining sum 26 there are four credits available for estate tax reduction but by far the most significant is the unified transfer tax credit 27 this credit is a flat 192 800 which equates to a 600 000 net taxable estate thus the unified transfer tax credit means that current law exempts from taxation all otherwise taxable estates up to 600 000 in value above 600 000 estates face a tax rate table that contains no fewer than 17 different rates ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent there is a 5 percent surcharge for estates between 10 000 000 and 21 040 000 intended to phase out the unified transfer credit thus estates up to 21 million in value face a 60 percent marginal rate 28 the gift tax the second layer of federal wealth transfer taxation is the levy made on lifetime property gifts like the definition of gross estate current law contains a host of decisions that the courts and executors must make in determining the value of taxable gifts the tax base perhaps the most difficult decision of all is the one that must be made first determining the value of the decedent s lifetime giving this difficulty arises on two fronts such extraordinary efforts at valuation and record reconstruction must be made in order to determine whether the annual level of gift giving exceeded the allowed limits an estate may exclude from the gift tax base all annual present interest gift transfers of 10 000 or less per donee 30 but if the donor made the gift to meet the donee s tuition or medical expenses the limit does not apply furthermore if the donor s spouse elects to make a similar gift to the same donee a practice known as gift splitting the annual limit rises to 20 000 all gifts above these limits become part of the gift tax base first a gift is the transfer of property for something less than full legal consideration to a party generally within the donor s family on the one hand the executor must determine which gift transfers meet the test of insufficient legal consideration on the other hand the executor must distinguish gifts made for income tax purposes that require detached and disinterested generosity from those that qualify for the gift tax 29 second the executor or the court must wrestle with the question of fair market value the federal gift tax requires that all wealth transfers made as gifts over the decedent s entire life be valued for taxation that means incredibly that appraisals of value must be made for gifts made decades before the decedent s death moreover these gifts must be appraised in terms of their fair market value at the time they were made which is a task that often stretches the frontiers of property appraisal to its breaking point deductions like the estate tax base the gift tax base can be reduced by certain deductions besides gift splitting certain gifts to one s spouse may be deducted also gifts to charities recognized by the irs as tax exempt organizations can be deducted from the gift tax base 31 finally special rules apply to the division of property in a divorce or separation and this leads to more gift tax deductions 32 tax liability computing the amount of gift tax is relatively simple first taxable gifts for the current and all previous calendar years are summed and taxed using the tax rate table for estates second this total amount of gift tax then is reduced by any unused unified transfer tax credit to illustrate suppose that a married couple gave their only child 10 000 a year for a period of 20 years for a cumulative total of 200 000 these gifts equal the maximum annual amount that taxpayers may exclude from the federal gift tax base however for four years this couple made additional gifts to their child of 100 000 a year for a total of 400 000 this latter amount is above the limit and is taxable now suppose that the gross taxable estate of this couple equals 1 000 000 which includes the taxable gifts the executor of the estate will use the unified credit of 600 000 to reduce the taxable amount and will pay taxes on the remaining 400 000 or the additional gifts the couple gave their child the generation skipping tax wealth transfer taxes have been so consistently high throughout this century that a substantial cottage industry devoted to estate tax avoidance has blossomed within the legal and financial communities one of their cleverest inventions was a trust established by a parent for the lifetime benefit of his or her children that passed tax free to the parent s grandchildren upon the parent s death or bypassed the children completely and went directly to the grandchildren the trust avoided estate taxes altogether because such taxes are never levied on amounts that cannot be controlled by the taxpayer however some trusts were designed to pay out to the grandchildren upon the death of the taxpayer s children thus the taxpayer could target specific individuals to receive benefits from the estate if the taxpayer could skip a generation through the creative use of a tax free trust congress enacted a cumbersome tax law change in 1976 to close the indirect generation skipping transfer but it left unaddressed the trust or bequest that directly skipped the parent s children both of these loopholes were addressed by congress in 1986 as part of the tax reform act of 1986 congress established a flat rate tax of 55 percent on all generation skipping transfers transfers subject to the tax are those made from a trust to a skip person someone two or more generations removed from the donor those made by a donor directly to a skip person without going through a trust and those that result from termination of an interest in a property or trust which usually happens upon the death of the donor 33 as with the estate tax and the gift tax several exclusions and exemptions apply the same 10 000 annual exclusion and tuition and medical exemptions found in the gift tax law apply to generation skipping taxes a total lifetime exclusion of 1 000 000 2 000 000 for married couples is allowed finally transfers made prior to january 1 1990 are exempt up to 2 000 000 4 000 000 for married couples 34 the liberal case for repealing the eastate tax this complex tax edifice rests on the foundation that taxing intergenerational wealth transfers results in less concentrated wealth holdings and that this leads in turn to greater economic opportunity and a more democratic society certainly simplicity cannot be raised in support of this tax policy as the above discussion indicates and as figures 1 and 2 show the estate and gift tax cannot be justified as playing an important role in financing government the unified estate and gift tax now brings in less than 1 7 percent of total federal revenues the liberal egalitarian argument for intergenerational wealth taxation the case for the estate tax turns on the tax s effectiveness in achieving greater economic democracy through the redistribution of wealth if its supporters cannot sustain the argument that the estate tax improves equality of economic opportunity then there exists little else except perhaps inertia to recommend continuation of this part of u s tax policy other simpler taxes could meet revenue objectives far more efficiently academic support for intergenerational wealth taxation remains warm in large part because of the role it plays in the most important theoretical treatise on liberal egalitarianism john rawls s a theory of justice 35 since its publication in 1971 this careful magisterial presentation of the case for liberal democracy infused with just institutions has permeated thinking on most issues in social and political theory it is fair to say that no stronger theoretical case for intergenerational wealth taxation exists at the center of rawls s case for wealth taxation is the principle that ll social primary goods liberty and opportunity income and wealth and the bases of self respect are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the least favored 36 while at first blush this principle would appear to suggest radical egalitarianism in economic and political life rawls recognizes the superiority of free over socialized markets to produce benefits for the least advantaged citizens which leads him and many like minded political theorists to support significant differences in the economic conditions of individuals within a generation after a century of economic experimentation there can be little doubt that everyone achieves greater economic benefit when individuals are allowed to discover their own comparative advantage and focus their labor in the area where they can make the greatest economic difference this tolerance for intragenerational differences leads rawls to oppose all income taxes since economic income stems from natural differences in talent and from differing propensities of individuals to apply themselves to hard work 37 however two principled considerations compel rawls to take substantial exception to intergenerational differences in economic condition first rawls opposes the transfer of accumulated property to succeeding generations because it undermines the first principle of a just society that everyone has an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all 38 those who begin with a significant unearned endowment of property resources place others not so advantaged in a less equal condition and this undermines the principle that everyone should have access to the same system of equal basic liberties second this difference might be tolerated if it produced greater benefits for the least advantaged than for the advantaged however intergenerational wealth transfers create benefits that flow in the opposite direction over time they enhance the advantages of inheriting generations and generally degrade the liberties of the unbenefitted thus he taxation of inheritance and income at progressive rates when necessary and the legal definition of property rights are to secure the institutions of equal liberty in a property owning democracy and the fair value of the rights they establish 39 while rawls does not advance confiscatory taxation of intergenerational wealth transfers his argument does imply substantial taxing discretion by the state in his universe the state guides the institutions of distribution should government determine that wealth transfers constitute significant barriers to the equal enjoyment of liberties as defined by rawls it clearly has the power to tax away as much of the wealth that moves between generations as it deems necessary to restore justice objections to the liberal egalitarian case for the estate tax a number of objections could be raised against the rawlsian case for wealth transfer taxation not the least of them being the questionable assertion of government authority over the intergenerational disposition of private property if wealth is acquired legally and transferred peacefully that is in some non tortious fashion that breaches no contract pertaining to the property government has no ethical standing to interfere with its disposition of course liberal egalitarians claim a more expansive role for government a principal element of which is the progressive enhancement of equality of condition among citizens thus it is important first to consider the estate tax within the context of the argument that justifies the tax s existence if it can be shown that the estate tax does not advance the ethical program of the liberal egalitarians then other objections to this tax that can be raised without assuming this ethical and moral framework become more compelling this approach to analyzing the estate tax was taken in a seminal monograph by edward j mccaffery published in the yale law journal in 1994 40 professor mccaffery comes to the debate over the estate tax with impeccable political credentials unlike many critics of intergenerational taxation who frame their objections within a larger politically conservative analysis of contemporary government macaffery formulated his critique of the estate tax within a liberal framework as he stated last year before the u s senate committee on finance i am an unrequited liberal in both the classical and contemporary political senses of that word whose views on social and distributive justice might best be described as progressive i used to believe in the gift and estate tax as a vehicle for obtaining justice as to the latter belief only i am now prepared to confess that i was blind but now can see 41 mccaffery raises five general objections to the liberal egalitarian argument supporting intergenerational wealth taxation each of them assumes the ethical and moral objectives of the liberal political program the currently combined income and estate tax system encourages large inter vivos gift transfers which have the effect of creating a greater inequality of starting points or a less level economic playing field this predictable effect of the estate tax law is aggravated further by the fact that high estate tax rates encourage the consumption rather than the transfer of wealth purchasing goods and services instead of saving the funds that support that consumption produces larger differences between rich and poor people thus the estate tax is illiberal because it undermines rather than advances the liberal egalitarian objective of equality of economic opportunity while higher wealth transfer taxes might reduce the level of inter vivos gifts and other tax law changes could be made to penalize the spending behavior of rich families it currently is both practically and politically impossible to do so on the one hand analysts are becoming increasingly aware of the intergenerational focus of much current saving behavior at all income levels liberals should promote the creation of transferable wealth among the less advantaged on the other hand politicians are becoming increasingly aware of how much voters want taxes to fall not rise the estate or inheritance tax has been repealed in australia canada israel and california and the movement for tax reform is a spreading worldwide movement there will always be differences between the starting conditions of people in a non ideal world if liberal egalitarians attempted to eliminate all the differences that stem from intergenerational wealth transfers they would risk leaving the least advantaged even worse off than they were before not only would confiscatory taxation reduce the consumption behavior of wealthy people thereby also reducing employment and incomes among poorer citizens but it would depress the amount of economic capital as well thereby reducing economic expansion and income growth both of which are central to improving the conditions of the least advantaged is the use and not the mere concentration of wealth that threatens reasonable liberal values 42 generally speaking the accumulation of savings and the promotion of earnings that underlie the growth of savings are goods that liberals like earnings and savings create a common pool of resources that can be used to promote improvements in the general welfare through public and private means liberals generally regard the consumption behavior of the wealthy as objectionable thus wealth transfer taxation which attacks savings and promotes wanton consumption is wholly ill suited to the attainment of an ideal liberal society the best tax policy that liberal egalitarians could pursue if attaining liberal social and political objectives truly motivates the liberal program is one that taxes consumption not savings mccaffery writes that y getting our reasonable political judgments wrong by taxing work and savings while condoning even encouraging large scale use the status quo impedes the liberal project the real threats to liberty and equality from private possession alone turn out on closer scrutiny to relate to possession qua potential or actual use each of which can be addressed indeed can best be addressed in a tax system without an estate tax 43 not only then is the estate tax inconsistent with a liberal program of promoting equality of economic condition but it encourages behavior that works against liberal objectives it supports consumption and depletion by penalizing savings and earnings it encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like steve forbes to spend 30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save 30 million for his children s future an investment upon which he will pay a 55 percent transfer tax as opposed to a campaign expenditure upon which no additional taxes are ever levied how many new jobs and new businesses did mr forbes s campaign create as opposed to the same amount saved in a bank that lends the funds to entrepreneurs and business managers liberals and conservatives are beginning to answer this question in precisely the same way because of capital accumulation effects the estate tax may not achieve the objective to which it is presumably directed that is equalizing the distribution of income if the government takes actions to offset these accumulation effects the tax will lead to an increase in equality of income and wealth the desirability of the estate tax may still be questioned not only because of the distortions which it introduces but also because it may actually increase inequality in the distribution of consumption 45 the weaknesses of the estate and income tax system as a tool for redistribution long have been known even to its academic friends joseph stiglitz who now serves as the chairman of president clinton s council of economic advisers concluded in 1978 that the estate tax effectively transfers resources from the saver to the spender which absent any offsetting tax policy change reduces the stock of capital and leads to lower levels of national wealth furthermore wrote stiglitz alan blinder another member of the president s initial council of economic advisers and subsequently vice chairman of the federal reserve system s board of governors also has raised serious doubts about the redistributional promises of the estate tax 46 he has been joined by michael boskin martin feldstein gary becker laurence kotlikoff lawrence summers and many other economists with prominent connections to mainstream economics 47 the economic case against the estate tax in addition to the left s declining enthusiasm for the ideology of wealth taxes two economic issues have added to the momentum for repeal one is the mounting weight of economic and financial evidence against the estate and gift tax as such the other is the rapidly spreading general view that income taxes and the multiple taxation of savings reduce economic growth which in turn slows the rate of economic improvement by the least advantaged among the economic problems associated with the tax the estate tax raises little money and encourages inefficient tax avoidance schemes bolstering the skepticism about the efficiency of the estate and gift tax is the striking fact of how little revenue it raises for the federal government despite the tax s broad reach theoretically touching upon nearly all transferable wealth the unified tax raised only 14 7 billion in 1995 48 as figure 1 shows the estate and gift tax consistently has fallen as a percentage of total federal revenues while at the same time the total amount of wealth has risen dramatically when a tax raises significantly less than the estimate of its potential it is often because taxpayers have discovered ways to avoid the tax and have changed their economic behavior in ways that reduce the pool of funds from which the tax is drawn to understand the extent to which this happens it is necessary to estimate just what estate tax collections theoretically should look like public finance economists have struggled for a long time with this question producing an adequate answer however requires knowing a great deal more than we now do about the size of legal tax avoidance and the degree to which taxpayers change their economic behavior in order to reduce their estate tax liabilities moreover economists do not know the size of the wealth pool within which estates are formed the commerce department s bureau of economic analysis periodically estimates household net worth or the sum of durables savings and equities held by households 49 the bureau currently estimates this net worth to be about 26 4 trillion of which 8 4 trillion is in equities while this amount by no means constitutes the tax base for the estate tax a portion of this enormous sum most certainly does for example laurence j kotlikoff estimates that slightly more than 50 percent of household wealth is held as intergenerational savings 50 if one assumes that this 50 percent or 13 2 trillion is transferred in equal amounts over two generations or 46 years then about 290 billion annually is moving to the next generation even this figure probably overstates the tax base for the estate tax many economists argue that taxpayers who believe they will pay estate taxes will change their economic behavior in ways that result in a huge shrinkage of the estate tax base 51 b douglas bernheim argues that high estate tax rates lead taxpayers to make far more cash gifts to their children than they otherwise would in large part because their children pay taxes at lower rates than they do bernheim estimates that 50 percent to 75 percent of all intergenerational gifts are made because of the estate tax charitable gifts and other revenue losses are between 70 percent and 80 percent of total estate tax revenue put another way indirect revenue losses in 1995 might have been 11 billion on revenues of 14 7 billion 52 the revenue data strongly imply significant tax avoidance and other economic behavior that responds to high tax rates by moving national wealth and thus taxable estates from savings to consumption it is exceptionally difficult however for analysts to go from implication to quantification recent breakthroughs in the economic understanding of household savings may lead ultimately to convincing estimates of how much savings behavior stems from income and estate tax policy even so economists can offer a number of important insights about the deleterious economic effects of tax policy on economic performance the estate tax discourages savings savings take many different forms cash reserves in a bank stock in a corporation art land housing ownership of a business and so forth that serve many different purposes households hold cash in a bank largely to finance future consumption like the purchase of a house or as a hedge against unanticipated household expenses like costly medical care similarly the equity component of a mortgage is designed to be used to purchase future housing these two forms of savings are largely liquid and thus earn relatively low rates of return households put money in a bank with the understanding that their funds can be withdrawn virtually at any time the household prefers the bank in turn lends these savings with this same understanding in mind and therefore prefers relatively short term low risk loans that contain significant liquidity for the bank so if a household saves in a long term time deposit for example a 10 year certificate of deposit it will demand a higher rate of return as compensation for not having these funds available for consumption the bank in turn is freer to invest in riskier ventures for which it also can demand a higher rate of return the bank s cost of a loan failure also falls when it is working with longer term savings it knows it has a certain period of time to make successful loans that cover its contract with the saver and yield the bank a profit the decision to save largely follows this simple story when households consume most of their income any long term investment must earn a high return however when they increase their savings relative to their consumption of income they require less compensation for foregone consumption and the required rate of return falls economists are divided between those who believe that households have a relatively fixed savings percentage over their lifetimes which implies relatively fixed time preferences and those who see the percentage of savings as something that fluctuates as certain preferences including time or consumption and costs particularly taxes change it is this latter viewpoint that is particularly relevant to estate tax analysis taxes play a role in savings decisions because they increase the cost of saving relative to consuming income for example if a household invests 25 percent of its income after taxes in a bank account that earns interest it will pay additional taxes on any interest it takes as income if another household decides to invest its 25 percent in corporate stocks it will pay additional taxes on any capital gains it takes as income however if both households take that same 25 percent of after tax income and buy expensive shoes no additional income taxes will be collected no doubt sales taxes will be collected on the shoe purchases but sales tax rates are almost always less than the income tax rate one would pay on the same amount of money thus taxes discourage saving by increasing its cost relative to consumption if the household saves anyway it will demand a higher rate of return to compensate it for the taxes it must pay on interest earnings likewise a household purchasing stocks will demand a higher and more secure rate of return on its stocks in both cases the cost of capital to the borrower to the bank or to the corporation has risen because of taxes one way for a household to save and avoid additional taxation is to purchase an asset like art or land that appreciates slowly over a very long period of time this kind of purchase however also increases the economy wide cost of capital by reducing the fund of money available to banks and businesses still another way to reduce the tax cost of saving is to invest in tax advantaged funds such as iras or 403 b and 401 k plans these types of funds annuitize savings which means essentially that only low risk long term low yield to medium yield investments will be supported by them while they do reduce current tax liabilities they are especially costly for the saver in two ways in addition to shrouding these plans in penalties and taxes should they be liquidated before the saver reaches a certain age the government has significantly discounted the future value of these savings by delaying taxes on earnings until they are at their highest level the unified estate and gift tax adds yet another layer of taxes on any savings decision a household makes successful saving always raises the possibility of creating a taxable estate at which point the tax cost of a dollar saved increases by an amount somewhere between 7 4 cents and 55 cents so if the household persists in its decision to save it will require some long term premium return on its investments roughly equal to its estimate that estate taxes will not be avoided naturally this premium further increases the cost of capital the estate tax hurts small business investing in a business is one of the many forms of saving for some families the only form for most small firms every available dollar goes into the family business the dry cleaning business the restaurant the trucking company because the business creates an asset for the children and incomes for the owners women re entering the work force after raising children often find self employment the only entry level employment open to them minorities know the reasons for self employment only too well minorities hit hard all of the financial security provided by these businesses is put at risk if the owner dies with a taxable estate in an important 1995 study of how minority businesses perceive the estate tax 53 joseph astrachan and craig aronoff found that some 90 percent of the surveyed minority businesses knew that they might be subject to the federal estate tax about 67 percent of these businesses had taken steps including gifts of stock ownership restructuring life insurance purchases and buy sell agreements to shelter their assets from taxation over 50 percent of these same businesses indicated that they would not have taken these steps had there been no estate tax and some 58 percent of all the businesses in the survey anticipated failure or great difficulty surviving after determining their estate taxes 54 the astrachan aronoff study echoes findings in a 1994 study by patrick fleenor and j d foster of the tax foundation a washington based tax policy organization 55 who presented estimates of lifetime effective tax rates for a taxable corporation a non corporate business an individual earning high amounts of labor income and a large business in each case fleenor and foster found that the presence of the estate tax raised the lifetime tax rate to a figure above 65 percent the large business simulation determined a tax rate of 72 percent nearly every public finance economist of the last 50 years has concluded that tax rates of this magnitude significantly reduce the taxpayer s willingness to earn more and take entrepreneurial risk and these two effects reductions in labor and in new business formation directly depress the rate of general economic growth which should deeply concern everyone interested in improving economic welfare in the united states while professor mccaffery appears unaware of the fleenor foster study it includes precisely the kind of evidence he has marshaled to assail the estate tax as inimical to the expansion of economic opportunity he is not however unaware of richard e wagner s important 1993 monograph federal transfer taxation a study in social cost which ties together the many threads of this emerging theoretical canon on estate taxation 56 professor wagner s study stands virtually alone in presenting macroeconomic estimates of the estate tax s effects on individual decisions to work and save using a model that trades labor for capital according to their relative costs and that represents this dynamic interaction through key indicators of macroeconomic activity wagner found that the tax premiums created by the estate tax raise the cost of capital sufficiently to reduce national output employment and capital stock by measurable amounts in a simulation that modeled the u s economy without the current estate tax wagner found that nominal gross domestic product gdp would have been 80 billion higher after eight years than in an economy without the estate tax 228 000 more jobs would have been created the capital stock would have been 640 billion larger 57 and and the larger economy resulting from the repeal of estate taxes produced increases in all other taxes over the eight year simulation period though not quite by an amount equal to the loss of the estate tax 58 the impact of repealing the estate tax while analysts have made significant progress in understanding the microeconomic effects of intergenerational taxation the dearth of studies similar to wagner s shows that much work still needs to be done on measuring the tax s macroeconomic effects it is little wonder however that such studies are not more numerous as stiglitz noted there are many remaining questions about the tax s effects on wealth accumulation and without a good knowledge of these effects economists cannot create that most elementary but crucial of concepts in any tax analysis the tax base bearing in mind these limitations the author and heritage foundation analysts have estimated the economic impact of repealing the estate and gift tax beginning in 1997 the heritage analysis made certain assumptions about the effect of repeal each of these assumptions was introduced into two leading models of the u s economy the washington university macro model wumm and the mark 11 macroeconomic model of wharton econometric forecasting associates 59 these two statistical models of u s economic activity are highly regarded exceptionally accurate tools for estimating the effects of public policy changes on the general economy and are widely used for this purpose by america s leading corporations and government agencies given the substantial doubt that annual estate tax filings fully reflect the size of the tax base 60 estimates of the tax s economic effects must start from another foundation the macroeconomic estimates presented here were built from estimates of changes in the u s labor force and domestic capital stocks associated with removing the estate tax portion of the after tax cost of labor and capital these estimates then were introduced into the macroeconomic models to compute the effects cost of capital assumptions the cost of capital the so called rental price of investment results from at least three factors 1 the cost of attracting investors to supply capital funds and not do something else with their money 2 the ratio of a capital good s depreciation relative to the value of output it produces and 3 taxes if a business or a household borrows money it must pay the lender or investor enough to attract that lender or investor away from other opportunities a portion of this opportunity cost payment is the tax that the lender expects to owe on the loan s earnings under current law a business may offset some of this tax premium by deducting its annual depreciation and interest payments in some cases businesses also may claim various investment tax credits that further reduce the tax premiums they have had to pay to lenders however a substantial portion of the cost of operating a business is not tax deductible and this results in a positive residual tax premium in real world capital costs endnotes

the last 12 months to july 2022 the st cloud index of leading economic indicators lei fell 0 9 three of six indicators were positive survey responses were largely responsible for the decline initial claims for unemployment insurance and stock prices contributed positively to lei firms reported weaker may july performance and weaker expectations for the future only responses to levels of current capital expenditures showed any positivity difficulty finding qualified workers eased significantly despite the fact that in a special question 55 said they were still short of workers and would try to replace a worker who left their businesses in other special questions 38 of area business owners replied that we are already in a recession while 21 do not believe a recession will start before 2024 at the earliest most felt that elevated pricing pressures would last another year or more almost a third of firms said higher input prices were being absorbed into shrinking profit margins can construction keep st cloud growing there is little doubt that the performance of the st cloud area economy has been enhanced by a strong construction sector the difference is striking if you compare st cloud s construction employment boom to the rest of the state and country construction employment between february 2020 and july 2022 not seasonally adjusted data for minnesota and st cloud are aggregated to include mining and logging grew 38 4 in st cloud versus 31 7 for the state and 7 8 for the nation put another way the sector added 2 962 jobs while the rest of the st cloud economy lost 4 598 growth has been fairly broad based but information from the central minnesota builders association indicates that 2021 was an excellent year for building after subpar periods of january to july in 2019 and 2020 averaging about 38 permits over those 7 months building permits in the area shot up to 197 in 2021 including 71 in the city of sartell permit issuance has returned however to its 2019 level so far in 2022 yet as the nearby chart shows the decline in permit issuance has not slowed the growth of the construction sector to remove the effects of seasonality we use 12 month moving averages for both permit issuance and construction employment as the resulting graph shows the two series are moving in opposite directions contrary to what we would expect this is therefore a concern but perhaps not too much of one insofar as there are other reasons we hire construction workers than just to start a new home first non residential construction appears to be doing well for the state employment in constructing buildings is up but down for residential buildings contractors are another area in which the state is experiencing expanding employment if businesses follow residences into new and expanding neighborhoods this pattern makes sense as a signal that the expansion in construction is not yet over second despite mortgage rates rising higher the latest reported 30 year rate was 5 8 there is a declining number of houses in the market the st cloud area association of realtors scaar reported 1 6 months supply of inventory of homes for sale while this is much higher than the less than one month of inventory reported as recently as april it is less than half of the number seen even three years ago data from the city of st cloud shows 27 development projects that are equal to or greater than 250 000 in value through july 31 2022 down slightly from 29 such projects over the same period last year however the value of the projects rose by a third it is likely that a higher valued project engages more workers interestingly prices have not risen as fast here as many parts of the country scaar reports the median house sold in st cloud rose 9 7 in july 2022 from the same month last year minneapolis home prices rose 10 4 according to the s p corelogic case shiller index compared to 18 for the u s price appreciation has slowed in real estate over the summer but the fact remains that even with less house price inflation in st cloud than elsewhere our employment has been greater survey results for standard questions current activity tables 1 and 2 report the most recent results of the st cloud area business outlook survey responses are from thirty six area businesses that returned the recent mailing in time to be included in the report participating firms are representative of the diverse collection of businesses in the st cloud area they include retail manufacturing construction financial health services and government enterprises both small and large survey responses are strictly confidential written and oral comments have not been attributed to individual firms a diffusion index represents the percentage of respondents indicating an increase minus the percentage indicating a decrease in any given quarter for any given item a positive index usually indicates expanding activity while a negative index implies declining conditions table 1 shows that business activity during the three month period ending in august 2022 was weaker than the last quarter and one year ago diffusion index 24 3 compensation of employees also fell from the previous quarter and last year diffusion index 57 6 the diffusion index for number of employees 24 2 is smaller than it was in the previous quarter and similar to slightly lower than last year capital expenditure diffusion index 36 4 is similar to the last quarter but higher than the value reported one year ago this is the only diffusion index that was higher in august 2022 than august 2021 none were higher than the values in may 2022 the diffusion index for prices received for company s products 54 5 is lower than those in the previous quarter and one year ago national business activity diffusion index 13 3 shows a considerable decline in comparison to the previous quarter and one year ago attracting qualified workers seems easier than it was in the previous quarter and last year diffusion index 13 as always firms were asked to report any factors that are affecting their business these comments include the ability to find skilled workers our current administration on a national level as well as on a state level political risks foreign risks inflation market risks are all causing uncertainty and challenges supply chain issues and qualified labor shortage open for suggestions to solve either the right talent to keep things moving being sure every employee feels valued and appreciated we need everyone doing their best to keep things progressing because we sell new tires and retreaded tires we have always been somewhat insulated from the impact of economic slowdowns pessimism mostly future outlook in every case responses to questions about business expectations over the next six months deteriorated in august from responses in may or from a year ago the future business activity diffusion index is 33 3 which is below 40 5 in august 2021 and 42 8 in the last quarter slightly above 53 of surveyed firms expect improved business activity by february while 20 of the firms expect weaker conditions indicating overall optimism about the local economic activity over the next six months the future capital expenditures index is 23 4 26 7 of firms expect higher capital spending over the next six months versus 3 3 of firms expect to reduce capital purchases the future capital expenditures diffusion index is smaller than that of the last quarter and slightly lower than the value recorded a year ago with 32 3 of surveyed firms expecting to expand employment by february and only 6 4 of the firms expecting decreased payrolls the future employment index is at 25 9 which is promising but smaller than the recorded index in the last quarter and one year ago firms will likely be providing high employee compensation to attract and retain workers over the next six months the diffusion index of future employee compensation is 51 6 which is lower than the diffusion index for employee compensation in the last three months about 3 of the firms expect to pay lower wages and salaries by february the prices received index also remains elevated at 58 1 61 3 of surveyed firms expect to receive higher prices by february while 3 2 expect prices received to decrease area business leaders expect inflationary pressures to continue but more moderately than the last quarter this quarter s final survey chart depicts the future difficulty attracting qualified workers diffusion index this diffusion index in august 2022 is 10 4 which is considerably smaller than may 2022 and august 2021 indicating an existing but moderating labor shortage a negative reading on this index has always signaled a recession since we started asking this question in 1998 this diffusion index has been declining since the middle of last year though it is still positive results of special questions the following questions address firms expectations of recession evolving employment practices inflation expectations and rising input prices special question 1 thinking about the u s economy generally when do you think we will have the next recession about 40 of our survey respondents believe that the economy is already in a recession while 31 expect to experience a recession in the second half of 2023 or later the remaining expect a recession in the second half of 2022 or the first half of 2023 the sample appears to show some polarization of attitudes about recession by way of comparison we looked at the answers about an almost identical question conducted aug 1 9 by the national association of business economists the share of these professional economists who think the us economy is already in a recession is half of the respondents to the st cloud area quarterly business outlook a bare majority of them believe the economy will be in recession sometime in the next four quarters with only 20 thinking the economy will avoid a recession before july 2023 one can understand the range of uncertainty the federal reserve s strategy to tackle unprecedented inflation has included two potent 0 75 percentage point hikes in the fed funds rate at its last two meetings at a conference in wyoming last month chair jerome powell indicated that either 0 50 or 0 75 is most likely to happen at the next meeting yet it could be a long while before inflation returns to healthy levels targeted by the fed we recall milton friedman s observation that monetary policy works with long and variable lags and overshooting the optimal fed funds rate this could then lead to a slow down of the economy and transitioning to a steady and stable growth or a soft landing as the fed promises but in the past this often leads to a recession instead respondents written comments include what makes you so certain there will be a recession i am not as convinced as you some areas are already seeing recession some are sold out for 2 years semiconductor unemployment still low our mortgage home purchase refinance activity is down 75 from prior year i do not believe anyone has the answer to this question it is here just not to the degree that it will be at later because of a strong labor market and backlog of work for many companies i do not think we will see a recession until at least 2024 historical definition we are there special question 2 if your firm experiences a loss of an employee in the second half of 2022 what are you most likely to do according to a recent nfib survey about half of small business owners faced a significant labor shortage as late as last july hiring is in particular more difficult for small business owners because lower cash flows and restricted access to credit reduce their ability to absorb talented workers through offering competitive salaries bonuses and wages more than 55 of the responding firms in our survey are experiencing a labor shortage and express a continuing desire to hire more employees about 34 of the respondents indicate that their desire to fill a vacancy varies with the position the remaining 10 of the respondents do not intend to hire workers until at least 2023 respondents written comments include too complicated to explain but for now i am staffed the workload at this point is growing so we need to maintain or replace workers always looking for good help we are experiencing a strong demand for our services and a shortage of qualified workers we struggled finding employees in 2021 and are still catching up from open positions in 2022 2021 we will keep going on until we are fully rounded up we cannot find workers upgrading technology as much as possible to cover the gap we have many openings and expect to have more in the future as we grow and people retire we are constantly looking for good people and will hire them if we can find them a recession will impact hiring for sure exploring tech solutions first we need more people in most every part of our company special question 3 thinking about the u s economy generally how long do you anticipate elevated pricing pressures to last according to a recent nfib survey three quarters of business owners believe that inflationary pressures are worsening forcing them to significantly reconsider their business practices about two thirds of our survey respondents expect inflationary pressures to last more than a year 38 of the respondents expect inflation to last beyond 2023 while 31 believe that pricing pressures will continue until the second half of 2023 the remaining firms show more optimism expecting the pressure to ease before the second half of 2023 respondents written comments include beyond 2023 but i think it will moderate for a couple of more months at the least i do not believe that the higher prices will return to pre covid levels just guessing but if suppliers can keep numbers up they will it is a supply demand issue with the current backlog on the supply chain the ukraine war and the labor shortage i think there will be pricing pressures at least until the end of 2023 i feel once a recession hits things could fall quickly in fact i worry about that happening a slower rise and slower fall would be ideal but i feel we are past that happening out of control government spending is not stopping special question 4 how are you managing rising input costs inflation ongoing labor shortage and supply chain disruptions are still among the most significant problems facing firms of all sizes and small businesses in particular this can naturally force firms to fundamentally review their business strategies such as purchases pricing capital allocation etc according to nfib s new inflation survey 56 35 of small firms business decisions are substantially moderately affected by rising prices to absorb rising input prices businesses can pass increased costs downstream to their customers reduce their supply of goods and services change suppliers find cheaper alternatives if possible or absorb increased costs in their profit margin the latter can be difficult for small businesses with thin profit margins our sample indicated that firms have predominantly resorted to passing the prices downstream and or absorbing them in their profit margin respondents written comments include we raised prices ourselves a little bit of all plus trying to increase sales passing price increases downstream this is the only plan that works for us minor price changes we will try to absorb so far we have been able to pass on pricing increases we have been absorbing but plan to raise prices in the fall 2022 because we cannot keep doing this lower unemployment rates and more jobs continue in st cloud total nonfarm employment in the st cloud area grew 2 9 in the last 12 months to july 2022 not much different from the state as a whole or the twin cities metro as seen in table 3 however there are significant differences in various sectors as noted on page 1 of this report the construction sector has continued to grow much more quickly than other sectors in st cloud and stands in distinction against a 0 2 decline in construction around the state the retail trade transportation warehouse and utilities and education and health sectors all grew more in the last 12 months in st cloud than elsewhere in the state the sector labeled other services which includes arts and entertainment gyms and beauty salons continued to recover while leisure and hospitality is still recovering and grew faster than the area average in the last 12 months this sector still employs 1 8 fewer workers than it did in february 2020 only four sectors of the 11 in the private sector are above their level from that month construction retail trade wholesale trade and professional and business services the education and health sector is still 6 7 below its february 2020 level since then manufacturing employment is down 2 5 in the st cloud msa but up 5 1 in the state the labor force grew 1 6 over the 12 months to july 2022 as shown in table 4 but civilian employment rose 3 1 this drove the unemployment rate to 2 0 in july 2022 from 3 5 a year ago similar unemployment rates were present for the twin cities and minnesota clearly labor supply in st cloud and around the state is very tight at this time initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to fall to very low levels in may and june the july 2022 figure was not available from minnesota department of employment and economic development when this report went to press the value of building permits for new homes in the city of st cloud fell by almost a quarter from the elevated levels experienced a year ago as noted elsewhere building permits were the highest in seven years during 2021 compared to one year ago the st cloud stock price index fell by 6 3 compared to a loss of 10 4 in the s p 500 in the most recent quarter seven stocks gained led by american axle and manufacturing at 32 three stocks declined in price during the period with capital one financial losing 12 the most notable the st cloud index of leading economic indicators fell 0 9 over the last 12 months in the most recent quarter as shown in table 5 there were three indicators up and three others down the responses to this quarter s st cloud area quarterly business survey contributed the most to the decline in the index while better stock price performance and fewer initial claims for unemployment insurance pushed against that downdraft this is now two consecutive quarters in the decline of the index after accelerating dramatically at the outset of 2022 the index is now just below its pre pandemic peak in the third quarter of 2018 this report shows a significant divergence of views business owners seem certain that the area is in an economic recession while others do not think one will come any time soon likewise economic data that looks at the labor market indicates good growth though slowed from this time a year ago but stock prices and new building permits point towards a softening economy if this is a recession it looks like none we have seen before people with either opinion can present some facts to support their view it is therefore our judgment to wait for one more quarter of information before deciding whether or not a recession has begun about the authors king banaian specializes in analyzing data and writing about it in the second portion of this report mana komai molle collects and analyzes responses to the st cloud area business outlook survey covered in an early portion of the report only molle has access to the confidential list of surveyed businesses and the returned surveys special questions asked in the survey may at times deal with public policy but do not reflect a political agenda of either of the authors
soaring consumer prices aren t fading as quickly as hoped inflation in august remained near 40 year highs defying forecasts of a sharper decline and squeezing the budgets of millions of americans who are struggling to cover basic costs like food gas and rent a government report tuesday showed while inflation did ease the drop from a year earlier wasn t as large as economists predicted and two other key gauges the month over month change in prices and a measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and energy costs did just the opposite they rose the disappointing results sent stock and

jobs market and falling gas prices overall prices increased 8 3 from a year earlier down from an 8 5 rise in july and a 40 year high of 9 1 in june as rising food and rent costs offset falling

the bls released the latest cpi figures earlier today with consumer inflation easing to 8 3 y o y for the month of august as noted in my earlier article july s cpi was recorded at 8 5 although this may appear to be a welcome improvement financial markets have crashed in trading today are you looking for signals alerts from pro traders sign up to invezz signals for free takes 2 mins source tradingeconomics com at the time of writing the dow jones is down 2 7 the s p 500 has fallen 3 0 and the tech heavy nasdaq witnessed an even steeper decline of 3 9 commodities were not spared either plummeting after the release source marketwatch why were markets surprised copy link to section there are three key reasons for the market s reaction higher than anticipated headline inflation higher than anticipated rise in core inflation shift in inflationary factors towards housing higher than anticipated headline inflation copy link to section as previously reported on invezz the fed has maintained a very hawkish narrative however despite the front loading of interest rate hikes and the weakness in energy prices as discussed in my earlier article the cpi surprised to the upside by staying well above market forecasts source wsj for the latest updates on energy markets movements do check out invezz s energy research higher than anticipated rise in core inflation copy link to section even though there has been a moderation in energy and food prices in august core cpi excluding volatile food and energy components inflation has continued to rise gasoline prices were down 10 1 on the month while fuel oil was 10 6 lower the energy category as a whole fell 5 in august the extent to which the federal reserve s policies may or may not have impacted energy prices is unclear much of the drop in fuel prices can be attributed to the end of the summer driving season in the united states as well as the price moderation covered in the latest oil news despite this both the annualized and month on month core cpi rose in august 2022 source bls in the above graph we find that month on month inflation is being driven primarily by higher shelter prices which were up 0 7 and 6 2 in the course of the last 12 months however the rise in core cpi implies that inflationary pressures are beginning to seep into other parts of the economy this is crucial since the federal reserve tends to consider the core cpi as more easily manageable than headline inflation and thus central to anchoring expectations in august the core cpi rose 0 6 nearly twice expectations while on a yearly basis it was up 6 3 higher than the forecast of 6 markets found these numbers to be very disappointing and the stubborn increase in monthly price rise offers scope for surging inflation expectations which could prove highly problematic for chairman powell concerns that the economy is on the incorrect inflationary trajectory will likely prompt policymakers to hike rates further and faster despite their best intentions this may not be the right answer in a july study i noted that the economists stiglitz and baker argued that rate hikes may exacerbate supply chain difficulties in addition it takes several quarters for rate decisions to be wholly transmitted through the economy at any rate monetary authorities function with imperfect information it is the expectation of higher and faster rate hikes that is driving up the dollar index or dxy as the market prices in additional fed actions you can read more about how dollar strength and high inflation are linked here the shift in inflationary factors toward housing copy link to section in the above graph it is clear that housing shelter inflation has seen an uptick according to the wsj the shelter index acts as a lagging indicator in that it takes time to adjust to rising prices which could signal higher prices moving ahead this month marks the highest increase in shelter prices during the year jeffrey kleintop chief global investment strategist for charles schwab notes that housing inflation may continue to rise given the unique way it is calculated in the united states and a handful of other countries particularly in parts of europe shelter inflation draws upon oer or owners equivalent rent thus the shelter index accounts for rental rates and not house prices unlike in several other jurisdictions including canada australia and sweden when mortgage rates are high as they are today the market for renters tends to swell usually pushing up rents and sending the shelter index higher due to the high weightage of shelter in the cpi approximately 32 4 increasing rate hikes may actually fuel inflation by sending mortgage rates higher and leading to a rise in rental prices consequently shelter inflation has the potential to be much a more durable source of high prices and may potentially contribute to higher inflation for the remainder of the year and well into 2023 this is even though energy prices eased considerably and there is scope for food prices to fall as well however food and fuel occupy 13 9 and 7 5 of the cpi basket respectively and may only offer limited relief if the shelter index continues to rise rate hikes coming copy link to section in the latest economy news most economists were concerned that the fed may be doing too much in terms of monetary tightening however with cpi proving to be higher than anticipated as well as the uptick in core cpi this data will certainly give the fed enough fodder to justify accelerating further and keeping rates raised for longer according to the cme s fedwatch tool prior to the cpi announcement the probability of a 50 bps hike at next week s meeting stood at 10 while that of a 75 bps hike stood at 90 however post the release this shifted radically with an 82 probability of a 75 bps hike and even an 18 likelihood of a 100 bps increase with the fed s monumental rate hikes likely to continue concerns about the economy being pushed into a recession have certainly increased in august us pmis dropped to their lowest levels in over two years as covered here to boot the economy has already experienced two consecutive quarters of negative growth in such an environment tighter policies will further weigh on liquidity the us fed s planned hike is likely to be followed by other global central banks this would dampen international liquidity flows and usher in a very challenging h2

menafn accesswire montréal qc accesswire september 13 2022 st georges eco mining corp cse sx otcqb sxoof fse 85g1 would like to provide an update on the different initiatives undertaken by the company as well as its financing efforts evsx proposed partnership investment in italian battery company late last week evsx signed a binding memorandum of understanding with arabat s r l a battery recycling technology company headquartered in foggia italy this agreement should be the first step toward a formal partnership with arabat the executed document gives the partners four months to complete a detailed partnership agreement wherein evsx will initiate the planification to deploy its front end solution to manufacture critical metals black mass from the used batteries sourced by arabat in italy and adjacent european countries the initial industrial plant should be located in the puglia region black mass chemistry that is more favorable to the exclusive citric acid leaching process developed by arabat and reviewed over the last year by evsx will be processed locally with profit sharing and or a royalty to be paid to the italian partner all other black mass chemistries produced will be transported to one of evsx s specialized tech plants and battery sourcing compensation payments will be negotiated with arabat arabat s management initially approached us to present their technology to process black mass and investigate a potential r d and industrial collaboration what we saw was a solid group of scientists with an extensive network based in italy and the industrial centers of western europe that needed to be leveraged after reviewing dozens of technologies often perceived as competing with evsx s solution we came to the conclusion that arabat besides being innovative could complement evsx in specific parts of the world and followed similar philosophies for the recovery of critical elements this agreement strongly solidifies each group in their respective niches we look forward to concluding a mutually beneficial partnership and quickly building and deploying the initial italian industrial plant with them this follows the fundamentals of sx with green and sustainable technologies and we are excited to move forward in north america and europe commented enrico di cesare ceo of evsx we are happy to have reached an agreement with evsx for the industrial development of our revolutionary technology our goal is to contribute to the technological sustainable and circular transformation of the european continent and beyond starting from our

the initial design and engineering of its phase i industrial circuit for battery preparation and processing into black mass company management s experience in industrial equipment design maintenance and operations allowed it to accelerate from feasibility study to industrial ordering and accelerate industrialization in strategic locations the modular approach will cost substantially less than what is discussed in the market by many entering the sector it also allows for a strategy of rapid local and international growth a portion of the company s strategy is to focus on novelty in process and avoid developing new equipment off the shelf industrial units are being purchased to be incorporated within the rollout which eliminates risk and learning curves the total manufacturing costs are expected to be us 1 million for the three units transportation installation training and configuration costs should add 1 5 million to the total resources to be expensed building and facilities adaptation costs should add 5 million to the total the company expects all three industrial plants will be fully operational between the end of 2022 and the first part of 2023 notwithstanding any black swan event after dispersing any residual charges the batteries are shredded most of the copper steel plastic carbon and aluminium is segregated and recuperated these steps leave the different chemistry types of black mass as the end product depending on the type of battery black mass can comprise between 5 to 20 of the total mass and weight steel and copper do not require any further transformation to be sold aluminium represents a significant part of the batteries and third parties have indicated that they would be ready to acquire all of the company s production alongside the carbon reduction credits produced by the process these third parties are also interested in the carbon recuperated at this stage this carbon is of different grades and quality depending on the type of
