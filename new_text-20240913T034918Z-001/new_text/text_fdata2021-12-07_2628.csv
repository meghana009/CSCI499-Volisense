pam and barry van dyck have been dreaming of leaving behind the snow in grand rapids mich and going someplace warm and adventurous for their 50th wedding anniversary with zip lining snorkeling rivers in caves amphibious vehicles and waterslides pam van dyck says of course those aren t activities just for them but for their children and grandchildren too as the retired couple wants to celebrate a half century together with their entire family everybody enjoys being together and this would be a fun way to celebrate us having 51 years together pam van dyck says it s 51 years now because the van dycks initially planned the anniversary trip to mexico for last december but postponed it amid a surge in covid 19 cases at a time when vaccines were not yet widely available now they re not entirely sure they can take the rescheduled trip this month our biggest concern of course is what s happening now with the new variant and it s just getting a little risky i not ready to cancel or postpone pam van dyck says adding that she s waiting and watching to see what happens with the new coronavirus strain i really don t want to do that but we would i m not putting everybody at risk the discovery of the omicron variant of the coronavirus in at least a third of u s states is raising questions about whether it will be safe to travel for the upcoming holidays with christmas now less than three weeks away to try to curb the spread of the variant many countries are imposing travel restrictions and bans including the u s which has banned most non u s citizens who have recently been in any of eight southern african countries from entering the united states starting monday the biden administration is requiring all travelers coming into the u s to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within a day of their departure regardless of citizenship and vaccination status and it is extending the mask wearing mandate on board planes and inside airports into mid march such restrictions are raising concerns that there may be another slowdown in air travel hurting an industry that was just beginning to turn the corner toward recovery after having its busiest week since the pandemic began over the thanksgiving holiday period u s airlines flew about 2 4 million passengers on nov 28 that s the most since february 2020 and the industry had been preparing for a busy december too with some airlines offering employees incentive pay to work extra or not call in sick to accommodate the increase in passengers should you travel health experts say it depends experts in infectious disease and public health officials note that omicron is a variant of concern but add that there is not much known about it including its transmissibility its ability to evade the immune system and the severity of disease it causes so it s difficult to say right now if those with travel plans for christmas should instead stay home dr robert murphy a professor of infectious diseases at northwestern university s feinberg school of medicine and director of the school s institute for global health says we ll know more in a couple of weeks i think people should really get ready to hit the pause button on their travel plans he says those who are immunocompromised should definitely not travel and that includes people over 65 people who are obese people with diabetes people with underlying cancer people with any kind of immunocompromised condition i think these people should not be traveling anywhere he also recommends that people cancel or postpone their trip if they were planning to go overseas spencer platt getty images getty images united airlines planes sit at gates at newark liberty international airport in new jersey on nov 30 the united states as well as a growing list of other countries has restricted flights because of the detection of the omicron variant of the coronavirus the international traveler is at much higher risk than domestic murphy says and not just for contracting the coronavirus he says with governments worldwide closing borders and imposing new travel restrictions there s a significant risk of your flight being canceled and you getting stranded overseas or you being forced to quarantine upon arrival at your destination because of an outbreak murphy says he has canceled his own planned trip to europe over the holidays as for domestic travel for those without underlying health conditions whose flights are already booked murphy and other public health experts urge travelers to take a wait and see approach we ll know a lot more in the next two weeks murphy told npr if this comes out like we think it s going to come in other words it s just more contagious and it s not a worse disease and if you re vaccinated and boosted that if you do get infected you don t get too sick you know i think travel could be pretty safe very soon omicron s impact on airlines one more headache you didn t need the rise of the omicron variant and subsequent global travel restrictions come at a perilous time for the airlines which had been banking on a strong holiday season and a recovery in business and international travel next year to help propel the industry out of a long pandemic slump well you know it s one more headache you didn t need and you hope to avoid says robert w mann a former airline executive who now works as a consultant for the industry it s a continuation of the thing we ve seen since the beginning which was you know two steps forward one step back or sometimes two steps back mann says but you know we ll make it through this we understand how to deal with it a lot better than we did initially united airlines ceo scott kirby says he expects united to take a financial hit from the omicron coronavirus variant adding that trans atlantic flights will be most affected my guess is we ll have less flying to europe than we would have in january because of the new variant kirby told the financial times in an interview with cnbc kirby added that omicron is certainly going to have a near term impact on bookings there will be a short term dip in revenue but the dip will be smaller than it was for delta we ve always known there were going to be more variants and we ve said the covid recovery would never be a straight line kirby said adding we re much better dealing with this as a society vaccines are likely to prove effective again we look confident about the long term nothing changes about where we ll be 12 months from now industry analysts agree that the airlines appear better prepared to handle the now inevitable ups and downs that come with surges in coronavirus infections and the discovery of new variants in the past year each new variant has brought a decline in bookings but then an increase once the surge dissipates said helane becker an analyst with financial services firm cowen in an interview with the associated press the omicron variant does not appear to be biting into americans appetite to travel as domestic air travel bookings rose over the past week according to adobe digital insights which tracks flight booking data airline and travel related stocks rose monday as bookings have not fallen as sharply as expected adobe s data shows that from nov 25 through dec 1 domestic flight bookings online were up 19 compared with the week prior cyber monday saw the biggest uptick in bookings with levels elevated through the two days following the majority of these bookings were for trips happening in the next two months mann the airline consultant says holiday travelers who had already booked flights don t appear to be canceling their trips yet out of fears of possibly another surge in coronavirus infections but he says the omicron variant does cast a pall of uncertainty over how airline executives plan for next year and their decision has to be you know how much capacity am i going to risk scheduling in 2022 for the spring and summer mostly mann says because that s when everyone hoped we would be out of the soup and into the black again i think there s still some concern that this may once again delay that recovery process citing the world health organization s advisory warning that blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of the coronavirus and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods the airline and travel industries are urging governments worldwide to reverse the most severe travel restrictions that have already been put into place the emergence of the omicron variant panicked many governments into once again restricting or entirely removing the freedom to travel said willie walsh director general of the international air transport association in a statement he noted that the presence of the new variant is already confirmed on all continents the ill advised travel bans are as ineffective as closing the barn door after the horse has bolted walsh added copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

new york at last month s cop26 climate summit hundreds of financial institutions declared that they would put trillions of dollars to work to finance solutions to climate change yet a major barrier stands in the way the world s financial system actually impedes the flow of finance to developing countries creating a financial death trap for many economic development depends on investments in three main kinds of capital human capital health and education infrastructure power digital transport and urban and businesses poorer countries have lower levels per person of each kind of capital and therefore also have the potential to grow rapidly by investing in a balanced way across them these days that growth can and should be green and digital avoiding the high pollution growth of the past global bond markets and banking systems should provide sufficient funds for the high growth catch up phase of sustainable development yet this does not happen the flow of funds from global bond markets and banks to developing countries remains small costly to the borrowers and unstable developing country borrowers pay interest charges that are often 5 10 per cent higher per year than the borrowing costs paid by rich countries developing country borrowers as a group are regarded as high risk the bond rating agencies assign lower ratings by mechanical formula to countries just because they are poor yet these perceived high risks are exaggerated and often become a self fulfilling prophecy when a government floats bonds to finance public investments it generally counts on the ability to refinance some or all of the bonds as they fall due provided that the long term trajectory of its debt relative to government revenues is acceptable if the government suddenly finds itself unable to refinance the debts falling due it likely will be pushed into default not out of bad faith or because of long term insolvency but for lack of cash on hand this is what happens to far too many developing country governments international lenders or rating agencies come to believe often for an arbitrary reason that country x has become uncreditworthy this perception results in a sudden stop of new lending to the government without access to refinancing the government is forced into a default thus justifying the preceding fears the government then usually turns to the international monetary fund for emergency financing the restoration of the government s global financial reputation typically takes years or even decades rich country governments that borrow internationally in their own currencies do not face the same risk of a sudden stop because their own central banks act as lenders of last resort lending to the united states government is considered safe in no small part because the federal reserve can buy treasury bonds in the open market ensuring in effect that the government can roll over debts falling due the same is true for eurozone countries assuming that the european central bank acts as the lender of last resort when the ecb briefly failed to play that role in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis several eurozone countries including greece ireland and portugal temporarily lost access to international capital markets after that debacle a near death experience for the eurozone the ecb stepped up its lender of last resort function engaged in quantitative easing through massive purchases of eurozone bonds and thereby eased borrowing conditions for the affected countries rich countries thus generally borrow in their own currencies at low cost and with little risk of illiquidity except at moments of exceptional policy mismanagement such as by the us government in 2008 and by the ecb soon thereafter low and lower middle income countries by contrast borrow in foreign currencies mainly dollars and euros pay exceptionally high interest rates and suffer sudden stops for example ghana s debt to gdp ratio 83 5 per cent is far lower than greece s 206 7 per cent or portugal s 130 8 per cent yet moody s rates the creditworthiness of ghana s government bonds at b3 several notches below those of greece ba3 and portugal baa2 ghana pays around cent on ten year borrowing whereas greece and portugal pay just 1 3 per cent and 0 4 per cent respectively the major credit rating agencies fitch moody s and s p global assign investment grade ratings to most rich countries and to many upper middle income countries but assign sub investment grade ratings to nearly all lower middle income countries and to all low income countries moody s for example currently assigns an investment grade to just two lower middle income countries indonesia and the philippines trillions of dollars in pension insurance bank and other investment funds are channelled by law regulation or internal practice away from sub investment grade securities once lost an investment grade sovereign rating is extremely hard to recover unless the government enjoys the backing of a major central bank during the 2010s 20 governments including barbados brazil greece tunisia and turkey were downgraded to below investment grade out of the five that have since recovered their investment grade rating four are in the eu hungary ireland portugal and slovenia and none are in latin america africa or asia the fifth is russia an overhaul of the global financial system is therefore urgent and long overdue developing countries with good growth prospects and vital development needs should be able to borrow reliably on decent market terms to this end the g 20 and the imf should devise a new and improved credit rating system that accounts for each country s growth prospects and long term debt sustainability banking regulations such as those of the bank for international settlements should then be revised according to the improved credit rating system to facilitate more bank lending to developing countries to help end the sudden stops the g 20 and the imf should use their financial firepower to support a liquid secondary market in developing country sovereign bonds the fed ecb and other key central banks should establish currency swap lines with central banks in low income and lower middle income countries the world bank and other development finance institutions also should greatly increase their grants and concessional loans to developing countries especially the poorest last but not least if rich countries and regions including several us states stopped sponsoring money laundering and tax havens developing countries would have more revenues to fund investments in sustainable development jeffrey d sachs university professor at columbia university is director of the centre for sustainable

new york regulators are looking into the deal that would bring donald trump s new social media company to the stock market the deal has attracted both legions of fans of the former president and people looking to make a quick profit the company partnering with trump media technology group acknowledged the inquiries in a filing it made with regulators on monday it also gave some financial forecasts for the company which wants to rival twitter and other platforms that banned trump after the jan 6 capitol riots along with netflix and other streaming video services it said over the weekend that it s lined up 1 billion in investments from a group of unnamed institutional investors separately trump media announced that rep devin nunes a republican from california will leave congress to become the company s chief executive in january nunes the former chair of the house intelligence committee was an ardent backer of trump s during probes into russian interference in the 2016 election and the president s 2019 impeachment by the democratic led house the regulatory scrutiny is focused on the october announcement by trump s media venture that it would merge with digital world acquisition corp that company had launched on the u s stock market three weeks earlier with the sole purpose of finding a privately held company to buy it s often referred to by its trading symbol of dwac dwac said monday that it is cooperating with the preliminary fact finding inquiries by the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority the sec early last month requested documents related to meetings of dwac s board and communications between dwac and trump s media venture among other things according to dwac the sec s request said the commission s investigation does not mean that the sec has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the sec has a negative opinion of dwac or any person event or security advertisement the sec could be looking at whether dwac and trump s company had any conversations about a deal before dwac s own initial public offering of stock said jay ritter a professor at the university of florida who is an expert on ipos under rules for these blank check companies known as special purpose acquisition companies or spacs they re not supposed to line up acquisition targets before selling their own shares senator elizabeth warren on nov 17 wrote a letter to the sec s chair gary gensler asking if the agency is exploring whether dwac had violated the law by holding such discussions and misleading potential investors by failing to inform them before its ipo asked how worried he would be about the sec s investigation if he were on the receiving end ritter said it depends on what i knew this could be innocuous or pro forma stuff or it could be really serious just what the regulators are probing is not clear what s more the regulatory rules on spac discussions with targets are gray prohibiting only substantive talks with possible acquisition targets still the trump deal stood out as unusual in many ways even before an oct 29 report from the new york times said that dwac ceo patrick orlando had met with trump and his representatives before taking dwac public blank check companies typically buy businesses with employees customers and a track record which is not the case with the trump deal several spac experts also said the three weeks it took for dwac to find and strike a deal with tmtg was unusually fast dwac and tmtg did not respond to requests for comment on monday advertisement an sec spokesperson declined to comment beyond saying the sec does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation separately the financial industry regulatory authority or finra asked in late october and early november for a review of trading in dwac s stock before the oct 20 merger deal was announced that could be an indication of a search for insider trading ritter said though it s a notoriously difficult thing to prove the merger announcement sent dwac s stock surging from 9 96 to 94 20 in just two days as trump supporters and investors looking to make a fast buck piled in the shares have since pulled back to roughly 44 on monday the shares closed down 2 6 at 43 81 such a lofty price indicates high expectations for trump s media venture among at least some investors in its filing with regulators dwac also gave some financial forecasts for the company which has yet to launch but wants to build a non cancellable global community the presentation included forecasts that the company s truth social service may have 81 million users by 2026 or nearly 7 million more people than voted for trump in the last u s presidential election spacs generally are known for giving very optimistic forecasts about their future growth in presentations to investors in five years tmtg is forecast to generate nearly 3 7 billion in revenue according to the filing that is more than the annual revenue of retailer restoration hardware rv maker winnebago industries and entertainment giant iheart media which owns more than 800 radio stations for its tmtg video service that will stream non woke entertainment and news it says the monthly fee per user could be 9 in 2026 netflix in comparison got 14 49 in average revenue from its u s and canadian members during the first nine months of this year in the statement announcing his appointment as ceo nunes said the time has come to reopen the internet and allow for the

omicron spreads uncertainty about holiday travel and dampens recovery for airlines pam and barry van dyck have been dreaming of leaving behind the snow in grand rapids mich and going someplace warm and adventurous for their 50th wedding anniversary with zip lining snorkeling rivers in caves amphibious vehicles and waterslides pam van dyck says of course those aren t activities just for them but for their children and grandchildren too as the retired couple wants to celebrate a half century together with their entire family everybody enjoys being together and this would be a fun way to celebrate us having 51 years together pam van dyck says it s 51 years now because the van dycks initially planned the anniversary trip to mexico for last december but postponed it amid a surge in covid 19 cases at a time when vaccines were not yet widely available now they re not entirely sure they can take the rescheduled trip this month our biggest concern of course is what s happening now with the new variant and it s just getting a little risky i not ready to cancel or postpone pam van dyck says adding that she s waiting and watching to see what happens with the new coronavirus strain i really don t want to do that but we would i m not putting everybody at risk the discovery of the omicron variant of the coronavirus in at least a third of u s states is raising questions about whether it will be safe to travel for the upcoming holidays with christmas now less than three weeks away to try to curb the spread of the variant many countries are imposing travel restrictions and bans including the u s which has banned most non u s citizens who have recently been in any of eight southern african countries from entering the united states starting monday the biden administration is requiring all travelers coming into the u s to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within a day of their departure regardless of citizenship and vaccination status and it is extending the mask wearing mandate on board planes and inside airports into mid march such restrictions are raising concerns that there may be another slowdown in air travel hurting an industry that was just beginning to turn the corner toward recovery after having its busiest week since the pandemic began over the thanksgiving holiday period u s airlines flew about 2 4 million passengers on nov 28 that s the most since february 2020 and the industry had been preparing for a busy december too with some airlines offering employees incentive pay to work extra or not call in sick to accommodate the increase in passengers should you travel health experts say it depends experts in infectious disease and public health officials note that omicron is a variant of concern but add that there is not much known about it including its transmissibility its ability to evade the immune system and the severity of disease it causes so it s difficult to say right now if those with travel plans for christmas should instead stay home dr robert murphy a professor of infectious diseases at northwestern university s feinberg school of medicine and director of the school s institute for global health says we ll know more in a couple of weeks i think people should really get ready to hit the pause button on their travel plans he says those who are immunocompromised should definitely not travel and that includes people over 65 people who are obese people with diabetes people with underlying cancer people with any kind of immunocompromised condition i think these people should not be traveling anywhere he also recommends that people cancel or postpone their trip if they were planning to go overseas the international traveler is at much higher risk than domestic murphy says and not just for contracting the coronavirus he says with governments worldwide closing borders and imposing new travel restrictions there s a significant risk of your flight being canceled and you getting stranded overseas or you being forced to quarantine upon arrival at your destination because of an outbreak murphy says he has canceled his own planned trip to europe over the holidays as for domestic travel for those without underlying health conditions whose flights are already booked murphy and other public health experts urge travelers to take a wait and see approach we ll know a lot more in the next two weeks murphy told npr if this comes out like we think it s going to come in other words it s just more contagious and it s not a worse disease and if you re vaccinated and boosted that if you do get infected you don t get too sick you know i think travel could be pretty safe very soon omicron s impact on airlines one more headache you didn t need the rise of the omicron variant and subsequent global travel restrictions come at a perilous time for the airlines which had been banking on a strong holiday season and a recovery in business and international travel next year to help propel the industry out of a long pandemic slump well you know it s one more headache you didn t need and you hope to avoid says robert w mann a former airline executive who now works as a consultant for the industry it s a continuation of the thing we ve seen since the beginning which was you know two steps forward one step back or sometimes two steps back mann says but you know we ll make it through this we understand how to deal with it a lot better than we did initially united airlines ceo scott kirby says he expects united to take a financial hit from the omicron coronavirus variant adding

the company partnering with trump media technology group acknowledged the inquiries in a filing it made with regulators on monday new york regulators are looking into the deal that would bring donald trump s new social media company to the stock market one that has attracted both legions of fans of the former president and people looking to make a quick profit the company partnering with trump media technology group acknowledged the inquiries in a filing it made with regulators on monday it also gave some financial forecasts for the company which wants to rival twitter and other platforms that banned trump after the jan 6 capitol riots along with netflix and other streaming video services it said over the weekend that it s lined up 1 billion in investments from a group of unnamed institutional investors separately trump media announced that rep devin nunes a republican from california will leave congress to become the company s chief executive in january nunes the former chair of the house intelligence committee was an ardent backer of trump s during probes into russian interference in the 2016 election and the president s 2019 impeachment by the democratic led house the regulatory scrutiny is focused on the october announcement by trump s media venture that it would merge with digital world acquisition corp that company had launched on the u s stock market three weeks earlier with the sole purpose of finding a privately held company to buy it s often referred to by its trading symbol of dwac dwac said monday that it is cooperating with the preliminary fact finding inquiries by the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority the sec early last month requested documents related to meetings of dwac s board and communications between dwac and trump s media venture among other things according to dwac the sec s request said the commission s investigation does not mean that the sec has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the sec has a negative opinion of dwac or any person event or security the sec could be looking at whether dwac and trump s company had any conversations about a deal before dwac s own initial public offering of stock said jay ritter a professor at the university of florida who is an expert on ipos under rules for these blank check companies known as special purpose acquisition companies or spacs they re not supposed to line up acquisition targets before selling their own shares senator elizabeth warren on nov 17 wrote a letter to the sec s chair gary gensler asking if the agency is exploring whether dwac had violated the law by holding such discussions and misleading potential investors by failing to inform them before its ipo asked how worried he would be about the sec s investigation if he were on the receiving end ritter said it depends on what i knew this could be innocuous or pro forma stuff or it could be really serious just what the regulators are probing is not clear what s more the regulatory rules on spac discussions with targets are gray prohibiting only substantive talks with possible acquisition targets still the trump deal stood out as unusual in many ways even before an oct 29 report from the new york times said that dwac ceo patrick orlando had met with trump and his representatives before taking dwac public blank check companies typically buy businesses with employees customers and a track record which is not the case with the trump deal several spac experts also said the three weeks it took for dwac to find and strike a deal with tmtg was unusually fast related articles twitter co founder jack dorsey stepping down as ceo dwac and tmtg did not respond to requests for comment on monday an sec spokesperson declined to comment beyond saying the sec does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation separately the financial industry regulatory authority or finra asked in late october and early november for a review of trading in dwac s stock before the oct 20 merger deal was announced that could be an indication of a search for insider trading ritter said though it s a notoriously difficult thing to prove the merger announcement sent dwac s stock surging from 9 96 to 94 20 in just two days as trump supporters and investors looking to make a fast buck piled in the shares have since pulled back to roughly 44 such a lofty price indicates high expectations for trump s media venture among at least some investors in its filing with regulators dwac also gave some financial forecasts for the company which has yet to launch but wants to build a non cancellable global community the presentation included forecasts that the company s truth social service may have 81 million users by 2026 or nearly 7 million more people than voted for trump in the last u s presidential election spacs generally are known for giving very optimistic forecasts about their future growth in presentations to investors in five years tmtg is forecast to generate nearly 3 7 billion in revenue according to the filing that is more than the annual revenue of retailer restoration hardware rv maker winnebago industries and entertainment giant iheart media which owns more than 800 radio stations for its tmtg video service that will stream non woke entertainment and news it says the monthly fee per user could be 9 in 2026 netflix in comparison got 14 49 in average revenue from its u s and canadian members during the first nine months of this year the presentation also lists the names of 30 key employees including its chief technology officer but only gives their first names and last initial the company has yet to offer many other details about its operation outside of trump being its chairman

i ve tried to ignore pronouncements that we should cut tariffs on chinese imports to fight inflation but they re now appearing in the chinese press the last straw not that i blame the prc for this they re only parroting americans americans who are being misleading and occasionally worse than that for the cost of tariffs and they do have a cost i ll use an annual number derived last month by an anti tariff group 51 billion which naturally changes when the quantity of imports rises or falls fun fact the 6 2 percent inflation rate everyone s worried about the china tariffs may be lowering that that inflation is 2021 price change from 2020 most tariffs were applied in 2019 and passed to american consumers by mid 2020 tariffs costs rose as trade recovered from covid but it s not clear the increase was faster than consumer inflation if tariff costs rose from 51 billion to 53 billion say they d be pulling 2021 inflation down by a tiny bit we ll get to that view of the headquarters and head office of the people s bank of china via reuters not the point i hear secretaries and former secretaries of the treasury reply the tariffs don t contribute to current inflation but if we reduced or discarded them it could help limit future inflation yes although it s a bit odd to pick out a 2019 policy which didn t create meaningful 2020 inflation in order to address 2021 inflation it s odder when people don t mention american monetary policy in april 2020 narrow money stock m1 was 4 77 trillion in april 2021 it was 18 9 trillion nearly a 300 percent increase six months after that we have inflation pressure who d have guessed it s the egg i had for breakfast that s upsetting my stomach tonight not the three large pizzas i had for lunch still not the point i hear some conservative friends saying tariffs are taxes which discourage economic activity in the tariff case the tax also adds to final sales prices both statements are true but more distraction than main event we have other taxes that add to final sales prices federal excise taxes have the same effect as tariffs and are roughly twice as large and the production encouraged by cutting those taxes might occur in the us which is not true for tariffs yet when i tried to find anyone calling for lower excise taxes they re all talking about fighting inflation in india time to come clean i m nitpicking that s because everything in this discussion is nitpicking except for the 300 percent rise in m1 which is insane regarding the 51 billion tariff cost to consumers us personal consumption expenditure this year will be about 16 5 trillion addressing consumer burden through china tariffs is equivalent to telling a family spending 500 per week on food that you re going to cut their costs by 1 55 that s not a random amount it s how important china tariffs are so why are people talking about them first the tariffs are ripe targets because they don t do much of anything they are applied to goods in the first nine months of 2019 american goods imports from china were 340 billion in the first nine months of 2021 they were 360 billion trade war second the small set of businesses affected by tariffs are arguing their case as they should their voice is amplified by free traders who see tariffs as a dangerous step even if very small and by politicians deflecting blame for inflation there are also people looking to gain from a brief stock market rally that could result if china tariffs are lowered and that last group may not be the most unpleasant lobbyists parts of american business are less interested in sparing consumers than in returning to normal us china relations this means no barriers to moving more supply chains to china to investing heavily in the prc without disclosing who s getting the money to selling dangerous technology china tariffs make almost no difference to inflation and matter even less to the economy as a whole they matter most to firms who haven t been considering the national interest

how do you pick the next stock to invest in one way would be to spend days of research browsing through thousands of publicly traded companies however an easier way is to look at the stocks that smart

portfolio beddow capital management is also relatively very bullish on the stock earmarking 4 16 percent of its 13f equity portfolio to jnj due to the fact that johnson johnson nyse jnj has experienced bearish sentiment from the entirety of the hedge funds we track it s easy to see that there were a few hedge funds that decided to sell off their positions entirely heading into q4 at the top of the heap donald sussman s paloma partners cut the biggest stake of the 750 funds followed by insider monkey totaling an estimated 17 5 million in stock andrew weiss s fund weiss asset

pam and barry van dyck have been dreaming of leaving behind the snow in grand rapids mich and going someplace warm and adventurous for their 50th wedding anniversary with zip lining snorkeling rivers in caves amphibious vehicles and waterslides pam van dyck says of course those aren t activities just for them but for their children and grandchildren too as the retired couple wants to celebrate a half century together with their entire family everybody enjoys being together and this would be a fun way to celebrate us having 51 years together pam van dyck says it s 51 years now because the van dycks initially planned the anniversary trip to mexico for last december but postponed it amid a surge in covid 19 cases at a time when vaccines were not yet widely available now they re not entirely sure they can take the rescheduled trip this month our biggest concern of course is what s happening now with the new variant and it s just getting a little risky i not ready to cancel or postpone pam van dyck says adding that she s waiting and watching to see what happens with the new coronavirus strain i really don t want to do that but we would i m not putting everybody at risk the discovery of the omicron variant of the coronavirus in at least a third of u s states is raising questions about whether it will be safe to travel for the upcoming holidays with christmas now less than three weeks away to try to curb the spread of the variant many countries are imposing travel restrictions and bans including the u s which has banned most non u s citizens who have recently been in any of eight southern african countries from entering the united states starting monday the biden administration is requiring all travelers coming into the u s to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within a day of their departure regardless of citizenship and vaccination status and it is extending the mask wearing mandate on board planes and inside airports into mid march such restrictions are raising concerns that there may be another slowdown in air travel hurting an industry that was just beginning to turn the corner toward recovery after having its busiest week since the pandemic began over the thanksgiving holiday period u s airlines flew about 2 4 million passengers on nov 28 that s the most since february 2020 and the industry had been preparing for a busy december too with some airlines offering employees incentive pay to work extra or not call in sick to accommodate the increase in passengers should you travel health experts say it depends experts in infectious disease and public health officials note that omicron is a variant of concern but add that there is not much known about it including its transmissibility its ability to evade the immune system and the severity of disease it causes so it s difficult to say right now if those with travel plans for christmas should instead stay home dr robert murphy a professor of infectious diseases at northwestern university s feinberg school of medicine and director of the school s institute for global health says we ll know more in a couple of weeks i think people should really get ready to hit the pause button on their travel plans he says those who are immunocompromised should definitely not travel and that includes people over 65 people who are obese people with diabetes people with underlying cancer people with any kind of immunocompromised condition i think these people should not be traveling anywhere he also recommends that people cancel or postpone their trip if they were planning to go overseas spencer platt getty images getty images united airlines planes sit at gates at newark liberty international airport in new jersey on nov 30 the united states as well as a growing list of other countries has restricted flights because of the detection of the omicron variant of the coronavirus the international traveler is at much higher risk than domestic murphy says and not just for contracting the coronavirus he says with governments worldwide closing borders and imposing new travel restrictions there s a significant risk of your flight being canceled and you getting stranded overseas or you being forced to quarantine upon arrival at your destination because of an outbreak murphy says he has canceled his own planned trip to europe over the holidays as for domestic travel for those without underlying health conditions whose flights are already booked murphy and other public health experts urge travelers to take a wait and see approach we ll know a lot more in the next two weeks murphy told npr if this comes out like we think it s going to come in other words it s just more contagious and it s not a worse disease and if you re vaccinated and boosted that if you do get infected you don t get too sick you know i think travel could be pretty safe very soon omicron s impact on airlines one more headache you didn t need the rise of the omicron variant and subsequent global travel restrictions come at a perilous time for the airlines which had been banking on a strong holiday season and a recovery in business and international travel next year to help propel the industry out of a long pandemic slump well you know it s one more headache you didn t need and you hope to avoid says robert w mann a former airline executive who now works as a consultant for the industry it s a continuation of the thing we ve seen since the beginning which was you know two steps forward one step back or sometimes two steps back mann says but you know we ll make it through this we understand how to deal with it a lot better than we did initially united airlines ceo scott kirby says he expects united to take a financial hit from the omicron coronavirus variant adding that trans atlantic flights will be most affected my guess is we ll have less flying to europe than we would have in january because of the new variant kirby told the financial times in an interview with cnbc kirby added that omicron is certainly going to have a near term impact on bookings there will be a short term dip in revenue but the dip will be smaller than it was for delta we ve always known there were going to be more variants and we ve said the covid recovery would never be a straight line kirby said adding we re much better dealing with this as a society vaccines are likely to prove effective again we look confident about the long term nothing changes about where we ll be 12 months from now industry analysts agree that the airlines appear better prepared to handle the now inevitable ups and downs that come with surges in coronavirus infections and the discovery of new variants in the past year each new variant has brought a decline in bookings but then an increase once the surge dissipates said helane becker an analyst with financial services firm cowen in an interview with the associated press the omicron variant does not appear to be biting into americans appetite to travel as domestic air travel bookings rose over the past week according to adobe digital insights which tracks flight booking data airline and travel related stocks rose monday as bookings have not fallen as sharply as expected adobe s data shows that from nov 25 through dec 1 domestic flight bookings online were up 19 compared with the week prior cyber monday saw the biggest uptick in bookings with

chicago is in the market this week with an upsized 2 2 billion refinancing under its general obligation and sales tax securitization corp credits after finalizing the results of a tender and exchange offer it s roundly about 1 billion more for the results of the tender chicago chief financial officer jennie huang bennett s office said in a statement the deal is larger to incorporate the positive results of the tender and exchange chicago launched the tender exchange offer to holders of 4 3 billion of general obligation and motor fuel tax backed bonds in november as part of a long planned 1 25 billion refinancing that was separate from an additional 1 billion in tender exchange authorization chicago through its go credit and its sales tax securitization corp will take more than 2 billion of debt to the municipal bond market this week bloomberg news the deadline to submit tender offers was friday and the city posted a notice of results and acceptance offers monday on the municipal securities rulemaking board s emma site loop capital markets llc and goldman sachs are senior managers on the refinancing and are dealer manager on the tender exchange globic advisors is the tender agent on tuesday loop priced and repriced 444 875 million of gos for the city with some concessions in the repricing with yields rising on bonds by two to five basis points bonds with a 5 coupon in 1 2024 yield 0 62 33 to refinitiv mmd 5s of 2027 at 1 05 45 5s of 2031 at 1 64 65 and 4s of 2036 at 2 01 86 bps 77 bps to mmd 4 the 10 year yield based on the preliminary pricing represents a 61 basis point spread to the aaa which compares to a 109 basis point spread on its 2020 10 year bond the deal will current refund outstanding debt and to pay a portion of the tendered bonds that s up from 224 million a tax exempt b series was set monday at 219 million based on the bonds the city has selected to exchange the stsc set up in 2017 as a higher rated bankruptcy remote vehicle to refinance outstanding go debt at greater savings will refund 377 million in a tax exempt series up from an initial estimate in the offering statement of 244 million and 1 18 billion in a taxable series up from 737 million both are selling under the stsc s second lien chicago last year conducted its first tender exchange to holders of 1 8 billion of high interest taxable bonds as part of a 1 5 billion go stsc refunding the 370 million of tendered bonds contributed 40 million to the overall 310 million of savings providing budgetary relief in 2020 and 2021 exchanges were once mostly limited to distressed borrowers looking for relief but took hold among more traditional borrowers this year and have accelerated in the latter part of the year said matt fabian partner at municipal market analytics issuers now have the advantage as they have investors attention between the use of taxable refundings and dearth of tax exempt supply fabian said investors are desperate to maintain their tax exempt bonds so will pay the added expense of engaging in the exchange just to keep their bonds over losing them to a taxable refunding it has become a full blown trend for the market it s a benefit to keep tax exempt supply for secondary trading over losing it through a taxable refunding following the 2017 tax law that eliminated advance tax exempt refundings the city will take the roughly 250 million in refunding savings upfront to help balance mayor lori lightfoot s 2021 and 2022 budgets city officials did not provide an updated savings estimate monday proceeds of the deals will refund go stsc motor fuel revenue bonds a federal tifia loan pay down tendered and exchanged bonds and capitalize interest the latter is a practice the city has used on refundings as a means to bolster upfront savings but it s frowned upon by market participants when used outside of new money deals with a project construction period and some view it as a more modest form of scoop and toss the term for the city s long running practice of rolling old debt into new bonds bennett has stressed that all maturities achieve savings and no debt is being pushed out or scooped and tossed as was a common practice on city go sales under former mayors richard m daley and rahm emanuel the latter shed the practice on go deals in his final years but early stsc deals pushed out repayment of gos with savings achieved because of the stsc s higher ratings this practice with respect to go refunding bonds ended in 2018 one year prior to target date but refinancing by sales tax securitization corporation has historically extended the maturity of the debt refunded kroll bond rating agency said in its recent report on the deals lead chicago analyst harvey zachem added that s not been the case on the 2020 refinancing and the upcoming sale they are deferring interest and if they are deferring interest how are they not slowing amortization said creditsights john ceffalio senior municipal research analyst it sounds like a form of scoop and toss he said given a lack of information investors will largely have to wait until after both sales close to accurately review their impact on the city s maturity schedules creditsights said in a report published monday on the go deal we will have to see ultimately how debt service looks after the sale compared to today to get a full understanding of the refinancing s impact said fabian who labels the use of capitalized interest in a refinancing deficit borrowing the city heads into the market on the tailwinds of near term ratings stability driven by its rising revenue picture and 1 9 billion of federal relief and a market in search of any hint of yield illinois favorable pricing results last week when its 10 year spread cut by more than 60 basis points to a 54 bp spread over the municipal market data s aaa benchmark bode well for chicago this week s aggressively successful sale by the state of illinois demonstrates the demand for incremental yield is still very strong ceffalio and patrick luby senior municipal strategist wrote friday in creditsights look ahead at the calendar this week the city captured tighter spreads than seen in a decade on its 2020 go sale the 10 year landed at a 109 basis point spread over the municipal market data s aaa benchmark compared to 169 bp spread on its 2019 issue the 10 year has sharply narrowed and is currently evaluated at a 52 bp spread the 10 year stsc bond last year landed at a 62 bp spread to the aaa compared to an 83 basis point spread on the previous deal it has since narrowed to 25 bps according to mmd the city s gos carry a bbb minus rating from fitch ratings a from kroll bond rating agency and bbb plus from s p global ratings all along with moody s investors service which rates chicago at a speculative grade and has not been asked to rate city deals for years revised the city s outlook back to stable in recent months from negative where it had been moved last year due to worries over the pandemic the stsc bonds carry aa minus ratings from fitch and s p and aa plus from kroll all outlooks are stable the bonds mature from 2024 to 2048 pledged revenues grew on average at a rate of 4 6 from 2011 to 2019 before falling to 639 million in 2020 from 714 million before the pandemic in 2019 the city expects 743 million in collections this year creditsights placed a market perform rating on chicago gos and said in a review published monday that aggressive minded investors may find a tactical opportunity for near term spread tightening of chicago s along with the market even though it doesn t view the current spreads as providing sufficient compensation for the longer term credit risks the city sought to put its best foot forward in an online investor presentation chicago is showing a strong recovery from the impacts of covid 19 and has made substantial progress on several key financial metrics the roadshow presentation says the city s balance sheet benefits from 980 million of reserves that are equate to 27 of 2020 operating revenues debt amortization will provide room for 660 million in borrowing to support the city s 1 2 billion covid recovery plan and to fund a multiyear 3 7 billion capital plan the city next year also will have moved to actuarially based contributions to all four of its pension funds under a plan to achieve 90 funded ratios by 2058 but the city s pension net pension liabilities of 33 billion and weak 23 5 funded ratio remain burdensome and leave the funds at risk in the event of poor investment returns pension pressures and the need to meet the 2023 structural target pledge to keep current ratings weigh on investors sentiments given the city will exhaust federal aid in a couple years

dwac s own initial public offering of stock said jay ritter a professor at the university of florida who is an expert on ipos under rules for these blank check companies known as special purpose acquisition companies or spacs they re not supposed to line up acquisition targets before selling their own shares senator elizabeth warren on nov 17 wrote a letter to the sec s chair gary gensler asking if the agency is exploring whether dwac had violated the law by holding such discussions and misleading potential investors by failing to inform them before its ipo asked how worried he would be about the sec s investigation if he were on the receiving end ritter said it depends on what i knew this could be innocuous or pro forma stuff or it could be really serious just what the regulators are probing is not clear what s more the regulatory rules on spac discussions with targets are gray prohibiting only substantive talks with possible acquisition targets still the trump deal stood out as unusual in many ways even before an oct 29 report from the new york times said that dwac ceo patrick orlando had met with trump and his representatives before taking dwac public blank check companies typically buy businesses with employees customers and a track record which is not the case with the trump deal several spac experts also said the three weeks it took for dwac to find and strike a deal with tmtg was unusually fast related articles twitter co founder jack dorsey stepping down as ceo dwac and tmtg did not respond to requests for comment on monday an sec spokesperson declined to comment beyond saying the sec does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation separately the financial industry regulatory authority or finra asked in late october and early november for a review of trading in dwac s stock before the oct 20 merger deal was announced that could be an indication of a search for insider trading ritter said though it s a notoriously difficult thing to prove the merger announcement sent dwac s stock surging from 9 96 to 94 20 in just two days as trump supporters and investors looking to make a fast buck piled in the shares have since pulled back to roughly 44 such a lofty price indicates high expectations for trump s media venture among at least some investors in its filing with regulators dwac also gave some financial forecasts for the company which has yet to launch but wants to build a non cancellable global community the presentation included forecasts that the company s truth social service may have 81 million users by 2026 or nearly 7 million more people than voted for trump in the last u s presidential election spacs generally are known for giving very optimistic forecasts about their future growth in presentations to investors in five years tmtg is forecast to generate nearly 3 7 billion in revenue according to the filing that is more than the annual revenue of retailer restoration hardware rv maker winnebago industries and entertainment giant iheart media which owns more than 800 radio stations for its tmtg video service that will stream non woke entertainment and news it says the monthly fee per user could be 9 in 2026 netflix in comparison got 14 49 in average revenue from its u s and canadian members during the first nine months of this year the presentation also lists the names of 30 key employees including its chief technology officer but only gives their first names and last initial the company has yet to offer many other details about its operation outside of trump being its chairman

on wall street as all about tech companies we just don t have with some exceptions but it took a 50 point range on the day to get there the session began by not following wall street until the index fell into a hole at 11am it bottomed out down 33 at lunchtime and ten minutes before the bell was up 16 the release of anz bank s job ads series for november seemed to cause the consternation with ads jumping 7 4 in the month to be a record 44 above pre pandemic levels the reopening of nsw and victoria resulted in 16 9 and 15 2 increases in ads in those states respectively anz believes a strong rebound in employment is imminent expecting the unemployment rate to fall below 5 october 5 2 in the near term and below 4 by the end of next year encouraging stuff unless you re worried about a sooner rather than later rba rate rise which it appears the market was so good news can be bad but it can also be good which seems to be the way the market interpreted it in the afternoon presumably we buy more groceries when we have a job so consumer staples helped drive the index yesterday with a 1 9 gain after falling all last week this was nevertheless with a bit of help from metcash mts

night sending our futures up 29 points this morning buy first thus far it does not look like there s a great degree of severity to it but we have really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe or it really doesn t cause any severe illness comparable to delta wall street only heard the first line of what dr fauci told cnn on sunday night regarding omicron before deciding to buy first and worry about being careful later the reversal from friday night s selling was swift but while the faamgs were back in favour it was not a mirror reversal of the rapid tech de rating seen on friday with chip stocks in particular hit again as they continue to drop off after spectacular 2021 rallies rather it was industrials leading the charge the dow was up almost 800 points earlier in the session the venerable doctor s words were positive for the banks and energy in particular in the latter case riding a 5 bounce in oil prices but it were the travel names that really stood out with their share price jumps having been abandoned two weeks ago when omicron was revealed reports from south africa show that while the virus is rapidly spreading hospitalisations aren t that s all wall street needed to know in the meantime the mayor of new york city announced that by later this month all private sector employers will have to mandate vaccinations for their workers there was good news out of china or bad if one assesses the reasons the pboc has cut chinese bank reserve requirements freeing banks up to lend more money but evergrande has warned what everyone suspected that it may not be able to repay its creditors its share price fell 20 we might recall shares of moderna leapt 20 the day omicron was revealed last night they fell

president trump and president vladimir putin of russia made a series of questionable claims at a news conference following their summit meeting in helsinki on july 16 trump was asked whether he believed the u s intelligence community s assessment that russia interfered in the presidential election in 2016 or whether he believed putin s denials remarkably trump said he had confidence in both parties this prompted a statement from daniel coats the president s director of national intelligence we have been clear in our assessments of russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy coats said trump s claim wasn t the only one worth fact checking from his news conference with putin we rounded up several more from both presidents advertisement trump my people came to me dan coats came to me and some others they said they think it s russia i have president putin he just said it s not russia i will say this i don t see any reason why it would be i have confidence in both parties i have great confidence in my intelligence people but i will tell you that president putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today putin president trump mentioned the issue of the so called interference of russia with the american elections and i had to reiterate things i said several times including during our personal contacts that the russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal american affairs including election process overwhelming evidence shows that russia orchestrated a campaign of cyberespionage and propaganda to interfere in the u s presidential election in 2016 the u s intelligence community the department of justice and the house and senate intelligence committees have all arrived at this conclusion three days before trump and putin s summit a grand jury convened by special counsel robert s mueller iii indicted 12 russian intelligence officers working for a military agency known as the gru the mueller indictment describes in granular detail how the gru officers used phishing techniques in 2016 to hack into the computer networks of hillary clinton s campaign the democratic national committee and the democratic congressional campaign committee the russian intelligence officers allegedly stole documents from these democratic committees and strategically released them in the run up to the election through a website they set up called dcleaks through a fictitious hacker persona they dubbed guccifer 2 0 and through an organization not named in the indictment but widely reported to be wikileaks advertisement in one instance the russian officers hacked the website of a state board of elections and stole information related to approximately 500 000 voters including names addresses partial social security numbers dates of birth and driver s license numbers the indictment alleges putin s goal was to help trump win according to the u s intelligence community s assessment from january 2017 putin and the russian government aspired to help president elect trump s election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him the assessment says all three agencies agree with this judgment cia and fbi have high confidence in this judgment nsa has moderate confidence the senate intelligence committee found that the january 2017 assessment by the u s intelligence agencies relies on public russian leadership commentary russian state media reports public examples of where russian interests would have aligned with candidates policy statements and a body of intelligence reporting to support the assessment that putin and the russian government developed a clear preference for trump advertisement the senate intelligence committee said it concurs with intelligence and open source assessments that this influence campaign was approved by president putin asked whether he preferred trump over clinton in 2016 putin said in helsinki yes i did yes i did because he talked about bringing the u s russia relationship back to normal shortly after putin claimed that the russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal american affairs the justice department announced it had charged a 29 year old russian citizen in the united states with conspiring to infiltrate organizations active in u s politics in an effort to advance the interests of the russian federation without prior notification to the attorney general these charges don t stem from mueller s investigation but the defendant maria butina is accused of secretly working as an agent of the russian government as she sought to influence u s politics the lesson here is that there s a mountain of evidence contradicting putin s claims of no interference at all in american politics fresh evidence emerged the same day as this news conference advertisement u s intelligence agencies and lawmakers from both parties say they believe russia is planning to meddle in this year s midterm elections russia like its soviet predecessor has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on u s presidential elections that have used intelligence officers and agents and press placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to the kremlin according to the u s intelligence community assessment from 2017 the role of the intelligence community is to provide the best information and fact based assessments possible for the president and policymakers coats said in a statement july 16 after trump s remarks in helsinki we have been clear in our assessments of russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security trump there was no collusion at all everybody knows it and people are being brought out to the fore so far that i know virtually none of it related to the campaign and they re going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign putin could you name a single fact that would definitely prove the collusion this is utter nonsense just like the president recently mentioned mueller s investigation is ongoing it s too early to say whether he has found or will find any evidence of cooperation between russia and trump s presidential campaign advertisement reporters have pieced together a series of contacts between russian individuals and trump campaign advisers on june 3 2016 a music publicist named rob goldstone emailed donald trump jr offering very high level and sensitive information that could incriminate hillary goldstone described this as part of russia and its government s support for mr trump trump jr responded if it s what you say i love it especially later in the summer goldstone set up a meeting with a russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya on june 9 2016 the meeting at trump tower with veselnitskaya included trump jr trump son in law jared kushner and trump s then campaign chairman paul manafort among others veselnitskaya said she went to the new york meeting to show trump campaign officials that major democratic donors had evaded u s taxes and to lobby against the so called magnitsky law that punishes russian officials for the murder of a russian tax accountant who accused the kremlin of corruption according to bloomberg news advertisement veselnitskaya also said trump jr requested financial documents showing that money that allegedly evaded u s taxes had gone to clinton s campaign bloomberg reported she didn t have any and described the 20 minute meeting as a failure a memo she reportedly brought to the trump tower meeting was a close match with a document russian prosecutors had written two months earlier and shared with a u s congressman this raises the possibility that veselnitskaya was acting as an agent of the russian government at the trump tower encounter share this article share the memo natalia veselnitskaya provided to the trump campaign last year focused on banker turned human rights activist bill browder whose reputation has become inextricably linked to the global human rights campaign he launched in 2009 after tax lawyer sergei magnitsky died in a russian prison business insider reported magnitsky was thrown in jail and beaten to death after he discovered a 230 million tax fraud scheme that implicated high level kremlin officials browder says the us passed the magnitsky act in 2012 that sanctioned high level russian officials accused of human rights abuses and corruption advertisement it s noteworthy that putin at the helsinki news conference with trump brought up the same browder magnitsky situation we can bring up the mr browder in this particular case putin said business associates of mr browder have earned over 1 5 billion in russia they never paid any taxes neither in russia nor in the united states and yet the money escaped the country they were transferred to the united states they sent huge amount of money 400 million as a contribution to the campaign of hillary clinton well that s the personal case it might have been legal the contribution itself but the way the money was earned was illegal there s no evidence that browder or his associates contributed 400 million to clinton s campaign in 2017 browder testified before the senate judiciary committee that from 1996 to 2005 his firm hermitage capital was one of the largest investment advisers in russia with more than 4 billion invested in russian stocks his investment firm named and shamed oligarchs who stole from shareholders an effort browder said that putin initially supported that changed in 2003 he testified and browder was expelled from russia just over two years later advertisement after the falling out with putin browder hired magnitsky a russian tax accountant to investigate a suspected theft from his russian companies magnitsky was arrested and died in prison in 2009 under suspicious circumstances browder s advocacy of magnitsky s case led congress to pass the 2012 magnitsky act which bars russian officials believed to be involved in the accountant s death from entering the united states or using its banking system in response russia blocked u s parents from adopting russian children since then the kremlin has gone to great lengths to discredit browder in 2013 a russian court sentenced him in absentia to nine years in prison for failing to pay 500 million in taxes he was put on trial in absentia again in 2017 putin said the united states should help russia investigate browder but he renounced his u s citizenship and resides in london we previously drew up a list of all known contacts between russians and trump campaign advisers several trump advisers met with the russian ambassador sergey kislyak during the campaign including michael flynn who later resigned as trump s national security adviser for failing to fully disclose those contacts to vice president pence trump campaign adviser george papadopoulos pleaded guilty on oct 5 2017 to lying to federal agents about his contacts with people with connections to the russian government during the campaign the washington post reported that manafort during the campaign offered to provide briefings on the race to a russian billionaire closely aligned with the kremlin oleg deripaska the house intelligence committee s republican majority released a report that found no evidence of collusion between russia and the trump campaign but the report said investigations by other committees the special counsel the media or interest groups will continue and may find facts that were not readily accessible to the committee or outside the scope of our investigation democrats on the panel strongly disagreed with the majority report s conclusions noting that there were many documented contacts between trump campaign officials and russian individuals during the campaign putin the concord company that was brought up is being accused it s been accused of interference but this company does not constitute the russian state it does not represent the russian state we are now talking about private individuals not about particular states before mueller s grand jury indicted the 12 russian intelligence officers working directly for putin s government it indicted several russian individuals working for a troll farm called the internet research agency two russian companies called concord catering and concord management and consulting provided the internet research agency with millions of dollars to buy digital ads and to pump pro trump and anti clinton messaging into the u s ecosystem in 2016 mueller s indictment alleges among those indicted was yevgeniy viktorovich prigozhin one of the richest men in russia prigozhin controlled the two concord companies that funded the troll farm and directed its work mueller alleged he is a caterer who has been nicknamed putin s chef because of his close ties to russian president vladimir putin the post reported the new york times reported that prigozhin has received contracts from the russian government worth 3 1 billion over the past five years citing research by the anti corruption foundation a group set up by russian opposition leader alexei navalny the u s treasury department in 2016 imposed sanctions on prigozhin and concord over russia s occupation of crimea and military actions in ukraine and then imposed more sanctions in march based on malicious cyber enabled activities prigozhin has extensive business dealings with the russian federation ministry of defense and a company with significant ties to him holds a contract to build a military base near the russian federation border with ukraine the treasury department said in 2016 when it announced prigozhin s ukraine related sanctions russia has been building additional military bases near the ukrainian border and has used these bases as staging points for deploying soldiers into ukraine in helsinki putin said concord did not represent or constitute the russian state but the indictment leaves open the possibility that russian government officials contributed to the internet research agency s efforts it says the named defendants worked together with others known and unknown to the grand jury moscow s influence campaign followed a russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations such as cyber activity with overt efforts by russian government agencies state funded media third party intermediaries and paid social media users or trolls according to the january 2017 assessment by the u s intelligence community trump why was the fbi told to leave the office of the democratic national committee i ve been wondering that i ve been asking that for months and months and i ve been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media where is the server what happened to the servers of the pakistani gentleman that worked on the dnc i have confidence in both parties i really believe that this will probably go on for a while but i don t think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server putin i d like to add something to this after all i was an intelligence officer myself and i do know how dossiers are made up there s disagreement whether the fbi requested access to the dnc s servers former fbi director james b comey testified to the senate intelligence committee that the fbi made multiple requests at different levels to access dnc s servers but the dnc said the fbi never requested access the dnc ultimately allowed crowdstrike a private company to review its database and share findings with the fbi which comey testified was an appropriate substitute cybersecurity expert thomas rid said that handing over the server as trump described could have destroyed evidence what they need to see is how the traffic moves said rid a professor at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies if investigators were surveilling a house rid said they would want to know who goes in and out the same is true of investigating server traffic he added having the physical object whether a house or a server is not nearly as helpful as knowing who goes in and out rid said the pakistani gentleman trump referenced is imran awan a naturalized u s citizen and former it specialist on capitol hill awan and four others were banned from the house network after being accused of violating security protocols in february 2017 this investigation provided fodder for several conspiracy theories on right wing media trump previously attempted to tie the hacking of the dnc server to awan not russia on july 3 awan pleaded guilty to making a false statement on a bank loan application the plea deal had nothing to do with his work on capitol hill but federal prosecutors included an unusual passage that debunked several conspiracy theories about awan s work prosecutors said they found no evidence awan engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving house computers systems the u s attorney s office that shot down these theories is led by jessie k liu a trump nominee trump what happened to hillary clinton s emails thirty three thousand emails gone just gone i think in russia they wouldn t be gone so easily i think it s a disgrace that we can t get hillary clinton s 33 000 emails there s no evidence clinton deleted these 33 000 emails in anticipation of receiving a subpoena and comey has said the fbi s investigation found no evidence that any work related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them clinton s staff had requested that these emails be deleted months before they received a subpoena according to the fbi s july 2016 statement the fbi concluded that clinton was extremely careless in her handling of classified information but that she did not intend to violate any laws in looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts comey said in july 2016 putin i did hear these rumors that we allegedly collected compromising material on mr trump when he was visiting moscow well distinguished colleague let me tell you this when president trump was at moscow back then i didn t even know that he was in moscow i treat president trump with utmost respect but back then when he was a private individual a businessman nobody informed me that he was in moscow trump it would have been out long ago this is most probably a reference to the steele dossier which included several scandalous and unsubstantiated allegations linking trump to bribery and prostitutes in russia putin was asked in helsinki whether he had any compromising material involving trump he didn t specifically deny it putin said he didn t even know trump was in moscow in 2013 however russian government officials including putin s top spokesman knew trump was in moscow in november 2013 to host the miss universe pageant and were told about the real estate developer s eagerness to meet with putin while he was there according to people familiar with the conversations who have recounted them to congressional investigators the washington post s rosalind s helderman reported russia is known to collect information on foreign government officials and business leaders through surveillance at hotels and other locations according to the post trump sought a meeting with putin in 2013 only to be told the russian president was too busy receiving the dutch king helderman reported send us facts

standing in the crumbling foundations of the long gone st joseph mission church one can almost imagine hymns being sung fervently if a little out of tune by the immigrant farmers gathered in the tiny church atop a steep hill just over the county line into holmes county standing at the head of the congregation was a man destined to inspire a great american novel jean baptiste lamy was born in the auvergne region of southern france in 1814 deeply religious he felt a call to the ministry and was ordained as a priest at the age of 24 but lamy was not content to do small things when there was bold work that needed done at the age of 25 he left europe to become a missionary on the american frontier the diocese of cincinnati had a perfect assignment for father lamy when he arrived in 1839 the second oldest catholic church in ohio was in need of a priest that church st luke s had been established in danville in 1822 shortly after the community changed its name to that from the original sapp s settlement the original church was a log cabin and they didn t have a priest in 1838 the church members started work on a frame church but work was slow with the arrival of father lamy that changed young energetic and industrious lamy rose the money and labor needed to finish the new st luke s in danville and was soon handling services on a circuit that included loudonville coshocton newark and mount vernon as well one area that father lamy identified as needing pastoring was the influx of german and alsatian settlers in southwest holmes county between glenmont and greer it was hardly choice land all the prime farm land of the county having been claimed earlier but those settlers were hearty stock and they were determined to eke a living from the steep hills father lamy built a mission church st joseph s at the top of the first large hill over the county line to find what remains of the mission go south out of greer on brinkhaven road county road 77 but instead of turning with the road to cross the mohican river go straight on alum rock road and cross the county line from knox into holmes just a short way in there is an intersection with township road 16 we ll come back to this intersection for another story in the future but for now plunge up the steep hillside on the gravel road and watch for washouts near the top of kaylor ridge township road 15 will go off to the left but stay with township road 16 for another quarter mile or so when the remains of the st joseph mission are indicated by a church historical marker on the right father lamy s church was small the foundation rocks outline a main chamber that could have held at most about 50 people further away from the road is a smaller rectangle attached to the main rectangle it isn t clear what the structure of the building would have been so the small area is uncertain if the church would have presumably faced the road the entrance would have been on the north end of the precisely aligned building if the entrance was here those leaving the church may have once had a beautiful view down the gully across the road now wooded the hillside doesn t boast any outstandingly old trees so it may have been pasture land cleared by the early farmers in this layout the smaller rectangle may have been a sacristy where father lamy kept his robes for services he certainly wouldn t have traveled in full priestly garb across the muddy frontier less likely though not impossible is that the small rectangle was a vestibule for an entrance on the south side of the church this would seem odd though putting the main entrance of the church away from the road and what s more opening the church into its own graveyard the graveyard is documented on genealogical sources as having at least nine burials but there are plainly more the recorded burials may be the ones for which sandstone grave markers were carved many of those have now become illegible or have been broken off over the years at least a dozen or more additional graves are marked by field stones and depressions in the ground suggest that dozens more people are buried here one early record describes the church as having been built out of logs presumably perched atop the stone foundation it probably had at least a few small windows for comparison there is an old log cabin in a remarkable state of preservation down the hill on county road 17 alum rock road that dates from the same period indeed whatever alsatian family lived in that cabin almost certainly attended this church the mission operated throughout the 1840s ministering to the farmers along and around kaylor ridge at its height the church saw a total of about 50 families in the area who at least occasionally attended some of them never missed a service according to records kept by the columbus diocese st joseph s saw its peak activity in the late 1840s there were four baptisms in 1845 with six each the following two years the peak came in 1848 with a grand total of 10 baptisms and two marriages father lamy continued his rounds throughout the region working as the catholic version of a circuit preacher hitting the st joseph mission for mass on the first monday of every month then he was reassigned to an area in kentucky that needed organization which he proving so brilliant at little did he know it but his industry was much talked about in the church and word gradually made it to the top lamy was stunned in 1850 when he received word that pope pius ix had personally appointed him bishop for a mission in the far southwestern region of new mexico which had just come into the united states after the mexican war while there were a few haphazard churches in the region lamy was charged with expanding the network standardizing their operations and cleaning up some of the churches that had gotten a little wayward allowing priests to have native concubines and such lamy was to be joined in his assignment by his friend father joseph machebeuf the priest overseeing the church in sandusky infamous for tracking parishioners down to bars and flogging them with a whip for drinking both were regarded as outstanding missionaries and disciplinarians whose talents were needed out west lamy was able to leave more quickly and began a flatboat expedition down the ohio and mississippi rivers his flatboat wrecked destroying most of lamy s goods and supplies but he persevered and made his way overland to santa fe over the next three decades lamy and machebeuf established and expanded the catholic church in the southwest with lamy serving as bishop of santa fe and later archbishop of the entire region machebeuf became bishop of denver lamy never wavered in his fighting against chaos and unorthodoxy becoming one of the great organizers of the church in the united states he retired in the early 1880s dying in 1885 but perhaps the reason lamy is still so remembered and revered today is because the great american writer willa cather famous for my antonia and o pioneers decided to write a novel based on lamy s adventures in the southwest this 1927 book death comes for the archbishop is regarded as cather s masterpiece and one of the greatest american novels in cather s book lamy becomes father latour while machebeuf is called father vaillant the book has been named by the modern library as one of the 100 best english language novels of the 20th century the mission church on kaylor ridge continued on a few years without father lamy at first seemingly thriving under lamy s german successor father christopher grandeler grandeler pointed out that the german settlers were grateful to have a priest fluent in both german and english both difficult tongues for father lamy but grandeler an older priest serving the missionary call began to complain about what the ohio winter did to his rheumatism and even went so far as buying a plot of land assuming the church would allow him to become permanently attached to the st joseph mission the church allowed no such thing as a small congregation of dirt poor farmers was in no way adequate to support a full time priest grandeler soon began to rub his bosses even further the wrong way being seen in the constant company of a woman during a business trip to cincinnati and being heard in newark making statements that he didn t see much difference between protestants and catholics father grandeler was removed and the mission began to falter in 1857 a substantial new stone catholic church was built in glenmont at the foot of the far side of the ridge that congregation the church of saints peter paul is still in operation today the st joseph mission began to wind down its last paperwork records were filed in 1861 in the chaos of the civil war diocese records were haphazard in 1862 and 63 by 1864 no records were filed today the catholic churches of the region still thrive thanks at least in part to the vigorous foundation father lamy laid down before pursuing his destiny in the old west death came for the archbishop later but it was preceded by a lot of living in rural central ohio first

always watch this space view this post on instagram a post shared by milk jawn milkjawn yo isn t ice cream kind of a warm weather jawn so it isn t like partners amy wilson ryan miller and catheryn sanderson are planning on opening the new brick and mortar location of their beloved delivery pop up ice cream operation milk jawn in the middle of winter but they did announce it to the world late last week the new permanent physical space a first for milk jawn will be a 500 square foot storefront at 1439 east passyunk avenue right at passyunk and dickinson there they ll be selling their small batch premium local milk ice cream in cups pints cones and with any luck as ice cream cakes starting in the spring of 2022 which is nothing but good but the real news here the milk jawn crew also picked up the space at 1303 east passyunk and that one is a little bit bigger it s 2 600 square feet and it will become home to milk jawn s new production facility something of a step up from amy wilson s kitchen where this all started back in 2012 seriously for the longest time the biggest problem for milk jawn has been the fact that they sell out everywhere every time they show up somewhere with some ice cream to sell gone immediately every time they come up with some new flavor and talk about it on instagram gone they ve been doing their best to keep up with demand working out of maken studios in kensington but now that they ll have their own space for churning out their lemon curd with blueberry basil swirl malted milk toffee crunch and mango sticky rice flavored ice cream well they ll still probably sell out every day but at least we all might have a better chance at getting a taste come spring view this post on instagram a post shared by wilson s live music

kitchen knocking out a menu of new orleans influenced southern cuisine that means oysters and shrimp cocktails oxtail mac and cheese fried chicken crabcake egg rolls and the aforementioned lobster gumbo last time we talked about milligan he was back from a stint cooking on the west coast running a series of pop up dinners hoping to bring attention to creating equal opportunity in the food service industry working at the bercy and stove tap which i loved and developing a restaurant concept of his own called greenwood a two restaurant supper club made by and for people of color originally planned for a 2021 debut the actual brick and mortar part of greenwood has been delayed but it currently exists as a pop up concept in the meantime milligan has the kitchen at wilson s to

all had a good laugh remembering the brief surreal life of mad rex back then i told you about a bunch of madcaps who d taken on the herculean task of scrubbing all the weird out of that massive space at 1000 frankford avenue and turning it into a proper restaurant you know one without vr headsets or assault rifles on the walls i didn t have a lot of details then but i do have a few more now for starters the place is going to be opening this week on thursday december 9th to be exact they re running with a fish house concept a nice touch for fishtown and needed in a completely un ironic way have chef valentin bay in the galley ex of brauhaus schmitz and a whole crew of fish freaks who ll be sourcing and prepping a surf and turf menu focused on easy approachable and occasionally surprising grub think shrimp and grits a surf and turf charcuterie board featuring smoked and dried meats and seafood bison tartare with ossetra caviar crab bisque swordfish steaks rockfish stuffed with mint crabcake sandwiches and filet mignon the space is huge 200 plus seats once they hauled away the helicopter and dismantled the vr lounge the bar is impressive there s a full on ice bar for serving crab legs and oysters and the biggest tv that any philly restaurant has ever seen seriously the thing is 25 feet long the team is looking to make this place not just a destination restaurant for seafood in a city that really needs some more places like that but also for wine and cocktails they re shooting for the moon here and i m really hoping for the best over at forsythia chris kearse is doing sunday night prix fixe dinners for the neighbors 55 gets you five courses of french inspired cuisine from one of the best chefs in the city we re talking andouille and garlic beignets escargot mahi mahi with white bean cassoulet caramel pot du crème and an optional add on course of pumpkin campanelle with duck heart ragu for an additional 20 it s a great deal and looks like a

distracted by everything shiny and new reservations are available here get em while they re hot view this post on instagram a post shared by true blue bakery truebluebakery a while back i told y all about a real australian bakery called true blue they made a name for themselves out in west chester doing pies pasties and sausage rolls but were packing up their mixers and bowls and heading to a new home in royersford i ve been keeping an eye on the place mostly because i like to know the location of all the closest sausage rolls and meat pies no matter where i am in the world and am pleased to announce that they officially opened for business on saturday december 4th at 324 main street in royersford i am somewhat less pleased to announce that they were closed again by around 3 30 p m that very same day not for any tragic or terrible reason but just because demand was so great that they sold out of literally everything they had stocked for the weekend within the first few hours and because everything in the shop is made from scratch they needed to shut down for a couple days just to you know make more food right now they re hoping to re open again on tuesday with some fresh stock if you re looking to get your hands on some aussie meat pies mustard dogs or pasties i d think about grabbing a sleeping bag and camping out view this post on instagram a post shared by a dash

for outdoor dining under the stars they each seat up to eight people keep you safe from the winter cold and offer excellent views of the 16 foot christmas tree right outside the restaurant granted i

prickly but for those of you just slightly more social you can contact the restaurant to make your reservations there are four igloos available now and more being added in the coming weeks view this

idiots the number of times people try to bribe their way into hsl at least twice a week how much money they offer in some cases a lot how often it works never and how he s shutting the place down again for the holidays yeah you read that right december 18th is going to be hop sing s last night of service for the year he wants his staff to be able to spend time with their families over the holidays so he s closing up shop again as for a re opening date lé was cagey he said they ve been turning away more people than they serve every night doing good business and doing their very best to keep everyone staff and guests safe by limiting seating and requiring vax cards at the door no exceptions but he still wasn t entirely sure what was going to be happening in 2022 except to say that if he did decide to re open he would be doing things the same way in terms of distancing proof of vax etc and he ll continue that way until the pandemic is done so anyway for those of you looking for a last pre christmas shot at hop sing s cocktails and hospitality the 18th is your last chance show up early be polite and don t forget that proof of vaccination card and as soon as i hear what lé s

parts will be moving into the former pride mobility plant on susquehanna avenue over the next three months powerrail led by 63 year old president ceo paul foster was formed in 2003 after foster left a high level position with general electric the company initially worked out of the city of wilkes barre for three years before settling in on over seven acres of land working out of multiple buildings in duryea in 2006 starting in duryea with one building foster gradually purchased surrounding dissolving companies buildings three in total over time with the company growing not only nationally but also internationally and space becoming a premium it was time to look for a bigger facility related video we started growing and growing and growing and i have some other locations throughout the

executives from duryea i think it s a wonderful opportunity for exeter borough denise adams exeter borough mayor said when they get this building up and running they plan on adding additional employees which will be great for our area paul foster is wonderful and he s already building relationships with surrounding businesses having powerrail in exeter will be a tremendous asset powerrail s growth over the years the business model when i moved to duryea was totally different than what i have now when we moved to duryea we were just a distributor and a small remanufacturer today we are manufacturing new and have remanufacturing facilities all over the country and parts distribution globally foster said his parts exports business used to be approximately 5 and now it s up to 35 there are many companies in the world that either specialize in locomotive parts manufacturing or electrical or distribution butch gaudet vp of engineering said we are unique in the field we do it all guadet who also oversees all production is confident they are the only company in the world that is a one stop shop in the locomotive industry powerrail has facilities in pennsylvania delaware georgia and indiana as well as europe and australia employing a total of 152 employees 80 of which work out of duryea according to deborah crockett powerrail corporate human resources manager the numbers of employees will grow significantly over time we are going to need welders machinists warehouse personnel production assembly people and more crockett said we will start putting out wanted ads sometime after the first of the new year before a substantial number of employees can be hired powerrail will be looking to remodel the entire facility with the exception of the warehouse area over the next few months a major overhauling of the former pride offices will be demolished to make way for a new floor plan suited for powerrail we re going to be tearing out a lot in the office areas foster said on remodeling the former pride building right now our offices are cramped and i have my engineer staff across the street i have my accountant in another building and i have people in avoca so now we will all be together foster said most of his current buildings lack proper heat and have no air conditioning but the new facility will have adequate heating and cooling powerrail an employee stock ownership plan esop company sold 30 of the company to the employees in recent times making my company an esop company was the best thing i ever did foster admitted it makes my employees happy and everyone is heavily involved with the company making suggestions cutting costs etc i took some of my key guys and made them partners in the business as well the future of powerrail manufacturing or remanufacturing dated locomotive parts from the 1940s and later is where powerrail excels they take an old existing part and make it better according to butch gaudet but foster believes the future in locomotives is battery power we are going to be involved in building the first battery operated locomotive in the world foster said we are not going to manufacture the locomotive but we will be a subcontractor foster said the basic build of the new locomotives would be the same with the biggest difference in cutting out fossil fuels one program that foster is looking forward to is forming a partnership with wyoming area school district since his new property line backs up to the wyoming area secondary center the school is right next door and i d like to set up a work study program with high school students to learn a trade in our industry foster expressed my vision is to set up some type of classroom and even pay the kids to go to class there will be a lot of activity at the susquehanna avenue location in the next three months including moving powerrail s caboose parked at the duryea facility to its new home in exeter deborah crockett said there will be an official grand opening ceremony and other activities slated at the completion of the move and remodeling late spring 2022

wealth creation it gives you a view of your expenditures the things you can cut to increase your savings to maintain a feasible budget it is advisable to create a new one every month can you imagine a sailor without a compass that s what a person who spends their money without a budget is like such a person will likely eventually suffer a devastating financial crash one of the most popular and effective budgeting techniques is the 50 30 20 rule this method suggests that 50 of your income goes to essentials like food rent and healthcare thirty percent goes to nonessentials such as shopping and luxury activities the remaining 20 is the most important allocation which should go to savings 5 start an emergency fund emergency funds prepare you for unexpected events like losing a job such occurrences can disorient your wealth building without emergency funds two common outcomes are selling the investment or incurring debts if you incur debts your wealth starts diminishing also you ll have to pay interest for the debt if you sell your investment you lose the capital and interest you would otherwise earn so to avoid such scenarios build an emergency fund as your backup money to

start by paying off high interest debt so you can save money and start building wealth 7 live below your means overspending can dramatically impact your ability to build wealth cut spending on

diversify your equities that means you can focus your investment on specific etfs like emerging markets developed markets or american markets even though stocks are much riskier compared to other assets they have the best return on investment with a well informed diversification strategy you can lower the risks and maximize the returns 9 invest in real estate investing in real estate investment trusts gives you a chance to profit from the real estate industry without direct involvement reits are essentially real estate company stocks involved in buying and selling properties

islamabad the attorney general of pakistan has assured the federal shariat court that the government as well as parliament are fully committed and bound to ensure that all laws are consistent with and brought in conformity with the injunctions of islam as laid down in the holy quran and sunnah in the riba case ag khalid javed khan in his submissions said that a comprehensive exercise has already been undertaken by different institutions of the state for bringing banking and the financial system of pakistan in conformity with the injunctions of islam it needs to be emphasized that through legislative and executive measures a robust interest free banking sector has developed in the country and is successfully providing services to the people the attorney general said adding banking in the islamic mode now accounts for approximately 17 of the country s overall banking system in terms of assets while in terms of deposits the share is approximately 18 3 as of december 2020 he said that currently 22 islamic banking institutions with five full fledged islamic banks and 17 conventional banks having islamic banking branches are providing an array of shariah compliant products and services through their network of 3 456 branches along with 1 683 windows at islamic banking counters at conventional branches across the country this he said is an ongoing process and is fully consistent with the transformation of the banking sector from the conventional to islamic mode without creating any schism in the financial sector which is inextricably linked with the global financial market he said that given the success and attractions of banking and financing in the islamic mode islamic banking and financing is being adopted in many countries other than muslim countries as is evident from developments in canada and other western countries after the 2008 global financial crisis the western world observed the resilience the islamic banking sector had shown by proving itself as a safer alternative compared to the western banking system since then islamic banking has spread to europe north america and africa islamic banks are in operation in countries such as denmark france luxembourg nigeria south africa germany switzerland and the united kingdom the ag in his written submission before the fsc stated the attorney general wants the federal shariat court to show judicial restraint in the case arguing as parliament the executive and other institutions of the state are actively engaged in the process of discharging the obligation to bring the laws of the country including banking and financial laws in conformity with the injunctions of islam it is humbly submitted that without prejudice to the question of jurisdiction of this honorable court this calls for judicial restraint by this honorable court given the fact that the question is not whether laws have to be brought in conformity with the injunctions of islam but how best to achieve this highly desirable constitutional mandate the attorney general sought from the fsc the disposal of the riba petitions suggesting that it should be left to the democratic process including parliament and other institutions to expeditiously fulfill and achieve the constitutional mandate as enshrined in article 227 of the constitution of pakistan to bring all laws in conformity with the injunctions of islam

devin nunes decision comes at a time when his political future in california appeared in possible jeopardy due to redistricting washington california republican rep devin nunes who was one of former president donald trump s most ardent loyalists in congress is leaving the house at the end of this year to join trump s fledgling media company a statement monday from the trump media technology group said nunes would serve as chief executive officer beginning in january 2022 the company is preparing to launch a social media platform intended to rival competitors including twitter which blocked trump s account in january following the deadly storming of the u s capitol in june facebook suspended trump s accounts for two years following a finding that he stoked violence ahead of the jan 6 insurrection devin understands that we must stop the liberal media and big tech from destroying the freedoms that make america great trump said in a statement nunes decision comes at a time when his political future in california appeared in possible jeopardy draft maps released in the once a decade realignment of congressional districts suggested he would face a challenging reelection in the 2022 midterms those maps will not be finalized until later this month nunes 48 said in a statement the time has come to reopen the internet and allow for the free flow of ideas and expression without censorship the united states of america made the dream of the internet a reality and it will be an american company that restores the dream trump s decision to select one of his most pugilistic defenders to oversee his new media group instead of a seasoned business leader makes clear that he intends to use the company for political benefit as much as for profit trump announced the launch of his media company in october the company says its plans include the creation of truth social a twitter style social media app as well as a subscription based video streaming service that will feature entertainment programming news and podcasts trump is listed as the company s chair trump s media company and digital world acquisition announced over the weekend they had agreements for 1 billion in capital from institutional investors the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority are looking into the deal digital world acquisition corp launched on the u s stock market three weeks earlier with the sole purpose of finding a privately held company to buy nunes is the top republican on the house intelligence committee and was the panel s chairman before democrats won the majority in 2018 he launched the committee s investigation into trump s ties to russia along with california rep adam schiff the top democrat on the panel who is now its chairman soon after they announced the probe though nunes became one of trump s most forceful defenders in congress in early 2017 he visited the white house reviewed documents there and then held a press conference saying that communications involving trump associates had been swept up by u s spy agencies and were mishandled by former president barack obama s administration after an uproar the house ethics committee said it would investigate the visit and determine whether he had leaked classified information related articles trump asks us judge to force twitter to restore his account the ethics panel cleared nunes a year later but nunes had already recused himself from the russia probe after a contentious investigation that democrats claimed was biased in trump s favor the intelligence committee found that russia interfered in the election but that there was no evidence of coordination between trump s campaign and russia nunes was also in the spotlight as he ardently defended trump through democrats 2019 impeachment inquiry which was led by schiff and the intelligence panel in early 2021 two days before the jan 6 capitol insurrection trump awarded nunes the presidential medal of freedom in a statement the white house credited nunes with uncovering the greatest scandal in american history referencing nunes efforts to discredit the russia investigation
the company partnering with trump media technology group acknowledged the inquiries in a filing it made with regulators on monday new york regulators are looking into the deal that would bring donald trump s new social media company to the stock market one that has attracted both legions of fans of the former president and people looking to make a quick profit the company partnering with trump media technology group acknowledged the inquiries in a filing it made with regulators on monday it also gave some financial forecasts for the company which wants to rival twitter and other platforms that banned trump after the jan 6 capitol riots along with netflix and other streaming video services it said over the weekend that it s lined up 1 billion in investments from a group of unnamed institutional investors separately trump media announced that rep devin nunes a republican from california will leave congress to become the company s chief executive in january nunes the former chair of the house intelligence committee was an ardent backer of trump s during probes into russian interference in the 2016 election and the president s 2019 impeachment by the democratic led house the regulatory scrutiny is focused on the october announcement by trump s media venture that it would merge with digital world acquisition corp that company had launched on the u s stock market three weeks earlier with the sole purpose of finding a privately held company to buy it s often referred to by its trading symbol of dwac dwac said monday that it is cooperating with the preliminary fact finding inquiries by the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority the sec early last month requested documents related to meetings of dwac s board and communications between dwac and trump s media venture among other things according to dwac the sec s request said the commission s investigation does not mean that the sec has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the sec has a negative opinion of dwac or any person event or security the sec could be looking at whether dwac and trump s company had any conversations about a deal before dwac s own initial public offering of stock said jay ritter a professor at the university of florida who is an expert on ipos under rules for these blank check companies known as special purpose acquisition companies or spacs they re not supposed to line up acquisition targets before selling their own shares senator elizabeth warren on nov 17 wrote a letter to the sec s chair gary gensler asking if the agency is exploring whether dwac had violated the law by holding such discussions and misleading potential investors by failing to inform them before its ipo asked how worried he would be about the sec s investigation if he were on the receiving end ritter said it depends on what i knew this could be innocuous or pro forma stuff or it could be really serious just what the regulators are probing is not clear what s more the regulatory rules on spac discussions with targets are gray prohibiting only substantive talks with possible acquisition targets still the trump deal stood out as unusual in many ways even before an oct 29 report from the new york times said that dwac ceo patrick orlando had met with trump and his representatives before taking dwac public blank check companies typically buy businesses with employees customers and a track record which is not the case with the trump deal several spac experts also said the three weeks it took for dwac to find and strike a deal with tmtg was unusually fast related articles twitter co founder jack dorsey stepping down as ceo dwac and tmtg did not respond to requests for comment on monday an sec spokesperson declined to comment beyond saying the sec does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation separately the financial industry regulatory authority or finra asked in late october and early november for a review of trading in dwac s stock before the oct 20 merger deal was announced that could be an indication of a search for insider trading ritter said though it s a notoriously difficult thing to prove the merger announcement sent dwac s stock surging from 9 96 to 94 20 in just two days as trump supporters and investors looking to make a fast buck piled in the shares have since pulled back to roughly 44 such a lofty price indicates high expectations for trump s media venture among at least some investors in its filing with regulators dwac also gave some financial forecasts for the company which has yet to launch but wants to build a non cancellable global community the presentation included forecasts that the company s truth social service may have 81 million users by 2026 or nearly 7 million more people than voted for trump in the last u s presidential election spacs generally are known for giving very optimistic forecasts about their future growth in presentations to investors in five years tmtg is forecast to generate nearly 3 7 billion in revenue according to the filing that is more than the annual revenue of retailer restoration hardware rv maker winnebago industries and entertainment giant iheart media which owns more than 800 radio stations for its tmtg video service that will stream non woke entertainment and news it says the monthly fee per user could be 9 in 2026 netflix in comparison got 14 49 in average revenue from its u s and canadian members during the first nine months of this year the presentation also lists the names of 30 key employees including its chief technology officer but only gives their first names and last initial the company has yet to offer many other details about its operation outside of trump being its chairman
