stock image of united states courthouse eastern district of new york brooklyn new york photo by flickr st george news st george a complaint filed in u s district court in new york alleges two st george business owners of bilking insurance companies out of tens of millions of dollars in fraudulent prescription claims according to the complaint filed in u s district court in brooklyn new york and unsealed on wednesday two st george men david gary bishoff 37 and brycen kay millett 31 each face one federal felony charge of conspiracy to commit health care fraud following an investigation that was launched by the fbi in 2020 according to the complaint agents allege that bishoff and millett ran a number of call centers based out of utah to fraudulently bill private health insurers for telemedicine prescriptions and while the operations were based in the u s initially the defendants later moved the call centers overseas millet owned three call center companies brace today advanced response and midway connection and federal prosecutors allege they were used in the scheme to funnel money back and forth between multiple bank accounts owned by the defendants and to finance the operation according to the complaint the scheme went something like this first the call centers would contact the individuals enrolled in private insurance programs and offer them medications at no cost and without any medical exam to determine the medical necessity for the those medications some individuals agreed to receive the medications while others did not but in either case the complaint states the defendants generated false prescriptions for these individuals from there bishoff using the alias bobby fisher and millett also known as brett johnson along with several codefendants recruited licensed physicians whose job it was to review the prescriptions presented by health care practitioners following a telemedicine appointment with the patient these licensed physicians then would create the prescriptions as requested by the practitioners and from there the prescriptions were sent to a number of pharmacies owned by the defendants and were purportedly filled and sent to the patient the insurance companies were then billed for the medication on behalf of the insured through the course of the investigation however agents found no evidence that any mid level practitioners ever recommended or prescribed any medications during the alleged telemedicine appointments agents also learned the defendants were using the national provider identifier number assigned to each of the licensed physicians which identified that particular doctor as the one prescribing the medication unbeknownst to the physicians and without their authorization the evidence also suggested that both bishoff and millett purchased or acquired a number of brick and mortar pharmacies that already had established relationships with insurers and the necessary board certifications to operate federal prosecutors say these businesses were acquired fraudulently by using straw buyers to conceal the fact it was the defendants who were the alleged owners of the businesses the pharmacies operating under their preexisting licensing in some cases or using the name of the straw buyer in others then would bill the insurance companies for the prescriptions submitted in many cases the complaint says the patient never received the medications that were purportedly filled and then billed to their insurance companies once the insurance companies caught on to the scheme they terminated the relationship with the fraudulent pharmacy and once that happened the defendants allegedly abandoned that particular pharmacy and then set up another one elsewhere a process that continued throughout the scam the investigation also revealed that private insurers paid tens of millions of dollars in reimbursements for fraudulent prescriptions according to the complaint the scheme operated using a series of call centers including three based in utah one of which operated under the business name of brace today a company that opened in 2016 and offered telemedicine services both bishoff and millett claimed ownership of the call center on various documents recovered by investigators and in august 2018 they moved the call center to a different location in utah and began to operate the business as advanced response the third company midway connections opened a call center in june 2017 in richfield under the name of millett s wife who was listed as the owner on bank documents later found by investigators but she never worked for the company according to several employees that were later interviewed by the fbi prosecutors also allege that while midway connections was listed as a medical insurance benefits company it operated as a call center in 2019 the company closed its doors in utah and the operation was moved overseas in essence the defendants billed insurance companies for medications purportedly processed by mid level practitioners during a telemedical appointment using a series of upper level physician s licenses those prescriptions if filled were processed through pharmacies also owned by the defendants purchased using straw buyers the reality however is that instead of patients being seen during telemedicine appointments they were contacted by one of several call centers and told they could get their medications for free then their insurance company would be billed for those prescriptions without ever having an appointment with a provider and more often than not the complaint alleges the patients never received the medications as promised additionally the complaint says straw purchasers often were unaware that the pharmacy they purchased was involved in the scheme and the physicians whose licenses were used to bill the insurance company were in the dark as well the scheme was kept afloat by funneling funds between the different call centers and the first two brace today and advanced response acted as shell companies used to funnel money from overseas into the u s and those funds were then used to pay operating and other costs to keep the scheme going as well as providing funds to the defendants during numerous interviews investigators learned that call center employees were falsely implying they were affiliated with the insured s pharmacy doctor or insurance company in order to gather information on the patient or to convince them to accept certain medications in early 2020 beneficiaries reported receiving third party calls selling migraine medication pain creams and other medications at no cost to the patient a majority of the patients never received the items as promised only to learn later their insurance company had been billed for the items the same held true for patients whose insurance companies paid for medications they never ordered complaints began to funnel into the call centers from insurance companies stating they were unable to secure the documentation needed to reimburse the company for prescriptions purportedly provided to patients the insurers also reported receiving calls from their beneficiaries reporting they were being billed for medications they never authorized or for those they were told were free the complaint also states that patients also were contacting the call centers saying they had never received their medications in august 2019 the state board in alabama issued an emergency order to suspend the operations of one of the pharmacies purchased by the defendants less than a month after the business began operations ultimately the state revoked the pharmacy s license the previous month the company received notification from one of the insurers that more than 1 7 million had been billed for claims that were invalid from july 2018 through february 2019 nearly 500 000 was transferred from brace today and from october 2018 through may 2020 more than 931 000 was transferred from advanced response and another 1 million from midway the amount of money transferred from each of the companies represented more than 97 of the business total revenue over a three year period starting in 2018 prosecutors allege that millett received nearly 1 8 million from midway s multiple bank accounts while bishoff received 5 7 million from multiple bank accounts owned by brace today and advanced response in total more than 12 million was disbursed to bishoff and millett from the first two call centers over the four year period the complaint was filed in federal court in brooklyn new york on march 7 and at the time of filing federal prosecutors requested the complaint remained sealed so as not to jeopardize the investigation or to reduce the risk that disclosure may increase the risk that both defendants would flee since neither had been arrested at that point the complaint remained sealed until april 20 the case was filed in the eastern district of new york since one of the defendant s hafizullah ebady lived in new jersey when the case was filed and will retain jurisdiction under federal law however the defendants must appear before a federal magistrate that is closest to where they live for identification and to establish custody arrangements which in this case was the u s district court of utah the file was then forwarded to magistrate judge paul kohler in st george as such both defendants were take into custody by the u s marshals office and then appeared before kohler last month where they were identified during an initial appearance held in federal court in st george on march 13 and then released from federal custody with both defendants identified and out on pretrial release all hearings going forward in the case will take place in federal court in new york this report is based on statements from court records police or other responders and may not contain the full scope of findings persons arrested or charged are presumed

buyback yield change in total liabilities to assets accruals z double prime bankruptcy risk z score and f score the score is variable meaning it can consider all eight measures or should any of the eight measures not be valid the remaining measures that are valid to be assigned a quality score stocks must have a valid non null measure and corresponding ranking for at least four of the eight quality measures the quality score is used to assess the underlying â œqualityâ of a particular stock a higher quality stock possesses traits associated with upside potential and reduced downside risk backtesting of the quality grade shows that stocks with higher grades on average outperformed stocks with lower grades over the period of 1998 through 2019 stocks receive better grades higher scores

multiple marine heat waves have occurred since 2014 along the washington coast marine heat waves have caused major ecological disruptions along the pacific coast in recent years but scientists have developed a global forecasting system to help fisheries and coastal communities anticipate and prepare for these extreme weather events the scientific journal nature on wednesday published the forecasting system that provides projections on marine heat waves around the world up to a year in advance researchers said the new forecasts could provide vital information as climate change causes marine heat waves to become increasingly frequent and intense these marine heat waves are the expression of when natural variability meets up with anthropogenic climate change and results in these episodic but extreme events said elliott hazen a co author of the report and research ecologist at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration southwest fisheries science center in monterey california with marine heat waves come both new opportunity and new risk most recently a heat wave that began to accumulate in 2013 along the west coast more commonly known as the blob disrupted fish stocks triggered damaging algal blooms and threw the ocean s ecological balance off kilter the blob peaked in 2014 and fizzled in 2016 but research from earlier this year indicated the impacts persisted long after ocean temperatures returned to normal the blob fueled a massive increase in the population density of california market squid along the oregon and washington coasts according to a report published in january by the american fisheries society hopefully this is something that can help mitigate those potential negative impacts in the future or even help with seizing opportunities that might arise due to marine heat waves said michael jacox lead author and noaa research scientist at the southwest fisheries science center and the physical sciences laboratory in boulder colorado jacox said the northeast pacific is already showing signs of a marine heat wave but not very close to shore which would be good news certainly if that plays out he said in california s coastal waters the 2013 heat wave forced humpback whales to hunt closer to shore where warmer temperatures caused a bloom of toxic algae that led to delays for dungeness crab fisheries as a result fisheries saw an abrupt increase in the number of whales tangled in ropes attached to those crab traps the new forecasts could help prevent situations like that hazen said there really hasn t been any operational marine heat wave forecasts in place he said so this really is a first around the world unexpected spikes in ocean temperatures have caused huge losses in fish shellfish and coral marine heat waves are a contemporary phenomenon about which scientific knowledge is limited the relationship between warming ocean temperatures and unpredictable marine heat waves as well as their impact on land temperatures remains to be fully understood according to nick bond the washington state climatologist at uw as the oceans continue to warm these sorts of heat waves are going to be coming along that much more and they ll probably be that much more severe he said following the blob noaa developed the marine heatwave tracker which monitors northern pacific coastal waters for evidence of an ongoing heat wave the forecasts published wednesday however can be used to predict where a marine heat wave is likely to develop and for how long up to a year in advance due to greater atmospheric and oceanic fluctuations the forecasts cannot be used as effectively on the east coast or in the mediterranean sea predictions are most accurate researchers said during el nino the el niño southern oscillation is a two to seven year cycle during which ocean temperatures in the eastern pacific undergo a warming and cooling cycle each cycle has a large impact on currents fisheries and the weather while past methods of predicting heat waves could provide an understanding of ongoing weather events or long term changes in oceans and marine ecosystems jacox said the new forecasts could fill that gap the forecasts he said are one piece of the puzzle multiple marine heat waves have occurred since 2014 along the washington coast in most cases pools of water near the center of the blob can become warmer by up to 5 degrees fahrenheit and by 1 to 2 degrees at the edges a 2016 study found that marine heat waves have increased in frequency since the 1970s the ocean captures about a third of the planet s excess carbon and more than 90 of its excess heat when you think about the whole climate system bond said it behooves us obviously to keep track of the oceans nicholas turner the seattle times

washington ap eight weeks into the war the biden administration s decision to dramatically ramp up delivery of artillery guns to ukraine signals a deepening american commitment at a pivotal stage of fighting for the country s industrial heartland it also brings into stark relief moscow s warning that continued u s military aid to ukraine would have unpredictable consequences suggesting that russia sees the international wave of weaponry as a growing obstacle to its invasion as well as a western provocation we re in a critical window of time now president joe biden said thursday in announcing he had approved an additional 800 million in battlefield aid that includes 72 of the u s army s 155mm howitzers along with 144 000 artillery rounds and more than 120 armed drones that will require training for ukrainian operators this brings to 3 4 billion the amount of security assistance provided since russia began its invasion feb 24 that is an extraordinary total of u s military aid for a country to which the united states has no defense treaty obligation a look at the u s assistance and u s expectations for what it will accomplish why is artillery so important now heavy weapons such as artillery are shaping up as a key feature of the unfolding battle for ukraine s eastern region known as the donbas the relatively flat terrain is suited for what the military calls maneuver warfare the movement of tanks and other ground forces backed by long range guns like the 155mm howitzer the russians have been deploying their own additional artillery to the donbas region in recent days along with more ground troops and other material to support and sustain what could be a long fight for terrain in ukraine s industrial heartland the howitzers the u s is sending to ukraine will be the latest american model known as the m777 used by the army and the marine corps smaller and more maneuverable than the older model the m777 can be deployed on the battlefield by heavy lift helicopters and moved relatively quickly between positions by seven ton trucks that also are being provided by the pentagon what makes it important is the kind of fighting that we expect in the donbas because of the terrain because it s open because it s flat because it s not as urban we can expect the russians to rely on long range fires artillery in particular said john kirby the pentagon press secretary so we know that this is going to be part of the russians playbook a senior u s defense official said the first of the 72 howitzers are expected to begin moving to europe by this weekend of 18 other 155mm howitzers that biden approved last week for shipment to ukraine an unspecified number already are in europe and u s howitzer training for ukrainian personnel began wednesday in an undisclosed country outside of ukraine will this be enough to hold off the russian offensive probably not and biden said he already has asked the pentagon to get to work on additional potential military assistance biden said this phase of russia s invasion will be more limited in terms of geography but not in terms of brutality he also acknowledged that he needs congress to approve the funds necessary to continue providing key weapons to ukraine beyond the latest 800 million package which he said would ensure a steady flow of arms only for the next few weeks u s officials say the russians are trying to adjust their approach in ukraine after early setbacks suggesting the fight could be a long one after failing to take kyiv the capital in the early weeks of its multipronged invasion russia has since narrowed its objectives by focusing on the donbas where moscow backed separatists have been fighting since 2014 and on a stretch of coastal territory along the sea of azov from mariupol to the crimean peninsula one russian advantage is this region s proximity to russian territory which allows for shorter supply lines than earlier battles in ukraine s north what else is the u s providing in addition to the 72 howitzers and the vehicles required to move them around the battlefield the new weapons package for ukraine includes artillery rounds and armed drones from u s air force stocks still in the pipeline from a separate 800 million weapons package announced only last week is a wide range of articles including radars used to enable the targeting of russian artillery as well as air surveillance radars and unmanned coastal drone vessels artillery and drones are the exact things ukraine will need as russia heads into its next campaign in the east and south said mark montgomery a retired navy rear admiral who previously served with u s european command in helping improve u s ukrainian military relations montgomery is now an analyst at the foundation for defense of democracies the drone included in the latest package is called the phoenix ghost made by a u s company aevex aerospace which bills itself as a leader in full spectrum airborne intelligence solutions kirby the pentagon spokesman declined to describe the drone s capabilities beyond saying that it is used largely but not exclusively to attack targets it also has onboard cameras kirby said the drones are especially well suited for the terrain on which the ukrainians are fighting in the donbas

the federal reserve must move faster than it has in the past to rein in high inflation chair jerome powell said thursday signaling that sharp interest rate increases are likely in the coming months beginning at the fed s next policy meeting in may in a panel discussion held by the international monetary fund during its spring meetings powell also suggested that there s something in the idea of front loading aggressive rate hikes as the fed grapples with inflation that has reached a four decade high so that does point in the direction of a half point rate increase being on the table for the fed s policy meeting may 3 4 powell said typically in the past the fed has raised its benchmark short term rate by more modest quarter point increments when the fed raises its rate it often leads to higher borrowing costs for people and businesses including those seeking to borrow to buy homes cars and other costly goods wall street investors already expect the fed to raise its key rate by a half point at its next three meetings including those that will occur in june and july powell s comments thursday underscored those expectations that would be the fastest tightening since 1994 when the fed raised its rate by 1 25 percentage points over the course of three meetings powell s comments caused stocks to shed early gains and sell off in the afternoon with the s p 500 falling 1 5 by the close of trading last month the fed implemented its first rate hike in more than three years raising its target rate to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 expectations for sharp rate increases have risen quickly reflecting the steady surge in inflation as recently as december fed officials had penciled in just three quarter point rate hikes this year fed officials had hoped that inflation would mostly fall on its own as supply chain snarls and shortages of items like semiconductors unraveled but those expectations have disappointed powell said by contrast christine lagarde president of european central bank who took part in thursday s discussion sounded a much more cautious note inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro reached 7 5 last month compared with a year earlier the highest level since records began in 1997 yet europe s economy faces a greater threat from russia s invasion of ukraine which has sent food and particularly energy prices on the continent soaring and has weighed more on its economic growth than in the united states lagarde said the ecb at its next meeting in june would decide when to end its program of bond purchases which are intended to lower long term interest rates the fed completed a similar effort in march the ecb has set the july september quarter as a target to stop buying bonds but hasn t been more specific one reason for lagarde s caution she said is that about half of europe s inflation is driven by high energy prices typically interest rate policies can do little about such supply shocks our economies are moving at a different pace lagarde said referring to europe and the united states where growth has been faster our inflation is fed by different components in his remarks powell said the fed wants to expeditiously raise its benchmark rate to a neutral level meaning a level that neither encourages nor restrains economic growth fed officials now consider a rate of between 2 25 and 2 5 to be roughly neutral that s 2 percentage points above its current level the fed could raise rates beyond neutral powell said to a level that would slow the economy if that turns out to be appropriate to stem high inflation how quickly the fed should lift rates to a point they start to restrain the economy could be a point of debate among policymakers in the coming months on wednesday charles evans president of the federal reserve bank of chicago said that rates will probably end up above neutral by next year but mary daly president of the san francisco federal reserve suggested wednesday that once the fed lifted rates to a level that no longer encouraged or restricted growth it should proceed cautiously if we slam the brakes on the economy by adjusting rates too quickly or too much we risk potentially tipping the economy into recession daly said
while only a handful of cases have been reported in the u s dozens of cases have recently been identified in europe washington health experts across the u s and europe are puzzled as mysterious cases of severe hepatitis continue to rise among young children in the u s the centers for disease control cdc issued an alert thursday to physicians nationwide to be on the lookout for liver inflammation the agency has so far confirmed 9 pediatric cases in alabama in children aged 1 to 6 the cdc said that three of the patients went into acute liver failure and two ultimately required liver transplants the uptick follows a recent outbreak that was first identified in europe last week british officials reported 74 cases of hepatitis or liver inflammation found in children since january the usual viruses that cause infectious hepatitis were not seen in the cases and scientists and doctors are considering other possible sources additional cases of hepatitis had been identified in denmark ireland the netherlands and spain the european centre for disease prevention and control said in a statement tuesday without specifying exactly how many cases were found mild hepatitis is very common in children following a range of viral infections but what is being seen at the moment is quite different said graham cooke a professor of infectious diseases at imperial college london some of the children in the u k have required specialist care at liver units and a few have needed a liver transplant the liver processes nutrients filters the blood and fights infections the infections caused symptoms like jaundice diarrhea and abdominal pain hepatitis can be life threatening if left untreated while it s unclear what s causing the illnesses a leading suspect is an adenovirus only some of the children tested positive for coronavirus but the world health organization said genetic analysis of the virus was needed to determine if there were any connections among the cases there are dozens of adenoviruses many of them associated with cold like symptoms fever sore throat and pink eye u s authorities said the nine alabama children tested positive for adenovirus and officials there are exploring a link to one particular version adenovirus 41 that s normally associated with gut inflammation public health officials ruled out any links to covid 19 vaccines saying none of the affected children were vaccinated the who noted that although there has been an increase in adenovirus in britain the potential role of those viruses in triggering hepatitis is unclear who said there were fewer than five possible cases in ireland and three confirmed cases in spain in children aged 22 months to 13 years

your bags are packed you re ready to go you re standing there outside your door and you re thinking if i catch covid 19 on this trip i could get seriously ill or die you got a fresh n95 respirator for the trip and you were counting on most of your fellow travelers to cover their noses and mouths too the driver of your ride share the people in the airport and passengers packed tightly inside the plane but this week a federal judge in tampa fla issued an order that voided the centers for disease control and prevention s mask mandate for those on public transportation the u s justice department is appealing the decision at the cdc s behest until the issue is sorted out in court most commercial airlines airports buslines and public transit systems have stopped requiring travelers and employees to mask up advertisement that means you re likely to be surrounded by maskless faces the most transmissible strain of the coronavirus yet the ba 2 subvariant of omicron dominates the landscape now it may be slightly less lethal than its forerunners but older people those with medical conditions and the unvaccinated face a heightened risk of serious disease or death if they become infected while full vaccination offers some protection against becoming severely ill that protection is leakier if you haven t been boosted or if your last shot was more than four months ago now what do you do dr john brooks the cdc s chief medical officer for the covid 19 response has some practical advice arm yourself get vaccinated and if you re fully vaccinated get boosted if you ve had two or three shots of pfizer s comirnaty or moderna s spikevax vaccine and it s been four months since your last shot another dose is advised give yourself a week or so for another jab to refresh your immune system s supply of antibodies if you have certain medical conditions can t be vaccinated or take medications that weaken your immune system s ability to fight off infections see if you can get a dose of evusheld a form of passive defense that can help protect you patients in active treatment for cancer or people who received a stem cell transplant for blood cancer in the past two years may not have mounted a strong response to the vaccine they need the extra boost of immunity that the monoclonal antibodies in evusheld provide patients who take long courses of high dose steroids or a range of other medications to treat auto immune diseases such as lupus rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis may be in the same boat and anyone who has had a solid organ transplant needs more protection to compensate for the powerful medications they take to prevent rejection advertisement just over a million doses of the protective medication have been distributed mainly to hospitals and healthcare systems across the country that won t cover everyone who probably needs it if you think it could help you the rheumatologist oncologist or transplant team that treated you is best positioned to help you get it do wear your mask and make sure it s a good one in a crowd the more people are masking the less virus will be suspended in the air to be breathed in so more masking is better but correct and consistent wearing of a mask that molds close to your face can protect you from breathing in those lingering viral particles or limit how much you take in that in turn could mean the difference between warding off infection and becoming ill you ve heard this before but it s worth repeating a cloth mask won t cut it given how readily the omicron variant spreads if you love your cloth mask put a disposable surgical mask over it they re designed to draw in and trap virus on their surface but your best bet is to wear an n95 respirator which pinches around your nose and has ear loops or head straps that hold the mask tight to your face before you go on an airplane practice at home to make sure you can wear it comfortably correctly and consistently brooks said they re itchy and scratchy and the air is hot for some people but millions of healthcare providers have learned how to wear them and you can too mind the transitions and take a direct flight if you can the filtration systems of most commercial jets are fully engaged when they re traveling above 10 000 feet brooks said and they are powerfully effective at cleaning the air under those conditions but when jet engines are idling on the ground and passengers are boarding or deplaning those systems are not doing that job and the efficiency of those air filtration systems also suffers as the plane ascends or descends so be sure to wear your mask during those transitions and taking direct flights where possible limits the amount of time you re sitting in a crowded metal tube with a filtration system that s going to let more virus slip through than it will at cruising altitude advertisement reserve a window seat board last and sit near the front so you can deplane quickly the principle here is to spend the least amount of time possible on a plane that s still on the ground brooks explained you also want to sit where any virus emitted by passengers and staff in the aisles is least likely to reach you seeking special favors from airlines is either costly or difficult but most will let you choose your seat for an extra charge and if you can do that look for one that gives you some distance from passers by but also lets you make a fast get away eat or drink with caution you ll probably be hungry and thirsty if you re taking a long trip but if other travelers are largely unmasked your snack or swig of soda is an opportunity for their virus to enter your respiratory tract brooks notes that a straw can be inserted right under a mask limiting the broken seal he suggests eating in the airport rather than on the plane and munching your meal in an unpopulated corner of the gate area wash your hands before eating know the community transmission level where you re going and behave accordingly going to a hotspot of new cases or passing through one on the way to your destination find out before you go so you know where masking and social distancing are still a good idea and where you can afford to loosen up visit the cdc s community website and click on the counties you ll be traveling from to and through stock up on rapid tests and prepare to spring into action if you have a positive result it makes sense to test yourself before you travel to make sure you re good to go but bring another test and take it four days or so after you ve been in a high exposure situation like an airport or if you develop covid 19 symptoms advertisement getting the earliest possible indication of infection is all the more important because antiviral medications such as paxlovid and molnupiravir are now available and they can shorten the duration and or lessen the severity of an infection but they must be taken as soon as symptoms start and no more than five days after symptom

rita hayworth was a major star and a world class beauty so it s not surprising that she inspired extravagant gifts it s well documented that in 1941 film director orson welles presented her with a new lincoln continental coupe she kept the car for three decades and donated its bumpers to a world war ii scrap drive that car magnificently restored will be auctioned by worldwide april 23 george rinhart getty images rita hayworth leans on her new lincoln continental a gift from orson welles popular history has it that rita hayworth was later gifted with an even more extraordinary car by a wealthy lover in this case it was her husband the immensely wealthy prince aly kahn tired of his philandering reportedly with actress joan fontaine hayworth decamped with her daughter to nevada to begin divorce proceedings according to lore kahn was distraught and around this time he saw an exclusive ghia bodied cadillac one of two built on spec at the 1953 paris auto salon in an attempt to win hayworth back the story goes he bought the cadillac off the stand and sent it to hayworth in nevada she reportedly kept the car but not the husband who had also offered her 1 million if she would raise their daughter as a moslem a subsequent german owner lent the car to the petersen automotive museum in los angeles the petersen eventually purchased the ghia cadillac and gave it the striking dark burgundy paint it wears today as seen in the top photo the other one is blue that was petersen s story until two years ago but as with paintings provenance can change joseph harper associate curator of the petersen said via email i can understand your interest in the vehicle however was never owned or built for rita hayworth after some extensive research the museum stopped representing it as such some time ago due to a complete absence of evidence despite previous claims made by previous owners bettmann getty images rita hayworth and her then husband prince aly kahn harper further explained that leslie kendall the museum s curator investigated the claims of celebrity ownership didn t find anything corroborating them and decided that we not perpetuate the myth or legendary connection this decision was made only a couple of years ago so many of the things found online may still use such wording and they do kendall told autoweek that the ghia cadillac is a gorgeous lovely and important car even without star power it s certainly quite beautiful reflecting the exquisite high beltline designs by italian coachbuilder ghia in the postwar period there s a strong resemblance between ghia s cadillacs and around the same time under the skin ghia s car is a stock 1953 cadillac with a 210 horsepower 331 cubic inch v8 and an automatic transmission petersen automotive museum even without a movie star connection the ghia cadillac is a gorgeous creation inside and out the cadillac even minus rita hayworth is even more exclusive than the lincoln and would definitely top it in auction pricing if both cars had been owned by ordinary civilians it s one of just two and the ultimate expression of ghia flamboyant styling the lincoln by contrast is a production car but the rita orson connection is a big incentive for bidders juan diego calle ceo and co founder of classic com estimates hayworth s lincoln will bring 80 000 to 120 000 at auction but the two cars will likely never go head to head because petersen says its exclusive cadillac is staying put in the museum s extensive collection share your thoughts on rita hayworth and her ghia bodied cadillac in the comments below

powell reinforces expectations of sharp rate hike next month washington the federal reserve must move faster than it has in the past to rein in high inflation chair jerome powell said thursday signaling that sharp interest rate increases are likely in the coming months beginning at the fed s next policy meeting in may in a panel discussion held by the international monetary fund during its spring meetings powell also suggested that there s something in the idea of front loading aggressive rate hikes as the fed grapples with inflation that has reached a four decade high so that does point in the direction of a half point rate increase being on the table for the fed s policy meeting may 3 4 powell said typically in the past the fed has raised its benchmark short term rate by more modest quarter point increments when the fed raises its rate it often leads to higher borrowing costs for people and businesses including those seeking to borrow to buy homes cars and other costly goods wall street investors already expect the fed to raise its key rate by a half point at its next three meetings including those that will occur in june and july powell s comments thursday underscored those expectations that would be the fastest tightening since 1994 when the fed raised its rate by 1 25 percentage points over the course of three meetings powell s comments caused stocks to shed early gains and sell off in the afternoon with the s p 500 falling 1 5 by the close of trading last month the fed implemented its first rate hike in more than three years raising its target rate to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 expectations for sharp rate increases have risen quickly reflecting the steady surge in inflation as recently as december fed officials had penciled in just three quarter point rate hikes this year fed officials had hoped that inflation would mostly fall on its own as supply chain snarls and shortages of items like semiconductors unraveled but those expectations have disappointed powell said by contrast christine lagarde president of european central bank who took part in thursday s discussion sounded a much more cautious note inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro reached 7 5 last month compared with a year earlier the highest level since records began in 1997 yet europe s economy faces a greater threat from russia s invasion of ukraine which has sent food and particularly energy prices on the continent soaring and has weighed more on its economic growth than in the united states lagarde said the ecb at its next meeting in june would decide when to end its program of bond purchases which are intended to lower long term interest rates the fed completed a similar effort in march the ecb has set the july september quarter as a target to stop buying bonds but hasn t been more specific one reason for lagarde s caution she said is that about half of europe s inflation is driven by high energy prices typically interest rate policies can do little about such supply shocks our economies are moving at a different pace lagarde said referring to europe and the united states where growth has been faster our inflation is fed by different components in his remarks powell said the fed wants to expeditiously raise its benchmark rate to a neutral level meaning a level that neither encourages nor restrains economic growth fed officials now consider a rate of between 2 25 and 2 5 to be roughly neutral that s 2 percentage points above its current level the fed could raise rates beyond neutral powell said to a level that would slow the economy if that turns out to be appropriate to stem high inflation how quickly the fed should lift rates to a point they start to restrain the economy could be a point of debate among policymakers in the coming months on wednesday charles evans president of the federal reserve bank of chicago said that rates will probably end up above neutral by next year but mary daly president of the san francisco federal reserve suggested wednesday that once the fed lifted rates to a level that no longer encouraged or restricted growth it should proceed cautiously if we slam the brakes on the economy by adjusting rates too quickly or too much we risk potentially tipping the economy into recession daly said

photo pixabay it s sunday june 3 1888 and you ve just sat down for dinner at the hotel vancouver outside two recently installed edison dynamos light up the city for the first time elsewhere whaling is big everywhere atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are at 294 parts per million nearly a third lower than current levels in victoria the capital s newspaper warns water levels in the fraser river are higher than at any time in the season it is still rising salmon is scarce on the river notes a weekend dispatch from the victoria daily times you order the fish salmon a la victoria pommes a la duchese reads the menu typical b c fare it s easy to think 141 years later today the location of the hotel has changed its restaurant rebranded as notch8 those old menus i remember them well there was always salmon on there said dennis peckham a former chef at notch8 who now oversees eight local restaurants for the glowbal restaurant group not any more salmon is out roasted trout cod and seared scallops are in according to the restaurant s latest dinner menu today we look at sustainability said peckham are we doing our part a link between vancouver restaurant menus and climate change as climate change warms many seas to the south fish species are moving pole ward in a migration never seen in modern times how those climate triggered migrations impact the fishing industry has been well documented but few have linked the warming of local seas to the changing nature of what lands on our plate now a new study from researchers at the university of british columbia has set out to correct that published this week in the journal environmental biology of fishes researchers from the ubc institute for the oceans and fisheries tracked down menus from 362 vancouver restaurants stretching from 1880 to 2021 even if you are not catching fish or you are not related to the seafood sector it affects our everyday life said institute director william cheung who co authored the study with john paul ng their central question have vancouver s fish and seafood menus changed with warming local seas pulling old menus from the royal bc museum in victoria and the vancouver archives the researchers documented all the locally caught species on offer throughout the decades next they matched each species with their preferred ocean temperatures as cheung put it they took the temperature of a seafood menu by comparing different time periods they discovered the highest preferred temperature had climbed 3 c since 1880 the more the ocean has warmed the more fishers caught warm water fish and the more they ended up on a restaurant s menu big questions remained was vancouver an anomaly were restaurants in other cities adjusting their menu to the shift in locally available fish to answer those questions cheung and ng compared contemporary menus in restaurants in anchorage alaska and in los angeles calif the pattern held in alaska restaurants were serving more cold water fish and in l a more warm water fish were on offer as cheung put it they established a strong correlation between changing ocean temperatures and what fish dishes are found on local menus in with the blob out with the salmon salmon once dominated our seas and seafood menus but in recent decades a confluence of changing ocean temperatures habitat destruction overfishing changing predator relationships and disease have all taken their toll between 1980 and 2014 the fraser river averaged 9 6 million sockeye returns annually with up to 28 million one year by 2020 salmon returning to the fraser river fell to an all time record low of 293 000 according to cheung the biggest shift in menu offerings was seen between the periods 1981 1996 and 2019 2021 the latter coming after the arrival of extreme marine heat waves known as the blob as cold waters migrate north others have started to fill the void left behind in the early 1990s humboldt squid suddenly started to appear on local menus as the species expanded its territory into b c waters said cheung where some species have gained traction on local menus the pacific sardine once a popular menu item before the 1950s disappeared as its stocks were decimated by overfishing in b c such declines however are not always a dead end sardines are a warm water species so we expect our waters will become more favourable to them and their populations will come back said cheung that s good news for peckham who places both squid and sardines high on his priorities of culinary ingredients along with octopus caught as bycatch that would otherwise go to waste humbolt squid we already use he said sardines would be very high on the list i love sardines i used to use them in california quite a bit it affects your everyday life populations of popular fish like albacore tuna could also increasingly spend more time in b c s warming waters others iconic species like sockeye salmon face an uncertain future some of the species we take them for granted said cheung pointing to the impact climate change is having on sockeye even if you are not catching fish or you are not related to the seafood sector it affects our everyday life those culinary cultures might need to be adjusted cheung is careful to point out that his study did not take into account how vancouver s shifting demographics have driven demand for different kinds of seafood over the years the restaurants especially in metro vancouver are increasingly mindful about serving sustainable seafood said cheung we want to see if those seafood menus have a lower carbon footprint the researchers are also planning to investigate how a culinary culture focused on sustainability but constrained by supply chains and rising prices will adapt peckham who is about to open another san francisco style seafood and chop house this time in toronto says it s already a tough balance seafood prices have surged in recent years a trend he says is made worse by large scale export to asian markets still sustainability will remain at the core of what his restaurants do it s what his customers want he says there are some beautiful fish available to us at all times from hawaii said peckham but it s easier to tell a story when it s local

sounds like the early phase of a construction project and that s the phrase federal reserve chair jerome powell used thursday to describe a possible strategy by the u s central bank to tamp down inflation running at a four decade high the idea is the fed might enact a series of steep interest rate increases say 0 5 percentage point per meeting versus the more typical 0 25 percentage point to make sure consumer prices don t spiral out of control we re really going to be raising rates and getting expeditiously to levels that are more neutral and then that are actually tight powell said during a panel with european central bank president christine lagarde arranged by the international monetary fund imf the risk is that higher borrowing costs crimp spending and investment and then the economy slides into a recession bitcoin is seen by many investors as an inflation hedge and it s also seen as a risky asset that might come under pressure during a period of shrinking economic growth so powell s hawkish tone was enough to send bitcoin s price lower just as the largest cryptocurrency appeared to be gaining steam the price reached a 10 day high nearly touching 43 000 but then slid back toward 40 000 erasing recent days gains bitcoin price action has continued to whipsaw between a wider range of 38 47 000 tammy da costa analyst at dailyfx told coindesk s angelique chen u s stocks ended the day lower and u s treasury yields rose markets s p 500 1 5 djia 0 8 nasdaq 2 1 gold 1 953 0 1 insights one year after coinbase s ipo most listed crypto companies are underwater the last quarter of 2020 was an exciting time bitcoin seemed meteoric given the new institutional interest in the asset class coinbase global coin filed preliminary paperwork with the securities and exchange commission sec for a listing and soon after pre ipo contracts were trading on ftx that valued the company close to 75 billion but just over a year since its ipo coinbase s stock is down nearly 55 underperforming bitcoin which is down around 26 for the same time period to be sure many tech stocks are also down for this same period as investors appetite for listed crypto companies seems to have waned in a note published last year singapore s qcp capital wrote that investors were no longer assigning a strong premium to licenses and regulatory friendliness like they once did which would in turn put pressure on coinbase s stock that premium has been on the pretext that it would give them a free pass while governmental agencies took their war on crypto to other platforms and exchanges instead like binance qcp wrote at the time if now a regulated u s entity who is offering a product that is already being offered in the u s going through the proper legal route can face such harsh action then nobody is assured to be safe anymore coinbase s regulatory compliance and u s base also keeps it out of some of the more interesting parts of crypto like lending it also meant that coinbase had a slow start in the derivatives market which overtook the spot market for the first time in june 2021 behind many of its non us based rivals likely turning investors away from its stock hong kong s bc technology group which runs the institutional focused digital assets platform osl has seen a similar fate with its stock although it had a brief rally after positive earnings the stock is down nearly 66 over the last year mining stocks aren t fairing much better riot blockchain riot which operates bitcoin mining farms throughout the u s is down nearly 66 over the last year while marathon digital mara another miner is down 40 canaan can a manufacturer of mining equipment is down nearly 70 michael del grosso an analyst at compass point research who covers miners explains this poor performance by saying in a previous coindesk interview mining stocks currently are leveraged plays on the price of bitcoin these mining stocks had their moment when china ordered operations shut in country and the global hash rate was in flux but as that sorted itself out and bitcoin flirted with all time highs yet couldn t sustain itself the stocks sank like rocks currently compass point maintains a neutral rating on riot blockchain this begs the question are there any listed crypto companies that are actually above the water line indeed there are crypto banks like silvergate capital and signature bank both of these banks which provide banking services to crypto exchanges have managed to outperform bitcoin over the last year given that they are tied to exchanges their value is based upon the volume of transactions on an exchange and volume is maintained at a brisk pace as is demand for other tools silvergate provides like leverage so perhaps the problem with these listed companies isn t a market hostility to listed crypto companies but rather that the market needs more than them just being a proxy for the price of bitcoin technician s take bitcoin momentum strengthens despite short term pause bitcoin btc generated a positive momentum signal on the daily price chart similar to what occurred in late march that suggests buyers could remain active toward the 46 700 resistance level the cryptocurrency is up 4 over the past week the relative strength index rsi on the four hour chart is declining from overbought levels which typically occurs during a brief pullback in price still support at 40 000 could maintain btc s recovery phase initial resistance is seen at 42 400 where sellers were active earlier in the new york trading day on the daily chart however the rsi is rising from oversold levels with stronger momentum indicating a rise in bullish sentiment important events 8 30 a m hkt sgt 12 30 a m utc japan jibun bank manufacturing pmi

opinion tim holt zo calo public square this country is littered with dying small towns that lacked a plan b one they should have had in place before the mill shut down or the factory moved to mexico mount shasta california and ashland oregon did it right located in the california oregon border region where i live they avoided economic devastation by having their survival plans well underway by the time their lumber mills began to shut down more than a half century ago indeed mount shasta was more than 100 years ahead of the curve thanks to a guy named justin hinckley sisson who planted the seeds for the town s future reinvention as a recreational tourist destination a schoolteacher from connecticut sisson moved out west and reinvented himself as a rugged outdoorsman in 1866 he opened a hotel and restaurant on the lower slopes of mt shasta and started taking his visitors on hunting fishing and mountain climbing excursions the timber boom that had begun around that time had pretty well petered out by 1990 when the last lumber mill closed in mount shasta by then a wave of newcomers attracted to the recreational opportunities in the area had taken up where sisson left off setting up outfitting stores and offering guide services a new ski park opened in 1985 all this was complemented by a new batch of motels and restaurants beginning in the late 1990s a nonprofit organization called the mount shasta trail association fueled by grants and private donations greatly expanded the area s hiking opportunities adding 20 miles of trails along lakes and rivers and on the slopes of mount shasta with another 46 miles currently in the works all in all it added up to a smooth and vigorous transition from a timber based economy to one based on recreational tourism seventy five miles up the road sits another former timber town ashland oregon the last of its eight lumber mills shut down in 1967 but an english professor at the local college angus l bowmer had already planted the seeds for the town s reinvention bowmer had done some amateur acting on the side and he got the idea of converting an unused structure in the city park into a venue for shakespearean plays the city of ashland offered him 400 and funds for a construction crew just enough support to get his project off the ground the first two productions occurred in 1935 instantly becoming an annual event the oregon shakespeare festival by the 1960s the festival had established ashland as a major theatre town that drew fans of the bard from up and down the west coast by 2019 the ashland chamber of commerce estimated that over 100 000 visitors were showing up at the theatre festival each season its success has spawned a number of other live theatre venues what do these two successful town reinventions have in common they both carry the promise that visitors leave their drab boring lives behind and find something new and exciting in the town a successful reinvention is a high tide that raises all boats attracts that surge of hikers and skiers and theatre goers who fill the hotels and restaurants and keep the cash registers in the retail shops humming but what happens when the tide doesn t roll in the small town where i live dunsmuir california provides an example of what happens when you don t have a plan b dunsmuir is just 10 miles down the road from mount shasta in its heyday dunsmuir was a thriving railroad hub for passenger trains equipment repair and crew changes ten passenger trains came through every day but now most of that has gone away it s down to two passenger trains each day and freight train crews are less than half what they were in the days of steam locomotives there was no plan b in place before or during the railroad s decline so now more than half a century later well intentioned people here are playing catchup trying to bring the town back to life but through piecemeal efforts a new art gallery a small performing space a micro brewery some pretty good restaurants none of this adds up to a solid rebranding the town has shrunk from 2 200 in population when i moved here 26 years ago to 1 700 today this is despite a number of elements in dunsmuir s favor the sacramento river runs right through dunsmuir it s considered one of the best fly fishing destinations in california hiking trails abound and the slopes of mt shasta and the ski park are a short drive away but new enterprises tend to come and go at a high turnover rate like the outfitting store that only lasted a couple of months an entrepreneur from oakland who d made a bundle selling novelty items in china bought up a half dozen downtown properties 20 years ago and promised that it would be the beginning of the town s revival those buildings still sit empty it s tough to get a plan b going in a depressed economy in their book our towns the journalists james and deborah fallows found common factors in successfully reinvented towns across the united states among them was an openness to newcomers to new people bringing new talents and ideas to their new homes in these open towns the newcomers often find opportunities to reinvent themselves to apply whatever skills and talents they may have in new ways in this new stimulating environment the retired accountant who made his own beer at home opens a micro brewery or the english professor gets into the theatre business or that connecticut schoolteacher opens a hotel and starts taking his visitors on hunting and fishing excursions in dunsmuir we see similar personal transformations that could plant the seeds for a successful town reinvention a former stock and bond trader from the bay area took over the fly fishing shop a former bank executive from san francisco runs the hardware store every small town has its share of talented enterprising folks the ones who get the art galleries and the micro breweries going but they can t do it alone they need visitors and ideas from elsewhere and people need to direct their positive energy and talent in the same direction and come up with a theme a story for their town to tell otherwise they re likely to have a nice quiet town with a lot of empty storefronts tim holt is the editor of the quarterly northwest review and the author of the back to the land novel on higher ground set in the mount shasta region
photo pixabay it s sunday june 3 1888 and you ve just sat down for dinner at the hotel vancouver outside two recently installed edison dynamos light up the city for the first time elsewhere whaling is big everywhere atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are at 294 parts per million nearly a third lower than current levels in victoria the capital s newspaper warns water levels in the fraser river are higher than at any time in the season it is still rising salmon is scarce on the river notes a weekend dispatch from the victoria daily times you order the fish salmon a la victoria pommes a la duchese reads the menu typical b c fare it s easy to think 141 years later today the location of the hotel has changed its restaurant rebranded as notch8 those old menus i remember them well there was always salmon on there said dennis peckham a former chef at notch8 who now oversees eight local restaurants for the glowbal restaurant group not any more salmon is out roasted trout cod and seared scallops are in according to the restaurant s latest dinner menu today we look at sustainability said peckham are we doing our part a link between vancouver restaurant menus and climate change as climate change warms many seas to the south fish species are moving pole ward in a migration never seen in modern times how those climate triggered migrations impact the fishing industry has been well documented but few have linked the warming of local seas to the changing nature of what lands on our plate now a new study from researchers at the university of british columbia has set out to correct that published this week in the journal environmental biology of fishes researchers from the ubc institute for the oceans and fisheries tracked down menus from 362 vancouver restaurants stretching from 1880 to 2021 even if you are not catching fish or you are not related to the seafood sector it affects our everyday life said institute director william cheung who co authored the study with john paul ng their central question have vancouver s fish and seafood menus changed with warming local seas pulling old menus from the royal bc museum in victoria and the vancouver archives the researchers documented all the locally caught species on offer throughout the decades next they matched each species with their preferred ocean temperatures as cheung put it they took the temperature of a seafood menu by comparing different time periods they discovered the highest preferred temperature had climbed 3 c since 1880 the more the ocean has warmed the more fishers caught warm water fish and the more they ended up on a restaurant s menu big questions remained was vancouver an anomaly were restaurants in other cities adjusting their menu to the shift in locally available fish to answer those questions cheung and ng compared contemporary menus in restaurants in anchorage alaska and in los angeles calif the pattern held in alaska restaurants were serving more cold water fish and in l a more warm water fish were on offer as cheung put it they established a strong correlation between changing ocean temperatures and what fish dishes are found on local menus in with the blob out with the salmon salmon once dominated our seas and seafood menus but in recent decades a confluence of changing ocean temperatures habitat destruction overfishing changing predator relationships and disease have all taken their toll between 1980 and 2014 the fraser river averaged 9 6 million sockeye returns annually with up to 28 million one year by 2020 salmon returning to the fraser river fell to an all time record low of 293 000 according to cheung the biggest shift in menu offerings was seen between the periods 1981 1996 and 2019 2021 the latter coming after the arrival of extreme marine heat waves known as the blob as cold waters migrate north others have started to fill the void left behind in the early 1990s humboldt squid suddenly started to appear on local menus as the species expanded its territory into b c waters said cheung where some species have gained traction on local menus the pacific sardine once a popular menu item before the 1950s disappeared as its stocks were decimated by overfishing in b c such declines however are not always a dead end sardines are a warm water species so we expect our waters will become more favourable to them and their populations will come back said cheung that s good news for peckham who places both squid and sardines high on his priorities of culinary ingredients along with octopus caught as bycatch that would otherwise go to waste humbolt squid we already use he said sardines would be very high on the list i love sardines i used to use them in california quite a bit it affects your everyday life populations of popular fish like albacore tuna could also increasingly spend more time in b c s warming waters others iconic species like sockeye salmon face an uncertain future some of the species we take them for granted said cheung pointing to the impact climate change is having on sockeye even if you are not catching fish or you are not related to the seafood sector it affects our everyday life those culinary cultures might need to be adjusted cheung is careful to point out that his study did not take into account how vancouver s shifting demographics have driven demand for different kinds of seafood over the years the restaurants especially in metro vancouver are increasingly mindful about serving sustainable seafood said cheung we want to see if those seafood menus have a lower carbon footprint the researchers are also planning to investigate how a culinary culture focused on sustainability but constrained by supply chains and rising prices will adapt peckham who is about to open another san francisco style seafood and chop house this time in toronto says it s already a tough balance seafood prices have surged in recent years a trend he says is made worse by large scale export to asian markets still sustainability will remain at the core of what his restaurants do it s what his customers want he says there are some beautiful fish available to us at all times from hawaii said peckham but it s easier to tell a story when it s local

illinois received a credit rating upgrade thursday from moody s investors service a bond credit rating agency after a series of downgrades which began more than 10 years ago it is the second credit rating upgrade from moody s since this time last year credit ratings are one way to assess a state s financial health because it is a common way bond buyers and investors assess the risk of buying bonds from a state this can affect how easily it is for a state to borrow money moody s one of the three major credit rating firms gave the state a rating of baa1 the eighth highest on a scale of 21 possible ratings the state is on track to close the current fiscal 2022 with its strongest fund balance in over a decade wrote the credit agency in its rating announcement the agency also cited illinois recent payments to decrease its pension debts and into its financial reserves such as its rainy day fund gov jb pritzker on thursday used the upgrade to point out that any improvement is good for a state that has a history of financial mismanagement there s more work to be done but step by step rung by rung we are steadily climbing the ladder out of a hole that was dug over decades said pritzker at a tuesday press conference illinois future is bright illinois tax rebate gov jb pritzker signs 46 5b budget including rebates checks to illinois taxpayers despite optimism from the governor some state finance experts are more cautious kenneth kriz is the director of the institute for illinois public finance at the university of illinois springfield he studies municipal bonds and ways that governments manage money he cautioned that the announcement should be considered in context it does indicate that the financial condition is improving said kris but the question is how much credit ratings like moody s rate group s credit worthiness in broad categories with moody s aaa rating being the highest aa being next a being the third baa being fourth these broad ratings then have notches within them being marked by a number it doesn t mean we re in a great financial position said kriz even with the upgrade illinois continues to have the lowest rated general obligation bonds of any state eighteen states have the highest possible rating aaa with another 16 having the second highest aa1 new jersey is the second lowest rated state and moody s rates it at a2 two notches above illinois credit rating elections how the top illinois governor candidates are outpacing others in fundraising and spending moody s also rates the credit for governments around the world illinois credit rating is similar to thailand which moody s rates baa1 and indonesia which moody s gave a baa2 rating the credit rating upgrade is the second from moody s since this time last year when the state s credit rating was baa3 illinois initially reached this credit rating in 2016 during a partisan standoff that led to the state operating without a budget for more than two years this rating is the lowest a state can receive before its debts are considered junk bonds a term for when a bond crosses over from being considered an investment instrument and instead becomes a speculative asset s p global another rating agency currently rates illinois with a bbb rating its equivalent to illinois former rating under moody s kriz however said it is likely that this will increase to match moody s current assessment of the state kriz warned that fitch ratings the third major credit rating agency still rates illinois credit worthiness as a bbb equivalent to moody s baa3 and the lowest possible rating before being considered junk though credit ratings are an important part of measuring a state s financial health they can only capture one aspect of it mask guide where should masks be worn what you need to know about the latest mask guidelines the actual debts being assessed by moody s in its credit rating are general obligation bonds a type of investment backed solely by a government s credit rating debts from these kind of bonds made up 11 5 of the state s long term debts as of june 30 2021 the larger risks to illinois financial health according to kriz are the state s other long term obligations notably pension liability and other post employment benefits owed to government workers these types of debt amount to 208 billion in debt and make up 85 7 of the state s long term obligations according to the most recent financial report from the state s comptroller moody s though not directly assessing the risk of these debts cited the challenges facing the state in its reasoning for why the state s credit rating remains low these challenges include heavy long term liability and fixed cost burdens that constrain the state s financial flexibility and contribute to a weak financial position compared to other states the agency wrote some democrats in the legislature still took the opportunity to celebrate what they view as proof that their budgeting strategy is effective moody s credit rating increase is further affirmation that democrats are getting illinois finances back on track said house speaker chris welch d hillside in a thursday statement more headlines why magro s meat and produce is changing product offerings at springfield store kriz cautioned that the state s recent budgeting has relied heavily on one time aid from the federal government i don t want anyone to think this is going to continue he said referring to recent budget surpluses republicans also criticized democrats use of federal aid on thursday the truth is pritzker continues to put illinois on a path toward fiscal insolvency by increasing state spending and failing to address the systemic issues that are causing people to flee this state said one of the state s top conservative politicians senate republican leader dan mcconchie r hawthorn woods should he remain in office next year he is going to be confronted with a major hangover after the federal

performing asset ratio to total assets compared to 0 38 president and chief executive officer curtis c simard stated the company had a strong start to the year as we effectively positioned ourselves to grow loans expanded net interest margin increased fee based income controlled expenses driving positive operating leverage for the quarter and maintained our credit quality and solid capital levels commercial loan growth was very strong for the quarter and may fluctuate based on timing of loan closings and payoffs however at 21 annualized loan growth was a reflection of strong pipelines heading into the year that remain robust the growth and pipelines are a healthy mix of real estate loans commercial and industrial loans and increases in utilization rates to 30 on existing lines of credit the lending activity during the quarter highlights the strength of our teams experience and client relationships as we continue to navigate an uncertain economic and rate environment with dynamic variables that could shift in either direction we have an enviable revenue stream allowing for flexibility in any rate environment and our lending customers carry leading profiles as we refuse to push out the risk curve the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet positions us to expect to further benefit from any potential fed rate hikes we self funded loans during the quarter by deploying excess cash as total deposit growth remained flat core deposit accounts grew 5 annualized in the quarter which offset a strategic run off in wholesale time deposits we continue to see growth in our core deposits as we attract new customers and gain market share as well as deepen our existing relationships allowing for minimal reliance on wholesale borrowings a total of 500 net new accounts were opened in the quarter moving to earnings net interest margin nim expanded to 2 95 for the first quarter 2022 up from 2 88 in the same quarter of 2021 core nim non gaap was 2 93 and 2 78 for the first quarters of 2022 and 2021 respectively and was 2 69 in the fourth quarter of 2021 of the 24 basis point increase from the fourth quarter 16 basis points relates to the use of cash to fund loan growth and 8 basis points was the result of previously announced deleveraging strategies credit quality continues to be strong across our loan portfolio the provision for loan losses this quarter reflects a build to the allowance on higher loan growth balanced with improvements in non accrual loans delinquencies specific reserves and beneficial shifts in product mix net recoveries on previously charged off loans were 95 thousand compared with net charge offs of 168 thousand in the first quarter of 2021 mr simard continued compared with a year ago fee based revenue increased 11 reflecting a deepening and expanding customer deposit base growth in trust and investment management fees and higher treasury management fees our wealth management business continues to perform very well despite the broader market volatility we continue to attract additional assets from customers successfully retain transfer across generations and win new business based on a high service level and risk based approach mortgage banking revenue was in line with expectations given the decline in refinancing activity and tighter gain on sale margins given excess capacity in the industry given the shift in the mortgage banking environment we opportunistically managed our mortgage production between on balance sheet and for sale through our secondary market platform our tangible book value per share non gaap was 18 72 compared with 19 86 at year end 2021 or a decrease of 5 7 as a result of the mark to market adjustments in our securities portfolio given the rising rate environment this dilution is temporary and reasonable given the relatively short duration risk of the securities portfolio excluding securities adjustments tangible book value per share was up 7 on an annualized basis to 20 07 from 19 73 at year end 2021 mr simard concluded based on our performance strong capital levels and the board of directors confidence in our execution of our strategic priorities we are pleased to announce an increase to our quarterly dividend of 0 02 per share to 0 26 per share or a yield of 3 63 in closing we celebrated our 135th anniversary in the first quarter and are proud to carry our downeast maine

close of business on may 17 2022 payable on june 17 2022 this dividend equates to a 3 63 annualized yield based on the 28 62 closing price of the company s common stock at the end of the first quarter

commercial leasing and hotel accommodation industries total residential loans increased 47 4 million from the end of the fourth quarter 2021 as we opted to put originations on the balance sheet instead of selling into the secondary market while residential loans increased origination volume was significantly down from quarterly periods in 2021 due to lower refinancing activity the allowance for credit losses was 23 2 million for the first quarter compared to 22 7 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 a steadying economic forecast and disciplined approach to credit quality resulted in an allowance to total loans coverage ratio of 0 87 compared to 0 90 at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 the first quarter 2022 charged off loans resulted in a net recovery of 95 thousand compared to 144 thousand in the fourth quarter 2021 non accruing loans for the first quarter 2022 decreased to 9 2 million from 10 2 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 the ratio of accruing

compared to 83 at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 given the outsized loan growth this quarter time deposits decreased 33 6 million during the quarter primarily due to 22 0 million of wholesale deposits that matured in the first quarter the remaining decrease is attributable to customers continuing to move funds to transactional accounts upon contractual maturity the company s book value per share was 27 11 at march 31 2022 compared with 28 27 at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 tangible book value per share non gaap measure was 18 72 at the end of the first quarter 2022 compared to 19

2021 due to lower deposit rates and reduced wholesale borrowings the provision for credit losses for the quarter was 377 thousand compared to a recapture of 489 thousand in the first quarter of 2021 the provision in the first quarter 2022 is attributable to loan growth offset in part by improved credit quality metrics non interest income in the first quarter 2022 was 9 3 million compared to 10 2 million in the same quarter of 2021 customer service fees were 3 6 million in the first quarter compared to 3 0 million in the same period of 2021 the increase is due to nearly 500 net new accounts that were opened during the quarter and a higher volume of customer activity and transactions wealth management income grew to 3 8 million from 3 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 due to a 5 increase in assets under management mortgage banking income was 624 thousand compared to 2 6 million in the same period of 2021 reflecting higher on balance sheet activity and lower residential loan

million in the same quarter of 2021 a reduction of full time equivalents to 495 from 538 in the first quarter of 2021 resulted in lower salary and benefit expense however that benefit was almost

while only a handful of cases have been reported in the u s dozens of cases have recently been identified in europe washington health experts across the u s and europe are puzzled as mysterious cases of severe hepatitis continue to rise among young children in the u s the centers for disease control cdc issued an alert thursday to physicians nationwide to be on the lookout for liver inflammation the agency has so far confirmed 9 pediatric cases in alabama in children aged 1 to 6 the cdc said that three of the patients went into acute liver failure and two ultimately required liver transplants the uptick follows a recent outbreak that was first identified in europe last week british officials reported 74 cases of hepatitis or liver inflammation found in children since january the usual viruses that cause infectious hepatitis were not seen in the cases and scientists and doctors are considering other possible sources additional cases of hepatitis had been identified in denmark ireland the netherlands and spain the european centre for disease prevention and control said in a statement tuesday without specifying exactly how many cases were found mild hepatitis is very common in children following a range of viral infections but what is being seen at the moment is quite different said graham cooke a professor of infectious diseases at imperial college london some of the children in the u k have required specialist care at liver units and a few have needed a liver transplant the liver processes nutrients filters the blood and fights infections the infections caused symptoms like jaundice diarrhea and abdominal pain hepatitis can be life threatening if left untreated while it s unclear what s causing the illnesses a leading suspect is an adenovirus only some of the children tested positive for coronavirus but the world health organization said genetic analysis of the virus was needed to determine if there were any connections among the cases there are dozens of adenoviruses many of them associated with cold like symptoms fever sore throat and pink eye u s authorities said the nine alabama children tested positive for adenovirus and officials there are exploring a link to one particular version adenovirus 41 that s normally associated with gut inflammation public health officials ruled out any links to covid 19 vaccines saying none of the affected children were vaccinated the who noted that although there has been an increase in adenovirus in britain the potential role of those viruses in triggering hepatitis is unclear who said there were fewer than five possible cases in ireland and three confirmed cases in spain in children aged 22 months to 13 years
the western sanctions against russia decided unilaterally by washington are presented as a just punishment for the aggression against ukraine but without mentioning their illegality under international law everyone can see that they do not reach their target in practice the united states is isolating the west in the hope of maintaining its hegemony over its allies rising tensions 15 the end of western domination by thierry meyssan this article is a follow up to 1 russia wants to force the us to respect the un charter january 4 2022 2 washington pursues rand plan in kazakhstan

the straussians by thierry meyssan voltaire network 5 march 2022 9 a gang of drug addicts and neo nazis 5 march 2022 10 israel stunned by ukrainian neo nazis 8 march 2022 11 ukraine the great manipulation march 22 2022 12 the new world order being prepared under the pretext of war in ukraine 29 march 2022 13 the war propaganda changes its shape 5 april 2022 14 the alliance of mi6 the cia and the banditry 12 april 2022 the united states which was a late participant in the world wars and suffered no losses on its territory emerged victorious from the world conflicts inheriting the european empires it developed a system of domination that made it the world s policeman however their hegemony was fragile and could not resist the development of large nations as early as 2012 political scientists began to describe the thucydides trap by analogy with the greek strategist s explanation of the wars between sparta and athens according to them china s rise to power also made a confrontation with the united states inevitable noting that if china had become the first world economic power russia had become the first military power washington decided to fight them one after the other it is in this context that the war in ukraine took place washington presents it as russian aggression adopts sanctions and forces its allies to take them too the first thing that comes to mind is that the united states knowing that it is militarily inferior but economically superior decided to choose its battlefield however an analysis of the forces involved and the measures taken belies this reading of events washington assassinated iraqi president saddam hussein and libyan leader muamar gaddafi because they dared to question the dominance of the dollar then they looted their central banks the world economic system the global economic system was created by the bretton woods agreement in 1944 they aimed to establish a framework for capitalism beyond the crisis of 1929 for which nazism had not been the solution the united states imposed its currency as a gold convertible benchmark neither the soviet union nor china participated in the conference in 1971 president richard nixon decided to unofficially end the dollar s parity with gold this allowed him to finance the war in vietnam in practical terms there were no longer any fixed exchange rates the measure was not formalized until after the war in 1976 it was also at this time that china formed an alliance with the anglo saxon multinationals the european community the forerunner of the european union adapted by regulating the now floating exchange rates in 1972 the currency snake and then by creating the euro from 1981 onwards the united states began to let its debt slip away it went from 40 of its gdp to 130 today they tried to globalize the world economy i e to impose their rules on the solvent countries and to destroy the state structures of the remaining countries the rumsfeld cebrowski strategy to pay their debt they printed dollars spied on the companies of their allies and stole all the reserves of two big oil states iraq and libya nobody dared to say anything but from 2003 onwards the us economic system was no longer what it claimed to be officially they were still liberal but everyone could see that they were no longer producing their own food and necessities and that they were living on rapine the us economy which was one third of the world economy when the ussr dissolved is now only one tenth many states anticipated the end of the bretton woods rules and thought about a new deal in 2009 brazil russia india and china soon joined by south africa for africa created the brics these countries have set up financial institutions which unlike the imf and the world bank do not make their loans conditional on structural reforms or political commitments to align with washington they prefer to invest on a leasing basis with the host country becoming the owner of the investment when it is profitable in 2010 belarus kazakhstan and russia soon joined by armenia founded the eurasian economic union these border countries established a free trade zone with egypt china iran serbia singapore and vietnam they could be joined by south korea india turkey and syria in 2013 china began its vast new silk roads project the following year when its gdp surpassed that of the united states at purchasing power parity beijing created the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and in 2020 it regulated foreign capital in 2021 the european union devised its global gateway to compete with china and impose its political model but this demand was seen as colonial overreach by many countries and was rejected en masse gradually the russian and chinese blocs have come closer together thanks to the joint project of the great eurasian global partnership 2016 within the framework of the shanghai cooperation organization the aim is to develop the whole space by creating balanced communication channels on the ideological bases defined by kazakh sultan nazerbayev inclusiveness sovereign equality respect for cultural and socio political identity openness and readiness to integrate other ensembles washington s attempt to destroy this emerging entity has no chance of success it is striking that the economic attack began not with the invasion of ukraine but two days before it is primarily directed against russian banks russian billionaires and the russian gas industry and not at all against the new eurasian communication system finally it aims at excluding russia from international organizations but does not concern the states that refuse to condemn russia therefore it will push them into the arms of beijing in other words the us is not isolating russia but it is isolating the west 10 of humanity from the rest of the world 90 of humanity u s president joe biden came to effectively chair the european council on march 24 of which the united states is not a member according to the european treaties it is nato that ensures the security of the european union 0 the very day after moscow recognized the independence of the donetsk and lugansk people s republics february 21 2022 the united states launched an economic attack on russia february 22 the european union followed suit the day after february 23 vnesheconombank and promsvyazbank were excluded from the global financial system vnesheconombank veb rf is a regional development bank it could have helped the donbass promsvyazbank psb invests mainly in the defense sector it could have played a role under the mutual assistance treaty 1 as russia started a special military operation in ukraine february 24 the united states extended the exclusion of the first two banks from the global financial system to all russian banks february 25 the european union followed suit february 25 2 in order to prevent as many states as possible from joining russia washington extended the trade bans to belarus the european union began to deny russian banks access to the swift system as previously instructed by the united states extended sanctions to belarus and censored the russian state media russia today and sputnik march 2 3 washington began to target wealthy russian citizens erroneously called oligarchs with bad relations with the kremlin march 3 and to ban imports of russian energy sources march 8 the european union followed suit but resisted a ban on the import of much needed russian gas march 9 4 washington extended financial sanctions in the imf and world bank expanded the list of oligarchs and bannned the export of luxury goods to russia march 11 the european union followed suit march 15 5 washington ensuref that members of the duma and oligarchs no longer have any rights in the west that russia would no longer be able to use its assets in the usa to pay its debts to the usa and that it would no longer be able to use its gold to pay its debts abroad 24 march the european union followed in these prohibitions it pronounced a ban on the import of russian coal and oil but still no ban on gas see table on february 4 2022 russian and chinese presidents vladimir putin and xi jinping signed a joint statement outlining their vision for sustainable economic development the day after the russian army entered ukraine on february 25 they confirmed by phone that the u s reaction would not change their agreement the rest of the world s response it is an extremely surprising phenomenon to observe the u s has managed to sway a majority of states to its side but these states are the least populous in the world it is as if they have no means of putting pressure on countries capable of independence due to the unilateral actions of the anglo saxons and the european union the world is being divided into two heterogeneous spaces the era of economic globalization is over the economic and financial bridges are being broken one by one reacting swiftly russia has convinced its brics partners to stop trading in dollars and to eventually create a common virtual currency for their exchanges until then they will proceed in gold this currency should be based on a basket of brics currencies weighted according to the gdp of each member state and on a basket of commodities listed on the stock exchange this system should be much more stable than the current one above all russia and china appear to be much more respectful of their partners than the west they never demand structural reforms neither economic nor political the ukrainian affair shows that moscow does not seek to take power in kiev and occupy ukraine but to push back nato and fight the banderites the neo nazis according to kremlin terminology nothing but very legitimate even if the method is brutal in practice we are witnessing the end of four centuries of domination by westerners and their empires it is a confrontation between different ways of thinking westerners now think only in terms of weeks with this short sightedness they may have the impression that the united states is right and the russians wrong on the contrary the rest of the world thinks in decades even centuries in this case there is no doubt that the russians are right and the west as a whole is wrong moreover the west rejects international law they attacked yugoslavia and libya without the authorization of the security council and lied to attack afghanistan and iraq they only accept the rules they make on the contrary the other states aspire to a multipolar world in which each actor would think according to their own culture they are aware that only international law would make it possible to preserve peace in the world as they dream of it rather than confronting russia and china the united states has chosen to withdraw into its empire to isolate the west in order to maintain its hegemony since 2001 all world leaders have viewed the west and particularly the united states as wounded predators they do not dare to confront them and look for ways to accompany them gently to the cemetery no one ever imagined that they would isolate themselves to die thierry meyssan translation roger lagassé read

development and backfilling leveling of drill pits required during well installation this phase is expected to be complete in mid may 2022 following completion of the well work for hh2 4 delineation definition drilling will resume for hhs 2 6 2 7 and 2 8 delineation drilling for hh2 5 is already complete surface component fabrication for hh 2 4 is in progress the building and metering piping has been fabricated all materials for hh 2 4 are onsite with the exception of downhole pumps which are scheduled to arrive prior to completion of the associated infrastructure surface construction will entail trenching and installation of pipelines flowlines and electrical wiring followed by installation of hh2 4 with all its internal data monitoring and safety systems finally the pumps and insulating wellhead covers will be installed prior to groundcover seeding of the production area hh 2 4 is expected to be ready for production in 2022 q3 with advance preparations and the likelihood of supply chain delays in mind we are pre ordering and purchasing well installation materials for additional header houses construction materials have been ordered through hh 2 5 and long lead items have been ordered for hh 2 6 ur energy ceo john cash said given recent geopolitical events as well as legislation proposed in congress uncertainty is increasing with respect to continued secure supplies of uranium although no contracts have been reached at this time we are pursuing discussions with several domestic nuclear utilities concerning off take sales arrangements particularly in light of the rapidly changing market we are pleased to report the progress of our advance preparations at lost creek which will accelerate our ability to quickly ramp up in addition to the wellfield drilling and construction begun in q4 we have taken additional steps in q1 to purchase materials for wellfield construction with a goal of having production ready header houses when a go decision is made we will continue to monitor supply chain issues and developments in the uranium market to remain ahead of possible production demands wellfield construction and development is not the only ongoing work toward ramp up staff are actively pursuing further innovations for lost creek and beyond ur energy prides itself in leading the industry on technical and permitting matters such as water treatment engineering design of ion exchange vessels well abandonment methods and aquifer exemptions by its nature r d is difficult and the results are never certain but the company believes we must continue to advance technology if we wish to become more cost competitive on a global scale and we are advancing several such projects to date costs of the r d efforts have not been significant we are pleased to provide an update on two of the more advanced and promising r d projects progress report on r d activities casing and well installation technology during 2021 q4 as plans were being made to initiate the ongoing drilling programs it became apparent that well casing is in short supply as are drilling contractors many of whom left the uranium industry and or have become more costly due to high demand from a variety of industries to address both issues in order to advance our mu2 drilling programs in a timely and cost effective manner a review of alternate casing materials and well installation technologies was undertaken through the review company staff identified a material that is in nearly all technical respects including internal and external pressure ratings equivalent or superior to the pvc well casing used historically in the in situ industry we have identified suppliers able to provide the material with acceptable lead times and at a cost significantly lower than current pvc casing costs well installation methods were required to be engineered to utilize the new casing material additionally a non significant permit amendment describing those changes was submitted and is currently being reviewed by the wyoming department of environmental quality land quality division due to the material s properties it may be used for injection wells but not for production wells at an in situ facility injection wells generally represent approximately 65 of the wells throughout wellfields designed with traditional five spot recovery patterns in addition to its relatively low cost the proposed method if proven out is expected to reduce drill rig time on injection wells by about 70 and reduce environmental impacts the company expects the cost savings from reduced drill rig time to be partially offset by the need for additional in house labor assuming the land quality division grants approval of the material and the associated installation methods the company will test the concept by installing a small number of wells at lost creek while the efficacy of the method will not be known until completion of the planned initial tests the company is sufficiently optimistic about the material and the installation methods it has engineered that in february 2022 a provisional patent was filed with the u s patent office to protect the intellectual property as additional information becomes available the company will continue to provide updates water recycling and filtration ur energy has been an industry leader in water recycling through the successful engineering permitting and implementation of its class v system and continues to make strides on further improvements engineering of an advanced water treatment system that will allow an additional 90 reduction of disposed water beyond gains already achieved with our class v system is entering advanced stage analyses expected to be completed by 2022 q4 the value of increasing the rate of recycling is that less wastewater requiring disposal will be generated while our existing lost creek permit allows for the installation of two additional deep disposal wells these wells are expensive to install the objective of this r d work is to treat a sufficient quantity of wastewater to minimize the number of additional deep disposal wells required at lost creek and in turn recycle the majority of that fluid as clean class v injectate as designed the system will also provide enhanced water filtration of injection fluids which may allow for the removal of existing and future header house filtration systems if the remaining design engineering and economic studies are successful we anticipate that these processes and technology will also be utilized at our shirley basin

on january 14 2021 certain institutional investors brought an action against a group of closed end funds organized as massachusetts business trusts and their trustees seeking rescission of a control share bylaw provision and a declaratory judgment to the effect that the control share bylaw is illegal the control share bylaw provision in question generally provides that an acquisition of shares that results in a shareholder owning more than 10 percent of a fund s outstanding shares prevents that shareholder from voting shares in excess of 10 percent unless specifically authorized by the affirmative vote of fund s other shareholders the control share bylaw is intended to operate in a manner similar to control share provisions under state corporate statutes plaintiffs contended that the control share bylaw was inconsistent with section 18 i of the investment company act of 1940 which provides that every share of stock issued by a registered management company shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock the defendants presented numerous arguments against the plaintiffs contention and in particular noted the staff of the sec s recission in may 2020 of a 2010 no action letter the boulder letter setting forth the staff s former view that a closed end fund opting into a state control share statute would be inconsistent with section 18 i on february 17 2022 the u s district court for the southern district of new york granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their claims for rescission of the control share bylaw and a declaratory judgment concluding that the control share bylaw was inconsistent with section 18 i of the 1940 act in so deciding the court focused on the plain language of section 18 i concluding that what makes a stock voting depends on its holder s ability to presently vote the stock and that a control share bylaw that deprives a shareholder of this ability even temporarily renders the stock not a voting security under the 1940 act the order was issued under the caption saba capital cef opportunities 1 ltd et al v nuveen floating rate income fund et al no 21 cv 327 on february 25 2022 the funds and their trustees filed a notice of their intention to appeal the district court s order

when terence rogers started his catering business tbd foods in 2014 he realized that a lot of leftover ingredients like strawberry tops potato skins and kale stems were being discarded after meals while honing his skills in boston kitchens he heard about a restaurant in copenhagen that operated a fine dining restaurant and a casual sister brunch joint by divvying up ingredients between the two restaurants to use whole foods and minimize waste so rogers decided to create something similar in denver and in july 2020 opened sullivan scrap kitchen in city park west which incorporates scraps and ingredients that would otherwise be tossed from the catering business into creative dishes for the restaurant at the casual eatery diners can feel better about what they eat with delicious earth friendly entrées such as green chile migas with lamb neck pancakes and sopapillas made from sourdough discard and sage scented gnocchi tossed with kale stem pesto a lot of times with catering there s a little more element of fine dining people want a really nice steak or really nice piece of fish but there s only so many of those per animal rogers says so we wanted to be able to find different avenues to utilize some of the products that we were getting in addition to repurposing scraps sullivans also sources its ingredients locally with producers like river bear american meats and buckner family ranch as well as offering compostable to go containers for rogers it s important to be sustainable because we want to be doing this for a long time he says if we want things to last and have long term success focusing things on a more sustainable approach just seems like the sensible and right thing to do for our environment in honor of earth day we caught up with rogers to learn how denverites can make more sustainable choices in their home kitchens from reimagining veggie scraps to learning to break down and use a whole animal don t toss compost one of the simplest and easiest things you can do to make your home more sustainable is to compost it s an easy way to cut out the excess food rogers says you can put in tea bags paper towels that have been used and compostable containers weekly compost collection is available to denverites for 117 per year and compost from the program can be purchased for 7 a bag at ace hardware locations around town to take home and use in your garden it s nice when you can have something that directly goes to compost and that gets turned into something that can be used by yourself or others in the city he says i think composting is a really good starting point reevaluate the sell by date another way to be kind in the kitchen is to be flexible with sell by dates on perishable items all these dates that you get from the store they re just a recommendation they re not like a hard line of this is gonna go bad this exact date rogers says he recommends looking closely at your food when deciding whether to throw it out smell and taste it to see if it s truly expired milk for instance it s probably good for another two or three days depending on the quality and how it s made rogers says while there s a time and a place to prioritize fresh foods raw fish and proteins are best consumed fresh rogers says sustainable practices like freezing can help reduce waste a lot of times frozen stuff is just as good depending on how you re using it he says if you re putting spinach in your smoothie and you ve got some spinach in the fridge that s starting to go bad you can just throw that in the freezer and you re never going to notice the difference in taste if it s in a smoothie or a stew you can always freeze your stuff and come back to it later learn to break down a bird to make meat eating more sustainable rogers suggests learning to break down a whole chicken or fish creating cooking friendly cuts at home if you can cut an onion i feel like you can break down a chicken he says it s fairly straightforward and then you can get an appreciation for using the whole animal aside from roasting the chicken breasts rogers recommends braising the legs for pasta dishes tacos or soup you can also render fat or make homemade chicken stock from the wings and bones a practice that not only yields healthy delicious pantry staples but makes use of the entire bird i feel like chicken is like the perfect way to dip your toes into he says it s a very approachable easy quick thing that if you do eat meat it s just a different way to look at how you eat meat and how much you can get out of just one animal versus buying only boneless skinless chicken breasts save veggie scraps reimagining vegetable scraps are one of the most versatile ways to cut back on food waste rogers says instead of consuming only the most pristine parts save your kale or mushroom stems onion skins beet or ginger peels and carrot tops for stocks soups risottos and sauces at sullivans he makes a beet and ginger simple syrup using just the peels from the roots or after roasting beets he ll remove the skins and place them in white balsamic vinegar to create a seasoned vinegar for salad dressings you might not be able to eat every part of the vegetable just like you can t eat a bone he says but at least there s flavor there that you can extract whether through syrups or stocks or turning those maybe less pristine pieces into a soup or a puree or folding it into rice or something you can really find a way to utilize almost all of the vegetable pieces for example try your hand at some of rogers s go to uses for veggie scraps chile pepper tops place in oil or vinegar to make homemade chile infusions onion skins and vegetable offcuts throw in a gallon size bag or container in your freezer and make stock when it s full kale stems blanch stems and run them through a food processor to make a pesto base stale quinoa deep fry to make crispy salad toppings broccoli kale and mushroom stems pulverize in a food processor and mix with beans for veggie burgers potato skins deep fry to make chips or nachos fare made with scraps from sullivans scrap kitchen photo by riane menardi morrison eggs benedict from sullivans scrap kitchen photo by riane menardi morrison sourdough pancake from sullivans scrap kitchen photo by riane menardi morrison shop at farmers markets supporting your local farmers and ranchers is a great way to focus on food sustainability rogers says especially when you shop with vendors who maintain healthy soil or emphasize organic practices and animal welfare if more people hopefully that just becomes the norm and we can start to move away from factory farming and factory ranching he says if you go to the markets late in the day you may even be able to strike a deal with producers who can t or don t want to bring the produce back to their farms he says also ask for or seek out ugly produce which may not look as appealing as supermarket specimens but are still delicious you don t need the prettiest heirloom tomato to make tomato sauce rogers says for those who have the time and desire rogers says that less than pristine produce can also be canned preserved and fermented time tested ways to extend the life of summer s bounty think drinks when imagining how to repurpose scraps in the kitchen think outside the oven and consider how food scraps can elevate a beverage you can make simple syrups or if you like to make cocktails at home or tinctures you can make shrubs or mocktails rogers says for instance instead of tossing out strawberry tops rogers uses them as a base for shrubs sweet tart vinegar based drinks that can be consumed on their own or mixed into cocktails or mocktails he also recommends making limeade with beet and ginger peels lime juice and mint for a refreshing summer beverage can be a nice creative way to use things he says

of 29 1 million or 3 7 compared to the business lending portfolio of 779 9 million at march 31 2021 the decrease in the business lending portfolio compared to december 31 2021 is primarily driven by

primarily driven by the forgiveness of ppp loans consumer loans totaled 15 6 million at march 31 2022 a decrease of 2 0 million or 11 3 compared to 17 6 million at december 31 2021 and a decrease of 2

1 million or 8 8 compared to 2 01 billion at march 31 2021 the increase in deposits compared to december 31 2021 is due to organic growth investar acquired approximately 207 0 million in deposits from cheaha at the time of acquisition on april 1 2021 the remaining increase compared to march 31 2021 is due to organic growth the covid 19 pandemic has created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market and as a result we have experienced large increases in both noninterest and interest bearing demand deposits and in money market deposit accounts and savings accounts compared to december 31 2021 and march 31 2021 these increases were primarily driven by reduced spending by consumer and business customers related to the covid 19 pandemic and increases in some ppp borrowers deposit accounts we believe these factors may be temporary depending on the future economic effects of the covid 19 pandemic our deposit mix continues to improve and reflects our consistent focus on relationship banking and growing our commercial relationships as well as the effects of the pandemic on consumer and business spending noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits

31 2021 the increase in net interest margin for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2021 was driven by a five basis point increase in the yield on our loan portfolio and a 23 basis point increase in yield on our securities portfolio together resulting in a 15 basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets the increase in net interest margin for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to the quarter ended march 31 2021 was driven by a 38 basis point decrease in the cost of deposits partially offset by a 16 basis point decrease in the

had a 23 basis point increase in the yield on our securities portfolio compared to the quarter ended december 31 2021 the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets compared to the quarter ended

ended december 31 2021 and march 31 2021 reflects the decrease in rates paid for all categories of interest bearing deposits with the exception of brokered deposits when compared to december 31 2021 the bank uses brokered deposits to satisfy the required borrowings under its interest rate swap agreements due to more favorable pricing as of march 31 2022 and december 31 2021 there was no balance of brokered deposits the average brokered deposit balance during the quarter ended march 31 2022 related to swap agreements that were terminated during the quarter the overall costs of funds for the

2021 the decrease in the cost of funds for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to the quarters ended december 31 2021 and march 31 2021 resulted from both lower cost of deposits and lower average

noninterest income compared to the quarter ended december 31 2021 was driven by 3 3 million in swap termination fees and a 0 8 million increase in the gain on sale or disposition of fixed assets the increase in noninterest income compared to the quarter ended march 31 2021 is mainly attributable to 3 3 million in swap termination fees partially offset by a 0 6 million decrease in the gain on sale of investment securities swap termination fees were recorded when investar voluntarily terminated a number of interest rate swap agreements during the first quarter of 2022 in response to market conditions and as a result of excess liquidity in the past few years investar has entered into multiple forward starting pay fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure against the variability in expected future cash flows in anticipation of rising rates however the borrowings required by the swap agreements provide excess liquidity and put downward pressure on the yield on our interest earning assets and net interest margin we elected to terminate a number of swap contracts that became effective in the first quarter of 2022 or would be effective in the second quarter of 2022 to avoid additional excess liquidity and net interest margin compression investar had forward starting interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of 60 million as of march 31 2022

2 compared to the first quarter of 2021 the increase in noninterest expense for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2021 was driven by the 1 9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense which resulted from the 1 9 million employee retention credit recognized as a credit to payroll taxes during the quarter ended december 31 2021 the increase in noninterest expense for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to the quarter ended march 31 2021 is primarily a result of a 0 4 increase in other operating expenses and 0 3 increase in salaries and employee benefits the increase in other operating expenses was driven by an increase in collection and repossession expenses the majority of which is related to one impaired loan relationship the increase in salaries and employee benefits is primarily attributable to the acquisition of cheaha on april 1 2021 which added four branch locations and related staff taxes investar recorded an income tax expense of 2 6 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 which equates to an effective tax rate of 20 5 an increase from the effective tax rate of 19 1 at december 31 2021 and a decrease from

ebitda margin last year this number peaked at 12 3 during 2020 and has been generally impressive over the past several years utilization rates and backlog numbers have been major contributors to the

eth 3 004 top gainers there are no gainers in coindesk 20 today top losers bitcoin retreats after touching 42k front end loading sounds like the early phase of a construction project and that s the phrase federal reserve chair jerome powell used thursday to describe a possible strategy by the u s central bank to tamp down inflation running at a four decade high the idea is the fed might enact a series of steep interest rate increases say 0 5 percentage point per meeting versus the more typical 0 25 percentage point to make sure consumer prices don t spiral out of control we re really going to be raising rates and getting expeditiously to levels that are more neutral and then that are actually tight powell said during a panel with european central bank president christine lagarde arranged by the international monetary fund imf the risk is that higher borrowing costs crimp spending and investment and then the economy slides into a recession bitcoin is seen by many investors as an inflation hedge and it s also seen as a risky asset that might come under pressure during a period of shrinking economic growth so powell s hawkish tone was enough to send bitcoin s price lower just as the largest cryptocurrency appeared to be gaining steam the price reached a 10 day high nearly touching 43 000 but then slid back toward 40 000 erasing recent days gains bitcoin price action has continued to whipsaw between a wider range of 38 47 000 tammy da costa analyst at dailyfx told coindesk s angelique chen u s stocks ended the day lower and u s treasury yields rose markets s p 500 1 5 djia 0 8 nasdaq 2 1 gold 1 953 0 1 insights one year after coinbase s ipo most listed crypto companies are underwater the last quarter of 2020 was an exciting time bitcoin seemed meteoric given the new institutional interest in the asset class coinbase global coin filed preliminary paperwork with the securities and exchange commission sec for a listing and soon after pre ipo contracts were trading on ftx that valued the company close to 75 billion but just over a year since its ipo coinbase s stock is down nearly 55 underperforming bitcoin which is down around 26 for the same time period to be sure many tech stocks are also down for this same period as investors appetite for listed crypto companies seems to have waned in a note published last year singapore s qcp capital wrote that investors were no longer assigning a strong premium to licenses and regulatory friendliness like they once did which would in turn put pressure on coinbase s stock tradingview that premium has been on the pretext that it would give them a free pass while governmental agencies took their war on crypto to other platforms and exchanges instead like binance qcp wrote at the time if now a regulated u s entity who is offering a product that is already being offered in the u s going through the proper legal route can face such harsh action then nobody is assured to be safe anymore coinbase s regulatory compliance and u s base also keeps it out of some of the more interesting parts of crypto like lending it also meant that coinbase had a slow start in the derivatives market which overtook the spot market for the first time in june 2021 behind many of its non us based rivals likely turning investors away from its stock hong kong s bc technology group which runs the institutional focused digital assets platform osl has seen a similar fate with its stock although it had a brief rally after positive earnings the stock is down nearly 66 over the last year mining stocks aren t fairing much better riot blockchain riot which operates bitcoin mining farms throughout the u s is down nearly 66 over the last year while marathon digital mara another miner is down 40 canaan can a manufacturer of mining equipment is down nearly 70 tradingview michael del grosso an analyst at compass point research who covers miners explains this poor performance by saying in a previous coindesk interview mining stocks currently are leveraged plays on the price of bitcoin these mining stocks had their moment when china ordered operations shut in country and the global hash rate was in flux but as that sorted itself out and bitcoin flirted with all time highs yet couldn t sustain itself the stocks sank like rocks currently compass point maintains a neutral rating on riot blockchain this begs the question are there any listed crypto companies that are actually above the water line indeed there are crypto banks like silvergate capital and signature bank tradingview both of these banks which provide banking services to crypto exchanges have managed to outperform bitcoin over the last year given that they are tied to exchanges their value is based upon the volume of transactions on an exchange and volume is maintained at a brisk pace as is demand for other tools silvergate provides like leverage so perhaps the problem with these listed companies isn t a market hostility to listed crypto companies but rather that the market needs more than them just being a proxy for the price of bitcoin technician s take bitcoin momentum strengthens despite short term pause

by tracy record west seattle blog editor as always the morgan community association packed a long list of topics into its quarterly meeting facilitated online last night by moca president deb barker electric vehicle charging lot we first reported on this a month ago seattle city light wants to convert the 4 520 square foot former substation at 4118 sw morgan into an 8 space fast charger lot for electric vehicles coby zeifman from scl came to the moca meeting to make the first public presentation about the proposal joined by theo gideon also of scl the site operated as a substation 1945 2002 it s scheduled for soil cleanup later this year for everyone who has suggested using the site as housing instead gideon noted that it would have to be declared as no longer serving scl s current and future needs but scl does not consider that to be the case construction will last about three months and could start before the end of this year the site would hold fast chargers that could bring a vehicle up to 80 charged within about half an hour so zeifman said it would not be a long term parking lot he stressed that the roughed out sketch is nowhere near an official design and the eventual project could be configured quite differently zeifman said the trees on the site must be removed because they would not survive the cleanup process but they ll each be replaced by two new trees in q a zeifman was asked why couldn t they use a nearby private parking lot for ev charging instead that s not particularly relevant he replied as city light owns this property and plans to use its own property to provide this benefit to the community why wouldn t this site be considered as affordable housing because the site hasn t been declared surplus property unlike the one in highland park that is being considered for affordable housing which was declared surplus years ago what about crime prevention through environmental design concepts for site design lighting graffiti prevention etc we haven t begun the design phase yet but we can incorporate those concepts if that s important to the community replied zeifman how will the site be maintained who will weed it often enough and keep it from becoming an eyesore zeifman didn t know gideon noted that scl does have its own vegetation management division what s the plan for it not becoming an encampment zeifman said another colleague at scl should be able to address that how has usage been at the scl junction charging station zeifman didn t have that handy they ll provide a reply by email but anecdotally said it tends to be one of our better used sites also how much noise will the transformer at the site generate that info wasn t available either but they ll look into it the transformer is quiet when no one s charger he said with so many questions unanswered moca president barker invited them back to the july meeting meantime the survey about the plan runs through friday answer it here other moca topics morgan junction

a chicken at nightfall farm eats a grasshopper august 2019 liz and nate brownlee strive to treat their animals ethically raising them on pasture and in a healthy natural environment liz brownlee photo provided when dave ring was a kid in the 1980s he hated apples they re called red delicious is the type of apple and they were coated in wax and they were mealy and they were disgusting he said in the 80s ring said food was mostly industrialized and food producers strived to make a consistent product in high quantities when he tried an organically produced apple one produced solely with natural substances and processes according to usda gov the difference was night and day he said i never knew that they could taste crisp juicy sweet all these different flavors different varieties of apples not just washington delicious ring said the distinction between organically produced food and commercially produced food would become the inspiration and mission of the downtown farm stand a downtown muncie grocery store ring and his wife sara ring opened in may 2007 located at 125 e main st the downtown farm stand offers a wide range of organically and sustainably produced goods including food toiletries candies and even cider and beer the rings have run and developed the store for nearly 15 years but they originally aspired to be farmers sara said after moving to muncie from california they bought their farm on eaton albany pike in august 1999 and planted sunflowers in the fields for their wedding which they also held on their farm dave and sara planted their first crop the following spring sara said we sold to restaurants here in muncie we sold to farmers markets here in muncie we sold to restaurants and farmers markets in indianapolis a little bit of everything dave said dave said he noticed most farmer s markets would follow a business model of reselling goods bought from produce auctions marketing outlets where farmers sell excess produce at wholesale prices instead of directly from local farms a lot of times will tell you that it s just because they want to have a full selection of products all throughout the season dave said and that s a reason but it s not a way to really grow a local farm economy from 2004 06 dave and sara started their own farmer s market on 400 s walnut st next to the canan commons in downtown muncie dave said choosing a downtown location was a very deliberate choice we want to give inner city neighborhoods access to fresh food dave said there s a perception that only wealthy people or more snobby people eat organic food it s not true low income people like to have access to clean food too in may 2007 the rings moved to their current location at 125 e main st and made their farm stand a brick and mortar business they first tried simultaneously to run both the store and their farm on eaton albany pike but the store wasn t sustainable with limited hours dave said an old worn out sign for the downtown farm stand welcomes visitors march 24 125 e main st is one of downtown muncie s oldest buildings dating back to the 1800s as a drug store miguel naranjo dn we decided that to make it work we were going to have to go full time so then we did 10 to 7 monday through saturday dave said and that seemed to do a lot just being available right away their efforts were noticed and recognized by locals such as janice largent regular customer of the downtown farm stand she has lived in muncie since 2002 and read about the downtown farm stand in the newspaper when they first opened in 2007 having grown up on a farm i cared about how the land s taken care of largent said i m not a trained environmentalist i just always care about the environment when she first began buying groceries at the rings store they were still in the process of renovating the space and cleaning out the previous owner s belongings even though they only had about one fourth of the products they currently have available largent said she started buying from them because she trusted their groceries were organic and their animal products were humanely raised dave said their commitment to the local farm economy is strong purchasing from local farms like the nightfall farm in crothersville indiana helps the rings stock their shelves while reducing their carbon footprint since their products aren t shipped over long distances my husband takes it as a point of pride that we re not a big corporation or conglomerate said liz brownlee co owner of nightfall farm and president of the hoosier young farmers coalition which seeks to recruit and support beginning farmers in indiana we are one farm and part of a community of lots of different farmers liz and her husband nate brownlee attended hanover college and studied biology and anthropology respectively however they each got the idea of starting a farm from a philosophy of food class nate took during his senior year for the class nate visited several small farms near hanover indiana and learned about their organic growing processes liz said inspired by this month long intensive course the brownlees started working as apprentices on organic farms in maine and vermont for five years after college i think for it was like a light bulb went off liz said the brownlees started their own farm in spring 2014 on liz s family s land and currently raise chickens turkeys pigs and sheep for meat as well as laying hens for eggs they raise their animals on pasture meaning they are free to roam outdoors and eat fresh grass and foliage liz said the way you eat really impacts the natural word we vote with our forks three times a day right liz said do we want to be supporting farmers that are sequestering carbon and providing habitat and keeping food local or do we want to be supporting farms that ship food halfway around the world and grow things out of season and treat animals abysmally in addition to raising animals on pasture the brownlees also focus on farming procedures that isolate carbon in the ground and reduce their carbon footprint these include silvopasture integrating trees into the same land that animals graze on and rotational grazing where animals are shifted over time between several different spaces to graze on allowing the foliage to grow back while the animals are away i m definitely a believer in large scale change liz said about tempering the effects of climate change we also need small change when people buy good food at small groceries as eaters that s their way of being part of the climate solution and when farmers like us can choose to farm in a way that sequesters carbon that s our act the brownlees met dave and sara ring when the rings usual source of chicken stopped raising chickens and focused his efforts on raising other animals liz said the rings posted a message on facebook asking about local farmers with pasture raised chicken and the hoosier young farmers coalition told them about the nightfall farm nate brownlee left and liz brownlee right co owners and operators of nightfall farm in crothersville ind pose for a photo april 2014 they began their careers eight years ago working on organic vegetable farms across maine and vermont liz brownlee photo provided the brownlees sell not only to local grocery stores like the downtown farm stand but also directly to individual customers through their community supported agriculture csa program in a csa individuals buy a whole share at once of a certain farm s product for a defined period of time in the case of nightfall farm six months this not only funds the farm with up front payments but also guarantees there will be a product for customers to buy when they need it it s very much based on a relationship so we get to know the csa members liz said we see them every month for pickup at the farmers market we give them updates about the farm and they get really good food between the support from local grocery stores and the nightfall farm csa liz said she and nate can steadily expand their farming operation and sustain their specific methods grocery stores like the downtown farm stand and people like dave and sara mean that we can go into the future with some confidence and security liz said dave and sara ring have been steadily developing the downtown farm stand since opening in 2007 with their rented space they opened a deli in september 2009 selling food made with organic ingredients and started a grocery delivery service in november 2011 spanning several towns in northeastern indiana in december 2019 they purchased the rest of the building their store is based out of restoring the second floor so it can be rented out for events the rings plan to expand their business further in the vein of food service dave said including a bar and restaurant second story based on the second floor they believe it will open this summer dave also said the name second story has a double meaning not only is it on the second story of our building he said but it s also the beginning of the next chapter of the downtown farm stand contact miguel naranjo with comments at miguel naranjo bsu edu

jennings la accesswire april 21 2022 jd bancshares inc the company otcqx jdvb the parent holding company of jd bank the bank reports its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended march 31 2022 net income for the three month period ended march 31 2022 is 2 108 163 or 0 62 per share compared to 2 977 470 or 0 87 per share for the linked quarter ended december 31 2021 and 1 919 989 or 0 56 per share for the prior year period ended march 31 2021 pre tax pre provision operating income for the current quarter was 2 291 078 compared to 3 056 080 for the linked quarter and 2 038 890 for the prior year quarter pre tax pre provision operating income excludes taxes loan loss provision net losses on the sale of other real estate owned net gains on the disposal of available for sale investment securities and the recognition of origination fees on loans made pursuant to the paychecks protection program ppp the decrease in pre tax pre provision operating earnings in the current period compared to the linked period is primarily due to a decline in non interest income and an increase in non interest expenses the increase compared to the prior year quarter is due to an increase in net interest income and partially offset by increases in non interest expenses bruce elder president and ceo commented while current quarter net income increased over the prior year period changes in ppp fee recognition the impact of interest rate volatility on equity investments and mortgage originations and a more pronounced occurrence of check and debit card fraud makes for challenging comparisons net income did increase by 9 8 over the march 31 2021 but declined by 29 2 over the linked quarter net interest income is 193 000 lower than the december 31 2021 quarter but is adversely impacted by a 292 000 decline in ppp fee recognition non interest income is 639 000 lower and includes a 199 000 fair market adjustment to an equity investment and a 103 000 decrease in gains on the sale of mortgage originations non interest expenses are 220 000 higher than the linked quarter due in part to a 172 000 increase in losses attributable to fraud on deposit accounts overall we are pleased with the results and believe we made strides in reallocating our balance sheet to higher earning asset categories we experienced a net increase in our loan portfolio of 19 8 million and shifted cash into our investment portfolio for a net increase of 30 7 million before accounting for unrealized losses from interest rate fluctuations we will continue to look for quality opportunities to enhance our net interest margin paycheck protection program lending ppp as of march 31 2022 there are 133 ppp loans totaling 10 3 million that remain outstanding during the first three months of 2022 we received 5 9 million in repayments from sba forgiveness and customer payments there are four borrowers who initially received loans in 2020 totaling 1 5 million and 129 borrowers who received loans in 2021 totaling 8 8 million the 2020 borrowers are making payments and the 2021 borrowers have until the middle of 2022 to apply for forgiveness the company received origination fees from the sba for participating in the program at origination we recognized as interest income that portion of the fee estimated to be our internal cost of origination the remainder is amortized over the contractual life of the loan if the loan is forgiven or repaid early the remaining unamortized portion is recognized as interest income in the month of repayment amounts recognized as interest income for the quarters ended march 31 2022 december 31 2021 and march 31 2021 are 206 000 498 000 and 814 000 respectively as of march 31 2022 we had approximately 406 000 in deferred ppp origination fees to be recognized in future periods asset quality loans past due 30 to 89 days at march 31 2022 are 1 1 million or 0 17 of the total loans outstanding compared to 1 3 million or 0 21 of total loans reported at december 31 2021 total nonperforming assets including loans on non accrual status other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets were 6 1 million at march 31 2022 increasing from 5 2 million at december 31 2021 when comparing non performing assets at march 31 2022 to december 31 2021 loans on non accrual status increased by 1 0 million to 5 1 million from 4 1 million and oreo decreased slightly to 960 000 from 1 1 million there are no repossessed assets at either of those dates management performs a quarterly evaluation of oreo properties and believes their adjusted carrying values are representative of their fair market values although there is no assurance that the ultimate sales will be equal or greater than the carrying values the company did not record any provisions for credit losses in the current and linked quarters compared to a 165 000 provision in q1 2021 the allowance for loan losses alll is 8 1 million at march 31 2022 or 1 27 of total loans compared to 8 2 million at december 31 2021 or 1 32 of total loans net charge offs are 50 000 for the current period compared to 185 000 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and 387 000 for the prior year comparative period we believe the current level of our alll is adequate however there is no assurance that regulators increased risks in the loan portfolio or changes in economic conditions will not require future adjustments to the alll net interest income net interest income for q1 2022 is 8 8 million compared to 9 0 million for the linked quarter and 8 4 million for the prior year quarter when excluding the aforementioned recognition of ppp origination fees net interest income increased by 99 000 compared to q4 2021 and 995 000 compared to q1 2021 net interest income is influenced by both the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as the federal reserve begins to increase short term interest rates to help curb inflation and the size of our loan portfolio continues to expand we anticipate that net interest income will increase throughout the remainder of 2022 interest income on loans excluding ppp origination fees increased by 233 000 for the current quarter compared with the prior year period although the average loans outstanding for both q1 2022 and 2021 are the same at 624 2 million a significant amount of ppp loans with interest rates of 1 were replaced by higher earning loans the average yield on loans excluding ppp origination fees increased to 4 87 from 4 71 a year ago due to the net increase in volume of asset categories other than loans the yield on total earning assets dropped to 3 25 in the current quarter compared to 3 26 in the prior year quarter total cost of funds declined to 0 34 in the current quarter from 0 40 a year ago the lower cost of funds coupled with the strong volume of loan originations offsetting ppp loan repayments resulted in an improved net interest margin of 2 91 compared to 2 86 a year ago compared to the linked quarter net interest margin is unchanged at 2 91 yield on total earning assets declined slightly from 3 26 at q4 2021 and was adversely impacted by a decline in ppp origination fees recognized of 292 000 the cost of funds declined by just 1 basis point from 0 35 for the linked quarter non interest income total non interest income is 2 7 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 3 3 million for the linked quarter and 2 7 million for the prior year quarter service charges and fees associated with deposit accounts are 2 2 million for the current quarter 77 000 lower than the december 2021 quarter and 264 000 higher than march 2021 quarter the reduction in service charges and fee income between current and linked quarters is primarily due to a decrease in debit card interchange revenue of 78 000 the increase in service charges and fee income between current and prior year quarters is due to increases in nsf fees and interchange revenue of 230 000 and 24 000 respectively mortgage loan activity has slowed as housing inventory is low and interest rates began to increase gains from the sale of mortgage loans originated in the current period are 239 000 compared to 342 000 and 337 000 reported for the linked and prior year quarters other non interest income is 201 000 for the current quarter 660 000 for the linked quarter and 376 000 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 other non interest income for the current quarter is adversely impacted by mark to market losses on an equity investment fair value losses associated with market fluctuations amounted to 237 000 for the current quarter compared to 38 000 for the linked quarter and 65 000 for the prior year quarter the largest components of other non interest income over the three comparative periods continues to be from trust and brokerage services those two revenue sources totaled 259 000 474 000 and 265 000 respectively for the three periods the prior year quarter includes a gain on the disposal of available for sale securities of 2 200 non interest expense total non interest expense is 9 0 million compared to 8 7 million for the linked quarter and 8 6 million for the prior year quarter salaries and benefits is the largest component of non interest expenses and decreased by 23 000 compared to the december 2021 quarter and increased by 258 000 compared to the march 2021 quarter total salaries and benefits expense is 4 6 million 4 6 million and 4 3 million for the three comparative quarters data processing expenses are 1 2 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 1 0 for the linked quarter and 978 000 for the prior year quarter data processing expenses are elevated during the first quarter of the year due to additional charges for year end processing routines creation of tax documents and other annual processes the level of data processing expenses are tied to the number of accounts and tend to increase with new customer acquisition occupancy expense in the current quarter is 1 2 million compared to 1 3 million for the december 2021 quarter and is in line with the 1 2 million recorded in the prior year quarter we announced opening a new office in july in lake charles louisiana that will replace a branch destroyed during hurricane laura in conjunction with the opening we will be closing and consolidating the operations of another branch in close proximity to the new branch location other than some non recurring charges related to the consolidation efforts occupancy expenses associated with the new branch should be offset by savings from the closed branch advertising marketing and business development expenses are also relatively constant at 342 000 313 000 and 352 000 for the comparative quarters marketing expenses are likely to increase in q2 2022 as we celebrate our 75th anniversary all other non interest expenses are 1 7 million for the current quarter compared

quarter are comprised of fraud losses professional fees ad valorem taxes fdic deposit insurance assessments and telecommunications losses associated with debit card and check fraud increased by 154 and 293 compared to the linked and prior year quarters respectively income tax expense is 388 000 for the current quarter compared with 571 000 for the linked quarter and 362 000 for the prior year quarter effective tax rates for the three comparative quarters are relatively stable at 15 54 16 10 and 15 85 respectively balance sheet total assets declined by 47 6 million or 3 5 to 1 31 billion at march 31 2021 from 1 36 billion at december 31 2021 the net decline in total assets results from the company s redemption of subordinated debt issued in 2017 a net decrease in deposits and the decline in the market value of investment securities available for sale during the current quarter the company used 73 6 million in cash to increase the investment portfolio by a net 30 7 million increase loans held for investment by a net 19 8 million redeem 17 5 million in previously issued subordinated debt and fund a net decrease in deposits of 5 6 million due to the sharp rise in interest rates the fair market value of our available securities decreased by 29 2 million during the first quarter of 2022 this resulted in an increase in the deferred income tax asset of 6 1 million and the difference of 23 1 million was a reduction in equity in the form of unrealized loss on available for sale securities as previously mentioned deposits declined by 5 6 million during the first three months of 2022 decreases of 5 3 million in money market accounts 5 1 million in interest bearing demand and 1 9 million in certificates of deposit were partially offset by increases of 5 3 million in non interest demand and 1 4 million in savings accounts the company historically sees public fund deposits increase in advance of year end and flow back out after the first of the year public funds which are in the interest bearing demand category declined by 7 7 million other liabilities decreased by 19 8 during the three month period as a result of the subordinated debt redemption and the payment of previously accrued expenses stockholders equity declined by 22 2 million to 79 0 million at march 31 2022 from 101 2 million at december 31 2021 the decrease is primarily due to the reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income of 23 1 million since december 31 2021 as rising interest rates had an adverse impact on the net fair market value of the company s investment portfolio other changes to stockholders equity include net income of 2 1 million less 858 000 in cash dividends declared and paid during the quarter and 393 000 in share repurchases due to the decline in accumulated other comprehensive income tangible book value per common share decreased to 21 90 at march 31 2022 compared to 28 28 at december 31 2021 key performance ratios return on average assets roa in the current quarter is 0 64 compared to 0 88 and 0 60 for the linked and prior year quarters respectively the decline in roa between q1 2022 and q4 2021 was due to a reduction in net income

wade dahood a colorful charismatic anaconda lawyer who often made headlines in high profile cases during a 70 year career and was instrumental in writing an expansive declaration of rights into a new montana constitution in 1972 has died he was 94 dahood died peacefully on monday after a short illness with family members by his side he practiced law into 2021 and despite physical challenges the past few years was still mentally sharp he did it all in 94 years and there s nothing to be sad about here his wife nancy told the montana standard this week he had a great life he did it all the way he wanted to and he did it his way dahood s son jeff joined his father at knight dahood in anaconda in 2006 and never quit learning from him the love of his life was the law jeff said and he never gave it up his eyesight was starting to go but we would send things over for him to read he said we had a supreme court brief due and he helped us with different things like that so up until the end his mind was absolutely there dahood took on the montana power co on behalf of shareholders who lost their shirts espn for tagging evel knievel as a pimp and the montana attorney general after a grand jury indicted dahood on 29 charges tied to workers compensation claims for clients he practiced with confidence and flair mixed with the media in the same manner and in the grand jury probe all charges were dismissed and the ag issued a public apology to dahood as part of a libel settlement he has a scrapbook on all that jeff said with a laugh he bought a new suit a bigger cigar and a new car but no matter the cause or client said longtime butte lawyer brad belke dahood practiced with the same fervor he would do cases for millions of dollars and cases for 50 bucks and bring the same care to all of those cases belke said most of us practice law but he loved the law it was a lifelong love affair with the law and in the courtroom belke said dahood always had a commanding presence the minute he stood up at the table he had the attention of the entire jury belke said and the lawyers were watching to see what he was going to do next because you re going to have to deal with it so you better be paying attention dahood was born in brooklyn new york in 1927 and came to anaconda as a young boy when his father found work in the mines he earned a law degree from the university of montana in 1951 and served as an army judge advocate general officer during the korean war arguing cases before the u s court of military appeals before returning to montana to practice law in 1953 jeff dahood said his dad was very patriotic and big on community involvement especially on all american holidays he would give speeches for memorial day and i remember one when i was a kid here at the washoe theatre he said the minute he walked in everybody kind of turned around and it got silent until his big booming voice started you knew when wade dahood was in the room tom powers clerk of the district court in butte silver bow said dahood was larger than life just walking into the clerk s office he would come in and in this booming bombastic voice say how are my favorite clerks in my favorite courthouse in the whole state of montana powers recalled with a smile i m fairly confident they were his favorite until he went to the next courthouse but there was nothing disingenuous about that powers said that larger than life personality was not affected it was very much him he was always very gracious and genuine dahood took cases of all kinds during his career but practiced mostly in condemnation law personal injury products liability criminal law and workers compensation he was a founder and past president of the montana trial lawyers association a fellow of the international society of barristers and was on the board of governors for the association of trial lawyers of america among other organizational posts in 1975 a state probe into montana s workers compensation system led to grand jury indictments against dahood a state administrator and several other lawyers dahood was accused of larceny and other wrongdoing in handling claims for clients during the case dahood voluntarily submitted to fingerprinting at the lewis and clark county jail amid prosecution claims that indicted lawyers were getting special treatment dahood emerged smiling from the process and at the request of a newsman posed for a photograph with his palms turned upwards and his hands extended before him an associated press account of the event said even before indictments were handed down dahood challenged then montana attorney general robert woodahl and his team of prosecutors to a statewide televised debate regarding the investigation i am willing to stand alone he told the ap surely such odds ought to be attractive to the other side all charges against him were ultimately dismissed but dahood filed a 1 5 million libel suit against woodahl and his chief prosecutor for statements they had made about him they settled in 1980 and issued a public apology to dahood saying they never intended to question your character honesty and professional integrity dahood accepted the apology but added a word of caution saying overzealous use of power by prosecutors casting aside the presumption of innocence causes irreparable damage and suffering to our legal system as well as those wrongly accused dahood spearheaded a 2001 class action lawsuit demanding the former montana power co compensate shareholders who were burned when the energy giant devalued its stock and sold its utility assets to become touch america a telecommunications company that later filed for bankruptcy that and two other lawsuits ended with a 115 million settlement a federal judge approved in 2010 after nearly a decade of litigation the money came from insurance companies goldman sachs and a big law firm a lot of lawyers did great work in the cases jeff dahood said but his father got those folks to really come to the table with their checkbooks dahood was friends with evel knievel and represented him in several cases including one after knievel was photographed at an espn awards show in 2001 with one arm around his wife and one around another young woman espn posted the photo with a caption that read evel knievel proves that you re never too old to be a pimp knievel filed a defamation suit but a lower court said the photo and caption were not defamatory as a matter of law and the 9th u s circuit court of appeals upheld the decision still no stage was too big for dahood he practiced i think in every court in montana and the supreme court and judge advocate general and the 9th circuit court of appeals nancy said but his most lasting legacy might have come from outside the courtroom dahood was one of 100 elected delegates who drafted a revised montana constitution 50 years ago he chaired the committee that produced a declaration of rights enumerating 35 individual and collective rights 17 having no parallel in the u s constitution i was always concerned about individual rights that s why i became a lawyer dahood said in a 2015 video interview that butte s evan barrett did on the 1972 constitution as part of an historical series on montana dahood said delegates were concerned that the size and complexity of government were becoming excessive and threatened individual liberty it s a reason one provision states the right of individual privacy is essential to the well being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest barrett said there are more protections under the 1972 montana constitution than any other constitution in america and dahood played a major role in their adoption as just one example barrett said montanans are the only ones in america with the explicit right to public participation in governmental processes before decisions are made rick applegate a research analyst and chief of staff for the committee said dahood was the shepherd of the declaration of rights as an attorney he spent much of his career sticking up for people who had been damaged or were disadvantaged or who were afflicted and he brought that perspective to the convention applegate said he also brought a forceful personality legal talents and an ability to work with people who had very different views applegate said he had a habit without being aggressive where he would approach somebody typically with an unlit cigar in his right hand and with his left hand he would reach out and take hold of the biceps of the person he was talking with and the person would realize that he was not likely to relax or release his grip until he was sure you at least understood what he was talking about applegate said dahood had enormous respect for discipline debate and discussion he said and there was something else that remained a constant i never heard anyone say that he wasn t telling the truth that he was just trying to snow somebody or hoodwink them or was offering a proposition that was clearly at odds with the facts applegate said dahood noted in the 2015 interview that of the 100 delegates 58 were democrats 36 were republicans and six were independents dahood was a republican but in the end after 56 days everyone signed the document and voters ratified it later that year the first 10 days there may have been some partisanship dahood said after those first 10 days there were no political labels there were 100 montana delegates dedicated to the task that had been placed before them to write a constitution that would be good for today and always in montana a celebration commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1972 constitution is set for june 15 16 in helena and as part of it the

in the first quarter of 2022 from the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily due to a 665 000 expense associated with the termination of the company s db plan in the fourth quarter of 2021 data

0 million and a 3 5 million or 15 0 decrease in cash and cash equivalents to 19 6 million at march 31 2022 these decreases were partially offset by increases of 17 1 million or 2 1 in loans and leases net of allowance to 850 0 million and 6 8 million or 33 4 in other assets to 27 1 million at march 31 2022 the decrease in investment securities primarily was the result of reinvesting only a portion of normal recurring maturities and payments on securities and using the remainder to fund growth in the loan and lease portfolio the increase in loans and leases was attributable to an increase in multi family loans construction and development loans and direct financing leases of 9 0 million 8 4 million and 3 7 million respectively partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage loans of 3

image found here let s start tonight as we have the past several with mariupol this morning putin told his defense minister shoigu to not try to reduce the azovstal complex where mariupol s defenders are holding on rather putin told shoigu to basically just seal it off putin is hailing russia s liberation of mariupol after his forces completely destroyed during a two month siege he told defense minister sergei shoigu to block off the azovstal metallurgical plant where the last ukrainian troops are holed up so that a fly can t get in pic twitter com g2lnd44qxf max seddon maxseddon april 21 2022 this is an important data point because i think it tells us something about the state of the dozen battalion tactical groups btgs that russia has in mariupol trying to defeat the azov regiment and the 36th separate marine brigade specifically that russia s forces in mariupol cannot do so because if they could they would and putin wouldn t be telling shoigu just to seal off the azovstal facility there are no reporters left in mariupol so all the info that comes out is either via the leaders and members of the azov regiment and the 36th separate marine brigade civilians who have either been able to escape mariupol or make contact with relatives or friends outside of mariupol or from the legitimate members of the mariupol government what we don t have are independent journalists able to report on the state of russia s forces putin s orders this morning however tell us something important he doesn t have enough troops and the troops he has are in no condition to continue to fight the azov regiment s and the 36th separate marine brigade s guerilla war through the streets and ruined buildings of mariupol this is also the conclusion of the kyiv independent s military reporter interpreting it for you guys from putin s into human language our forces in mariupol are extremely exhausted after over 50 days in fierce urban combat and we just can t spend even more time and resources to zerg rush this 5 km wide steel plant turned into a giant fortress pic twitter com 4msozfspdg illia ponomarenko iaponomarenko april 21 2022 if this is indeed the case then if the ukrainians can get fresh troops and the right equipment on site they can break mariupol s defenders and the citizens they re defending and sheltering out and get them to safety president zelenskyy seems to think so as well zelensky about lifting mariupol blockade we re preparing but we need weapons ukraine s military is preparing to unblock mariupol through diplomatic or military means but the country needs the right weapons from its allies president volodymyr zelensky said on april 21 the kyiv independent kyivindependent april 21 2022 also something else important here all the speculation that shoigu had a another heart attack last week that it was because he was poisoned that putin was trying to have him executed via the wet work program etc appears to have been bs which is why i was ignoring it because it was at best poorly sourced here s president zelenskyy s video address for this evening with english subtitles the transcript will be after the jump ukrainians our defenders today was a very meaningful foreign policy day for ukraine first the prime ministers of spain and denmark two countries that have consistently supported ukraine have arrived in kyiv thank you the two leaders whose presence in kyiv encourages other leaders of the democratic world to think about visits to ukraine about new gestures of support for our state about concrete decisions that we need to win i thanked them for helping our defense for sanctions pressure on russia i called on spain denmark and all other european democracies to further strengthen sanctions for this war to finally impose an oil embargo to disconnect the entire banking system of russia from the global financial system and to help us bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes against ukrainians the prime minister of denmark stated readiness to support the program of post war reconstruction of ukraine in particular the reconstruction and development of mykolaiv and the shipbuilding industry of ukraine let me remind you that this is the direction of reconstruction i proposed when addressing the parliament and the people of denmark in march and today i addressed the parliament and the people of portugal this was the 26th address to the parliaments of our partner states i can say that each of these speeches really gives us additional support brings the decision to provide assistance to ukraine including defensive one closer and most importantly each of these addresses helps establish a direct emotional connection between what we are experiencing in ukraine and what the political class is experiencing in the partner countries i also addressed the participants of the special spring session of the world bank today this is one of the most important events for the heads of international financial institutions and finance ministers of leading states we are accumulating financial support for ukraine the united states has announced a new package of support for our state we are grateful for that this package contains very powerful defense tools for our military in particular it is artillery shells drones this is what we expected i am grateful to the partners for their help and call for further acceleration of the supply of weapons to ukraine so that we can bring peace closer in the south and east of our country the occupiers continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories they are accumulating forces driving new battalion tactical groups to our land they are even trying to start the so called mobilization in the occupied regions of ukraine none of these steps will help russia in the war against our state they can only delay the inevitable the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory in particular mariupol a city that continues to resist russia despite everything the occupiers say i urge the residents of the southern regions of ukraine kherson and zaporizhzhia regions to be very careful about what information you provide to the invaders and if they ask you to fill out some questionnaires leave your passport data somewhere you should know this is not to help you not just to carry out a census of people who live in a certain area as they say no and not to give you any humanitarian aid this is aimed to falsify the so called referendum on your land if an order comes from moscow to stage such a show and this is the reality be careful i want to say straight away any kherson people s republics are not going to fly if someone wants a new annexation it can only lead to new powerful sanctions strikes on russia you will make your country as poor as russia hasn t been since the 1917 civil war so it is better to seek peace now unfortunately russia rejected the proposal to establish an easter truce this shows very well how the leaders of this state actually treat the christian faith one of the most joyful and important holidays but we keep our hope hope for peace hope that life will overcome death tomorrow is good friday for eastern christians the most sorrowful day of the year a day when everything you can do in life will weigh less than prayer except for one defending the homeland defending brothers in arms in battle a few minutes ago before delivering this address i signed another decree on awarding our heroes our military 202 defenders of ukraine were awarded state awards 194 servicemen of the armed forces and 8 servicemen of the state service of special communication and information protection of ukraine i am grateful to everyone who defends the state eternal memory to all who died for ukraine glory to ukraine here s the ukrainian ministry of defense s operational update for today the operational update regarding the russian invasion on 18 00 on april 21 2022 the fifty seventh day of the heroic resistance of the ukrainian people to a russian military invasion continues a russian federation continues its full scale armed aggression against ukraine russian enemy continued offensive operations in the eastern operational zone in order to establish full control over the territory of donetsk and luhansk oblasts at the same time missile and bomb strikes on military and civilian infrastructure throughout ukraine continue in the volyn polissya and siversky directions russian enemy did not take active actions no signs of formation of offensive groups were found there is a significant reduction in the intensity of the movement of columns of russian military equipment on the territory of the republic of belarus some units of the belarusian armed forces continue to carry out tasks to cover the ukrainian belarusian border in brest and gomel regions the situation in slobozhanshchyna has not changed significantly the partial blockade of kharkiv and the destruction of the city s infrastructure by artillery continue in the temporarily occupied territory of kharkiv region russian occupying forces prohibit the movement of the local population towards the territory controlled by the defense forces of ukraine the delivery of humanitarian aid from the ukrainian side is blocked in the donetsk and tavriya directions russian enemy tried to take full control of mariupol it continued to carry out air strikes and attempted assaults in the area of the seaport and the azovstal plant in the temporarily occupied territory of the kherson oblast the self proclaimed occupation authorities announced the mobilization of males in addition according to available information a so called referendum is planned for may 1 in the russian occupied part of the kherson region and in the period may 2 10 there is planned to be a census locals are prohibited from moving between settlements the shelling of mykolayiv continues in the south buh direction russian enemy is trying to improve its tactical position and get closer to the city but has no success russian enemy continues to suffer significant losses in personnel and military equipment according to updated data commander of the first motorized rifle regiment of the second motorized rifle division of the first tank army of the western military district lieutenant colonel denis mezhuyev was eliminated by the defenders of ukraine two members of the leadership of the same unit colonel kharitonov and lieutenant colonel smirnov were also seriously injured and are being treated in moscow in addition the mobilization of russian occupying units is significantly demoralized by the forced mobilization in unrecognized territorial formations of donetsk and luhansk oblasts poor nutrition low financial and material support of the personnel who arrived to replenish regular units of the russian federation we believe in the armed forces of ukraine let s win together glory to ukraine it turns out there was a senior defense official background briefing yesterday but they didn t post the transcript until much later than usual so here it is senior defense official we continue to see russia conduct offensive operations in the east as well as continued shaping operations but clearly there are offensive operations going on as we talked about yesterday russian forces are advancing south from the north side of the donbas and they are trying to maintain pressure on ukrainian forces to the west of donetsk fighting continues in the kherson region we assess that ukrainian forces have regained control of a town called oleksandrivka which is about 40 kilometers south of mykolayiv we maintain that mariupol was still being contested that there still is an active ukrainian resistance at the azovstal plant in the air domain again strikes really focused on the joint force operation area particular around izyum and in the north of the donbas the jfo and then obviously in the south very much focused continued focused on mariupol and these are airstrikes that include the use of some fixed wing russian bombers as well again that is not unusual that s what we ve been seeing but just so you know it s a range we haven t seen any over the last 24 hours we haven t seen any additional russian airstrikes elsewhere in ukraine it s all been focused on the east and in the south literally the jfo and mariupol over the last 24 hours no changes in the maritime domain i know this remains an interest item for all of you but the russian navy continues to still be postured largely off the coast of crimea and well away from southern coast there near odesa and that part of the northern black sea so no big changes to the naval posture there flights continue to arrive into the region from the presidential drawdown authorities that we are executing additional another four flights arrived over the last 24 hours from the most recent announcement of the 800 million and some of those flights did include howitzers in the next 24 there will be additional flights coming from the united states into the region with howitzers and let s see there has already been the howitzer rounds the 155mm rounds have arrived in the region and more will be coming that is not as i think we talked about yesterday that s largely coming from pre positioned stock so there s no reason to fly those things in they re coming from inside europe but those they are arriving they started arriving yesterday and they re going to and there ll be more arriving today and in the coming days as well until we you know get to that 40 000 round number that was offered in the 800 million package and yes the training of some small number of ukrainians on the howitzers has begun it has begun in a country outside ukraine i am not going to tell you or be able to detail where this is happening but it has happened and we expect this training to last for about a week and this is train the trainers it s a smallish number of ukrainians a little bit more than 50 they will get trained on how to use the howitzers and then they ll be able to go back into ukraine and train their colleagues q inaudible focused on one or i really have two questions but one is just a kind of a follow up on the about ukrainian aircraft do i understand that although ukraine has not received all aircraft that the point you made just the point that was made yesterday about they still have inaudible aircraft flying it still holds because of the spare parts senior defense official that is correct bob was talking about fixed wing i think you all understand that they have been given helicopters whole helicopters including some from the united states but it is true that they have more aircraft by a factor this is on background in fact i m fine if you report it on background they have more than 20 additional aircraft available to them than they did three weeks ago and that is because of the shipment and arrival of spare parts that have been able to get some of their inoperable aircraft fixed wing fighter aircraft in operable condition so by more than 20 they have increased their fleet because of the work that the united states and the international community has done to help get them the parts they need to get them in the air the rest of the q a at the link and i ve highlighted the part of the q a that clarifies the aircraft thing which despite a seemingly unambiguous statement that i posted in yesterday s update was still unclear strategic communication how does it work here s the latest british mod assessment from earlier today emphasis mine and here s their latest map update still in line with what we ve been seeing for the past week i want to draw your attention to this thread of reporting from michael weiss and then tie it back into the british assessment for today first tweet followed by the rest of the thread copied and pasted into a quote box new from holger_r and me karl our estonian defense specialist offers his insights into russia s eastern offensive michael weiss michaeldweiss april 20 2022 the offensive started at the weekend that s when the intensity of the battles grew we know because russia s losses were higher than on the days before this phase will be different than when the war started on feb 24 russia will not attack across the whole frontline simultaneously the intensity of fighting is roughly twice as much as what came before the russians are focused on two axes 1 izyum 2 severodonetsk and surrounding towns they ve had some success in kreminna but that s a tactical decision by ukraine 130 russians were hospitalized from there in the last day this indicates dozens were killed that s a lot perspective if russia doesn t succeed in 1 5 weeks their offensive will subside then a countdown starts for ukraine s counteroffensive i m still cautiously optimistic about russia not succeeding russia simply doesn t have enough forces in the east ukraine believes they have 90 btgs the u s says it s less than 80 ukraine has at least the same number of troops to defend russia has more armor tanks and artillery ukraine has more precision weapons but not enough to react all along the front russia has too many dumb weapons which makes a ukrainian counteroffensive difficult ukraine s tactics remains the same ambush battles destruction of convoys ukraine can t do force v force and doesn t try to another positive ukraine keeps getting new arms new equipment russia can t get it from anywhere and only gets weaker the supply chain from russia to izyum is as long as from belarus to kyiv this makes russia more careful than it was in the beginning of the war mariupol falling would be a pr win for russia but wouldn t have too much of an impact militarily russia s btgs battling there are in no condition to continue fighting on another front that said i don t believe mariupol will fall in the next few days ukraine has experience from 2014 when it held onto the donetsk int l airport for six months the area of the azovstal steel factory is many times larger every possible war scenario indicated russia would encircle mariupol ukraine stocked it with ammunition and food the goal of striking kramatorsk railway station wasn t to hinder ukraine s military movements it was to complicate civilian evacuation civilians in the battlespace affects ukrainian troops russia on the contrary doesn t care about civilian lives russia has 10 12 btgs in reserve behind its borders but no one knows their real condition it s complicated to get the btgs to full capacity russia is desperately mobilizing from dnr lnr they re force 55 60 year old men into the russian army it s a huge and desperate risk as among them are those who will turn their weapons against that army i can t see how russia can declare a big win in two weeks before may 9 it can get tiny tactical wins only there is no reason why ukraine s defenses should fail it s a very risky gambit for russia see today s news about a pro russian blogger getting shot killed in kherson public opinion in russia can change only if the battle of donbass fails there s no force inside the country to effectively oppose the war soldiers mothers come the closest ends the british have been assessing and others have been speculating that putin has rushed the start of the donbas campaign to fit into his own timeline based on the mythology that he s pushed for years around the 9th of may and as a result he needs some sort of victory that is more than taking some villages to show off on that date if this is indeed the case then his orders to shoigu this morning also make sense go back to the first part of sneddon s tweet at the top of the post putin is hailing russia s liberation of mariupol after his forces completely destroyed during a two month siege this is basically declaring victory and moving on i do want to highlight this reporting which contradicts the sixth tweet above about russia having more tanks new ukraine has more tanks available in country than russia thanks to european deliveries of soviet era t 72 tanks senior defense official u s has no tanks to give ukraine because military is using soviet era equipment jack detsch jackdetsch april 21 2022 and in case you ve missed it the usaf is now making bespoke tactical drones for the ukrainians if only the ukrainians had some of those mythical technical sergeants spoken about in the ancient sagas somewhere leto gets a sharp shooting pain to the temple clarification the phoenix ghost is a tactical drone similar to the switchblade but with some different capabilities senior u s defense official the u s air force developed it in line with ukraine s needs it will require some training for ukrainian troops jack detsch jackdetsch april 21 2022 here is an excellent thread from a retired royal air force air marshal on the airpower takeaways from ukraine s defense against the russian reinvasion some thoughts on the air war over ukraine and its implications for air forces in general i caveat all by stating that we don t know very much about ukr tactics and if we did we wouldn t want to be too descriptive but we can pick out some essential observations 1 11 edward stringer edwardstrngr april 21 2022 the first point is that in the eighth week of this war the russian air force vks still shows no sign of running a campaign to gain air superiority given the advantages it has in the physical component of air combat power this is truly remarkable so it probably cannot 2 11 and that means that the russian army cannot discount air attack at any time and ukr can plan to make use of the air environment this could prove to be the factor that tips the balance in effective overall combat power and it arises 3 11 because the ukr armed forces are clearly leading in the conceptual component of air combat power they have worked out how to take a massive inferiority in numbers and turn that around by fighting smarter there are lessons here in air c2 for all air forces 4 11 even perhaps especially the dominant ones of high tech nato these have got used to rolling out air dominance since gulf war 1 maybe they will always be able to but repeating a well worn tactical process albeit a complicated one has replaced air generalship 5 11 few senior western airman have had to work out from scratch how to use air power capabilities in less favourable circumstances to achieve campaign aims in contrast kpszsu has had to think around the problem 6 11 what they seem to have done is used intelligence to selectively attack russian air raids these appear to have been relatively effective in kill ratios but the ukr air force has also achieved many kills from manpads missiles and even artillery shelling airfields 7 11 or bayrakter tb2 v rus sams this implies good coordination between air and land air defence assets which rus has not achieved together this ukr air defence system has achieved a huge soft kill in deterring vks raids rarely now do they cross the flot 8 11 in the space created ukr has learnt to use modern novel tactics of drones and loitering munitions to act as poor mans air superiority this is not yet in the nato air forces play book and i would hazard a guess that nato army air force coord is not as good 9 11 so i conclude that nato air forces should humbly approach kpszsu and offer to share a mission exploitation exercise to find out what worked what didn t and why nato air power has become very good at one thing it should think on what ukr s air generals might teach them 10 11 but in the meantime ukr s ability to prosecute the war successfully relies on it being able to use the air when and how it wants we need to do listen to them telling us what they now need and make sure they have plenty of it in order to prevail 11 11 this is one very patriotic ukrainian millionaire hat tip to steeplejack for emailing it to me ukrainian millionaire asks ukrainian

could also be ukrainian intelligence that s value added there will be no easter ceasefire this weekend russia s representative claimed the truce would afford kyiv nationalists and radicals a respite

of investment securities swap termination fees were recorded when investar voluntarily terminated a number of interest rate swap agreements during the first quarter of 2022 in response to market conditions and as a result of excess liquidity in the past few years investar has entered into multiple forward starting pay fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure against the variability in expected future cash flows in anticipation of rising rates however the borrowings required by the swap agreements provide excess liquidity and put downward pressure on the yield on our interest earning assets and net interest margin we elected to terminate a number of swap contracts that became effective in the first quarter of 2022 or would be effective in the second quarter of 2022 to avoid additional excess liquidity and net interest margin compression investar had forward starting interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of 60 million as of march 31 2022 noninterest expense noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2022 totaled 15 4 million an increase of 1 5 million or 10 9 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and an increase of 0 6 million or 4 2 compared to the first quarter of 2021 the increase in noninterest expense for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2021 was driven by the 1 9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense which resulted from the 1 9 million employee retention credit recognized as a credit to payroll taxes during the quarter ended december 31 2021 the increase in noninterest expense for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to the quarter ended march 31 2021 is primarily a result of a 0 4 increase in other operating expenses and 0 3 increase in salaries and employee benefits the increase in other operating expenses was driven by an increase in collection and repossession expenses the majority of which is related to one impaired loan relationship the increase in salaries and employee benefits is primarily attributable to the acquisition of cheaha on april 1 2021 which added four branch locations and related staff taxes investar recorded an income tax expense of 2 6 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 which equates to an effective tax rate of 20 5 an increase from the effective tax rate of 19 1 at december 31 2021 and a decrease from

battalions and trying even to begin a so called mobilization in the regions they occupy in ukraine zelenskyy also warned ukrainians living in areas of southern ukraine under the control of russia

s only direct road link to the peninsula in order to stem the flow of military resupplies channeled through it had we been able to do it we would have already done it danilov said in response if there is a possibility we will definitely do it he did not clarify whether kyiv currently has the capability to carry out an attack the kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov branded danilov s statement nothing else than the announcement of a possible terrorist act and unacceptable speaking at a regular press briefing on thursday peskov added that all security measures were in place around the kerch bridge and other strategic facilities london western officials say ukraine will need economic and military support for months to come as the war grinds into a long conflict as russia s invasion enters a new phase focused on the eastern donbas region an official said putin is still in a position to win the war but not quickly speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence two western officials said russia might be able to surround and destroy the bulk of ukraine s forces and make territorial gains an aim of taking all of the donbas and securing a land bridge to crimea is potentially within reach for russia s forces however officials said it is far from certain russia will achieve that goal they said russia had learned some of the lessons of past failures in northern ukraine and was showing more effective command and control but they said russia was still feeding troops into its eastern offensive piecemeal and advancing in long columns of vehicles along roads leaving its forces vulnerable to attack officials said they also have not yet seen a major push up from the south which would allow russian forces to trap ukraine s troops in a pincer movement partly that is due to 5 000 to 10 000 russian troops attempting to overcome the last pocket of resistance in the port city of mariupol by jill lawless mariupol ukraine the mayor of the besieged port city of mariupol says

still sorting out the appropriate amount to request biden said the u s has the capacity to do this for a long time as it ships arms to ukraine but must work harder to maintain international pressure

encircled in a massive steel plant in the city and biden called on russia to provide humanitarian corridors so that civilians may flee safely washington the biden administration is making it easier

steel plant where ukrainian forces were holed up was securely blocked while the rest of the city was liberated which putin hailed as success leaving the plant in ukrainian hands however robs the russians of the ability to declare complete victory in mariupol the city s capture has both strategic and symbolic importance london britain s defence ministry says russian forces in ukraine are advancing from staging areas in the donbas region toward the city of kramatorsk which is the target of persistent rocket attacks in an intelligence update posted thursday morning the ministry says russian forces may increase the intensity and forcefulness of operations in ukraine as the kremlin seeks to demonstrate significant successes before the annual victory day celebrations on may 9 which

photo pixabay it s sunday june 3 1888 and you ve just sat down for dinner at the hotel vancouver outside two recently installed edison dynamos light up the city for the first time elsewhere whaling is big everywhere atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are at 294 parts per million nearly a third lower than current levels in victoria the capital s newspaper warns water levels in the fraser river are higher than at any time in the season it is still rising salmon is scarce on the river notes a weekend dispatch from the victoria daily times you order the fish salmon a la victoria pommes a la duchese reads the menu typical b c fare it s easy to think 141 years later today the location of the hotel has changed its restaurant rebranded as notch8 those old menus i remember them well there was always salmon on there said dennis peckham a former chef at notch8 who now oversees eight local restaurants for the glowbal restaurant group not any more salmon is out roasted trout cod and seared scallops are in according to the restaurant s latest dinner menu today we look at sustainability said peckham are we doing our part a link between vancouver restaurant menus and climate change as climate change warms many seas to the south fish species are moving pole ward in a migration never seen in modern times how those climate triggered migrations impact the fishing industry has been well documented but few have linked the warming of local seas to the changing nature of what lands on our plate now a new study from researchers at the university of british columbia has set out to correct that published this week in the journal environmental biology of fishes researchers from the ubc institute for the oceans and fisheries tracked down menus from 362 vancouver restaurants stretching from 1880 to 2021 even if you are not catching fish or you are not related to the seafood sector it affects our everyday life said institute director william cheung who co authored the study with john paul ng their central question have vancouver s fish and seafood menus changed with warming local seas pulling old menus from the royal bc museum in victoria and the vancouver archives the researchers documented all the locally caught species on offer throughout the decades next they matched each species with their preferred ocean temperatures as cheung put it they took the temperature of a seafood menu by comparing different time periods they discovered the highest preferred temperature had climbed 3 c since 1880 the more the ocean has warmed the more fishers caught warm water fish and the more they ended up on a restaurant s menu big questions remained was vancouver an anomaly were restaurants in other cities adjusting their menu to the shift in locally available fish to answer those questions cheung and ng compared contemporary menus in restaurants in anchorage alaska and in los angeles calif the pattern held in alaska restaurants were serving more cold water fish and in l a more warm water fish were on offer as cheung put it they established a strong correlation between changing ocean temperatures and what fish dishes are found on local menus in with the blob out with the salmon salmon once dominated our seas and seafood menus but in recent decades a confluence of changing ocean temperatures habitat destruction overfishing changing predator relationships and disease have all taken their toll between 1980 and 2014 the fraser river averaged 9 6 million sockeye returns annually with up to 28 million one year by 2020 salmon returning to the fraser river fell to an all time record low of 293 000 according to cheung the biggest shift in menu offerings was seen between the periods 1981 1996 and 2019 2021 the latter coming after the arrival of extreme marine heat waves known as the blob as cold waters migrate north others have started to fill the void left behind in the early 1990s humboldt squid suddenly started to appear on local menus as the species expanded its territory into b c waters said cheung where some species have gained traction on local menus the pacific sardine once a popular menu item before the 1950s disappeared as its stocks were decimated by overfishing in b c such declines however are not always a dead end sardines are a warm water species so we expect our waters will become more favourable to them and their populations will come back said cheung that s good news for peckham who places both squid and sardines high on his priorities of culinary ingredients along with octopus caught as bycatch that would otherwise go to waste humbolt squid we already use he said sardines would be very high on the list i love sardines i used to use them in california quite a bit it affects your everyday life populations of popular fish like albacore tuna could also increasingly spend more time in b c s warming waters others iconic species like sockeye salmon face an uncertain future some of the species we take them for granted said cheung pointing to the impact climate change is having on sockeye even if you are not catching fish or you are not related to the seafood sector it affects our everyday life those culinary cultures might need to be adjusted cheung is careful to point out that his study did not take into account how vancouver s shifting demographics have driven demand for different kinds of seafood over the years the restaurants especially in metro vancouver are increasingly mindful about serving sustainable seafood said cheung we want to see if those seafood menus have a lower carbon footprint the researchers are also planning to investigate how a culinary culture focused on sustainability but constrained by supply chains and rising prices will adapt peckham who is about to open another san francisco style seafood and chop house this time in toronto says it s already a tough balance seafood prices have surged in recent years a trend he says is made worse by large scale export to asian markets still sustainability will remain at the core of what his restaurants do it s what his customers want he says there are some beautiful fish available to us at all times from hawaii said peckham but it s easier to tell a story when it s local
littleton co accesswire april 21 2022 ur energy inc nyse american urg tsx ure the company or ur energy is pleased to share the following operational update regarding the ongoing drilling and construction program at lost creek and to report progress on research and development r d activities lost creek mine unit 2 advance preparations update well installation in lost creek s header house hh 2 4 is expected to be complete this month crews are also performing post well installation activities within the hh2 4 production area including well mechanical integrity tests completion zone development and backfilling leveling of drill pits required during well installation this phase is expected to be complete in mid may 2022 following completion of the well work for hh2 4 delineation definition drilling will resume for hhs 2 6 2 7 and 2 8 delineation drilling for hh2 5 is already complete surface component fabrication for hh 2 4 is in progress the building and metering piping has been fabricated all materials for hh 2 4 are onsite with the exception of downhole pumps which are scheduled to arrive prior to completion of the associated infrastructure surface construction will entail trenching and installation of pipelines flowlines and electrical wiring followed by installation of hh2 4 with all its internal data monitoring and safety systems finally the pumps and insulating wellhead covers will be installed prior to groundcover seeding of the production area hh 2 4 is expected to be ready for production in 2022 q3 with advance preparations and the likelihood of supply chain delays in mind we are pre ordering and purchasing well installation materials for additional header houses construction materials have been ordered through hh 2 5 and long lead items have been ordered for hh 2 6 ur energy ceo john cash said given recent geopolitical events as well as legislation proposed in congress uncertainty is increasing with respect to continued secure supplies of uranium although no contracts have been reached at this time we are pursuing discussions with several domestic nuclear utilities concerning off take sales arrangements particularly in light of the rapidly changing market we are pleased to report the progress of our advance preparations at lost creek which will accelerate our ability to quickly ramp up in addition to the wellfield drilling and construction begun in q4 we have taken additional steps in q1 to purchase materials for wellfield construction with a goal of having production ready header houses when a go decision is made we will continue to monitor supply chain issues and developments in the uranium market to remain ahead of possible production demands wellfield construction and development is not the only ongoing work toward ramp up staff are actively pursuing further innovations for lost creek and beyond ur energy prides itself in leading the industry on technical and permitting matters such as water treatment engineering design of ion exchange vessels well abandonment methods and aquifer exemptions by its nature r d is difficult and the results are never certain but the company believes we must continue to advance technology if we wish to become more cost competitive on a global scale and we are advancing several such projects to date costs of the r d efforts have not been significant we are pleased to provide an update on two of the more advanced and promising r d projects progress report on r d activities casing and well installation technology during 2021 q4 as plans were being made to initiate the ongoing drilling programs it became apparent that well casing is in short supply as are drilling contractors many of whom left the uranium industry and or have become more costly due to high demand from a variety of industries to address both issues in order to advance our mu2 drilling programs in a timely and cost effective manner a review of alternate casing materials and well installation technologies was undertaken through the review company staff identified a material that is in nearly all technical respects including internal and external pressure ratings equivalent or superior to the pvc well casing used historically in the in situ industry we have identified suppliers able to provide the material with acceptable lead times and at a cost significantly lower than current pvc casing costs well installation methods were required to be engineered to utilize the new casing material additionally a non significant permit amendment describing those changes was submitted and is currently being reviewed by the wyoming department of environmental quality land quality division due to the material s properties it may be used for injection wells but not for production wells at an in situ facility injection wells generally represent approximately 65 of the wells throughout wellfields designed with traditional five spot recovery patterns in addition to its relatively low cost the proposed method if proven out is expected to reduce drill rig time on injection wells by about 70 and reduce environmental impacts the company expects the cost savings from reduced drill rig time to be partially offset by the need for additional in house labor assuming the land quality division grants approval of the material and the associated installation methods the company will test the concept by installing a small number of wells at lost creek while the efficacy of the method will not be known until completion of the planned initial tests the company is sufficiently optimistic about the material and the installation methods it has engineered that in february 2022 a provisional patent was filed with the u s patent office to protect the intellectual property as additional information becomes available the company will continue to provide updates water recycling and filtration ur energy has been an industry leader in water recycling through the successful engineering permitting and implementation of its class v system and continues to make strides on further improvements engineering of an advanced water treatment system that will allow an additional 90 reduction of disposed water beyond gains already achieved with our class v system is entering advanced stage analyses expected to be completed by 2022 q4 the value of increasing the rate of recycling is that less wastewater requiring disposal will be generated while our existing lost creek permit allows for the installation of two additional deep disposal wells these wells are expensive to install the objective of this r d work is to treat a sufficient quantity of wastewater to minimize the number of additional deep disposal wells required at lost creek and in turn recycle the majority of that fluid as clean class v injectate as designed the system will also provide enhanced water filtration of injection fluids which may allow for the removal of existing and future header house filtration systems if the remaining design engineering and economic studies are successful we anticipate that these processes and technology will also be utilized at our shirley basin
