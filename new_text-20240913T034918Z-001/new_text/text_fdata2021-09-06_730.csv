communist china has relentlessly pursued economic growth for decades creating more billionaires than the u s and lifting 800 million people out of poverty but leaving 600 million more to live on 150 a month now president xi jinping is planning what some experts say would be a dramatic about face trying to restructure chinese society by cracking down on the country s newly minted super rich and redistributing wealth more evenly among the population of 1 4 billion the drive involves plans to regulate excessively high incomes and encourage high income people and enterprises to return more to society according to a readout of xi s comments at a meeting of the chinese communist party by the state run news agency xinhua while his slogan of common prosperity was hardly new among chinese leaders xi s speech last month was the starkest example of his apparent plan for a reshaped society some experts say that for the party a self preservation rationale is behind the goal of better income equality for years the communist party has staked its legitimacy on growth that has outpaced that of any other major economy now that it is slowing it may feel it has to offer a new promise equality image chinese women view the bags they bought at a louis vuitton flagship store shanghai china china photos getty images file china s government is aware that both domestic and international audiences are watching said austin strange an assistant professor of politics at the university of hong kong this is an opportunity to portray itself as a forward thinking government that cares about its citizens including those near the bottom of the wealth distribution as part of the communist party s sweeping vision for the future the government has enforced a regulatory crackdown against chinese tech giants that sent western financial markets into a spin but the efforts extend beyond the economy including limiting video gaming hours for minors to trying to stamp out a fan culture in which teenagers blindly idolize celebrities as the hawkish party controlled newspaper global times put it last week the message resonates with cao xinyin 19 a college student in beijing whose demographic university educated urbanite the communist party is eager to keep on its side common prosperity means that everybody can live a high quality life she said people will live a healthier life be better behaved have a happier mood and will be more likely to pursue and realize their dreams others aren t convinced shaun jiang 28 the former owner of an education company in the southwestern city of chengdu that recently closed said common prosperity was little more than a political slogan lacking a clear road map and feasibility either way xi s attempts to control the market are unprecedented said bill bikales a new york based economist who spent years in china working on economic policy at various u n agencies it s quite an extraordinary situation he said what s surprising is the extent to which xi thinks that the role of the market can be restricted and restricted and restricted again political legitimacy at stake xi s latest effort at state intervention might seem unsurprising for a one party communist state but since the 1970s china has turned away from the marxist zeal of mao zedong and embraced reforms that opened up its economy and helped transform it into the global powerhouse of today image an apartment building in chongqing the largest municipality in southwest china zhou zhiyong ap file more than 800 million people have been lifted out of extreme

to the hurun report a shanghai based organization that tracks china s wealthy population but although forecasts predict that china s economy could overtake the u s s in size as early as 2028 the country also has one of the highest levels of income inequality of any major world economy about 600 million people almost twice the u s population live on the equivalent of about 150 a month premier li keqiang said last year jiangnan zhu an associate professor of politics at the university of hong kong said the wealth disparity has been quite serious in china china was the only major country whose economy expanded last year having largely eliminated the coronavirus after it was first detected there in late 2019 but in recent years there has been an overall slowdown in the country s stratospheric economic growth which had been a crucial pillar of the chinese communist party s political legitimacy said strange of the university of hong kong ryan hass a senior fellow at the washington think tank the brookings institution said that now that the era of breakneck economic development is over the chinese leadership is shifting its focus toward improving quality of life issues as a new source of performance legitimacy meanwhile beijing is under growing criticism from abroad over a wide range of issues including its increasing military activity around taiwan its

direct response to china s wealth redistribution campaign alibaba group holding ltd another chinese tech giant pledged a similar amount thursday along with a revamped taxation and welfare system xi may be planning to use those types of large charitable donations as a central driver for his reforms said vivian zhan an associate professor of politics at the chinese university of hong kong the communist party has many policy tools to regulate big companies and mobilize resources from them for redistribution and other policy goals she said but the common prosperity drive still faces other challenges such as corruption the eradication of which has been the focus of a yearslong campaign by xi more than 60 percent of chinese people still believe corruption is a big problem according to transparency international a nonprofit organization based in berlin common prosperity is a good idea nice to hear but difficult to realize said qin guiying 52 who used to work as a farmer in sichuan

ikea sees shortages on 1 000 products with some stores running out of mattresses as lorry driver shortage and global supply crisis hits the chain ikea said all of its 22 uk and ireland stores were experiencing a shortage of products as a result of the pandemic and brexit the furniture giant said it has run out of mattresses in some of its stores lorry driver shortages disrupting number of companies and their supply chains ikea has run out of mattresses in some of its stores as lorry driver shortages continue to disrupt the company s supply chains the swedish furniture giant has become the latest company to experience disruptions to their supply chain as it struggles with shortages on around 1 000 products it comes after a major flu vaccine supplier and food companies such as coca cola mcdonald s and wetherspoon said they had been affected by ongoing hgv driver shortages britain is currently facing a 100 000 shortfall of hgv drivers which industry bosses have partly blamed on changes to migration rules post brexit and eu employees returning home due to the pandemic ikea said that all of its 22 uk and ireland stores were experiencing a shortage of products as a result of covid 19 and brexit ikea has become the latest company to experience disruptions to their supply chain due to lorry driver shortages why is there a supply chain crisis a lack of lorry drivers and food processors is being partly blamed on the new brexit visa regime introduced on january 1 which penalises lower skilled migrants in favour of those with qualifications but global factors are relevant too bosses say including chinese port closures and a lack of shipping containers us vice president kamala harris urged americans to buy christmas toys early due to a shortage there nick allen chief executive of the british meat processors association told mailonline britain has so far been unable to shake its dependency on eu workers who have been leaving due to the pandemic the supply of new workers is also being held back by stricter visa rules introduced on january 1 the most common complaint among uk retailers and food producers is the shortage of lorry drivers which the road haulage association currently puts at 100 000 thousands of prospective drivers are waiting for their hgv tests due to a backlog caused by lockdown while many existing ones have left the uk after brexit or to be back with their families during covid importers are also suffering a financial hit with dramatically rising transport costs caused by a global lack of shipping containers and a slowdown in freight movements resulting from port closures chinese authorities recently shut ningbo zhoushan port which is one of the world s largest container terminals due to a covid outbreak gary grant founder and executive chairman of toy chain the entertainer said the cost of shipping a container from asia had increased from 1 700 to more than 13 000 8 000 over the past year advertisement the company said it was seeing 10 per cent of its stock or around 1 000 product lines impacted as a result of supply issues reports the bbc a company spokesperson said like many retailers we are experiencing ongoing challenges with our supply chains due to covid 19 and labour shortages with transport raw materials and sourcing all impacted in addition we are seeing higher customer demand as more people are spending more time at home as a result we are experiencing low availability in some of our ranges including mattresses the road haulage association said the total number of people in the uk with hgv licences this summer is 516 000 but the latest department for transport data shows 278 700 hgv drivers were employed in 2020 equivalent to 54 per cent of the total ikea apologised to its customers for the issues and said it hoped the situation would improve in the coming weeks and months what we are seeing is a perfect storm of issues including the disruption of global trade flows and a shortage of drivers which have been exacerbated by the pandemic and brexit the spokesperson said it comes after it emerged that at least 18 councils across the uk are experiencing ongoing disruptions to their bin collection services due to the driver shortages the delays are primarily affecting collections of garden waste according to the bbc but some councils are also delaying recycling collections so they can provide enough drivers to pick up britons general waste the delays are being caused in part by the lack of hgv drivers for bin lorries along with the fact that many council staff are self isolating after either contracting coronavirus or coming into contact with someone with the disease on thursday three councils in devon wrote to home secretary priti patel asking for the government to grant temporary visas for european hgv drivers to ease the shortage north devon council is trying to fill seven bin lorry driver vacancies torbay council has eight vacancies and teignbridge council needs 10 drivers the councillors said in their letter steve darling david worden and alistair dewhirst added that it was proving very challenging to fill the vacancies at least 18 councils are experiencing disruption to bin collections due to driver shortages the councillors asked for driver applications being handled by the driver and vehicle licensing agency dvla to be fast tracked they said there are five applications in teignbridge which could be speeded up waste management firms including biffa and veolia told the bbc that they are doing everything to cope with the shortage other councils suffering from shortages include the city councils in derby and manchester along with others in milton keynes and basingstoke the shortage of drivers is also hitting the food industry earlier this week coca cola said a can shortage was being compounded by a shortfall of hgv drivers and pub chain wetherspoon s said it was suffering from a beer shortage fast food chains mcdonald s kfc and nando s have all suffered similar supply chain issues in recent months the latter firm had to close around a tenth of its outlets due to a chicken shortage caused in part by a lack of drivers meanwhile seqirus one of the world s largest flu vaccine companies this week reported delays in jab deliveries of up to a fortnight britain has around 237 300 qualified drivers who are not yet on the roads despite the shortfall of 100 000 workers industry experts have said better pay and improved working conditions are needed to lure them back they put the shortage largely down to brexit and the pandemic which led to 14 000 european drivers going home and just 600 of those returning the government could announce plans to shake up hgv tests for drivers in a bid to address the supply crisis which has seen supermarkets struggle to stock shelves with certain products since last year the industry has also seen large numbers of drivers retiring while lockdown has hit the training of new drivers with 40 000 hgv driver tests cancelled the average age of a uk lorry driver is put at 56 to 57 and not enough young people have joined the industry due to its long hours unattractive conditions and poor pay drivers median hourly pay has risen 10 per cent since 2015 to 11 80 below the 16 per cent average across other sectors with new tax changes also not in their favour lorry drivers can only drive for nine hours each day but many are away from home up to 15 hours a day putting off many young people who do not want such hours britain is just one of many european countries suffering from a driver shortfall there are an estimated 400 000 vacancies across the continent research by logistics analysts transport intelligence found that germany was missing between 45 000 and 60 000 hgv drivers last year that number is increasing with the international road transport union warning of a 185 000 shortfall there by 2027 france has also faced a similar crisis with the country facing a shortage of around 43 000 drivers since 2019 the shortfall in italy in 2019 was estimated to be around 15 000 transport intelligence said advertisement jose gomez urquiza chief executive of immigration agency visa solutions told the daily express we re living through the worst driver shortage that we ve seen in recent history by far

beijing is unlikely to let its economy soften too much and the latest measures are probably best framed as risk management china didn t throw as much fiscal or monetary firepower at the pandemic as the u s the relaxing of the reins isn t being done from a position of ultra loose policy earlier in the year when the recovery was generating a scorching pace of expansion chinese officials had begun to worry again about debt and financial imbalances as they did in the run up to covid now the backdrop is grimmer that means the world and china itself has to get comfortable with a more moderate performance not the double digit growth of the early 2000s the fed doesn t like to speak too loudly about how other economies figure in its deliberations but officials will have taken note of china s softness in the lead up to friday s american payrolls shocker conditions aren t so swell in asia part of the world that has enjoyed growth superlatives for decades the fed has good reasons local and global to take it slow

the selection of the next chairman of the federal reserve has generated far more attention than it deserves political leaders should instead be engaging in a far reaching debate about the fundamental direction of u s monetary policy whether jerome powell deserves to be reappointed or replaced by lael brainard might be an intriguing debate for d c insiders but the choice is likely to be of little consequence given the similarities in their economic outlooks and policy prescriptions furthermore the selection of a chairman is largely moot as today s federal reserve fed is a far more democratic institution than the one overseen by alan greenspan the greenspan era was famously characterized as being one in which the chairman systematically attempted to influence the preferences of voting members of the federal reserve open market committee fomc in order to achieve near unanimous consensus under the leadership of ben bernanke janet yellen and powell the fed has shifted away from being overly reliant on the views of the chair nowadays it is hard to imagine a chairman having the same level of influence on his colleagues as greenspan had during his long and controversial tenure looking beyond the fed chair selection debate there are three critical issues that should be of grave concern for policymakers as they are likely to impact the ongoing recovery and influence the long term trajectory of the u s economy these fundamental matters should be at the center of the ongoing political debate regarding the role of the federal reserve and its approach to monetary policymaking first the nature and scope of supply shocks hitting american businesses appear to be far more severe and longer lasting than the fed anticipated the case made by powell and his colleagues for inflation being transitory largely rested on the assumption that supply constraints would be quickly resolved once worldwide production came back online and transportation bottlenecks disappeared recent developments however suggest that it will take much longer for supply shocks to dissipate there may even be some lingering effects that have the potential to generate persistent upward pressure on price levels the 21st century global supply chain while incredibly efficient and cost effective was not built for dealing with rolling waves of covid 19 surges and associated lockdowns nor was it set up to handle increasingly frequent extreme weather events and climate change related catastrophes even prior to the pandemic the trump trade wars highlighted the risks associated with a china centric global manufacturing supply chain going forward it is likely that greater emphasis will be placed on building more diversified and more resilient supply chains which will result in higher future production costs furthermore the pandemic shock has highlighted the downside of lean inventories and just in time ordering fundamental reorganization of production processes and inventory management techniques are likely to lead to a sustained period of higher prices a second critical issue is related to the fed s implicit assumption that running the economy hot in order to attain maximum employment poses limited downside risks the pandemic shock and resultant changes in the underlying structure of the economy is bound to complicate determination of maximum employment levels the emergence of remote hybrid work options and massive sectoral demand shifts indicate a labor market that is in the throes of significant transformation recent trends in the u s labor market reassessment of work high quit rates record number of job openings and rising mismatches point to a period of elevated frictional and structural unemployment which is likely to result in the natural rate of unemployment exceeding its pre pandemic level consequently attempting to reach the historically low unemployment rates last seen in february 2020 may result in a fed policy error that raises inflation expectations it is also unclear that running the economy hot will necessarily result in improved outcomes for marginalized groups a third area of concern relates to financial distortions associated with the injection of excess liquidity via prolonged periods of quantitative easing by the fed and other major central banks measures originally intended for financial emergencies are now being deployed by monetary authorities to achieve traditional macroeconomic goals this in turn has caused financial markets to become addicted to a never ending stream of easy money to sustain ever higher asset prices unsurprisingly it has also encouraged speculative excesses unconventional fed policies might unintentionally be contributing to a rise in inequality the real debate therefore should be about the efficacy of pursuing ultra accommodative monetary policies when the economy is facing supply constraints and rising inflationary pressures the logic of buying mortgage backed securities when home prices are setting monthly record highs is hard to fathom the fed s decision to stick with bond purchases is difficult to rationalize when the 10 year treasury note yield languishes around 1 3 percent the reach for yield by desperate investors has encouraged record issuance of junk bonds have recent fed policies pushed us into a debt trap that limits the central bank s ability to raise interest rates in the future with historically high levels of public debt and non financial corporate debt any significant monetary tightening will result in a rapid collapse of asset prices and a sharp economic contraction necessitating a quick return to ever larger amounts of fresh liquidity injections and further expansion of the central bank balance sheet unless we get extremely lucky and a whole host of challenging issues get favorably resolved the next fed chair and his her colleagues are going to face some unpleasant choices vivekanand jayakumar is an associate professor of economics at the university of tampa

michel martin host what is a human life worth that s a question of faith of values and philosophy one that speaks to the most profound meditations about the meaning of life but in america it is also a question of money and that was the question attorney kenneth feinberg was asked to answer when he was selected to be the special master of the 9 11 victim compensation fund the fund was created by congress to bring financial relief to those who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and also to protect the airlines and by extension the economy from almost certain devastating lawsuits what followed was a complex emotional and sometimes painful process that is now dramatized in a new movie called worth here s a clip from the film where feinberg played by michael keaton and his law partner camille biros played by amy ryan describe to their staff what the law creating the fund actually says soundbite of film worth michael keaton as ken feinberg what it says is the victims and their families will be compensated based on economic value lost amy ryan as camille biros what that means they left up to the special master us martin it s a legal drama to be sure but it is also an investigation of the complex terrain of grief and loss empathy and healing and money worth was directed by sara colangelo and she is with us now welcome thank you so much for joining us sara colangelo thank you martin so you know complex tort litigation is not the usual subject for a legal thriller i mean you usually think of things like conspiracies or cover ups or murder mysteries what made you want to do it though what finally got your attention for however many months it took you to do colangelo yeah you know i think i was really interested in the moral conundrum of it all you know how math and calculation of dollars and cents and the kind of rational cold approach to actuarial models how that world would collide with the raw emotion of 9 11 and the heartbreak of thousands of families there was something really interesting in that scenario and in the tension inherent in that scenario i suppose martin well you know i have a clip that speaks to that let me just play that this is where this is the scene in the film where feinberg is first meeting the families he s trying to explain a formula by which compensation would be calculated based on things like how much did the loved one make in his or her life and how much would that person have made over the long run and the families as you might imagine they don t love that let me just play this clip soundbite of film worth unidentified actor 1 as character my boy was a firefighter was he worth less than the guy pushing pencils and trading stocks keaton as ken feinberg no certainly not as a human being no unidentified actor 1 as character their lives ended the same way keaton as ken feinberg but their mortgages did differ unidentified actor 2 as character how dare you crosstalk martin so you know obviously this is not a documentary right i mean it s a feature film and there are a lot of things that were sort of dramatized and stuff but how true to life was that moment i mean did that meeting actually happen colangelo it did and you know from what ken and camille have told me personally and what i ve read in articles these you know first few meetings in new jersey and staten island in parts of new york city they were really fraught with tension and anger and frustration and i think i was really interested in that both in documenting sort of the pain of the claimants but also in trying to understand what the toll was on ken and camille in sort of absorbing all of that anger and just grief and frustration at the process martin you know and some of the other storylines i mean part of that i do want to give it all away but part of the storyline is how he comes to understand that more is needed than just crunching numbers but some of the other storylines are kind of messy and as i said it s not a documentary but the fact is it is based on fact there were some messy sort of family relationships that were not always what they seemed or it just that had to be navigated as well as some you know like issues around same sex partners not being accepted by their families some in some cases not even being fully out and i was just interested in how you decided which of those stories you wanted to tell and why colangelo mmm hmm well when i read ken s memoir i was really touched by first of all the story of many of the undocumented families and i was you know really moved by the sort of no questions asked policy that ken and camille had created and so i really wanted to put that in the film and then as i kind of did a bit more research you know i did realize that there was a huge amount of discretion that ken and camille used in you know dealing with same sex families and partners and yeah there you know there were a lot of messy situations in which parents refused to acknowledge the partners of their children you know and a lot of these loved ones were there trying to prove that they were indeed part of their loved one s life and that they should receive something so it was pretty heartbreaking martin well the other thing that was there s also this question of that goes back to the beginning of the film is what is a life worth and there are characters in the film let s say who make a very strong case that their clients are worth more than other people because they made a lot of money and they expected more i just found that really fascinating how you navigated that what are your thoughts about that colangelo well it s i mean i think this is what i love about the film i guess and the subject matter is that you know we live in a capitalist system and these actuarial models are a reality and they re happening every day in the insurance industry you know so of course there were these multimillionaires who are you know heading some of the most powerful investment firms on wall street demanding money because they had to take care of their families and keep up their lifestyle and yet you had waiters waitresses at windows on the world and some undocumented folks who were making 25 to 30 000 a year and it s such a sort of strange and vulgar exercise to monetize human loss like that and to assign dollars and cents to people s lives so it s so uncomfortable and i think i was so attracted to that philosophical question you know how can you even do this it seems impossible and then to make matters worse money in general is a terrible substitute for a lost loved one martin you know it s interesting that the film is coming out now and it s coming out literally days after the last americans left afghanistan which was set in motion by the 9 11 attacks and i you know i m wondering what you how would you know but i m just wondering what you think people will receive from it and what you think it will bring up for them i have to tell you you don t dwell a lot on the actual imagery of the attacks you mainly experience it through the eyes of people watching it and i have to tell you for me anyway that was a great relief but i m just wondering how do you think people will receive that as it s coming in in such a fraught time when we re already experiencing a lot related to the anniversary of 9 11 colangelo yeah i mean i hope that it will gain a certain you know added relevance and poignancy at this moment you know as we re you know leaving afghanistan you know after a year and a half of covid in which you know i think a lot of these discussions were in the public sphere you know what is a life worth you know who gets the ventilator you know i hope that in a way this latest crisis in our country will maybe allow us to look at 9 11 in a slightly different way martin wow that was director sara colangelo her new movie worth is now streaming on netflix sara colangelo thank you so much for talking with us colangelo thank you

and as i said it s not a documentary but the fact is it is based on fact there were some messy sort of family relationships that were not always what they seemed or it just that had to be navigated as well as some you know like issues around same sex partners not being accepted by their families some in some cases not even being fully out and i was just interested in how you decided which of those stories you wanted to tell and why colangelo mmm hmm well when i read ken s memoir i was really touched by first of all the story of many of the undocumented families and i was you know really moved by the sort of no questions asked policy that ken and camille had created and so i really wanted to put that in the film and then as i kind of did a bit more research you know i did realize that there was a huge amount of discretion that ken and camille used in you know dealing with same sex families and partners and yeah there you know there were a lot of messy situations in which parents refused to acknowledge the partners of their children you know and a lot of these loved ones were there trying to prove that they were indeed part of their loved one s life and that they should receive something so it was pretty heartbreaking martin well the other thing that was there s also this question of that goes back to the beginning of the film is what is a life worth and there are characters in the film let s say who make a very strong case that their clients are worth more than other people because they made a lot of money and they expected more i just found that really fascinating how you navigated that what are your thoughts about that colangelo well it s i mean i think this is what i love about the film i guess and the subject matter is that you know we live in a capitalist system and these actuarial models are a reality and they re happening every day in the insurance industry you know so of course there were these multimillionaires who are you know heading some of the most powerful investment firms on wall street demanding money because they had to take care of their families and keep up their lifestyle and yet you had waiters waitresses at windows on the world and some undocumented folks who were making 25 to 30 000 a year and it s such a sort of strange and vulgar exercise to monetize human loss like that and to assign dollars and cents to people s lives so it s so uncomfortable and i think i was so attracted to that philosophical question you know how can you even do this it seems impossible and then to make matters worse money in general is a terrible substitute for a lost loved one martin you know it s interesting that the film is coming out now and it s coming out literally days after the last americans left afghanistan which was set in motion by the 9 11 attacks and i you know i m wondering what you how would you know but i m just wondering what you think people will receive from it and what you think it will bring up for them i have to tell you you don t dwell a lot on the actual imagery of the attacks you mainly experience it through the eyes of people watching it and i have to tell you for me anyway that was a great relief but i m just wondering how do you think people will receive that as it s coming in in such a fraught time when we re already experiencing a lot related to the anniversary of 9 11 colangelo yeah i mean i hope that it will gain a certain you know added relevance and poignancy at this moment you know as we re you know leaving afghanistan you know after a year and a half of covid in which you know i think a lot of these discussions were in the public sphere you know what is a life worth you know who gets the ventilator you know i hope that in a way this latest crisis in our country will maybe allow us to look at 9 11 in a slightly different way martin wow that was director sara colangelo her new movie worth is now streaming on netflix sara colangelo thank you so much for talking with us colangelo thank you

european coal generation has made a comeback in 2021 especially in the past few months and bullish power fundamentals due to historically high gas prices and underperforming renewables indicate this trend is set to remain through the rest of 2021 coal fired power plants across continental europe and the uk are set to ramp up at the expense of natural gas over the remainder of the year with a notional 35 efficiency coal plant in the money over a 49 13 efficient gas equivalent for the first time since 2018 and coal at its most profitable relative to gas since 2015 coal and lignite have already ramped up to take share from gas in germany s power generation mix this summer according to data from research institute fraunhofer ise as gas shippers attempt to prioritise injections into storage in the uk oal power provided supply to the grid for more than 60 days in a row with the streak ending on 20 august coal plants were only active for four of these days in 2020 s equivalent period across the months of june and july this year s streak is the longest since 2017 overall coal plants have been actively generating for more than 170 days to date this year more than the same period in both 2019 and 2020 likewise in the netherlands coal fired generation in august surpassed gas fired generation according to entso e data coal plants generated 2 4gw while gas plants generated 2gw between 1 august and 19 august entso e data also show that coal generation in 2021 to date exceeded coal generation in 2020 coal fired generation in 2021 to date was 1 9gw while it averaged at 1 1gw between january and august 2020 the ramp up in coal fired generation is expected to continue if strong dutch gas prices keep a lid on the profitability of gas fired power plants relative to coal fired plants in a more long term horizon by 2030 european markets are expecting to phase out over 50gw of coal 19gw of lignite and 21gw of nuclear capacity as previous icis analysis suggests much of the retiring capacity is expected to be replaced by rapidly expanding renewable generation on a de rated basis see uk and german examples this will likely lead to a generation deficit gas fired generation will therefore be critical in plugging this gap especially considering the need for baseload in electricity systems with a high penetration of renewables sparkand dark spreads in june 2021 german wind production dropped almost 31 compared to the same time in 2020 then in july it also dropped 15 year on year dutch onshore wind and solar output also declined in 2021 to date compared with 2020 levels in the same period entso e data showed however offshore wind output was higher in 2021 with the commissioning of the borssele iii and iv farm in the north sea normally fuel plants such as gas would ramp up to compensate but with the dutch ttf front month surging 35 over the course of june and rising further thereafter german gas fired power output also fell 36 year on year in july although rising nuclear output also took share from gas coal and lignite generation have also climbed hard coal output roughly doubled year on year across both months due to supply tightness on european natural gas markets and low wind power production gas prices surged more than other energy commodities in 2021 as a result 49 efficiency clean spark spreads have dropped below 40 efficiency clean dark spreads for curve contracts according to icis calculations which suggests that gas plants became less profitable than coal plants clean dark spreads are indicators of profitability for coal fired generators that take into account the cost of carbon while clean spark spreads indicate profitability for gas fired generators august expiring with coal in the money ends a run of 31 straight months stretching back to december 2018 in which gas was more profitable than coal in europe according to this measure coal s profitability will peak in december according to spreads calculated on 2 august the clean dark spread premium of 9 49 mwh over the clean spark for that month is wider than any expired spreads since december 2015 since 8 july the dutch year 22 clean spark spread dropped below the clean dark spread and remained in negative territory most days according to icis calculations however the year 22 clean spark spread rose from a low of 4 91 mwh on 16 august to 2 51 mwh on 19 august driven by sharp losses on gas markets the temporary decline in gas prices followed the announcement of russian producer gazprom on gas flow expectations along the nord stream 2 pipeline for 2021 nord stream 2 is 99 complete and could be launched this autumn but uncertainty remains about technical and regulatory certification processes for the pipeline supply fundamentals on gas markets remain tight as stocks in dutch storage facilities remain emptier than average and lng supply is expected to remain weak this will likely maintain support to ttf near curve prices resulting in low gas plant profitability the dutch parliament and senate passed a law in december 2019 banning the use of coal in the production of electricity from 2030 the four remaining dutch coal fired plants amercentrale rotterdam centrale maasvlakte centrale and eemshaven centrale are expected to close between 2024 and 2029 according to eex transparency platform all coal fired plants are expected to be fully available until the rest of 2021 as they went through maintenance during the second quarter gas remains price setter coal prices were historically the main driver of the german power far curve as the greater prevalence of the fuel in the country s generation mix meant that the last unit of demand was typically met by a coal fired plant coal will not return to its position as the marginal price setter as it does not have as much flexibility for power plants according to a market participants in order for coal to become the marginal price setting fuel gas prices need to continue rising while carbon and coal fall a trader said but greater demand and profitable margins are supporting coal prices the rotterdam benchmark year 22 coal contract has followed a bull run since april nuclear gap traders contacted by icis generally agreed that coal fired power output will continue to rising at the expense of gas one said that this trend is set to continue in germany at least until next spring this is because of the 4gw nuclear phase out by the end of 2021 which leaves a gap in the german capacity mix it is possible that we need two winters for natural gas markets to come back to levels we have seen two years ago because 2020 was the other extreme he said the results of the last coal exit auction in germany show that more people realise that the profitability of coal is increasing another trader added as it was not oversubscribed unlike prior auctions germany is retiring almost 3gw of lignite and hard coal combined by the end of 2022 with coal plants retiring including some relatively new and efficient clean dark spreads need to rise further relative to clean sparks to achieve the same fuel switch achieved in prior years therefore depending on how gas storage levels recover and whether more lng supply comes into europe the use of coal in the german power mix may drop back to previous levels uk s coal phase out was brought forward to 2024 which signals a longer term difficulty facing the uk power grid during periods of severe tightness where wind supply is limited the uk government has made a pledge to produce net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in order to reach these targets the uk government s main strategy is to rely heavily on renewables as its main carbon neutral source of generation alongside a greater interconnector import capacity while not carbon neutral gas generation will also play a part as a transition fuel for the coming decade new nuclear has appeared to take a back seat in the uk s net zero pathway according to icis analytics forecasts nuclear capacity will find a floor of 3 6gw from 2024 2027 before gradually increasing from that point onwards however as plants are being closed down faster than new plants being currently planned to be built nuclear capacity is not poised to overtake 2021 s total until 2034 while other sources of energy like battery storage are also expected to play a role it will mainly be gas generation that will meet demand when turbines are not generating making the uk s adherence to its emissions targets more difficult tom greatrex chief executive of the nuclear industry association said that britain is caught in a fossil fuel trap and the only way to escape is to build new nuclear power stations alongside renewable capacity our existing fleet have produced more zero carbon power than any other assets in britain but if they retire without replacement we will burn more gas and emissions will go up our path to net zero starts with replacing the existing nuclear fleet and investing in a strong and balanced zero carbon mix supply outlook with baseload generation from coal and nuclear dropping substantially in the coming years the role of gas as a stable source of power generation will increase however with output from both continental shelf and onshore fields dropping a large proportion of much needed gas supply is expected to come from lng and russia lng has taken centre stage across europe replacing indigenous production to become the region s marginal source for gas along with russian supply across the past three years 22 of european gas consumption was met by lng supply with north american volumes seeing a major expansion into europe current regasification capacity could see lng account for almost 45 of gas demand in the region this could potentially top 50 by 2025 with more than 300bcm of expected operational regasification capacity this would primarily be used for power generation as gas for power is forecast to rise by five percentage points between 2021 and 2023 to make up 24 of the stack across europe this comes as nuclear coal and lignite generation drops by 2 points over the same period it is expected that up to 40bcm of gas from fields will be removed from the european energy balance by 2025 making the increase in lng supply ever more important however more reliance on lng will lead to growing price volatility across energy markets with piped gas being a more stable and immediate source of supply source icis by laura mendes
local until 2023 parts shortage will keep auto prices sky high detroit general motors is telling owners of some suvs not to use their windshield wipers because an electrical short could cause the wiper motor to catch fire toledo ap back in the spring a shortage of computer chips that had sent auto prices soaring appeared finally to be easing some relief for consumers seemed to be in sight that hope has now dimmed a surge in covid 19 cases from the delta variant in several asian countries that are the main producers of auto grade chips is worsening the supply shortage it is further delaying a return to normal auto production and keeping the supply of vehicles artificially low and that means analysts say that record high consumer prices for vehicles new and used as well as rental cars will extend into next year and might not fall back toward earth until 2023 the global parts shortage involves not just computer chips automakers are starting to see shortages of wiring harnesses plastics and glass too and beyond autos vital components for goods ranging from farm equipment and industrial machinery to sportswear and kitchen accessories are also bottled up at ports around the world as demand outpaces supply in the face of a resurgent virus it appears it s going to get a little tougher before it gets easier said glenn mears who runs four auto dealerships around canton squeezed by the parts shortfall general motors and ford have announced one or two week closures at multiple north american factories some of which produce their hugely popular full size pickup trucks late last month shortages of semiconductors and other parts grew so acute that toyota felt compelled to announce it would slash production by at least 40 in japan and north america for two months the cuts meant a reduction of 360 000 vehicles worldwide in september toyota which largely avoided sporadic factory closures that have plagued rivals this year now foresees production losses into october nissan which had announced in mid august that chip shortages would force it to close its immense factory in smyrna tennessee until aug 30 now says the closure will last until sept 13 and honda dealers are bracing for fewer shipments this is a fluid situation that is impacting the entire industry s global supply chain and we are adjusting production as necessary said chris abbruzzese a honda spokesman the result is that vehicle buyers are facing persistent and once unthinkable price spikes the average price of a new vehicle sold in the u s in august hit a record of just above 41 000 nearly 8 200 more than it was just two years ago j d power estimated with consumer demand still high automakers feel little pressure to discount their vehicles forced to conserve their scarce computer chips the automakers have routed them to higher priced models pickup trucks and large suvs for example thereby driving up their average prices the roots of the computer chip shortage bedeviling auto and other industries stem from the eruption of the pandemic early last year u s automakers had to shut factories for eight weeks to help stop the virus from spreading some parts companies canceled orders for semiconductors at the same time with tens of millions of people hunkered down at home demand for laptops tablets and gaming consoles skyrocketed as auto production resumed consumer demand for cars remained strong but chip makers had shifted production to consumer goods creating a shortage of weather resistant automotive grade chips then just as auto chip production started to rebound in late spring the highly contagious delta variant struck malaysia and other asian countries where chips are finished and other auto parts are made in august new vehicle sales in the u s tumbled nearly 18 mainly because of supply shortages automakers reported that u s dealers had fewer than 1 million new vehicles on their lots in august 72 lower than in august 2019 even if auto production were somehow to immediately regain its highest ever level for vehicles sold in the u s it would take more than a year to achieve a more normal 60 day supply of vehicles and for prices to head down the consulting firm alix partners has calculated under that scenario said dan hearsch an alix partners managing director it s not until early 2023 before they even could overcome a backlog of sales expected demand and build up the inventory for now with parts supplies remaining scarce and production cuts spreading many dealers are nearly out of new vehicles on a recent visit to the central avenue strip in suburban toledo a road chock full of dealerships few new vehicles could be found on the lots some dealers filled in their lots with used vehicles the supply is so low and prices so high that one would be buyer heather pipelow of adrian michigan said she didn t even bother to look for a new suv at jim white honda it s more than i paid for my house she said ruefully ed ewers of mansfield traveled about two hours to a toledo area subaru dealer to buy a used 2020 four door jeep wrangler he considered buying new but decided that a used vehicle was more in his price range to replace an aging dodge journey suv mears whose honda dealership is running short of new inventory said dealers are managing to survive because of the high prices consumers are having to pay for both new and used vehicles he doesn t charge more than the sticker price he said enough profit to cover expenses and make money nor does he have to advertise as much or pay interest on a large stock of vehicles many vehicles he said are sold before they arrive from the factory chip orders that were made nine months ago are now starting to arrive but other components such as glass or parts made with plastic injection molds are depleted hearsch said because of the virus and a general labor shortage he said auto parts makers might not be able to make up for lost production some tentative cause for hope has begun to emerge siew hai wong president of the malaysia semiconductor industry association says hopefully that chip production should start returning to normal in the fall as more workers are vaccinated though malaysia vietnam taiwan singapore and the united states all produce semiconductors he said a shortage of just one kind of chip can disrupt production if there is disruption in malaysia wong said there will be disruption somewhere in the world automakers have been considering shifting to an order based distribution system rather than keeping huge supplies on dealer lots but no one knows whether such a system would prove more efficient eventually hearsch suggested the delta variant will pass and the supply chain should return to normal by then he predicts automakers will line up multiple sources of parts and stock critical components there will be an end to it but the question is really when said ravi anupindi a professor at the university of michigan who studies supply chains ____ ap writer yuri kageyama contributed to this report from tokyo
michel martin host what is a human life worth that s a question of faith of values and philosophy one that speaks to the most profound meditations about the meaning of life but in america it is also a question of money and that was the question attorney kenneth feinberg was asked to answer when he was selected to be the special master of the 9 11 victim compensation fund the fund was created by congress to bring financial relief to those who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and also to protect the airlines and by extension the economy from almost certain devastating lawsuits what followed was a complex emotional and sometimes painful process that is now dramatized in a new movie called worth here s a clip from the film where feinberg played by michael keaton and his law partner camille biros played by amy ryan describe to their staff what the law creating the fund actually says soundbite of film worth michael keaton as ken feinberg what it says is the victims and their families will be compensated based on economic value lost amy ryan as camille biros what that means they left up to the special master us martin it s a legal drama to be sure but it is also an investigation of the complex terrain of grief and loss empathy and healing and money worth was directed by sara colangelo and she is with us now welcome thank you so much for joining us sara colangelo thank you martin so you know complex tort litigation is not the usual subject for a legal thriller i mean you usually think of things like conspiracies or cover ups or murder mysteries what made you want to do it though what finally got your attention for however many months it took you to do colangelo yeah you know i think i was really interested in the moral conundrum of it all you know how math and calculation of dollars and cents and the kind of rational cold approach to actuarial models how that world would collide with the raw emotion of 9 11 and the heartbreak of thousands of families there was something really interesting in that scenario and in the tension inherent in that scenario i suppose martin well you know i have a clip that speaks to that let me just play that this is where this is the scene in the film where feinberg is first meeting the families he s trying to explain a formula by which compensation would be calculated based on things like how much did the loved one make in his or her life and how much would that person have made over the long run and the families as you might imagine they don t love that let me just play this clip soundbite of film worth unidentified actor 1 as character my boy was a firefighter was he worth less than the guy pushing pencils and trading stocks keaton as ken feinberg no certainly not as a human being no unidentified actor 1 as character their lives ended the same way keaton as ken feinberg but their mortgages did differ unidentified actor 2 as character how dare you crosstalk martin so you know obviously this is not a documentary right i mean it s a feature film and there are a lot of things that were sort of dramatized and stuff but how true to life was that moment i mean did that meeting actually happen colangelo it did and you know from what ken and camille have told me personally and what i ve read in articles these you know first few meetings in new jersey and staten island

and as i said it s not a documentary but the fact is it is based on fact there were some messy sort of family relationships that were not always what they seemed or it just that had to be navigated as well as some you know like issues around same sex partners not being accepted by their families some in some cases not even being fully out and i was just interested in how you decided which of those stories you wanted to tell and why colangelo mmm hmm well when i read ken s memoir i was really touched by first of all the story of many of the undocumented families and i was you know really moved by the sort of no questions asked policy that ken and camille had created and so i really wanted to put that in the film and then as i kind of did a bit more research you know i did realize that there was a huge amount of discretion that ken and camille used in you know dealing with same sex families and partners and yeah there you know there were a lot of messy situations in which parents refused to acknowledge the partners of their children you know and a lot of these loved ones were there trying to prove that they were indeed part of their loved one s life and that they should receive something so it was pretty heartbreaking martin well the other thing that was there s also this question of that goes back to the beginning of the film is what is a life worth and there are characters in the film let s say who make a very strong case that their clients are worth more than other people because they made a lot of money and they expected more i just found that really fascinating how you navigated that what are your thoughts about that colangelo well it s i mean i think this is what i love about the film i guess and the subject matter is that you know we live in a capitalist system and these actuarial models are a reality and they re happening every day in the insurance industry you know so of course there were these multimillionaires who are you know heading some of the most powerful investment firms on wall street demanding money because they had to take care of their families and keep up their lifestyle and yet you had waiters waitresses at windows on the world and some undocumented folks who were making 25 to 30 000 a year and it s such a sort of strange and vulgar exercise to monetize human loss like that and to assign dollars and cents to people s lives so it s so uncomfortable and i think i was so attracted to that philosophical question you know how can you even do this it seems impossible and then to make matters worse money in general is a terrible substitute for a lost loved one martin you know it s interesting that the film is coming out now and it s coming out literally days after the last americans left afghanistan which was set in motion by the 9 11 attacks and i you know i m wondering what you how would you know but i m just wondering what you think people will receive from it and what you think it will bring up for them i have to tell you you don t dwell a lot on the actual imagery of the attacks you mainly experience it through the eyes of people watching it and i have to tell you for me anyway that was a great relief but i m just wondering how do you think people will receive that as it s coming in in such a fraught time when we re already experiencing a lot related to the anniversary of 9 11 colangelo yeah i mean i hope that it will gain a certain you know added relevance and poignancy at this moment you know as we re you know leaving afghanistan you know after a year and a half of covid in which you know i think a lot of these discussions were in the public sphere you know what is a life worth you know who gets the ventilator you know i hope that in a way this latest crisis in our country will maybe allow us to look at 9 11 in a slightly different way martin wow that was director sara colangelo her new movie worth is now streaming on netflix sara colangelo thank you so much for talking with us colangelo thank you

carl umegboro writes that samuel ortom should pursue peaceful measures to secure the peace the killings in benue state must not continue unabated the incessant massacres and destruction of possessions be it ethnic religious or politically motivated must stop human lives cannot continue to be wasted many families have lost loved ones including parents and innocent children to these heinous crimes against humanity over time benue state governor samuel ortom has always criticised president muhammadu buhari on account of the herdsmen who are mostly of fulani stock the president s ethnic nationality observably these have become the governor s visible actions to the endless violent disturbances meanwhile the helpless people under his watch are on regular basis butchered or gunned down by their rivals the negligence leaves much to be desired measuring from section 14 2 b of the 1999 constitution as amended which provides that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government the governor has failed in his duties to protect lives and property in his domain a leader must be proactive there s no strong excuse that can justify the endless horrible scenes in benue propagandas can wait a state governor must take charge and ensure that the territory is calm and secure at every point in time president buhari had charged governors to take charge in their domains remarkably kogi state which is adjacent to benue had earlier witnessed similar ugly scenes but the governor yahaya bello sat down and fashioned a lasting solution that successfully tamed the regular violence in kogi the governor convened a stakeholders meeting involving warring groups set up a joint committee involving host communities farmers and herdsmen with powers to monitor activities and control excesses to prevent retributive or retaliatory violence which usually escalates losses in the area with the joint committees in place any person be it from the host communities farmers or herdsmen that violate the rules will be sanctioned and made to pay for damages after evaluation by the committees among the rules is that if a cow enters a farm and cause any damage the farmer is expected to report to the committee and not to retaliate by attacking the cows or herdsmen as soon as the committee establishes the allegations the damage will be evaluated for the owners of the cows to pay to the farmers without delay by this mechanism anyone taking laws into his hands from any sides will also be sanctioned accordingly and it has worked excellently instructively former us president ronald reagan once said peace is not absence of conflict it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means similarly an american political theorist saul alinsky said change means movement movement means friction only in the frictionless vacuum of a nonexistent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict likewise lawrence butler a us ambassador to the republic of macedonia from 2002 to 2005 in a remark said if war is the violent resolution of conflict then peace is not the absence of conflict but rather the ability to resolve conflict without violence putting these remarks together they point to one direction conflict is inevitable in human existence and occurs in all levels of human society at home across ethnic groups business relations amongst others in other words it s difficult to eliminate differences considering that each person has his thoughts in all cultures races and societies suffice to say that oversights of benue government in controlling the conflicts amounts to weakness and a failure of the administration it makes no sense that people that elected the leaders are frequently sent to their early graves and the governor who is the chief security officer of the state only stands by to attack the president as if the dead bodies can be revived afterwards with the blusters the constitution proactively empowers governors with security votes perceptively it has become a pattern of politicians particularly public office holders that are bereft of ideas to resort to verbal attacks to divert attentions this was abundantly witnessed during the tenure of ayo fayose as ekiti governor all that the people got from the administration was name calling clueless damaged brain or whatever came to his mouth and mind no significant impact or accomplishments for the state throughout the period again many have called for absolute ban of open grazing on account it is antediluvian and promotes ethnic crisis in the society admitted that s a good idea and supports civilization however it can realistically succeed by gradual process and not immediate ban as cattle rearing has existed for centuries and become a livelihood to some persons some grew up as herders thus instant ban without adequate planning and reorientation may not succeed considering that herders are nomadic moving with cattle from one location to another through the bush without even knowing when they cross boundaries in other words bello s approaches in establishing ethnic based conflict resolution committees in kogi for a lasting peace between host communities and herders are worthy of emulation the attacks against presidency cannot birth a solution but escalate the crisis ortom must therefore strategically change approaches for a lasting peace in benue ditto for plateau and other states constantly facing ethnic and religious crisis that always results to bloodbath people s lives matter

michel martin host what is a human life worth that s a question of faith of values and philosophy one that speaks to the most profound meditations about the meaning of life but in america it is also a question of money and that was the question attorney kenneth feinberg was asked to answer when he was selected to be the special master of the 9 11 victim compensation fund the fund was created by congress to bring financial relief to those who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and also to protect the airlines and by extension the economy from almost certain devastating lawsuits what followed was a complex emotional and sometimes painful process that is now dramatized in a new movie called worth here s a clip from the film where feinberg played by michael keaton and his law partner camille biros played by amy ryan describe to their staff what the law creating the fund actually says soundbite of film worth michael keaton as ken feinberg what it says is the victims and their families will be compensated based on economic value lost amy ryan as camille biros what that means they left up to the special master us martin it s a legal drama to be sure but it is also an investigation of the complex terrain of grief and loss empathy and healing and money worth was directed by sara colangelo and she is with us now welcome thank you so much for joining us sara colangelo thank you martin so you know complex tort litigation is not the usual subject for a legal thriller i mean you usually think of things like conspiracies or cover ups or murder mysteries what made you want to do it though what finally got your attention for however many months it took you to do colangelo yeah you know i think i was really interested in the moral conundrum of it all you know how math and calculation of dollars and cents and the kind of rational cold approach to actuarial models how that world would collide with the raw emotion of 9 11 and the heartbreak of thousands of families there was something really interesting in that scenario and in the tension inherent in that scenario i suppose martin well you know i have a clip that speaks to that let me just play that this is where this is the scene in the film where feinberg is first meeting the families he s trying to explain a formula by which compensation would be calculated based on things like how much did the loved one make in his or her life and how much would that person have made over the long run and the families as you might imagine they don t love that let me just play this clip soundbite of film worth unidentified actor 1 as character my boy was a firefighter was he worth less than the guy pushing pencils and trading stocks keaton as ken feinberg no certainly not as a human being no unidentified actor 1 as character their lives ended the same way keaton as ken feinberg but their mortgages did differ unidentified actor 2 as character how dare you crosstalk martin so you know obviously this is not a documentary right i mean it s a feature film and there are a lot of things that were sort of dramatized and stuff but how true to life was that moment i mean did that meeting actually happen colangelo it did and you know from what ken and camille have told me personally and what i ve read in articles these you know first few meetings in new jersey and staten island in parts of new york city they were really fraught with tension and anger and frustration and i think i was really interested in that both in documenting sort of the pain of the claimants but also in trying to understand what the toll was on ken and camille in sort of absorbing all of that anger and just grief and frustration at the process martin you know and some of the other storylines i mean part of that i do want to give it all away but part of the storyline is how he comes to understand that more is needed than just crunching numbers but some of the other storylines are kind of messy

toledo ohio back in the spring a shortage of computer chips that had sent auto prices soaring appeared finally to be easing some relief for consumers seemed to be in sight that hope has now dimmed a surge in covid 19 cases from the delta variant in several asian countries that are the main producers of auto grade chips is worsening the supply shortage it is further delaying a return to normal auto production and keeping the supply of vehicles artificially low and that means analysts say that record high consumer prices for vehicles new and used as well as rental cars will extend into next year and might not fall back toward earth until 2023 the global parts shortage involves not just computer chips automakers are starting to see shortages of wiring harnesses plastics and glass too and beyond autos vital components for goods ranging from farm equipment and industrial machinery to sportswear and kitchen accessories are also bottled up at ports around the world as demand outpaces supply in the face of a resurgent virus it appears it s going to get a little tougher before it gets easier said glenn mears who runs four auto dealerships around canton ohio squeezed by the parts shortfall general motors and ford have announced one or two week closures at multiple north american factories some of which produce their hugely popular full size pickup trucks late last month shortages of semiconductors and other parts grew so acute that toyota felt compelled to announce it would slash production by at least 40 percent in japan and north america for two months the cuts meant a reduction of 360 000 vehicles worldwide in september toyota which largely avoided sporadic factory closures that have plagued rivals this year now foresees production losses into october nissan which had announced in mid august that chip shortages would force it to close its immense factory in smyrna tennessee until aug 30 now says the closure will last until sept 13 and honda dealers are bracing for fewer shipments this is a fluid situation that is impacting the entire industry s global supply chain and we are adjusting production as necessary said chris abbruzzese a honda spokesman the result is that vehicle buyers are facing persistent and once unthinkable price spikes the average price of a new vehicle sold in the united states in august hit a record of just above 41 000 nearly 8 200 more than it was just two years ago j d power estimated with consumer demand still high automakers feel little pressure to discount their vehicles forced to conserve their scarce computer chips the automakers have routed them to higher priced models pickup trucks and large suvs for example thereby driving up their average prices the roots of the computer chip shortage bedeviling auto and other industries stem from the eruption of the pandemic early last year u s automakers had to shut factories for eight weeks to help stop the virus from spreading some parts companies canceled orders for semiconductors at the same time with tens of millions of people hunkered down at home demand for laptops tablets and gaming consoles skyrocketed as auto production resumed consumer demand for cars remained strong but chip makers had shifted production to consumer goods creating a shortage of weather resistant automotive grade chips then just as auto chip production started to rebound in late spring the highly contagious delta variant struck malaysia and other asian countries where chips are finished and other auto parts are made in august new vehicle sales in the u s tumbled nearly 18 percent mainly because of supply shortages automakers reported that u s dealers had fewer than 1 million new vehicles on their lots in august 72 percent lower than in august 2019 even if auto production were somehow to immediately regain its highest ever level for vehicles sold in the u s it would take more than a year to achieve a more normal 60 day supply of vehicles and for prices to head down the consulting firm alix partners has calculated under that scenario said dan hearsch an alix partners managing director it s not until early 2023 before they even could overcome a backlog of sales expected demand and build up the inventory for now with parts supplies remaining scarce and production cuts spreading many dealers are nearly out of new vehicles on a recent visit to the central avenue strip in suburban toledo ohio a road chock full of dealerships few new vehicles could be found on the lots some dealers filled in their lots with used vehicles the supply is so low and prices so high that one would be buyer heather pipelow of adrian michigan said she didn t even bother to look for a new suv at jim white honda it s more than i paid for my house she said ruefully ed ewers of mansfield ohio traveled about two hours to a toledo area subaru dealer to buy a used 2020 four door jeep wrangler he considered buying new but decided that a used vehicle was more in his price range to replace an aging dodge journey suv mears whose honda dealership is running short of new inventory said dealers are managing to survive because of the high prices consumers are having to pay for both new and used vehicles he doesn t charge more than the sticker price he said enough profit to cover expenses and make money nor does he have to advertise as much or pay interest on a large stock of vehicles many vehicles he said are sold before they arrive from the factory chip orders that were made nine months ago are now starting to arrive but other components such as glass or parts made with plastic injection molds are depleted hearsch said because of the virus and a general labor shortage he said auto parts makers might not be able to make up for lost production some tentative cause for hope has begun to emerge siew hai wong president of the malaysia semiconductor industry association says hopefully that chip production should start returning to normal in the fall as more workers are vaccinated though malaysia vietnam taiwan singapore and the united states all produce semiconductors he said a shortage of just one kind of chip can disrupt production if there is disruption in malaysia wong said there will be disruption somewhere in the world automakers have been considering shifting to an order based distribution system rather than keeping huge supplies on dealer lots but no one knows whether such a system would prove more efficient eventually hearsch suggested the delta variant will pass and the supply chain should return to normal by then he predicts automakers will line up multiple sources of parts and stock critical components there will be an end to it but the question is really when said ravi anupindi a professor at the university of michigan who studies supply chains by tom krisher

progressive democrats who had hoped unified party control of the government could spur transformative tax increases on multinational companies and wealthy individuals look like they will have to settle for a more modest outcome tax code changes moving through congress this month would still likely raise more than 1 trillion over a decade and reverse many trump era changes to help fund an expanded social safety net key pieces remain unresolved and progressive activists hope democrats can be swayed by last minute pressure campaigns and the party s desire to unite behind president biden the labor movement does not believe that there is a democrat in either house prepared to block the president s investment agenda for the benefit of giant corporations and billionaires said damon silvers director of policy at the afl cio but if it turned out that there was such a person our members would certainly want to talk to them democrats are weighing how far to go particularly on taxing multinational corporations and capital gains they had planned to use higher taxes tax enforcement and other policy changes to pay for their 3 5 trillion 10 year package the bill is expected to create a paid leave program extend the expanded child tax credit offer renewable energy tax breaks and may create a medicare dental benefit each 1 trillion in tax increases over a decade is roughly a 2 increase in federal revenue comparing republicans 928b infrastructure plan to biden s what s in each proposal progressives are trying to keep tougher tax proposals alive lawmakers including sens elizabeth warren d mass and sheldon whitehouse d r i pressed last week for strong international tax rules senate finance committee chairman ron wyden d ore floated exemptions for capital gains changes that would spare many multimillionaires but keep billionaires within democrats sights now we need congress to finish the job to come through for the american people mr biden said in remarks friday touting his proposed taxes on businesses and wealthy americans but it is far from certain what can pass and lawmakers have acknowledged they may need to pare their ambitions or borrow more the result could be a far cry from the talk of wealth taxes and repealing the 2017 gop tax law that dominated the 2020 presidential primary campaign and weren t part of mr biden s plans democrats slim congressional margins mean they need almost every lawmaker on board centrists balk at the current price tag and the taxes proposed to help pay for it frustrating progressives republicans are united against higher taxes moderates and the leadership are trying to thread a needle with what is clearly a much smaller eye than some progressives would like said todd metcalf a former democratic congressional aide now at accounting firm pwc llp noting that progressives may again have to accept part of what they want do they take that lesson and understand that a more moderate outcome is an acceptable one because it at least advances the ball there is a strong intraparty consensus to reverse some of the 2017 cuts the corporate tax rate is likely to jump to 25 from 21 fitting the preferences of sens joe manchin d w va and mark warner d va that is below the 28 mr biden proposed and the 35 that existed before 2017 democrats also plan to return to the top individual tax rate to 39 6 from 37 the biden plan would start that top bracket at 452 700 in taxable income for individuals and 509 300 for married couples the tax provision generating the most democratic angst is capital gains to progressives it is their clearest chance to push back against wealth inequality they have spent years decrying at this pivotal moment congress faces a key test will they take on three of the worst imbalances in who the nation s tax system serves said chuck marr senior director of federal tax policy at the left leaning center on budget and policy priorities referring to decisions on capital gains international taxes and enforcement will some of the wealthiest people continue to pay little or no income tax and have their bills erased when they die under current law people who die with unrealized gains don t pay capital gains taxes their heirs do but only on gains after the prior owner s death and only when they sell democrats have spent years building the case against these rules as an unfair benefit for the richest americans and there is broad consensus but not unanimity for change mr biden s plan would treat death like a sale and raise the top capital gains rate to 43 4 from 23 8 that change would affect billionaires and others who hold appreciated stock and can avoid income taxes by borrowing against their assets instead of selling moderate democrats are wary members such as rep cindy axne of iowa focus on the effects on family farmers and business owners the biden proposal offers a 1 million exemption to all and would let farm and business owners defer taxes as long as those entities remain owned and operated by the family those assurances haven t satisfied democratic opponents get fox business on the go by clicking here a senate finance committee options list suggests the biden plan but with a 5 million per person exemption instead of 1 million along with a potential 25 million exemption for family farms one potential middle ground would impose taxes on the owner s full gain but defer taxes until the asset is sold rather than making death like a sale for tax purposes opponents of capital gains tax increases hide behind farms in ways that obscure that the debate is really about what happens to the very richest americans a senior white house official said senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said on the guy benson show last week that he prays every night for democratic moderates and warned of the impact of tax increases this absolutely undoes everything we did four years ago and that 30 year tax reform bill he said on other fronts members from new jersey and other high tax states are insisting on relaxing limits on the state and local tax deduction even though the bulk of the benefit would go to high income households some lawmakers including a group led by rep brad schneider d ill have also questioned the need to move as far and as fast on raising international taxes as the biden administration wants the biden plan would raise the minimum taxes paid by u s companies on their foreign profits so many different industries are increasingly facing competition from around the world mr schneider said contending that u s tax levels don t have to match other countries but can t be too far away we have to make sure that we are at a level that is more than worthwhile for companies to stay here another piece of the administration s international tax proposal remains unsettled that is the so called shield which denies u s tax deductions to companies based in low tax countries it is part of enforcing the broader international agreement reached by treasury secretary janet yellen because it would eliminate potential advantages for some non u s companies centrist democrats are trying to respond to business concerns about implementation compliance costs and international pressures said david gamage a former treasury official who now teaches law at indiana university even the moderates i talk to are less sensitive to the thought that we just can t raise taxes on the wealthy he said click here to read more on fox business if democrats can t get the full biden agenda through congress they will still have moved the terms of the debate significantly mr gamage said he said democrats are no longer holding out hopes for a 1986 style bipartisan deal that closed off tax breaks but lowered rates

scientists investigate various models that trace declines in oceanic life denmark s crown prince frederik takes part in a marking of bluefin tuna in skagen denmark august 23 2021 climate change is not only having a significant physical impact on pacific island countries but is also threatening one of their main industries and a major source of food fisheries research shows climate change is altering the migratory pattern of many species of fish including tuna the lifeblood for many pacific island states protecting marine ecosystems and fisheries from climate change has become a major priority among many countries big and small globally but one of the problems has been trying to determine how marine ecosystems function now a team of researchers from australia the united states europe and canada say they may be a step closer to solving the problem in a paper published recently the researchers said that while marine ecosystem models are the key tool to understanding how climate change is affecting the world s food web and fisheries the processes that drive the marine ecosystem s response to climate change may differ widely the uncertainty could be causing models to underestimate future climate change impacts on the world s marine ecosystems they say ryan heneghan a biological oceanographer at the queensland university of technology joined forces with 23 other researchers representing marine ecosystem modeling experts around the world to produce what is now being considered a milestone paper for marine climate change impact projections their findings titled disentangling diverse responses to climate change among global marine ecosystem models were published in the journal progress in oceanography global warming is already driving significant changes in the structure of marine ecosystems across the world s oceans heneghan said the models used in the study showed that climate change will cause the world s marine animal biomass to decline but the modeling does not give a clear picture of the nature of these declines across the world s oceans this century millions of people depend on the world s oceans for food and incomes the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change said in its recent report on global warming that at least 83 percent of the world s oceans will very likely warm further this century that being the case it is essential we find a way to be more accurate in the modeling heneghan said it is widely acknowledged that as climate change warms the waters of the pacific and indian oceans some tuna will be forced to migrate to the high seas away from the jurisdiction of any country the changes will affect three key tuna species skipjack yellowfin and bigeye pacific countries such as the cook islands and territories such as tokelau charge foreign fishing operators to access their waters and heavily depend on this revenue the latest research suggests that movement of tuna stocks could cause a fall of up to 17 percent in annual government revenue to some of the small island states essentials needed this loss will hurt these developing economies which need fisheries revenue to maintain essential services such as hospitals roads and schools more broadly the experience of pacific island states also bodes ill for global climate justice simon nicol principal fisheries scientist for the pacific community an organization that represents 26 countries said the loss of fishing revenue would be devastating heneghan said the joint study was an attempt to try to get an honest picture of what we re missing in our models that could be driving inter model variation fish and other marine animals will burn more energy in warmer waters leaving less scope for growth and reproduction at the same time in regions where primary production from phytoplankton decreases there will be less food which will drive marine biomass down further attempting to summarize the vast complexity of the global marine ecosystem in a handful of equations is enormously difficult and global marine ecosystem modeling is a relatively new field of research heneghan said there is a lot of work to do and we re excited at the roadmap this study provides the scientific community for increasing our understanding of the world s magnificent marine ecosystems
innocent matongo a zimbabwean expatriate worker based in boksburg south africa is ruing the day he decided to latch on to a get rich quick scheme after investing thousands of united states dollars in a pyramid scheme over the last few months he was expecting the biggest pay out of his life last month but just before he was due to receive the huge pay out everything collapsed spectacularly in front of him it s hard to believe but it is what it is he told the sunday mail we were duped big time the pain is unbearable because i lost a fortune imagine i was expecting a pay out of us 20 000 on august 15 that was around the time we usually got our money reflecting in our accounts matongo is among the hundreds of zimbabweans who have been left counting their losses after a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme in which they had invested more than us 5 million collapsed like a deck of cards last week a zimbabwean man using the alias martin mhlanga who ran the crypto share investment scheme in south africa last week disappeared without a trace leaving scores of investors in a lurch mhlanga had over the last year pooled together hundreds of gullible clients under the scheme promising them implausible returns on their investments the investors were asked to pay an initial joining fee of us 30 and a us 300 initial instalment that was then given to the individual who would have referred the new investor many of the investors began sensing that something was not right last week after all the scheme s whatsapp group administrators left their groups abruptly without notice crypto shares had more than 50 whatsapp groups in operation prior to the scheme s dramatic collapse the sunday mail has gathered that trouble began on september 1 when a group of investors were supposed to receive their money mhlanga became evasive giving the investors one excuse after another that is when it dawned on many that they had been scammed victims of the scam have now set up several whatapp groups where they discuss how to recover their money or track down mhlanga matongo later on added this reporter onto one of the groups cryproshares 16 where most of the participants admitted to be in financial distress one group member with username edina claimed to have invested us 10 000 in july and was yet to receive her first payout i took all the money that i had saved and invested after convincing my husband that this might be our jackpot but now we are at loggerheads he says he wants the money back she said she now fears for her marriage others claimed to have contemplated suicide after news of mhlanga s disappearance started circulating on social media some claimed they sold their houses while others took massive bank loans in order to raise their initial investments while most are already counting their losses there are some who are still in denial hanging on to the hope that their pay outs will hit their bank accounts this week another victim who spoke on condition of anonymity said she had sold her car in order to join the scheme i am a zimbabwean who is based in south africa i was supposed to get my first pay out in august but now mhlanga is nowhere to be found she said i sold my car for us 5 000 and took a us 10 000 loan to make it us 15 000 hoping to double the amount mhlanga kept coming up with different ideas where people would invest as much as us 1 000 per week and they were promised to get a profit of us 2 000 after two weeks lawyer and crypto currency enthusiast mr amos nhere said it was unlikely that the fraudster was using his real name making it difficult for authorities to track him down if the investors were promised shares it might make sense to open a fraud case with authorities said mr nhere investors should lodge complaints with stock exchanges so they can seize funds or report him to the police this is fraud but the problem is that it is highly unlikely that he was using his real name and no one knows who he is it s a bit complex national police spokesperson assistant commissioner paul nyathi said cases of cyber fraud were on the increase cases of people being duped of their money are now rampant he said this issue of cyber fraud is on the increase hence the need for people to be vigilant an increasing number of people are losing their hard earned money to these criminals scammers usually use elaborate tactics to gain the trust of their victims in order to defraud them of their money the scammers promise big returns which are usually paid to the early entrants the schemes however eventually collapse as the number of current investors outstrips that of new entrants experts say the only constant in such schemes are the gullible investors who are blinded by the promise of quick riches attempts to contact the scammer on his south african registered mobile number failed his phone is unavailable his company also has no known physical address as he usually communicated with his investors virtually via whatsapp and other electronic platforms a pyramid scheme is a scheme under which a person makes a payment to get the right to recruit others into the scheme for which they receive an income the new recruits also make payments to get the right to further recruit others and in turn receive incomes for recruiting others over a period of time a hierarchy of participants resembling a pyramid is formed with the introduction of new recruits and increased number of participants to the scheme sunday mail

in the pure nickel market expectations of a short squeeze eased last week due to increased goods amid the large inflow of nickel plates after the opening of the import window however the overall domestic inventory continued falling as most of the inflow was from bonded areas meanwhile quotations continued to rise for nickel plate under bill of lading and lme nickel turned into a backwardation structure pointing to the current tight supply of the global pure nickel market on the stainless steel side output cuts driven by power curtailment will be the only negative factor amid tight supply of npi and nickel ore which will lower pure nickel consumption orders of nickel sulphate did not weaken but nickel sulphate prices are likely to fall as the high economics of nickel briquette and increased imports of intermediate products result in supply pressure nonetheless the overall demand is relatively stable nickel prices are expected to move rangebound the risk is that pure nickel inventory is likely to grow further or the import volume will increase more than expected

the managing director of the nigeria sovereign investment authority nsia mr uche orji in this interview on arise news channels spoke about the newly inaugurated board of the agency he also said with the charge by president muhammadu buhari for the nsia to support economic diversification there would be increased investments in infrastructure excerpts can you give us some insights into the operations of the nsia under the immediate past board of directors i will probably like to remind you that the last board was the second board of the nsia and to contextualise my answer i will go back to speak to the role of the first board the second board and how i think the third board picks up the baton and run with it the first board spent some time putting together the core foundation of the nsia and made sure we lived through the principles of accountability transparency and kick started the investment programme of the nsia they also laid the foundation of investing 20 per cent of the stabilisation fund 40 per cent in future generations fund and 40 per cent in the nigeria infrastructure fund the second board drove more into infrastructure they left 20 per cent in stabilisation and 30 per cent in future generation but shifted to 50 per cent in infrastructure fund the reason was we wanted to spend more time looking at domestic infrastructure of the country and this led us into quite a number things you saw us getting involved in healthcare roads agriculture and other aspects of investments secondly on the second board we split our investment committee into two one investment committee looking after the future generations fund and the stabilisation fund and another committee looking after the direct investment and infrastructure fund as we looked at that we saw that the reflection of that was more in seeing us get very deep into domestic infrastructure and i think that is really the effect of part of the role of the second board and i think as we go into the third one the president has given us a mandate to drive more economic diversification and make sure that there is more impact so you will expect to see more in investments in infrastructure that has also been the strategy of the organisation anyway i think we have talked to that many times on this show you are going to see us drive more and more into different aspects of infrastructure and direct investments in the country that will benefit nigerians what is the key mandate of each of the two boards i think the mandate is the mandate of the nsia the nsia was set up with the objective of providing stabilisation support in times of economic stress it was set up with the objective of saving funds for future generations of nigerians and then the third mandate is to enhance domestic infrastructure this is the mandate as established in the law that set up the nsia and i think every alteration of the governance and leadership works towards that mandate i mean and of course the organisation started with really nothing there was nothing it was built from scratch and so as time evolves and different boards come on we are all striving to fulfill that mandate that was set by the law and that is what really the law says so it as about driving returns it is about balancing impact and making sure you are making impact in the economy balancing social impact and commercial returns and ensuring that investments are of national importance ensuring that you are performing and earnings are not just on track with market but also above the market where we can make them better so these are the things that i think board after board at the nsia is working towards so there is really no difference between the second board and the third board we have an overall mandate by the law of nsia but it is just about the evolution of nsia as it grows as it invests and as it makes more impact so the agency has to make investments in various areas home and broad and in various asset classes how does the board arrive at making those decisions that are in the best interest of nigeria when you think about the nsia it is important to understand that that there are three different and distinct funds in the nsia each of them with a different investment policy statement and each of them with a different objective so i will give you an example let s start with the stabilisation fund what is the essence of the stabilisation fund it is to provide funds for the government when it is needed during times of economic stress last year during the covid crisis the nsia had to withdraw 150 million from that fund to give to the government the government made a call as stipulated by the law and you have to make that fund available within seven days that is the process we run within the nsia so that fund is invested in short term liquid instruments the investment policy statement was defined through management working with investment advisers and presented to the board and the board approved it and that was to invest in short term liquid instruments investments grade instruments and treasury bills but mostly kept in us dollars so that is the essence of that stabilisation fund it has very little risk then for the future generation fund the board decided that we needed not to take as much risk as our peers are taking so we split it into four equal parts across the four asset classes that we invest in we invest in private equity 25 per cent of the fund we invest in public equity again 25 per cent of the fund and we invest in what we call other alternatives and hedge funds we tweak these things around within a certain strategic asset and location range depending on how we see the market so for example last year when market opportunity came up and things were not as strong in the market we took advantage to invest so we increased our location into public equities and that paid off handsomely last year and so the decision process is very intricate i mean management meets three times a week and them of course it goes to the board if you want to make any changes one more thing you need to know is that we tend to run this also by an investment international adviser who we work with so these are some of the processes we undertake within the tenure of the last board you have done investments in agriculture healthcare diagnostic centres in luth and elsewhere these are some of the areas that seem interesting that should interest nigerians can you speak more about that so let me speak to the infrastructure fund the infrastructure fund we have process wise you make sure the investments are of national importance it is very important to us that investment benefits is not privatised but that it is something that benefits the country and we make sure that we can get commercial and social returns balanced make sure that we can attract other investors with us and then make sure that there are conducive legal and regulatory environment these are the four tests that we must pass because of the size of the fund we decided to start with a handful of sectors we added some sector later on but we started with toll roads agriculture healthcare power gas industrialisation financial markets infrastructure and more recently we added technology so these are the areas we are focused on at the moment we are developing projects here and we are investing in projects in healthcare we developed our first three projects with luth which is a cancer centre and the radiology and diagnostic centres in kano and umuahia those have become very successful and actually better than i expected we now have a mandate to now roll out 20 across the country including a centre for advance medicine which we are going to build here in abuja in partnership with somebody else in agriculture the president designed the presidential fertilizer initiative which we have drawn we have evolved we have restructured that it has continued to be successful when we started there were less than seven blending plants today there are 51 blending plants when we started there were shortages of fertilizer subsidies were very high today there is an excess quantity of fertilizer and hardly any subsidy so there is a lot of domestic production that is success we have also gone on to make direct investment in agriculture we have a farm in nasarawa state for example and then of course you know about the three big road projects lagos ibadan second niger bridge and abuja kano road these are all things that we are working on what should be expected in this regard specifically when mr president said your new board should make investments that relate to economic diversification basically i think the question and the demand is very straight forward and that is to drive more investment in the domestic sector and i think we are going to see more of the direct investments of the nsia and i think will benefits a number of people at our inaugural meeting we talked to a number of things and it is quite for me very heart warming to see the devolution of the various nsia boards this is the third board and the quality of conversations going on in the board you can see the strength and diversity of different board members especially with regards to having deep local knowledge within the country i mean we are having conversations about logistics yobe lagos port harcourt and agriculture and healthcare and all sort of things so there is enough strength and depth and knowledge to continue to drive that so look for us to do more of the domestic infrastructure investments like i said before we have plan to do 20 of these healthcare projects which i think is going to create a lot of jobs the luth cancer centre employs in an excess of a 100 people and i think in the diagnostic centres we have more than 50 people each and we are going to have 20 more and a big hospital coming up in healthcare not only is that going to save us foreign exchange going for medical treatment abroad which saw with the luth cancer centre during covid people could not travel so most people who unfortunately cancer had ended up paying and coming to our centre and we have very good therapist the second thing is that of course you have seen us in agriculture and you are going to see more in agriculture the farm in nasarawa is doing very well which is very interesting but there is a lot more in logistic that you are going to see us play a role in agriculture this i think is going to be very important for economic diversification but what is even more fascinating is what you are going to see us do in technology we have not been in technology for a while we started investing in venture capital two years ago and now we are going to start making direct investment in technology and it is everything from networking from sub marine cable systems cable landing stations all the way through to metro network fibre and fintech i want to ask if you are putting some money in some of our fintech start ups there are ways to invest in them the nsia has invested in almost every private equity company that exist in nigeria today and we have made a decision to also invest in venture capital firms that exist in the country so we have started making those investments and some of our venture capital and private equity investments that we have made end up investing in those companies so yes we do have some exposure you know one step you move yes but at the moment that is a level of exposure because it is also risk management for us as we continue to development and evolve we are now feeling more confident to start taking direct steps into this area so just watch out that is all i can tell you a lot of work has gone into them and i believe between now and the end of the year you will see us announce a number of real important interventions for investments in these areas this is something i feel very confident that nigeria is going to build a competitive advantage when we were investing in healthcare one thing was clear in new york nigerians have a competitive advantage in healthcare same in london we have doctors we have good people so healthcare investment for us was straight forward same in technology there is a huge competitive advantage in technology that are going to work out to help grow as nsia can you unveil your new board our chairman is mr faouk mohammed gumel gumel was a partner at pwc and then he has gone on to work for a conglomerate that is involved in commodities and agriculture called tgi group he is am executive director there and chairman of a number of subsidiaries farouk gumel is somebody who knows the nsia very well we met in 2012 that was actually when i arrived to start the nsia the then minister of finance ngozi okonjo iweala introduced farouk and i and he is been very close to the nsia and he ran our first strategic session so this is not somebody who is a stranger to the nsia he knows the story very well he has been very instrumental in the history of many things that we have done including fertilizer roads and all that so he is the chairman and we are very glad and he is an inspired choice from the president and we are very happy to have him as our chairman we have ali goni kadugum a top scholar at the college of education in yobe state who is also now a member of the board representing north east there is mr ike chioke a first class engineer who runs afrinvest a rhodes scholar and oxford scholar this is someone i have known for a very long time and he is somebody that we are very pleased to have on our board we have oniyangi kabir sulaiman who was at the ndic as a top examiner representing north central and of course there is isiekwana ikemefuna louis a lawyer the law requires that we must have an imminent legal personality and isiekwana ikemefuna is that lawyer and he also represents the south south region of the country and then there is babatunde sobamowo who represents the south west again who has very experience in the capital market who has also joined the board so this is a group with deep experience across many sectors many of them know nigeria better than i do but interaction of the board first day for me was really remarkable every day you learn and i think this is one of the things i find fascinating just from our early interactions i have very high hopes for what this board is going to accomplish how would your new board and the existing executive management team position for the global economic market development such as the us trade inflation the tapering of bond buying and so on if you remember when who spoke during our earnings announcement and even in january and maybe first quarter when i spoke on the show i made it clear that one of the things that really worried me was inflation we had very successful 2020 and i was very clear that 2021 may not be as strong as 2020 because we were going to start taking some risk off we may have taken some risk off too early because one of the other thing also emerging in the market unfortunately is that against all the data of inflation and growth that is not quite matching up to the stock market exuberance people continue to invest in the market because many times people have come to realise that they have no options so you have seen more and more money go into the market but we have taken some risk off a number of things for us is essentially what you mentioned which is inflation some of us are old school when it comes to investing i understand what inflation can do to the market it is an extraordinary task on the market and makes it very difficult for people to invest what happens with inflation interest rates have to rise to slow down inflation and once they rise equity markets goes down and bond market goes down so we decided to take some risk off and you saw us also swivel more to europe we started buying more european equities because europe has a lot of value and highly rich devalued stocks in the united states so there is a lot of what you call value investment going in europe so we made a switch into european equities a little bit at the beginning of the year and we are going to maintain that look i would rather just leave the last five per cent on the table than chase it all the way and fall off a cliff

as the central bank of nigeria cbn prepares for the launch of its digital currency next quarter obinna chima writes about the expected benefits of the e naira as well as the recently selected technical partner for the initiative central banks in more than 70 countries are presently studying or at advanced stages of developing their central bank digital currency cbdc which are digital representations of fiat currencies developed and issued by the apex banks in line with this in nigeria the central bank of nigeria cbn took a major step towards the launch of its own digital currency commonly known as the e naira last week with its formal announcement of its engagement of global fintech company bitt inc as its technical partner for the project to choose the technical partner the cbn went through a rigorous vendor selection process in line with the public procurement act conducted by seven departmental directors and a deputy governor whereby 15 companies were evaluated the evaluation was based on the following criteria technology ownership and control implementation timeline efficiency ease of adoption support for anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism aml cft platform security interoperability implementation experience according to a document seen by thisday from the evaluated 15 companies bitt came tops with an average score of 82 3 per cent the scores for some other bidders were bitt 82 3 per cent interstellar 76 9 per cent zimbali 76 4 per cent g d 76 3 per cent and emtech 66 4 interstellar s core technology is called stargate which is blockchain agnostic its primary blockchain is the bantu blockchain indeed technological advances in recent years which was further propelled by the covid 19 have led to a growing number of fast electronic means of payment available to consumers for everyday transactions essentially given their source cbdcs are not decentralised but simply a digital token issued as the territory s currency regulated and backed by local monetary reserves the report by zerocap stated in addition cbdcs may or may not utilise blockchain technology depending on the frameworks used to implement the assets into circulation the bank for international settlement bis noted in a report that there are various design choices for cbdcs including access widely versus restricted degree of anonymity ranging from complete to none operational availability ranging from current opening hours to 24 hours a day and seven days a week and interest bearing characteristics yes or no furthermore it points out that many forms of cbdcs are possible with different implications for payment systems monetary policy transmission as well as the structure and stability of the financial system although cbdcs will probably not function precisely like paper notes or bitcoin they will hold some digital features similar to physical cash assets will be easily transferable between entities and carry the same value in third party wallets or platforms these properties also apply to their storage cbdc users will store the tokens in their digital wallets and use the assets wherever they go citizens will most likely need to open an account with their central bank affiliations but storage options will vary from mobile to desktop online and offline anywhere on the planet with cbdcs local or international transfers can occur almost instantly and require much lower fees than the traditional system it will drastically minimise the task of verifying funds or risk monitoring in each banking platform since cbdcs are the actual fiat currencies in digital form reducing fees at faster transfer rates will also promote economic growth and benefit lower classes through low payment fees and higher accessibility to funds since cbdcs are issued through central banks and available to use through digital wallets the unbanked may access and transfer their funds without the need for private bank accounts which are often not at their disposal it will also benefit the underbanked through higher access to financial services with more straightforward frameworks and faster kyc m pesa a p2p payment platform released in kenya is a good example of such inclusion released in 2007 m pesa promoted easy payments and transactions without the need for private bank accounts as a result kenya s access to formal finance grew from 14 per cent in 2006 to 83 per cent in 2019 also digital fiat creates more significant obstacles to illegal activities as physical cash allows funds to be hidden and transferred outside of surveilled financial systems cbn s e naira technical partner bitt is a leader in the cbdc industry with subject matter experts at the intersection of technology and policy the company deployed its flagship product in regulated collaborative multi stakeholder environments including a live cbdc in four caribbean countries and digital currency deployments in barbados and latin america thisday findings also revealed that the bitt dcms for eastern caribbean central bank was vetted by the international monetary fund imf and world bank also the deployment in the caribbean countries was driven by social impact including financial inclusion through special features for the unbanked on off ramp through an accessible agency network and the implementation of zero cost mobile transactions the systems has patent pending offline transaction capabilities and the ability to integrate with other cbdc networks for cross currency exchange overstock which has majority stake in the company is a more than 20 year old publicly traded company nasdaq ostk with over 200m invested in blockchain technology related businesses pelion ventures a 35 year old vc firm manages ostk investments in addition bitt was the first company to digitise a national currency on a blockchain thus creating the first synthetic cbdc with the support of the central bank of barbados governor and the minister of finance that system is still in operation today and is integrated with the largest bill payment processor in the country and both major telcos the government of barbados uses it to collect payments online mmoney has grown to service thousands of merchants andmany more individuals within barbados it is clearly not a closed payment system the main product the digital currency management system licenced to cbn is not a closed payment system the dcms provides the suite of applications for the monetary authority commercial banks merchants and consumers both banked and unbanked a report stated furthermore bitt s market proven digital currency management system dcms encompasses a core transaction network numa architecture network abstraction layer a secure minting system and a digital currency manager for the monetary authority or administrator of the system in addition bitt provides user interfaces for enterprises merchants and retail consumers that enable a variety of actions to achieve each users objectives in managing digital currency transactions and services bitt has built its dcms to integrate with leading blockchain networks also in 2015 bitt started a project to digitise the barbadian dollar also in march this year dcash was designed and developed by bitt in partnership with the eastern caribbean central bank eccb and it became the world s first retail central bank digital currency cbdc to be publicly issued within a formal currency union the historic transaction was the climax of over two years of extensive research consultations planning software development operational training merchant acquisition customer service and marketing achieved through collaboration with the eccb bitt and multiple external stakeholders cbn optimistic about e naira the cbn pointed out that the selection of bitt from among highly competitive bidders was based on the company s technical competence efficiency platform security interoperability and implementation experience in choosing bitt inc the cbn will rely on the company s tested and proven digital currency experience which is already in circulation in several eastern caribbean countries bitt inc was key to the development and successful launch of the central bank digital currency cbdc pilot of the eastern caribbean central bank eccb in april 2021 it explained speaking on the selection process that saw bitt emerge as the cbn s preferred technical partner for the implementation of the cbdc from a group of 15 prospective technical partners nwanisobi emphasised that the bank based its selection assessment on technology ownership and control implementation timeline efficiency ease of adoption support for anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism aml cft platform security interoperability and implementation experience among others bitt was the first company to digitise a national currency on a blockchain thus creating the first synthetic cbdc with the support of the central bank of barbados governor and the minister of finance that system is still in operation today he explained while urging members of the public to embrace the e naira upon unveiling in the forthcoming weeks he also enjoined stakeholders to support the bank s policies stressing that the cbn remained focused on its resolve of being a people centered central bank also the cbn governor mr godwin emefiele expressed optimism that the e naira would bring about increased cross border trade accelerate financial inclusion and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow he said the digital money would lead to easier targeted social interventions as well as improvement in monetary policy effectiveness payment systems efficiency and tax collection cbn s director corporate communications department mr osita nwanisobi explained that the e naira project had been a long and thorough process for the apex bank following its resolve in 2017 to digitise the local currency after extensive research and exploration nwanisobi said cbn s decision was in line with an unmistakable global trend in which over 85 per cent of central banks were considering adopting digital currencies in their countries on her part the director information technology cbn ms rakiya mohammed said every nigerian would have access to the cbdcs when it is introduced she said let me state categorically that cryptocurrency such as bitcoin and the rest of them are not under the control of the central bank they are purely private decisions that individuals make and are not part of this arrangement we have spent over two years studying this concept of central bank s digital currency and we have identified the risks and it is one of the reasons why i said we are setting up a central governance structure that would involve all industry stakeholders to access all the risks as we continue on this journey very soon we would make an announcement on the date for the launch and by the end of the year we should have the digital currency according to her about 80 per cent of central banks across the world are presently exploring the possibility of issuing the central bank s digital currency saying that nigeria cannot be left behind mohammed added you are aware that we have two forms of fiat money the notes and the coins so the central bank s digital currency is the third form of fiat money so this digital money is going to complement the cash and note that we have the central bank digital currency will just be as good as you having cash in your pocket so if you are having the currency in your pocket you are as good as having cash on your phone now why did we need to go into this there are different cases that the central bank is looking at for instance we have remittances which is a huge market in africa we also know that in the last efina report our target for this year was to achieve 80 per cent financial inclusion we are about 60 per cent and at the rate we are going it is unlikely we would meet this target but the central bank digital currency would accelerate this target she said it would support the cashless policy as well as innovation adding that the central bank has a very clear roadmap on this and we are about to move to the next stage of a proof of consent after which we would start a pilot commenting on the upcoming initiative the divisional chief executive at interswitch group mr akeem lawal recently described the move as a forward looking policy initiative from the regulator s perspective adding that it will enhance the convertibility of the naira he said digital currency would also help the country to benefit from the technology which is the future of payments in every sphere of endeavour in his contribution managing director chief executive sd d capital management limited mr idakolo gbolade stated that the impact of digital currency on the economy would yield positive results therefore it is expected that the introduction of the e naira will make payments and transfers easier drastically help in reducing fraud and money laundering risks among other positive benefits

thursday the remnants of tropical storm ida created massive flooding severe flooding is seen in queens on thursday morning of the 13 people killed in new york city 11 were found dead in basements rainfall from hurricane ida flooded countless new york city basements new york had 17 confirmed deaths four in westchester county and the remainder in new york city in new york city two people perished in separate instances in brooklyn and 11 people died in queens of the 11 people who drowned in their apartments in queens 10 of them were living in illegal basement residences a 2008 study by the pratt center for community development found that 114 000 new yorkers lived in illegal basement apartments but researchers say the number is now likely to be much higher the problem is that because these spaces are illegal because there are big fines associated with them because the tenants need the space the homeowners need the income no one wants to talk about it said rebekah morris who leads basement legalization work at pratt told afp so it s very very difficult to assess what the actual numbers are but we know anecdotally that it s very high she added the problem is becoming more acute as new york s population grows but adequate housing fails to keep up over the past decade the city added 629 000 people bringing its population to more than 8 8 million according to us census data released last month all but one death in this week s storm occurred in the borough of queens which has a high immigrant population including many undocumented workers from central and south america morris said basement units are a key piece of the housing ecosystem among immigrant communities essential workers and older residents who cannot afford to stay elsewhere there s such a big crisis here we don t have enough housing and so people rent where they can t get a roof over their head which puts them in danger said morris experts want action taken against unscrupulous landlords who take advantage of low supply and cut corners to maximize profits there does have to be some accountability for the property owners who cut up apartments illegally nicole gelinas urban economics expert at the manhattan institute think tank told afp but activists also say that basement apartments are part of the solution to new york s housing problems it s not basement units per se that are problematic but illegal ones that don t meet basic safety requirements such as suitable emergency exit routes they say the pratt center is part of a coalition of groups trying to help increase the number of legally recognized below ground units under a campaign called base which stands for basement apartments safe for everyone they estimate that there is the potential for the creation of 200 000 safe and affordable basement apartments to boost new york s housing stock mayor bill de blasio did not declare a state of emergency until after seven people s bodies were found in basements on friday mayor bill de blasio said that extreme weather caused by climate change meant new york required a new set of ground rules for those living below ground we need a plan to evacuate

scientists investigate various models that trace declines in oceanic life denmark s crown prince frederik takes part in a marking of bluefin tuna in skagen denmark august 23 2021 climate change is not only having a significant physical impact on pacific island countries but is also threatening one of their main industries and a major source of food fisheries research shows climate change is altering the migratory pattern of many species of fish including tuna the lifeblood for many pacific island states protecting marine ecosystems and fisheries from climate change has become a major priority among many countries big and small globally but one of the problems has been trying to determine how marine ecosystems function now a team of researchers from australia the united states europe and canada say they may be a step closer to solving the problem in a paper published recently the researchers said that while marine ecosystem models are the key tool to understanding how climate change is affecting the world s food web and fisheries the processes that drive the marine ecosystem s response to climate change may differ widely the uncertainty could be causing models to underestimate future climate change impacts on the world s marine ecosystems they say ryan heneghan a biological oceanographer at the queensland university of technology joined forces with 23 other researchers representing marine ecosystem modeling experts around the world to produce what is now being considered a milestone paper for marine climate change impact projections their findings titled disentangling diverse responses to climate change among global marine ecosystem models were published in the journal progress in oceanography global warming is already driving significant changes in the structure of marine ecosystems across the world s oceans heneghan said the models used in the study showed that climate change will cause the world s marine animal biomass to decline but the modeling does not give a clear picture of the nature of these declines across the world s oceans this century millions of people depend on the world s oceans for food and incomes the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change said in its recent report on global warming that at least 83 percent of the world s oceans will very likely warm further this century that being the case it is essential we find a way to be more accurate in the modeling heneghan said it is widely acknowledged that as climate change warms the waters of the pacific and indian oceans some tuna will be forced to migrate to the high seas away from the jurisdiction of any country the changes will affect three key tuna species skipjack yellowfin and bigeye pacific countries such as the cook islands and territories such as tokelau charge foreign fishing operators to access their waters and heavily depend on this revenue the latest research suggests that movement of tuna stocks could cause a fall of up to 17 percent in annual government revenue to some of the small island states essentials needed this loss will hurt these developing economies which need fisheries revenue to maintain essential services such as hospitals roads and schools more broadly the experience of pacific island states also bodes ill for global climate justice simon nicol principal fisheries scientist for the pacific community an organization that represents 26 countries said the loss of fishing revenue would be devastating heneghan said the joint study was an attempt to try to get an honest picture of what we re missing in our models that could be driving inter model variation fish and other marine animals will burn more energy in warmer waters leaving less scope for growth and reproduction at the same time in regions where primary production from phytoplankton decreases there will be less food which will drive marine biomass down further attempting to summarize the vast complexity of the global marine ecosystem in a handful of equations is enormously difficult and global marine ecosystem modeling is a relatively new field of research heneghan said there is a lot of work to do and we re excited at the roadmap this study provides the scientific community for increasing our understanding of the world s magnificent marine ecosystems

a surge in covid 19 cases from the delta variant in several asian countries that are the main producers of auto grade chips is worsening the supply shortage example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video back in the spring a shortage of computer chips that had sent auto prices soaring appeared finally to be easing some relief for consumers seemed to be in sight that hope has now dimmed a surge in covid 19 cases from the delta variant in several asian countries that are the main producers of auto grade chips is worsening the supply shortage it is further delaying a return to normal auto production and keeping the supply of vehicles artificially low and that means analysts say that record high consumer prices for vehicles new and used as well as rental cars will extend into next year and might not fall back toward earth until 2023 the global parts shortage involves not just computer chips automakers are starting to see shortages of wiring harnesses plastics and glass too and beyond autos vital components for goods ranging from farm equipment and industrial machinery to sportswear and kitchen accessories are also bottled up at ports around the world as demand outpaces supply in the face of a resurgent virus it appears it s going to get a little tougher before it gets easier said glenn mears who runs four auto dealerships around canton ohio squeezed by the parts shortfall general motors and ford have announced one or two week closures at multiple north american factories some of which produce their hugely popular full size pickup trucks late last month shortages of semiconductors and other parts grew so acute that toyota felt compelled to announce it would slash production by at least 40 in japan and north america for two months the cuts meant a reduction of 360 000 vehicles worldwide in september toyota which largely avoided sporadic factory closures that have plagued rivals this year now foresees production losses into october nissan which had announced in mid august that chip shortages would force it to close its immense factory in smyrna tennessee until aug 30 now says the closure will last until sept 13 and honda dealers are bracing for fewer shipments this is a fluid situation that is impacting the entire industry s global supply chain and we are adjusting production as necessary said chris abbruzzese a honda spokesman the result is that vehicle buyers are facing persistent and once unthinkable price spikes the average price of a new vehicle sold in the u s in august hit a record of just above 41 000 nearly 8 200 more than it was just two years ago j d power estimated with consumer demand still high automakers feel little pressure to discount their vehicles forced to conserve their scarce computer chips the automakers have routed them to higher priced models pickup trucks and large suvs for example thereby driving up their average prices the roots of the computer chip shortage bedeviling auto and other industries stem from the eruption of the pandemic early last year u s automakers had to shut factories for eight weeks to help stop the virus from spreading some parts companies canceled orders for semiconductors at the same time with tens of millions of people hunkered down at home demand for laptops tablets and gaming consoles skyrocketed as auto production resumed consumer demand for cars remained strong but chip makers had shifted production to consumer goods creating a shortage of weather resistant automotive grade chips then just as auto chip production started to rebound in late spring the highly contagious delta variant struck malaysia and other asian countries where chips are finished and other auto parts are made in august new vehicle sales in the u s tumbled nearly 18 mainly because of supply shortages automakers reported that u s dealers had fewer than 1 million new vehicles on their lots in august 72 lower than in august 2019 even if auto production were somehow to immediately regain its highest ever level for vehicles sold in the u s it would take more than a year to achieve a more normal 60 day supply of vehicles and for prices to head down the consulting firm alix partners has calculated under that scenario said dan hearsch an alix partners managing director it s not until early 2023 before they even could overcome a backlog of sales expected demand and build up the inventory for now with parts supplies remaining scarce and production cuts spreading many dealers are nearly out of new vehicles on a recent visit to the central avenue strip in suburban toledo ohio a road chock full of dealerships few new vehicles could be found on the lots some dealers filled in their lots with used vehicles the supply is so low and prices so high that one would be buyer heather pipelow of adrian michigan said she didn t even bother to look for a new suv at jim white honda it s more than i paid for my house she said ruefully ed ewers of mansfield ohio traveled about two hours to a toledo area subaru dealer to buy a used 2020 four door jeep wrangler he considered buying new but decided that a used vehicle was more in his price range to replace an aging dodge journey suv mears whose honda dealership is running short of new inventory said dealers are managing to survive because of the high prices consumers are having to pay for both new and used vehicles he doesn t charge more than the sticker price he said enough profit to cover expenses and make money nor does he have to advertise as much or pay interest on a large stock of vehicles many vehicles he said are sold before they arrive from the factory chip orders that were made nine months ago are now starting to arrive but other components such as glass or parts made with plastic injection molds are depleted hearsch said because of the virus and a general labor shortage he said auto parts makers might not be able to make up for lost production some tentative cause for hope has begun to emerge siew hai wong president of the malaysia semiconductor industry association says hopefully that chip production should start returning to normal in the fall as more workers are vaccinated though malaysia vietnam taiwan singapore and the united states all produce semiconductors he said a shortage of just one kind of chip can disrupt production if there is disruption in malaysia wong said there will be disruption somewhere in the world automakers have been considering shifting to an order based distribution system rather than keeping huge supplies on dealer lots but no one knows whether such a system would prove more efficient eventually hearsch suggested the delta variant will pass and the supply chain should return to normal by then he predicts automakers will line up multiple sources of parts and stock critical components there will be an end to it but the question is really when said ravi anupindi a professor at the university of michigan

sheri berman argues that post communist left embrace of economic as well as political liberalism allowed populists to target the latter dziurek shutterstock com over the past decade or so the euphoria associated with the collapse of communism has turned to pessimism as many once promising democracies in eastern europe have slid into illiberalism and even authoritarianism understanding why this happened is crucial not only for scholars of the region but supporters of democracy worldwide since east european countries are wealthier today than in 1989 with citizens having access to products and conveniences they could only have dreamt of under communism economic grievances are often dismissed as potential causes of support for right wing populists and the democratic backsliding set in motion by them but such reasoning rests on a simplistic understanding of the transition to and the social and political consequences of neoliberal capitalism although eastern europe is of course distinctive in many ways research by scholars from the region about these consequences has lessons for those trying to understand the role played by neoliberal capitalism in causing democracy s problems in other parts of the world today misleading assessments a new book by kristen ghodsee and mitchell orenstein taking stock of shock provides an excellent jumping off point based on their own work and that of other east european scholars ghodsee and orenstein make clear how misleading assessments based on simple aggregate measures of economic growth gross domestic product and so on can be they show that while east european countries are indeed wealthier today than in 1989 getting there entailed immense economic suffering and social dislocation the transition to capitalism generated the largest and most enduring economic collapse to affect any world region in modern history in the more successful central european countries this collapse was comparable to that experienced by the united states during the great depression in other post communist countries it was worse and lasted longer in some cases for decades during this period on average poverty increased by 23 percentage points and in ten countries including poland poverty rates increased by 49 percent or more before starting to decline ghodsee and orenstein found that at peak misery in 1999 45 percent of all the people in postcommunist countries lived below the absolute poverty line of 5 50 day taking stock of shock not only details the suffering experienced by post communist societies on their way to becoming the relatively prosperous economies of today but also makes clear that this was not equally shared income and wealth inequality exploded and deep divisions between urban and rural areas educated elites and workers old and young developed as a result of the transition become a social europe member support independent publishing and progressive ideas by becoming a social europe member for less than 5 euro per month your support makes all the difference click here to become a member this was particularly dislocating since before 1989 eastern europe had been among the most equal regions of the world moreover as ghodsee and orenstein note it is one thing to be thrust into deep poverty for the first time in your life it is quite another thing to be thrust into poverty when some of the people around you are enjoying previously inconceivable levels of personal wealth this they say left deep scars on the collective psyche social dislocation moreover it is not just the traumatic economic consequences of the transition to capitalism that a focus on the relatively high contemporary gdp enjoyed by east european countries today misses as taking stock of shock makes clear the social dislocation has been immense perhaps the most obvious manifestation is a demographic crisis of historic proportions after 1989 emigration from eastern europe was unprecedented in speed scale and persistence compared with emigration experiences elsewhere this was accompanied by a collapse in fertility and a surge in mortality homicide and crime more generally shot up along with binge drinking heart disease suicide and other deaths of despair particularly among middle aged men living outside big cities cumulatively many east european countries experienced population declines akin to or even greater than those experienced by countries involved in major wars even though gdp recovered in the us and european countries after the great depression all scholars of the period accept that the associated economic suffering had immense political consequences in some countries of course it triggered the collapse of democracy that similar if not greater economic suffering along with the profoundly disruptive social changes experienced by east european populations since 1989 would not have political consequences is unimaginable yet why have nationalist populists so often been the beneficiaries of eastern europe s traumatic experiences as ghodsee and orenstein note since it was the losers of the transition sometimes referred to in the region as thrown away people older working class less educated and or rural citizens who disproportionately supported nationalist populists explaining their political behaviour is crucial that these voters became the base of nationalist populist parties in the region was not as myriad scholars including david ost maria snegovaya anna grzymala busse milada vachudova and gabor schering have shown because they were inherently prone to vote for illiberal xenophobic politicians rather it was because nationalist populists rather than left parties proved most responsive to their economic grievances ardent champions in the years after the transition most parties of the left in eastern europe became ardent champions of neoliberalism even more so than many of their counterparts on the right and in government implemented painful neoliberal reforms this allowed them to separate themselves from the communist past while neoliberal capitalism was presented as the necessary path to economic modernisation by the east european left parties west european counterparts reforms also of course advocated by the european union the outcome was that left parties became associated with neoliberalism and the economic suffering and social dislocation generated by it on top of this they often refused to present themselves as champions of workers and other groups that lost out in the transition indeed many left as well as liberal parties saw concessions to the losers as a potential threat to the political and economic liberalism they so desperately wanted their societies to realise the irony of course is that by inextricably linking economic and political liberalism and not responding to the suffering and dislocation caused by the former many left and liberal parties created opportunities for nationalist populists who cared little for the latter scholars including those mentioned above have shown how nationalist populists purposefully solicited those who felt they had lost out directing their anger at foreigners european bureaucrats and crypto communists and implemented at least some policies which addressed their economic grievances more clearly than in western europe scholars have been able to trace the electoral path of many of neoliberal capitalism s losers from left liberal and other parties into the arms of nationalist populists obvious lessons although facile comparisons should be avoided it is hard not to see some obvious potential lessons from eastern europe at the very least research on the transition there should remind us that aggregate measures of growth and development can hide immense economic suffering and that the social costs of neoliberal capitalism can be even greater than its economic ones in addition the political consequences of neoliberal capitalism are often indirect and complex while there is little correlation between wealth and the success of nationalist populist parties it would be wrong to dismiss the causal impact of economic grievances that these had anti democratic political consequences was not inevitable it depended on how various political actors reacted to them that left and liberal parties were often unwilling or unable to offer responses to these grievances within the framework of liberal democracy created an opportunity for others not committed to that framework to do so this is a joint publication by social europe and ips journal

finally to be easing some relief for consumers seemed to be in sight that hope has now dimmed a surge in covid 19 cases from the delta variant in several asian countries that are the main producers of auto grade chips is worsening the supply shortage it is further delaying a return to normal auto production and keeping the supply of vehicles artificially low and that means analysts say that record high consumer prices for vehicles new and used as well as rental cars will extend into next year and might not fall back toward earth until 2023 the global parts shortage involves not just computer chips automakers are starting to see shortages of wiring harnesses plastics and glass too and beyond autos vital components for goods ranging from farm equipment and industrial machinery to sportswear and kitchen accessories are also bottled up at ports around the world as demand outpaces supply in the face of a resurgent virus it appears it s going to get a little tougher before it gets easier said glenn mears who runs four auto dealerships around canton ohio squeezed by the parts shortfall general motors and ford have announced one or two week closures at multiple north american factories some of which produce their hugely popular full size pickup trucks late last month shortages of semiconductors and other parts grew so acute that toyota felt compelled to announce it would slash production by at least 40 in japan and north america for two months the cuts meant a reduction of 360 000 vehicles worldwide in september toyota which largely avoided sporadic factory closures that have plagued rivals this year now foresees production losses into october nissan which had announced in mid august that chip shortages would force it to close its immense factory in smyrna tennessee until aug 30 now says the closure will last until sept 13 and honda dealers are bracing for fewer shipments this is a fluid situation that is impacting the entire industry s global supply chain and we are adjusting production as necessary said chris abbruzzese a honda spokesman the result is that vehicle buyers are facing persistent and once unthinkable price spikes the average price of a new vehicle sold in the u s in august hit a record of just above 41 000 nearly 8 200 more than it was just two years ago j d power estimated with consumer demand still high automakers feel little pressure to discount their vehicles forced to conserve their scarce computer chips the automakers have routed them to higher priced models pickup trucks and large suvs for example thereby driving up their average prices there will be an end to it but the question is really when ravi anupindi a professor at the university of michigan the roots of the computer chip shortage bedeviling auto and other industries stem from the eruption of the pandemic early last year u s automakers had to shut factories for eight weeks to help stop the virus from spreading some parts companies canceled orders for semiconductors at the same time with tens of millions of people hunkered down at home demand for laptops tablets and gaming consoles skyrocketed as auto production resumed consumer demand for cars remained strong but chip makers had shifted production to consumer goods creating a shortage of weather resistant automotive grade chips then just as auto chip production started to rebound in late spring the highly contagious delta variant struck malaysia and other asian countries where chips are finished and other auto parts are made in august new vehicle sales in the u s tumbled nearly 18 mainly because of supply shortages automakers reported that u s dealers had fewer than 1 million new vehicles on their lots in august 72 lower than in august 2019 even if auto production were somehow to immediately regain its highest ever level for vehicles sold in the u s it would take more than a year to achieve a more normal 60 day supply of vehicles and for prices to head down the consulting firm alix partners has calculated under that scenario said dan hearsch an alix partners managing director it s not until early 2023 before they even could overcome a backlog of sales expected demand and build up the inventory for now with parts supplies remaining scarce and production cuts spreading many dealers are nearly out of new vehicles on a recent visit to the central avenue strip in suburban toledo ohio a road chock full of dealerships few new vehicles could be found on the lots some dealers filled in their lots with used vehicles the supply is so low and prices so high that one would be buyer heather pipelow of adrian michigan said she didn t even bother to look for a new suv at jim white honda it s more than i paid for my house she said ruefully ed ewers of mansfield ohio

aging dodge journey suv a pair of unsold 2021 highlander sports utility vehicles and a camry sedan are parked on the empty storage lot outside a toyota dealership in englewood colorado on aug 29 a global shortage of computer chips has forced automakers to temporarily close factories limiting production and driving up prices the coronavirus delta variant is now causing shortages of other parts photo david zalubowski associated press mears whose honda dealership is running short of new inventory said dealers are managing to survive because of the high prices consumers are having to pay for both new and used vehicles he doesn t charge more than the sticker price he said enough profit to cover expenses and make money nor does he have to advertise as much or pay interest on a large stock of vehicles many vehicles he said are sold before they arrive from the factory chip orders that were made nine months ago are now starting to arrive but other components such as glass or parts made with plastic injection molds are depleted hearsch said because of the virus and a general labor shortage he said auto parts makers might not be able to make up for lost production some tentative cause for hope has begun to emerge siew hai wong president of the malaysia semiconductor industry association says hopefully that chip production should start returning to normal in the fall as more workers are vaccinated though malaysia vietnam taiwan singapore and the united states all produce semiconductors he said a shortage of just one kind of chip can disrupt production if there is disruption in malaysia wong said there will be disruption somewhere in the world automakers have been considering shifting to an order based distribution system rather than keeping huge supplies on dealer lots but no one knows whether such a system would prove more efficient eventually hearsch suggested the delta variant will pass and the supply chain should return to normal by then he predicts automakers will line up multiple sources of parts and stock critical components there will be an end to it but the question is really when said ravi anupindi a professor at the university of michigan who studies supply chains contributing yuri kageyama

three different people have served as minister of marine affairs and fisheries under indonesian president joko widodo left to right susi pudjiastuti edhy prabowo and sakti wahyu trenggono indonesia s new fisheries minister faces a challenging task as he follows in the footsteps of a pro business politician now locked up for taking bribes and a tough talking seafood exporter whose boat burning policies made her wildly popular with fisher folk but analysts say the portfolio is an important one because the sprawling archipelago nation can take a leading role in boosting indonesia s economy while combating illegal unreported and unregulated fishing which the united nations describes as one of the greatest threats to marine ecosystems and fisheries sustainability indonesia is the world s second largest producer of seafood and it is important to have their leadership sally yozell who directs the environmental security program at the stimson center a washington think tank told benarnews the new minister doesn t have to be public and outward but the fisheries minister needs to be a champion for the fishing community edhy prabhowo sakti wahyu trenggo s immediate predecessor as fisheries minister lasted only 13 months in the job sakti is third person to be appointed the post by president joko jokowi widodo who was first elected in 2014 edhy s time in office ended abruptly last november with his arrest on suspicion that he took 25 7 billion rupiah u s 1 8 billion in bribes to lift a ban on lobster larvae exports the lifting allowed lobster larvae to be exported to china vietnam and singapore but the move was heavily criticized as harmful to indonesia s wild lobster stock as well as damaging local economies through lost revenue in july indonesia s corruption eradication commission kpk sentenced edhy to five years in prison for accepting cash in exchange for issuing permits for the export of lobster larvae his conviction sealed the end to edhy s unpopular tenure as minister edhy went to prison two years after president joko jokowi widodo decided not to reappoint susi pudjiastuti a businesswoman and owner of a seafood export company as fisheries minister she was best known for her up front demeanor public charisma and willingness to travel around the country and spend time on boats with fishermen in addition to her aggressive approach to fighting illegal fishing from china vietnam and elsewhere most visibly through a policy of sinking and blowing up foreign boats caught poaching in indonesian waters susi also made the country s boat tracking data public and pushed regulations to reduce the use of environmentally dangerous and unsustainable fishing practices this included initially implementing the ban on lobster larvae exports in 2016 minister susi was a brilliant person who really understood politically how to balance being a person of the people a champion of the fishing community but also the economic importance of sustainably managing fisheries yozell said edhy a confidante of former presidential candidate and current minister of defense prabowo subianto no relation was a member of parliament from 2009 2019 and had no experience in the fisheries sector he undid several of susi s policies putting a stop to the sinking of illegal boats and re starting the licensing of foreign fishing vessels which with better boats and technology often out compete indonesian fishermen for diminishing fish stocks edhy put growth ahead of conservation and how to protect fisheries said arifsyah nasution oceans campaigner at greenpeace indonesia who is based in aceh most of the indonesian fisheries areas are exploited or over exploited but re opened licensing for foreign fishing boats the same ones susi cracked down on in 2015 his successor sakti has thus far taken a more moderate approach including re implementing some of susi s policies originally from central java sakti is close to jokowi and is best known for founding two telecommunication firms pak sakti tries to be more moderate not so pro business and gives more room for input for civil society arifsyah told benarnews baskets of fish for sale are seen at a fishing port in banda aceh indonesia july 15 2021 investments over marine conservation it may not matter as the ministry of marine affairs and fisheries no longer has as much authority or sway as it did under susi that s because there has been a shift in power to another cabinet member luhut binsar pandjaitan the coordinating minister for maritime and investment affairs the key decision maker on how the indonesia government manages marine areas is not the ministry of maritime affairs anymore said arifsyah luhut s influence is quite big under jokowi luhut plays a key role in attracting foreign investment and has a close relationship with chinese foreign minister wang yi luhut s role in president jokowi s cabinet has been growing with some even calling him the real president a former military commander he is also a businessman with significant interests in natural resources he was a key force behind indonesia s omnibus bill on job creation passed last october which included many clauses that concern arifsyah when it comes to marine livelihoods under the omnibus law we re concerned that coastal communities and indigenous peoples are at threat of their livelihoods being violated by the expansion of coastal mining sand mining ports and reclamation projects arifsyah said environmentalists are concerned that the omnibus law will speed up the approval process for potentially harmful infrastructure projects reduce the requirements for environmental impact permits and limit the role that civil society and community groups play in challenging projects reclaiming leadership exactly why susi wasn t re appointed despite her popularity remains unclear some believe that foreign concerns including from china played a role the country was prior to 2015 the main source of illegal foreign fishing in indonesian waters according to a study chinese vessels that engaged in iuu fishing were responsible for between 2 000 and 5 000 hours of fishing per month nearly 10 times that of the next biggest perpetrators thai vessels for those in the elite who were doing trade with foreign countries particularly china she was upsetting them yozell said they thought it was time for her to go fabio scarpello a researcher at the university of auckland in new zealand who studies indonesian fisheries believes that susi s combative style also played a role susi s harsh managerial style alienated many parties scarpello told benarnews the coalition against susi included fisheries companies both in indonesia and abroad lawmakers and senior politicians this may have been why despite her popularity among the regular indonesians she was replaced under her management indonesia took a global leadership role on fisheries and marine protection the country hosted the our oceans conference in 2018 and was active at international forums that has mostly been abandoned and it s unclear if sakti will resume it

fed chairman doubles down on loose money as inflation rages by mike gleason precious metals markets were rallying on some early previous friday remarks from jerome powell the federal reserve chairman was speaking at the jackson hole virtual gathering of central bankers friday and saturday and he started off by emphasizing the view that high inflation readings will come down soon there is still a question of whether anything has changed since the last fed policy meeting there fed officials had suggested they may soon begin tapering their asset purchases something that could give the fed s money masters an excuse to back down on tapering is the recent global surge in covid cases linked to the delta variant some countries including australia are back in full lockdown mode in the united states mask mandates are back in many of the more authoritarian jurisdictions and vaccine requirements are increasingly being imposed by businesses and local governments just a few weeks ago president joe biden had touted the vaccine as a ticket to freedom from mask mandates now his team of government health bureaucrats is telling everyone to wear masks calling for more contact tracing and warning that additional vaccine booster shots will be necessary the risk is that the virus keeps mutating to thwart every effort aimed at achieving herd immunity but optimists on wall street are pricing in a robust economic recovery to continue in spite of the threats from the virus and fed tapering it s unlikely the central bank will get very far into tapering if wall street decides to throw a tantrum the fed may also face pressure from the big spending biden administration to reverse course and ramp up its bond purchases given the political realities capitalist and commentator steve forbes argued in his latest what s ahead commentary that tapering will likely be short lived steve forbes now concerning tapering every month the fed has been buying 120 billion of government bonds and mortgages thanks to covid 19 stimulus bills passed by congress and money previously created by the federal reserve out of thin air the financial system today is awash in liquidity corporations hold trillions in cash banks are loaded with lendable funds consumer checking accounts are at record levels given all this the continuation of the scale of the fed s bond buying should be fueling far worse inflation than what we ve been experiencing this gets to the fact that the fed will not be in control of its destiny if congress passes president biden s humongous spending bills the central bank will face irresistible pressure to buy bonds to help finance this extravagance if investors are overestimating the fed s ability to rein in liquidity then they may be underestimating inflation risk and undervaluing precious metals gold and silver markets have lagged this year but are showing signs of gathering strength in recent days precious metals markets have been basing out during these summer months while the price action has been frustrating for bulls it may ultimately be healthy for the long term bull market outlook the bigger the base the bigger the directional move that can follow an investor rush into gold and silver for protection from inflation negative real interest rates and systemic risks in financial markets remains to fully play out mike gleason is a director with money metals exchange a national precious metals dealer with over 50 000 customers gleason is a hard money advocate and a strong proponent of personal liberty limited government and the austrian school of economics a graduate of the university of florida gleason has extensive experience in management sales and logistics as well as precious metals investing he also puts his longtime broadcasting background to good use hosting a weekly precious metals podcast since 2011 a program listened to by tens of thousands each week home

gold teases intraday low consolidates friday s heavy gains the us off cautious sentiment triggers pullback from the key upside hurdle ecb stands out the central bank events japan eurozone gdp are important too gold weekly forecast xau usd bulls remain in control following dismal nfp data update gold struggled to capitalize on the previous session s strong positive move to the highest level since mid july and witnessed a subdued range bound price action on monday despite disappointing headline nfp print additional details of the latest us monthly jobs report kept alive hopes for an imminent fed taper announcement this was evident from a sharp intraday spike in the us treasury bond yields on friday which kept a lid on any further gains for the non yielding gold in fact the yield on the benchmark 10 year us government bond jumped back above 1 32 which in turn provided a much needed respite to the us dollar bulls a strong follow through usd recovery from one month tops was seen as another factor that contributed to cap the upside for the dollar denominated commodity apart from this the underlying bullish sentiment in the financial markets also acted as a headwind for traditional safe haven assets including gold the downside however remains cushioned amid relatively thin liquidity conditions on the back of a holiday in the us this in turn warrants some caution before confirming another rejection near the 1 832 34 region and positioning for any meaningful corrective slide around gold previous update gold xau usd begins the crucial week on a back foot down 0 11 intraday around 1 825 heading into monday s european session an absence of the us and canadian traders join sluggish economic calendar and the coronavirus woes to weigh on the market sentiment underpinning the gold price weakness it s worth noting that the cautious mood ahead of crucial central bank meetings and important data scheduled during the week also allows gold buyers to consolidate the recent gains gold s pullback from the seven week top could be best linked to the mildly offered stock futures and treasury yields favoring the us dollar index dxy that said the dxy rises 0 08 intraday to portray a bounce off monthly low covid 19 conditions remain grim in asia pacific and join the latest china taiwan tussles to weigh on the market sentiment furthermore political play in japan and downbeat headlines from afghanistan also portray a mild risk off mood amid a quiet asian session this week comprises three key central bank meetings namely the ecb rba and boc which in turn keeps the traders on their toes and curtail the previously risk on mood also in the line were q2 gdp figures from eurozone and japan which in turn probe gold buyers additionally downbeat us employment data for august and weak ism services pmi raised challenges for the global economic outlook and also poke optimists moving on global markets are likely to remain inactive as american and canadian traders enjoy an extended weekend hence a pullback can t be rejected but the odds favoring a trend change are likely minimal technical analysis despite the failure to cross a seven week old horizontal hurdle around 1 832 34 bullish macd and upward sloping momentum line back the recovery moves from the yearly low also favoring the gold buyers is the metal s sustained trading beyond the 200 dma level of 1 810 as well as a clear upside break of a three month old descending trend line now support around 1 795 it s worth noting that the 1 800 add to the downside filters whereas june s low around 1 750 becomes the key support past 1 795 alternatively a daily closing beyond 1 834 becomes necessary for the bulls to progress towards the early june s low near 1 856 however any further upside will enable gold buyers to aim for the 1 900 threshold and a fresh three month high beyond 1 916 gold daily chart trend further upside expected

labor day is being celebrated in the united states today under conditions of a devastating resurgence of the pandemic and a growing movement of workers to break free of the corporatist trade unions on labor day 2020 the total number of covid 19 deaths in the us had just surpassed 190 000 one year later the death toll is over 660 000 with total cases over 40 million due to the spread of the delta variant and the back to school policy spearheaded by the biden administration the number of hospitalizations for children 17 and under has increased fivefold since june at least 76 children have died from the disease since july 22 alone in his official labor day message biden said after more than a year in which essential workers made extraordinary sacrifices and carried our nation on their backs this labor day we see more clearly than ever that we must build an economy that responds to the needs and aspirations of working people the extraordinary sacrifices of workers in the form of mass death are the product of the deliberate decision supported by both the democrats and republicans to subordinate the lives of millions to the demands of the corporate and financial oligarchy now biden is honoring american workers by overseeing the elimination of federal unemployment benefits for millions of jobless workers beginning today this includes the 300 a week federal payment to 7 5 million unemployed workers who have already exhausted their state benefits and will get nothing the cutoff occurs right after the supreme court overturned the moratorium on evictions threatening as many as 11 million households in the coming months the reopening of schools and the whip of hunger and homelessness are aimed at driving millions of workers back into dangerous workplaces to produce the profits needed to finance the bailout of the corporations and the banks the federal reserve continues to pump over 120 billion a month into the financial markets which has fueled the meteoric rise of the stock market and a 62 percent increase in the wealth of america s billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic whatever biden s rhetoric about building an economy for everyone american workers are laboring longer hours producing more and earning less in real terms than they did in 1979 a report for labor day 2021 produced by the economic policy institute found that net productivity had grown 59 7 percent from 1979 2019 while a typical worker s compensation grew by only 15 8 percent this historic reversal in the position of the working class has only been accomplished with the assistance of the afl cio and other trade unions after suppressing strike activity for four decades the number of major strikes called by the unions last year fell to eight the third lowest level since 1947 in his labor day statement biden claimed over the years the labor movement has won many battles establishing the 40 hour work week integrating workplaces eliminating child labor securing health and safety protections for workers and countless other victories biden s mythical description of the unions is completely at odds with reality and he knows it the unions long ago abandoned the eight hour day basic health and safety and other protections the united auto workers united steelworkers and other unions routinely enforce 10 and 12 hour workdays in the factories at auto parts maker dana inc mandatory overtime has forced many workers to labor 84 hours a week one worker 60 year old danny walters died from a seizure after collapsing on the assembly line at the company s dry ridge kentucky plant while the unions have spent decades forcing workers to accept the destruction of every gain won through bitter struggle for the past year and a half they played a critical role in forcing tens of millions to work amidst the pandemic the biden administration is currently relying on the american federation of teachers aft to send millions of teachers and students back into covid infected schools in her own labor day statement aft president randi weingarten touted the aft s back to school for all campaign which she wrote involved a get out the vote style campaign in support of in person learning that s caring fighting and showing up in action weingarten who makes 500 000 a year for her services to the ruling class exuded indifference to the fate of teachers and children alike from the reopening of schools the delta variant she wrote has thrown us a curveball a curveball weingarten could not even mention the number of teachers and other workers who have died and are dying from the pandemic as it would only expose her own role in supporting the criminal policies of the entire ruling class let us provide the figures for her at least 1 600 active and retired k 12 educators and personnel have died of covid 19 including at least 181 school personnel since july 1 2021 while exact figures are hard to obtain more than 3 500 healthcare workers have died 500 meatpacking and food retail workers and hundreds of transit workers including 156 in new york city alone the past 18 months could hardly provide a more devastating exposure of the role of those who claim that the official unions are workers organizations the promotion of the afl cio by the democratic socialists of america and other pseudo left organizations is aimed at strengthening a labor police force comprised of upper middle class executives to isolate and suppress the class struggle but the working class which is fighting not just for improved wages and conditions but to save lives is coming into a direct conflict with these corporatist syndicates over the last week thousands of dana workers have repudiated a contract proposal brought back by the uaw and usw workers at many factories have rejected the deal by a 9 to 1 margin with workers in toledo ohio unanimously defeating it by 435 to 0 the uaw and the usw for their part have refused to call a strike and are forcing dana workers to work on labor day to stockpile parts for the company the overwhelming repudiation of the union backed contracts at dana follows the rebellion against the uaw and six week strike by volvo trucks workers in dublin virginia it also follows the 1 006 to 45 vote against the united mine workers contract by warrior met coal miners in alabama earlier this year and the stubborn resistance of nurses in worcester massachusetts on strike for six months there is a growing movement of workers to establish genuine organizations of working class struggle rank and file committees independent of the trade unions at dana workers in michigan ohio kentucky missouri and other states have formed the dana workers rank and file committee to coordinate their struggle and win the support of far broader sections of the working class at volvo the struggle was sustained and led by a rank and file committee established with the assistance of the world socialist web site this is the form through which the class struggle must and will develop nor are these conditions unique to the united states a growing movement of train workers autoworkers in india and the uk bus workers in ireland miners in chile and all sections of the working class internationally is striving to break free from the shackles of the nationalist and pro capitalist unions the challenge facing workers in the us and internationally is to unify their struggles into a common offensive against the ruling class policy of death inequality and exploitation in may the international committee of the fourth international initiated the formation of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees workers throughout the world must take up as an urgent task the building and expansion of the

this part picks up the company history in 2002 after chairman yang rong was forced out advertisement have you missed the previous part history of brilliance jinbei part 1 picking up the pieces after the yang s removal brilliance state of chaos requires a thorough reorganization under direction of bo xilai liaoning province re instates its control over brilliance and jinbei the first step is establishing huachen automotive group holdings where huachen is the chinese translation of brilliance just to keep things nice and simple huachen then buys all of the brilliance shares of yang s development fund for a fraction of their nominal value as a result huachen becomes the controlling shareholder of brilliance zhonghua junjie brilliance bs4 as sedan and stationwagon advertisement not much later huachen also buys back jinbei auto from faw through a very complex transaction that transforms jinbei auto into a subsidiary of brilliance although there are all kinds of holdings in between the next step follows in 2007 when brilliance is delisted from the american stock exchange instead brilliance is listed in hong kong this completes bo s coupe d état and places brilliance firmly under state control the actual structure of the company is as follows state holding company huachen owns 42 3 of brilliance and the rest is publicly traded huachen does have a majority of voting rights brilliance wholly owns jinbei auto and manages two car manufacturers it controls 41 of old truck factory now renamed shenyang jinbei vehicle manufacturing through jinbei auto the rest is publicly traded and 51 of the old van factory now called shenyang brilliance jinbei automotive with the remaining 49 in the hands of jinbei auto zhonghua kubao brilliance bc3 coupe advertisement needless to say the joint venture with mg rover never went ahead but brilliance had another trump up its sleeve bmw brilliance was already familiar with the germans because of their earlier negotiations about land rover in 2003 the two parties establish a joint venture between jinbei auto and bmw bo xilai ensures that the new bmw factory is erected almost next to the factory for zhonghua models another crisis another strong man while the trucks and vans provide the revenue brilliance tries to develop its zhonghua brand in the first half of the 2000s export to europe among other things is high on the agenda and brilliance brokers a deal in 2007 with a large german dealer organization that will distribute the cars across the continent on paper it looks promising the zhonghua cars have a modern platform look attractive and cost a lot less than local brands it is therefore not surprising that the german car industry does not like to see the newcomer on their home turf and they start an underhand campaign to discredit the brand the most obvious example is when a german agency crash tests one of the zhonghua models for the chinese market according to euroncap standards although the car scores quite well good enough for 3 stars with other participating european sister organizations the lack of an esp system is used by the german adac to not award those stars zero stars for unsafe chinese car is the headline in the european car press and the damage is done all zhonghua export models would be equipped with the esp system as standard which was already known at the time of the crash test a handful of zhonghuas as brilliance bs4 or bs6 are sold in europe but the german importer quickly throws in the towel brilliance bs4 crash test in china itself zhonghua does well for some time the brand s cars are more advanced than the chinese competition s proprietary products and high profile power struggle does not seem to affect sales too much for a while in 2004 zhonghua sales drop 60 and jinbei vans 20 and the company turns to loss the chinese customer has decided zhonghua does not keep up for the rapid developments of the market and turns to other new brands meanwhile the brilliance board of directors seems to have a revolving door employment policy with countless changes of leadership talented engineers and managers leave the company to pursue other opportunities in these circumstances the deputy mayor of dalian city becomes the new chairman more importantly qi yumin has enjoyed a long career in business management before his job in dalian he makes some aggressive changes securing credit lines with banks lowering prices of the cars so the zhonghua models drop from semi premium to mainstream and selling some marketing and sales channels to the bmw brilliance joint venture the turnaround is quick in 2007 brilliance makes 130 000 cars zhonghua and jinbei and returns a healthy profit qi yumin qi yumin makes far reaching decisions the most important one is probably to rely on mature technology from outside suppliers instead of creating its own r d it saves time and money but it also makes the zhonghua brand lose its cutting edge technology lead among domestic brands the return to profit for the self owned is short lived in 2009 brilliance transfers the entire zhonghua estate to parent company huachen so that it is no longer on the listed balance sheet walking a tight line in 2014 brilliance made a renewed attempt to create a premium car with a new brand name the huasong 7 this mpv relies entirely on bmw technology and has quite large dimensions once again the car is an excellent attempt by chinese standards but the huasong is not a commercial success either huasong 7 things are going well for jinbei for a long time the brand has always been successful with the toyota technology based vans a distant descendant of the model from the 80s is still available but also modern variants in addition jinbei also plunges into the passenger car market this happens when brilliance buys and modernizes a bankrupt car factory in southern mianyang initially they restart the production of pickups and suvs already made before the bankruptcy not much later a whole palette of ordinary passenger cars follows jinbei clearly focuses on the budget market the cars are cheap and simple suvs or mpvs for rural china jinbei 750 a cheap mpv jinbei dalishen pickup jinbei granse based on toyota granvia meanwhile an entire range of minibuses and mini trucks have appeared under the jinbei brand as well these cars are developed and built in collaboration with motorcycle manufacturer shineray from chongqing huachen and shineray xinyuan in chinese set up a joint venture in 2008 initially the cars are sold exclusively under the jinbei brand in china shineray is reserved for the export versions but more recently some shineray models are also available in china these models are new energy vehicles or electric cars jinbei haixing x30 made by brilliance shineray and that brings me to the following brilliance and jinbei have spectacularly missed the entire chinese nev market they hardly make any electric or electrified models and those shineray vans are developed by a subsidiary of shineray under qu yumin s rule the zhonghua range of cars is renewed in the first half of the 2010s but very little has happened since the same neglect for new products is apparent with the jinbei passenger cars after the initial launch very little development has been brought to the market decline and bankruptcy zhonghua s decline is spectaculair from 150 000 cars sold in 2016 to a little over 3 000 in 2020 all the while the brilliance group is still profitable the explanation lies in the great success of the joint venture with bmw this joint venture is ultimately the big money maker for brilliance so that s where the focus is it s own brands are on life support from the proceeds of the bmw brilliance joint venture this is an unsustainable policy which is underlined in 2019 after the central government lifts the restriction on foreign ownership of chinese car factories to be effective in 2022 bmw intends to acquire full control over the joint venture brilliance shareholders agree to sell half of their shares so bmw will own 75 of operation next year it also means brilliance profits from the joint venture will be cut in half brilliance current line up mostly consists of suvs like the v3 and v6 qi yumin is forced to take drastic measures again in december 2017 he sells half the passenger car unit of jinbei brilliance jinbei to renault for the amount of 1 yuan so it becomes an 51 49 joint venture between the chinese and french the next year he sells the entire stake in brilliance shineray then it s time to rebuild the remaining parts of the empire qi can rely partly on the engine and components business but it s not enough to support the entire company he makes little effort to revive the zhonghua brand but does invest in nev technology in 2018 briliiance and lsev and e bike manufacturer xinri set up a new joint venture for small electric vehicles brilliance xinri i03 it is not enough though as covid hits brilliance operations are stalled for extended periods the company only sells a bit over 3000 vehicles in the first half of the year and total debt rises to almost 15 billion in august all operations come to a full stop in october the company forfeits a bond repayment of almost 1 billion and creditors start bankruptcy proceedings in november a liaoning court enters the company in official bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings placing it under control of an curator in december investigations start against qi yumin over suspicions of fraud jinbei guanjing konect based on renault kadjar brilliance bankruptcy is remarkable because so far local governments did the upmost to protect their local businesses but liaoning province decided not to spend public anymore on the recurring losses of the automaker s chinese operations the bankruptcy procedure is usually a lengthy one debt recovery and a restart of operations are the objective in the case of brilliance it might prove to be difficult on the one hand it s hardly imaginable that such a large company will be liquidated on the other the huge debts are hard to ignore in the early part of the proceedings rumors appeared about a possible takeover by faw but it has been silent since the bankruptcy proceedings do not affect the listed companies of the company such as the xinchen engine company or its joint ventures with bmw and renault company overview all right let s take look at the brilliance group of companies below is a simplified corporate structure a more elaborate one is at the very end of the article for those who might be interested brilliance corporate overview click to enlarge brilliance huachen automotive group holdings co ltd wholly state owned holding company for the brilliance group

one of the great successes of the chinese car industry is the wuling hongguang that car is a low cost medium mpv think dacia lodgy that you rightfully can call the citroen 2cv of china with nearly 5 million units sold in about 10 years the hongguang has made a huge contribution to the mobility of the average chinese especially if they only had a limited household budget and did not live in one of the major cities advertisement a long company history precedes the creation of the hongguang and as usual the early history of wuling has little to do with cars the name wuling itself dates back to the 1980s sixty years after the company laid the foundation stone aircraft rice mills and combustion engines in 1928 in liuzhou the second city of the province of guangxi bordering vietnam the spade went into the ground for what was initially called the liujiang machinery factory i can already tell you that this factory has undergone countless name changes over time however to keep the story clear i will always refer to the factory by its most famous name liuzhou machinery factory advertisement the then ruling kuomintang founded the factory as a workshop for the repair of army equipment already in the early 1930s the factory is placed under the control of the fourth army which adds it to its aviation division aircraft repair is then the main purpose but there is also the first start of in house development combustion engines are being tinkered with and in the early 1930s liuzhou machinery even develops an engine that runs on coal replica of liuzhou built training aircraft in addition to service and maintenance liuzhou machinery also begins to assemble the whole aircraft these are mainly light training aircraft but in 1937 it also presents a single seat fighter aircraft during the first half of the turbulent 1940s with the second world war and the chinese civil war liuzhou machinery remains part of the military arsenal but that changes when the communists take power in 1946 the plant was put under the control of the province and from 1948 onwards it focuses on agricultural mechanization it starts making machines for processing sugar cane rice or corn among other things advertisement liuzhou machinery also assembles combustion engines to drive those machines as a result of this activity it builds a new factory in 1958 called liuzhou power machinery to make large marine diesel however china is in an economic recession as a result of the great leap forward and the shipbuilding market has completely collapsed marine diesel engines are therefore never manufactured we ll leave liuzhou machinery here for now and focus on liuzhou power machinery despite the factory s false start it is in fact the real predecessor of car manufacturer wuling before that happens however the factory will go through another phase tractors sewing machines and looms in 1962 the government of guangxi separated the liuzhou power machinery factory from its parent company and made it an independent enterprise the idea for marine diesel has long since been abandoned and has made way for completely different products first wood loggers and then agricultural tractors in 1964 the first model went into production and was given the brand name fengshou from 1966 the factory name also reflects the new activity liuzhou power machinery is renamed liuzhou tractor factory liuzhou fengshou tractor production in the 1960s china is still largely an agricultural economy so tractor production is good business production starts at about 500 tractors per year but will increase tenfold over the next decade this makes liuzhou tractor a successful industrial company by chinese standards meanwhile the former parent liuzhou machinery factory is expanding its activities it sets up the tianyang auto parts factory and the guangxi first machine tool factory and establishes its own subsidiary liuzhou magneto factory its main business is still making combustion engines and supplying liuzhou tractor leading to the type 70 truck engine in the late 1960s feiyue truck introduction with a parade the guangxi revolutionary committee the provincial government assesses at the time already that agricultural production alone will not be enough the sustain the production needs and those new products are needed the committee decides on truck building and instructs another agricultural company liuzhou agricultural machinery factory founded in 1954 together with liuzhou machinery factory to jointly select a suitable model in 23 days of 1969 they hand build the feiyue truck basically an imitation of the yuejin nj130 the truck is equipped with a type 70 engine this truck building effort is quickly renamed liuzhou automobile manufacturing factory and is later swallowed up by the dongfeng conglomerate in the mid 1970s guangxi government predictions become a reality the growth of liuzhou tractor is largely over china is the eve of major economic changes which will have major consequences for the agricultural sector all this time tractors have been part of the planned economy the central government guarantees a certain number of purchases but this provision was deleted in 1978 liuzhou tractor is suddenly stuck with a production surplus of several hundred units in the free market and must reform to keep the company profitable advertisement for the feiyue under its later name liujiang lz130 of course liuzhou tractor is thinking about car production like many others at the time a chinese military committee has just signed a licensing deal with mitsubishi to produce l100 minicab vehicles but liuzhou tractor is being skipped as a possible manufacturer as an interim solution the factory focuses on producing sewing machines and looms for spinning cotton wanjia sewing equipment however car production is not given up liuzhou tractor imports a mitsubishi from japan and starts its own engineering process that of course comes down to copying the mitsubishi liuzhou completed this process in 1982 and a year later all necessary licenses and permissions from the government are arranged small scale serial production started in 1984 liuzhou tractor changes its name to liuzhou light vehicle factory for the occasion wuling lz110 minitruck with wanjia logo the copied mitsubishi comes on the market as liuzhou lz110 the logo is a stylized letter w borrowed from the brand name wanjia used for the sewing machines in 1987 industrial design student wei hongren makes a modified version of that logo wherein the w is built up of five small diamonds liuzhou light vehicle adopts that logo while introducing the wuling brand name the literal translation of wuling is five diamonds liuzhou light vehicle also negotiates a license from mitsubishi so the wuling vans are no longer illegal copies made on a large scale from 1988 onwards five diamond logo the first wuling is based on the third generation mitsubishi minicab from 1977 in 1990 based on the fourth generation minicab from 1984 the successor hits the market under the chinese name xingwang meaning dragon both types turn out to be well put together and wuling soon becomes the leading producer of these minibusses disai visa and saic we return briefly to the liuzhou machinery factory over the years this factory has increasingly focused on producing combustion engines but has also had a department that makes car parts since the late 1960s you guessed it this factory also ventures into a complete car from 1988 they make a small station wagon a steel frame with a fiberglass reinforced plastic body the design is borrowed from the first daihatsu charade this car is made in 1996 under the brand name disai but can only be sold in guangxi province due to licensing restrictions the total production is about 3000 copies liuzhou disai photo by erik van ingen schenau in addition to the minivans liuzhou light vehicle is also interested in passenger cars when production of the citroen visa comes to an end in 1988 wuling manages to take over the remaining stock and production line for a symbolic amount including molds to assemble it the first 200 visas have bodywork from europe but citroen does not send any engines so a 1 liter three cylinder engine from tianjin xiali is mounted just under 1000 chinese visas are sold between 1991 and 1994 after which wuling s passenger car production comes to a halt again wuling visa photo by erik van ingen schenau still the minibusses remain a great success and production quickly increases to 100 000 units per year in the late 1990s even a setback such as a completely submerged factory in a major flood in 1996 cannot stop growth the company s growth and economic reforms of the chinese economy further professionalize the auto industry in liuzhou in 1989 the provincial government established liuzhou wuling automobile enterprise group as a state owned umbrella holding company several companies are brought together under this holding one of these is of course liuzhou light vehicle factory which continues under the name liuzhou wuling automobile remarkably in 1996 liuzhou machinery factory becomes a second major branch under the holding company after the divorce in 1962 mother and daughter have now been reunited under a single roof 1996 flooding disaster to further expand the success story wuling is looking for an international partner for technical cooperation in the late 1990s that search leads to general motors with whom serious negotiations are being conducted around the year 2000 however the cooperation encounters an obstacle gm has just entered into joint ventures with saic and jinbei under chinese law a foreign manufacturer cannot enter into more than two chinese joint ventures this seems like a dead end but there is always a creative solution in this case gm s chinese partner saic is at the center of the story in 2001 saic buys a large stake of about 76 in wuling automobile it then turns to gm and entices the americans into an investment thus in 2002 the triple joint venture saic gm wuling sgmw is created saic holds 50 1 of the shares gm invests 34 and wuling motors owns 15 9 wuling lz110 minivan here we ve reached a fork in the road the wuling brand is mainly marketed by sgmw in which wuling group has little real involvement the wuling company continues with its own activities the remainder of this article will follow the wuling company the brand s story will be the subject of a future article in which we will explore the history of saic so for the story of the hongguang from the opening paragraph you ll need to have a little patience special vehicles car parts and even more combustion engines wuling motors has largely sold its automotive branch but it is of course not the end of the company in the following years wuling motors built a large industrial complex it splits its activities into three major groups in 2001 wuling motors united development was formed this is the branch that focuses on making all kinds of auto parts it sets up several joint ventures with reputable international suppliers in the following years the most famous probably being the french faurecia company in addition to the mitsubishi based cars wuling also manufactures the daihatsu based lz6370 in 2003 liuzhou wuling special vehicle manufacturing was set up this business unit makes all kinds of vehicles also under the wuling name this concerns atvs carts you encounter on the golf course airport or amusement park modifications of commercial vehicles and electric buses finally the liuzhou machinery factory was renamed in 2006 as liuzhou wuling liuji power company the company grows into a major supplier of combustion engines the main customers are the various companies and joint ventures of the saic conglomerate but wuling liuji also supplies numerous other chinese car manufacturers wuling s 500 000th car xingwang minitruck leaves the factory in 2007 a major restructuring and partial privatization of wuling group followed management will bring the three business units mentioned above into an umbrella holding company called liuzhou wuling automobile industry company 49 owned by wuling group guangxi province and 51 by hong kong investment company dragon hill this dragon hill is owned by businessman lee shing who also has interests in mining but unfortunately i can t find anything specific about the man in 2015 guangxi province regained a majority share when wuling automobile industry is floated on the hong kong stock exchange wuling group is then officially renamed guangxi automobile group and controls 60 5 of the shares in the wuling automobile industry dragon hill retains about 13 5 and the remaining 26 is traded on the exchange wuling branded golf cart by guangxi automobile in 2010 wuling motors sold 10 of its shares in saic gm wuling to general motors leaving a small minority interest of less than 6 in the joint venture yet it remains an essential player especially because it licenses the name of the very successful wuling car brand in summary guangxi automobile group is nowadays mainly a supplier to the automotive industry they are an important player in parts and engines and still make special vehicles on a limited scale under the wuling brand name however the wuling passenger cars are a product of the joint venture with saic and gm a strategic decision that has brought the brand great success

friday s non farm payrolls dished out a huge surprise rolling out a gigantic miss to the downside as the us economy added only 235 000 jobs despite a sizeable upward revision of 133 000 to the previous month nothing was going to offset the shock of the miss in the headline data household employment performed strongly helping to push the employment rate down to 5 20 but retail jobs fell at the same time government construction rose only slightly with business services and transport saving the headline number the sweep of the delta variant across the us has clearly impacted travel and leisure demand and has possibly seen many americans hold off returning to the workforce it contrasts with various jobs vacant surveys which clearly show employers screaming to hire and average hourly earnings also released friday rose by a higher than expected 0 60 mom i ll not postulate the underlying reasons for the stubbornly low employment gains in an environment where employers have millions of unfilled jobs the world has plenty of armchair experts to do that needless to say total employment in the us is still over 5 0 million less than pre pandemic and any thoughts that the fomc would signal a taper at this month s meeting are now off the table add in the soft china data last week which usually runs a few months ahead of the us and the hawks are in retreat i would have expected a buy everything sell us dollars frenzy on friday instead all we got was more of a whimper the us dollar rose but not markedly gold rose but not by much cryptos rose because they re cryptos and wall street equities ended up sort of sideways banks fell as us yields eased which makes sense they make more money when rates are rising and the yield curve steepens positively that whimper may e due to the wizards of wall street heading for the exit door right after the numbers for the long weekend today us and canadian markets are closed for labour day sorry labor day in rebellious english so a more genuine reaction may appear tomorrow asia has opened in a circumspect manner this morning with only the fomo gnomes of japan getting excited propelling the nikkei 225 higher as friday s suga rush persists after softer heavyweight china and the us last week and a clampdown a day on the mainland regional investors are hesitating to grasp the us non farms peace dividend which has let basically every central bank in the asia pacific off the us tapering hook waiting for the gnomes of wall street to return from their last long weekend of the summer probably isn t a bad strategy this week features a few heavyweight central bank policy decisions but not much in the way of tier 1 data globally us jolts job openings should show employers screaming for warm bodies while tomorrow s china trade data will be asia s highlight asian investors though are likely to be more concerned about who is next in line for some common prosperity love a soft exports number could cause a negative tremor to sweep asia although it will increase expectations that more central government stimulus is on the way you can cut a bearish bullish case for china equities both ways on a lower number the reserve bank of australia announces its latest policy decision tomorrow rates will remain unchanged at 0 10 but interest will be focused on whether it will roll back its tapering plans that would be a positive for australian equities which are under the ex dividend hammer today bank negara malaysia will also leave rates unchanged at 1 75 with its intentions to support the covid 19 recovery already clearly telegraphed with a fed tapering now of the table until at least the end of the year the ringgit could continue to rally as a potential carry trade candidate the week s highlight will be the european central bank policy decision there will be no change of the lower forever interest rates but recent eurozone inflation data has had the northern european hawks squawking loudly and hunting for doves noise has risen around tapering but i believe the ecb will note the data from china the asian pmis and the us non farm payrolls and clip the hawks wings this time around that shouldn t derail the euro s rally though which is as much a weak us dollar story the us non farms data has thoroughly derailed my fed q4 taper tantrum asian central bank nightmare asean underperformance outlook i will ponder this over the next few days especially once the us is back at work receding fed taper boosts asian heavyweights friday s us employment data substantially lowered the risks of a fed taper

the dollar index reclaimed most of its intraday losses to finish just 0 11 at 92 12 these losses have reversed this morning with the index creeping 0 10 higher to 92 20 leaving the index effectively

mixed this morning with liquidity impacted by the us holiday the us non farms data will take the fed taper pressure of regional currencies for now allowing them to continue the v shaped recovery of the past two weeks the non farms miss should greenlight an increase in appetites by international investors for asean equities once again and potentially some carry trades that should be supportive for regional currencies this week overall the price action is rather less us dollar downbeat than i would have surmised after the us employment data on friday part of that is due to the us holiday i am sure i would prefer to wait until the us returns tomorrow to form a stronger opinion but given the scale of the downside miss it is hard to see the us dollar rallying this week if anything the downside is the greater risk oil slumps in asia on friday oil prices retreated after the soft non farm payrolls as investors fretted that the economic recovery was faltering thereby reducing consumption brent crude fell 0 50 to 72 40 and wti fell 0 80 to 69 20 a barrel the sombre mood has continued in asia after saudi arabia but prices by 1 0 a barrel to asian customers saudi arabia was expected to cut prices to asian customers today but the cut was higher than expected that has seen brent crude and wti retreat by another 0 95 to 71 75 and 86 55 a barrel respectively this morning given that opec is continuing its plan to raise production monthly despite weak data from china and the us raising slowdown fears and saudi arabia looking for market share in the region oil is likely to remain under pressure this week the data calendar is relatively thin of tier 1 releases globally meaning sentiment will drive market moves that should keep oil offered on rallies with resistance on brent crude at 72 50 and 73 70 a barrel a fall through the 100 dma at 71 15 a barrel signals a retest of 70 50 and 70 00 a barrel things could get ugly below 70 00 a barrel wti has resistance at 70 50 a barrel and is testing its 100 dma support at 68 60 this morning thinned liquidity could see support at 67 00 a barrel threatened gold still looks unimpressive a lower us dollar and easing us yields post payrolls lifted gold prices on friday gold finished the session 1 0 higher at 1828 00 an ounce easing to 1826 00 in a moribund asian session the rally on friday was unimpressive despite the headline figure the non farm payrolls miss was a ripe environment for gold to stage a powerful rally as fed tapering fears were swept off the table instead all gold could manage was a modest rally that never threatened the major resistance zone lying just above between 1830 00 and 1834 00 an ounce although a daily close above 1835 00 an ounce clears the technical picture for a move to 1900 00 gold appears to be running out of time to do so the price action on friday reinforces that gold s upward momentum is waning gold investors must now hope that us traders return to the office tomorrow and start selling us dollars meaningfully to keep hopes of higher prices alive if gold falls through support bounded by the 100 and 200 dmas at 1815 50 and 1809 50 an ounce gold could fall to 1780 00

u s vice president kamala harris completed her debut in southeast asia recently one of a series of visits to the region by american officials including deputy secretary of state wendy sherman and defense secretary lloyd austin in the larger context of the u s pursuit of stiff competition with china southeast asia has become a vital variable in the equation of u s china geopolitics but it s not new as early as the obama era southeast asia had been considered an integral part of the american rebalancing strategy given the region s intimate ties and proximity to china and more importantly to the south china sea which could be easily tapped if a country such as the u s with its increasing angst about china ever saw the need during the trump years southeast asia was incorporated into the indo pacific strategy under the euphemism of u s support for asean centrality even though asean has emphasized inclusiveness so as not to be seen as opposing china upon taking office u s president joe biden largely inherited trump s indo pacific strategy and only made a few adjustments in rhetoric although the administration pursues what it calls a peaceful coexistence pattern with china it also says that china poses the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century and the u s relationship with china will be competitive when it should be collaborative when it can be and adversarial when it must be in addition the u s will engage china from a position of strength none of these are much different from trump s strategic positioning on china and the corresponding methodology of dealing with it since the pandemic broke out asean has become china s largest trading partner and the sino asean relationship has been enhanced by vaccine cooperation and economic recovery as for a government trying to forge a united front against china using alliances and partners as much as possible and hedging bets if possible with regard to china s relations with its close neighbors there has always been a temptation for the u s side to seek more fierce competition with china biden is no exception all this provided the background for harris s recent visit to singapore and vietnam first the choice of destinations reflects u s emphasis on some of the key countries in the region making engagement more effective singapore small as it is is very influential in asean because of its leading ideas smart diplomacy and soft power it can also be categorized as a semi ally of the u s because of close military cooperation vietnam has for a long time been trying to upgrade its relationship with the u s with a view toward balancing china s influence especially in the south china sea austin also visited them signaling an unusual u s emphasis second the u s intends to achieve multiple results through the harris visit at a time of much doubt about america s capabilities and commitment to its allies spawned by biden s haste and chaotic military withdrawal from afghanistan harris tried to reassure friends in the region that the u s is still committed to the longstanding relationship with the indo pacific region and with southeast asian countries harris particularly wanted to convey a strong message on the south china sea she harshly criticized china which she said continues to coerce to intimidate and to make claims to the vast majority of the south china sea framing the issue as china making unlawful claims that have been rejected by the 2016 arbitral tribunal decision she repeated the old line that beijing s actions continue to undermine the rules based order and threaten the sovereignty of nations all these accusations are rootless but were made with a view toward inflaming hostility toward china by countries in the region moreover the u s has tried to advance and broaden bilateral cooperation with the two countries largely to serve its own china agenda for example in singapore a series of agreements were announced to address climate change cybersecurity and the pandemic the two sides also agreed to increase information sharing on cybersecurity threats to financial markets to cooperate on identifying coronavirus variants and to address supply chain issues including a global shortage of semiconductors in vietnam harris announced a donation of 1 million coronavirus vaccine doses to the country and the launch of a new cdc southeast asia regional office she also spoke about upgrading the relationship between the two countries to a strategic partnership as well as cooperation on climate space market access and maritime domains on the other hand in a bid to reassure asean countries she added that the u s welcomes competition and does not seek conflict with beijing nor does it want to force any country in the region to take sides actually both singapore and vietnam have expressed their intent not to follow the u s lead in countering china singapore prime minister lee hsien loong warned the u s against aggressively challenging china saying washington s increasingly hard line views could be very dangerous he criticized the u s for having moved from an approach of healthy competition with china to the view that america must win one way or another vietnam s prime minister met with a chinese envoy before harris arrived and said developing vietnam china relations is a strategic choice and a top priority in vietnam s foreign policy china s vaccine aid to vietnam also arrived earlier than the u s donation he emphasized that vietnam opposes politicizing either the pandemic or the tracing of virus origins all these examples show that countries in the region want to develop beneficial relationships with both the u s and china as such the u s hedge against china is doomed to fail
