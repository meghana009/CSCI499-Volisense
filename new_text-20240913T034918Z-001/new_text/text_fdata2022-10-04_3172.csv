it was a mini budget with a major impact shortly after the uk chancellor announced his plans for a new era full of tax cuts there were dramatic falls in the pound a nervous response from mortgage lenders and an urgent intervention from the bank of england such high levels of uncertainty especially during a cost of living crisis have led to widespread criticism of liz truss s new government and a huge boost in the polls for the labour party aside from a u turn on ditching a tax cut for the highest earners at the time of writing truss appears to be sticking to most of her plan but she should take note perhaps of the way her predecessors in no 10 have dealt with economic whirlwinds of the past for there have been plenty some of their effects lasted years and caused major political upheaval here s a reminder of some of them the 1931 devaluation crisis in september 1931 the uk was forced to abandon the gold standard the cornerstone of its economic policy and devalue the pound it was a humiliating moment which came after the british economy and its finances had been severely weakened by the first world war and its aftermath from 1925 the bank of england had kept interest rates high to keep the pound at a fixed parity to gold but by 1931 with rising unemployment and banks failing throughout europe this was not enough as gold reserves drained from the bank it was forced to approach american bankers for a loan to stabilise the currency those bankers demanded drastic public spending cuts as part of the deal including a 20 cut in unemployment benefits the labour prime minister ramsey macdonald believed he had no choice but to agree despite opposition from members of his cabinet and the trade unions in august 1931 macdonald resigned and formed a cross party national government made up mainly of conservatives despite this the pressure on the pound proved too great and in september the gold standard had to be abandoned nevertheless in the following month the national government won a landslide victory attacking the labour party for its economic mismanagement labour did not return to power until 1945 the 1976 imf crisis in september 1976 the uk s economy was in such a poor state that the labour government was forced to go cap in hand to the international monetary fund imf to ask for a record us 3 9 billion loan it was a pivotal moment which seemed to symbolise britain s post war economic decline the uk economy was already facing multiple problems with a growing balance of payments deficit inflation at over 15 an unsustainable government deficit and rising unemployment in return for its support the imf insisted on major cuts to public spending the labour government led by jim callaghan was split over whether to accept these terms but eventually gave in cutting back large swathes of government investment including its council house building programme worse was to come the squeeze on public spending coupled with high inflation led to the government trying to limit pay increases especially in the public sector the 1976 crisis and the subsequent strike wave in the 1978 1979 winter of discontent severely damaged labour s economic credibility opening the way for the election of a conservative government under margaret thatcher the 1992 erm crisis on 16 september 1992 black wednesday the pound came under intense pressure on foreign exchange markets without the support of european central banks britain was forced out of the european exchange rate mechanism erm the centrepiece of government s plan to curb inflation despite desperate measures from the bank of england which raised interest rate in a single day from 10 to 15 that evening the conservative chancellor norman lamont announced that britain was temporarily suspending its membership of the erm after a difficult and turbulent day the conservative government led by john major never fully recovered its reputation for economic credibility while bitter divisions emerged over the future of uk s economic relations with the rest of europe five years later with the economy still weakened and the government cutting spending and raising taxes the labour party under tony blair won a landslide victory in 1997 the 2008 global financial crisis in september 2008 the global financial system suddenly ground to a halt as fear spread throughout the financial system that major banks were insolvent the immediate cause was the collapse of a major us investment bank lehman brothers which held too many risky financial assets with plummeting values it soon became clear that many other banks both in the us and the uk also held too many of these assets as contagion spread governments scrambled to save the entire banking system and the world economy from collapse by october with major british banks running out of cash the labour government nationalised the royal bank of scotland and lloyds while the bank of england provided large undisclosed cash loans to prop them up in total the potential liability to the uk government amounted to pound 1 5 trillion the swift action prevented a global banking collapse which would have crippled the world economy but it still led to a severe and long global recession while the cost of the bailouts led government debt to soar the hard won economic credibility of the labour government under gordon brown was shattered and a conservative liberal democrat coalition government was formed in 2010 in the midst of new market jitters over a looming crisis in the eurozone although these crises had different origins a number of common themes emerge firstly the evidence suggests it is difficult for governments to buck the financial markets when traders have lost confidence in their economic policy credibility in financial markets is fragile it takes a long time to establish can be swiftly lost and hard to recapture the danger for governments is that problems in one financial market can often spillover into others through contagion sometimes with unexpected and global consequences secondly studies have shown that cuts to public spending often one of the most common responses to a crisis can be damaging reductions in spending especially on infrastructure can make it harder to repair the economic damage and stimulate growth finally there is evidence that the damage to a government s economic credibility has long lasting effects on political confidence permanently changing voting intentions weakening support for established parties who have been in power it can lead not only to electoral defeat but disenchantment with the whole political process author steve schifferes honorary research fellow city political economy research centre city university of london

rebekah young is director fiscal and provincial economics at scotiabank photo rebekah young u s incentives and battery materials could present issues there has been a lot of euphoria about the recent climate bill passed in the u s specifically that electric vehicle ev incentives will apply to vehicles made in all regions of north america instead of just within u s borders although no one makes evs in canada yet it s an acknowledgement of the tight integration of vehicle production and their supply chains across all three countries in addition to levelling the playing field for ev auto production incentives presumably will increase regional sales volume creating the chance that canada will get a bigger slice of this growing pie targets to a final mandate right now we re in an uncertain time for dealers overall as governments set ev mandates that may pose challenges under canada s 2030 emissions reduction plan the federal government has committed to a target of 100 zero emission vehicle zev sales by 2035 with interim targets of at least 20 by 2026 and 60 by 2030 but 60 is only eight years away and in the first quarter of 2022 zevs were only 8 of all new vehicle sales that is up from 5 in 2021 but currently ev vehicle inventory is even tighter than internal combustion engine ice vehicles and ev production will only start ramping up in the coming years pricing and affordability challenges are likely to persist in the years ahead the international energy agency iea is looking at the demand for battery materials and the corresponding rise in their prices in march 2022 iea reported that lithium and cobalt prices more than doubled in 2021 while those of copper nickel and aluminum rose by 25 to 40 the largest annual increases since the 2010s and by a wide margin a few of these materials are concentrated in countries such as russia so we don t expect prices will come down just as demand for them starts ramping up broader price pressures around energy costs labour shortages and supply chain reforms will only add to these costs working toward price parity while the cost of assembling evs may come down as higher sales volumes create economies of scale that may be eroded by the metals needed to make their batteries in order to see price parity with ice vehicles innovations in battery technologies must bring costs down and evs may have to become smaller to reach the price point of average consumers currently the typical ev buyer in the u s in particular is going for luxury models it s not necessarily because they re environmentally conscious but because it s an electric version of the type of luxury vehicle they ve always purchased what could speed up the auto industry transformation is that it could be increasingly inefficient and expensive for automakers to build zev and ice vehicles simultaneously and they ll be eager to switch to just one but there are still some 25 million vehicles on canadian roads almost all of them ice so it will be a long time before this stock turns over dealer concerns with evs the shift also raises many pragmatic concerns for dealers with limited inventory over the horizon and competing demand from incentivized u s purchases they may be scrambling to get evs on their lots even as government mandates put pressure on sales targets they will have extra cost pressures in repairing two entirely different types of vehicles dealers will also be involved in a used zev market where consumers may be leery of older batteries or vehicles that might not be updatable to the latest technologies so much of this is dependent on policymakers and dealers need to follow that policy landscape to help determine the best course of action as time goes on

it was a mini budget with a major impact shortly after the uk chancellor announced his plans for a new era full of tax cuts there were dramatic falls in the pound a nervous response from mortgage lenders and an urgent intervention from the bank of england such high levels of uncertainty especially during a cost of living crisis have led to widespread criticism of liz truss s new government and a huge boost in the polls for the labour party aside from a u turn on ditching a tax cut for the highest earners at the time of writing truss appears to be sticking to most of her plan but she should take note perhaps of the way her predecessors in no 10 have dealt with economic whirlwinds of the past for there have been plenty some of their effects lasted years and caused major political upheaval here s a reminder of some of them the 1931 devaluation crisis in september 1931 the uk was forced to abandon the gold standard the cornerstone of its economic policy and devalue the pound it was a humiliating moment which came after the british economy and its finances had been severely weakened by the first world war and its aftermath from 1925 the bank of england had kept interest rates high to keep the pound at a fixed parity to gold but by 1931 with rising unemployment and banks failing throughout europe this was not enough as gold reserves drained from the bank it was forced to approach american bankers for a loan to stabilise the currency those bankers demanded drastic public spending cuts as part of the deal including a 20 cut in unemployment benefits the labour prime minister ramsey macdonald believed he had no choice but to agree despite opposition from members of his cabinet and the trade unions in august 1931 macdonald resigned and formed a cross party national government made up mainly of conservatives despite this the pressure on the pound proved too great and in september the gold standard had to be abandoned nevertheless in the following month the national government won a landslide victory attacking the labour party for its economic mismanagement labour did not return to power until 1945 the 1976 imf crisis in september 1976 the uk s economy was in such a poor state that the labour government was forced to go cap in hand to the international monetary fund imf to ask for a record us 3 9 billion loan it was a pivotal moment which seemed to symbolise britain s post war economic decline the uk economy was already facing multiple problems with a growing balance of payments deficit inflation at over 15 an unsustainable government deficit and rising unemployment in return for its support the imf insisted on major cuts to public spending the labour government led by jim callaghan was split over whether to accept these terms but eventually gave in cutting back large swathes of government investment including its council house building programme worse was to come the squeeze on public spending coupled with high inflation led to the government trying to limit pay increases especially in the public sector the 1976 crisis and the subsequent strike wave in the 1978 1979 winter of discontent severely damaged labour s economic credibility opening the way for the election of a conservative government under margaret thatcher the 1992 erm crisis on 16 september 1992 black wednesday the pound came under intense pressure on foreign exchange markets without the support of european central banks britain was forced out of the european exchange rate mechanism erm the centrepiece of government s plan to curb inflation despite desperate measures from the bank of england which raised interest rate in a single day from 10 to 15 that evening the conservative chancellor norman lamont announced that britain was temporarily suspending its membership of the erm after a difficult and turbulent day the conservative government led by john major never fully recovered its reputation for economic credibility while bitter divisions emerged over the future of uk s economic relations with the rest of europe five years later with the economy still weakened and the government cutting spending and raising taxes the labour party under tony blair won a landslide victory in 1997 the 2008 global financial crisis in september 2008 the global financial system suddenly ground to a halt as fear spread throughout the financial system that major banks were insolvent the immediate cause was the collapse of a major us investment bank lehman brothers which held too many risky financial assets with plummeting values it soon became clear that many other banks both in the us and the uk also held too many of these assets as contagion spread governments scrambled to save the entire banking system and the world economy from collapse by october with major british banks running out of cash the labour government nationalised the royal bank of scotland and lloyds while the bank of england provided large undisclosed cash loans to prop them up in total the potential liability to the uk government amounted to pound 1 5 trillion the swift action prevented a global banking collapse which would have crippled the world economy but it still led to a severe and long global recession while the cost of the bailouts led government debt to soar the hard won economic credibility of the labour government under gordon brown was shattered and a conservative liberal democrat coalition government was formed in 2010 in the midst of new market jitters over a looming crisis in the eurozone although these crises had different origins a number of common themes emerge firstly the evidence suggests it is difficult for governments to buck the financial markets when traders have lost confidence in their economic policy credibility in financial markets is fragile it takes a long time to establish can be swiftly lost and hard to recapture the danger for governments is that problems in one financial market can often spillover into others through contagion sometimes with unexpected and global consequences secondly studies have shown that cuts to public spending often one of the most common responses to a crisis can be damaging reductions in spending especially on infrastructure can make it harder to repair the economic damage and stimulate growth finally there is evidence that the damage to a government s economic credibility has long lasting effects on political confidence permanently changing voting intentions weakening support for established parties who have been in power it can lead not only to electoral defeat but disenchantment with the whole political process author steve schifferes honorary research fellow city political economy research centre city university of london

okta sign logo on headquarters building of identity and access management software company michael vi okta can this sowâ s ear ever return to silk purse status stocks have been cratering it stocks have been cratering more even shares of cyber security companies have fallen with the hack hack etf which incorporates the major cyber security vendors down by 30 on a year to date basis but okta nasdaq nasdaq okta the leader in the identity management category has seen its shares fall far beyond average just how much as of the close on friday sept 30th the shares are down by no less than 76 since the start of the year and by 81 since they made an all time high less than a year ago they were the worst performer on nasdaq for the 3rd calendar quarter falling 37 compared to other leading cyber security names such as crowdstrike crwd down 22 since the start of the year palo alto panw down 13 since the start of the year and zscaler zs down 50 since the start of the year the performance of okta is far worse okta by comparison is all about pivots and turning and rectifying past miscues of various kinds i have recommended the shares of the leading cyber security vendors as â safe havensâ in the coming recession the fact is that all of the 3 companies above have recently reported strong numbers and guided for acceleration in previously anticipated growth and margin performance cyber security is not optional and cyber criminal donâ t recognize recessions threat surfaces keep enlarging and the consequences of breaches continue to escalate i recommend the shares of okta from a contrarian perspective as a former owner of the shares i think it is fair to say that the operational performance of the company has left a bad taste the company executed a strategic merger with autho and then basically fumbled the ball in terms of achieving sales synergies that were a key justification for the substantial purchase price but all of that is now on view and the shares reflect the disappointment surrounding the fumble and no longer reflect the potential synergies and accretion from the merger that to my mind is what makes a contrarian opportunity i donâ t want to suggest that the cyber security companies mentioned above are really quite analogs of okta in terms of what they sell crowdstrike is still mainly a vendor of endpoint security although it recently has begun to sell an identity management module that has proven to be very successful zscaler sells zero trust protection for web based networks while palo alto sells both a zero trust solution and next generation firewalls none of those is identity management and most users will need a combination of various solutions to develop reasonable protection against cyber criminals this is a very unforgiving market the understatement of the year i suppose miscues are punished severely while strong execution merely slows declines sadly okta has had its share of miscues including a couple of data breach and a flawed sales force integration strategy for some years i had been an okta skeptic valuation and lack of profitability had kept me away and i had wondered about the ability of a company to create a competitive moat around the identity management space itâ s an application that has been around a very long time but then about a year ago in the wake of okta s merger with autho a principal competitor with advanced technology in part of the identity management space i e customer identity management and a different sales focus which was centered on the developer community i thought i saw an opportunity i really saw an iceberg and abandoned my position down sharply but down far less than the loss could have been at the start of this year i had been concerned that the breach the company had suffered in january 2022 had been poorly handled and was not satisfied with the oktaâ s response and then reports of sales force integration issues began to emerge and those were finally confirmed during the companyâ s latest conference call i have had to wonder just how it is that a founder led company could mishandle such a key undertaking which had to be a priority as mentioned and to be perfectly clear i recommend the shares of okta from a contrarian perspective i think most of the problems the company has are on full view and i believe most current investors are expecting that the company will reduce multi year targets to some extent when it next reports results in early december the company s latest guidance sets revenue growth goals at very modest levels in this current quarter its forecast is for sequential revenue growth of just greater than 2 that metric was 11 in the same quarter of the prior year followed by sequential growth of 5 in what will be a fiscal q4 compared to 9 the prior year sequential revenue growth in the just reported quarter was actually 9 the results of the quarter just reported were a 5 upside when compared to prior guidance for revenues and non gaap profitability was noticeably improved as well compared to the prior forecast the growth in rpo balances was below forecast but apparently was mainly a function of duration as the growth in crpo at 36 was certainly acceptable for that metric that said the crpo balance rose just 6 sequentially which was apparently below prior expectations this guidance would seem to incorporate the current state of both economic headwinds and the specific sales execution challenges that the company has acknowledged while self evidently the companyâ s management structure has seen some upheaval and sales turnover is elevated with much sales force dysfunction presumably that is why the shares are valued as they are there are many investment opportunities these days in the enterprise software space skepticism abounds about company forecasts just the other day a forecast affirmation by splunk splk brought on a relief rally albeit of brief duration the reason is that many commentators think that all forecasts are suspect and will have to be reduced one well known hedge fund leader dan niles recently provided an interview forecasting that the estimates of software companies were still exposed and would see further cuts one economist nouriel roubini notorious or not depending on the disposition of the reader is forecasting a long and deep recession with the potential for a further 40 drop in the s p at the moment while todd mckinnon the company ceo remains in his position fred kerrest the companyâ s coo is taking a one year sabbatical the company has realigned its product development efforts with the former autho ceo leading product development efforts for customer identity while the cro leads the development of workforce identity cloud products lots of moving parts and signs of organizational stress that said the companyâ s cfo brett tighe has been with the company for more than 7 years and before that he was with salesforce crm in senior financial roles for 11 years and the companyâ s president of field operations susan st ledger has been in her position for about 2 years while the companyâ s chief revenue officer steve rowland has been in his position for 18 months ms st ledger held a similar role at splunk for 4 years while rowland not terribly surprisingly is also a splunk alumni can this leadership team right this troubled ship almost all companies make mistakes and miscues from time to time the same obviously can be said about analysts except our mistakes are on full view every day from 4 01pm on and often earlier than that recently the analyst at guggenheim john difucci upgraded the shares while calling okta a company in disarray last week the analyst at cleveland research ben bollin downgraded the shares from buy to hold he feels that the company is facing more significant fundamental challenges mainly competitive and will have to reduce guidance more substantially than has already been the case the company during its most recent conference call suggested it was revisiting its targets for fy â 26 and i doubt that anyone either owning the shares or providing recommendations is doing so based on a target my reason to revisit the investment thesis is simply that identity management is an enormous and under penetrated market and okta remains the leading participant in the space and i have a strategic disposition to increase my portfolio weighting in the cyber security space as i believe it will be the most recession resistant segment within it there are certainly other choices in the cyber security space these days other than the 3 companies i already own checkpoint chkp has shown some signs of life in terms of its operational performance and shares of rapid7 rpd now substantially rerated have interest cyberark cybr is also a competitor with a very competitive solution in what is called privileged asset management but it is infrequent that a software category leader also has the potential for really significant returns but i think that okta is one such company the questions of course are whether and at what cadence oktaâ s leadership can restore its momentum and start to realize the opportunities inherent in the acquisition of autho and resume its share gains in the space this is not a short term project restoring a broken sales force and crafting the right go to market strategy and messaging almost always takes longer than expected but fortunately for okta cyber security and identity management will be less affected by recessionary headwinds than most other segments of the it space that said unlike most of the other cyber security vendors okta did call out macro headwinds in its prepared remarks although it is easy to question whether this was real or an excuse for sales performance i am not going to uncover some existential valuation metric regarding okta that hasnâ t been analyzed and dissected many times already after falling by 75 even while continuing to grow the ev s ratio has dropped noticeably below average for the company growth cohort even when haircutting the companyâ s expected growth rate to a cohort of around than 30 but the company is projecting just a modest free cash flow margin and that is a significant negative in the current investment environment despite or perhaps because of the valuation compression the shares are not well loved by analysts in addition to the cleveland research downgrade a couple of days ago the moffettnathanson analyst started coverage of the shares just a couple of days ago with a sell rating and a 71 price target at the start of september the morgan stanley analyst lowered his rating on the shares to hold but set a 93 price target one of the many reasons why i simply donâ t set price targets on companies that i cover is that they frequently follow rather forecast stock prices of course no one would reasonably have a price target 20 above a current valuation with a sell rating and it more than a bit difficult to decipher the logic of a price target more than 60 above the current valuation with a hold rating but one of the reasons i am reviewing okta and not something else is that actually quantifying the outlook and using some kind of dpv analysis really does leave targets far far above current levels therein lies the significant potential that said other analysts do see some of the opportunities inherent in category leadership in a key part of the enterprise cyber security paradigm the jefferies analyst joseph gallo described okta shares as a â one of a kindâ buying opportunity with 50 upside of course the upside percentage is greater now with the shares down more than 15 since the date of the research report i was recently accused of using touchy feely analysis in my review of adobe adbe the problem with that recommendation and this one as well is that there isnâ t some kind of specific valuation flag that says â buy me â one thing about buying wounded assets as this one appears to be is that forecasting the timing of a turn is basically impossible when the sales force is fixed and observers believe it to be fixed the shares will most likely appreciate markedly in just a day or two much of that is because okta is the kind of investment that can be very popular with hedge funds due to its size liquidity and easy to understand functionality even now over 80 of the shares are held by institutions while that is a substantial percentage there are no aggressive hedge funds listed as large holders suggesting a potential significant source for share demand another thing to note okta is not going to achieve a turn around from its current condition in a quarter or two the company has suffered from heightened sales turnover basically because many previous autho sales contributors have felt that their sales targets were unattainable and that the comp plan was deeply flawed about the most that one might expect in the short term is that the company stops digging fixing sales execution issues which means dealing with lots of unhappy people doesnâ t happen at the flip of a switch the odds are that okta will right its ship i have been surprised that a company of this stature having a clear priority which was to create a unified sales platform failed to do so in a timely fashion about the most i can say is that this is the opportunity to do so is what is being presented to subscribers readers at this point finally i should mention okta uses stock based compensation and lots of it and there are readers and commentators who refuse to consider companies using sbc one of the things that need to be noted about sbc is how the calculation works out for that metric in particular quarters sbc is calculated based on when an option is vested and not when an option is granted because of last yearâ s acquisition of autho the level of options reaching their vesting conditions has increased on the other hand that increase is abating and thus sbc expense fell year on year in the quarter recently reported and it was flat sequentially but it is still elevated at 38 of revenues although the ratio will almost inevitably decline going forward as the company has moderated its hiring plans the reality is that sbc is tightly correlated with the number of hires so a decline in hiring as the cfo foreshadowed in the latest conference call will lead to lower sbc since i do not use gaap estimates or data in addressing valuation it is necessary to adjust estimates and projections for dilution this company does forecast outstanding shares on both a quarterly and an annual basis based on trends i use annual dilution of 3 5 in calculating valuation metrics macro headwinds just how much of the guidance shortfall is a function of a deteriorating economy there is obviously lots to consider when a company which has achieved an organic growth rate in the high 30 range actually in the mid 40 range all organic last quarter for some time sees growth atrophying to the mid 20 range in a single quarter looking at both glassdoor reviews and reviews from best place to work oktaâ s evaluations are fairly typical maybe a bit above average for an relatively large enterprise software company while oktaâ s management did call out macro headwinds in its prepared remarks on this latest conference call as one reason for its reduced guide management went on to say that the preponderance of its guide down was a function of sales integration and the concomitant issue of elevated sales turnover at some level i would suggest that the scenario being portrayed is quite similar to many of the problems that had upended the alteryx ayx growth outlook before the company took some hard steps and remediated the problems that had crippled its growth i think at this point almost all investors are aware of demand headwinds for most it vendors the company wound up reducing its guidance in terms of revenues the guide down for the last 6 months of the year was about 2 17 million it might be noted that because this guide down was 2 and not some considerably greater number the companyâ s forecast for its full year non gaap operating loss didnâ t change although this was more a factor of the q2 beat on that metric than any dramatic change in the trajectory of opex the company suggested that the macro headwinds being experienced werenâ t all that substantial at least at the time that guidance was provided the company is forecasting that it crpo balance will increase by 3 sequentially and that is where the issues of sales force integration and macro headwinds are most visible while crpo has its own limitations as a proxy for current bookings it is the best metric available to portray the strength of demand growth and the forecast reflects a sharp slowdown in expected sales performance although it is difficult to really know i imagine many investors believe that there are additional shoes to drop with regards to oktaâ s guidance and despite the published consensus that calls for 28 growth in what will be fy â 24 i doubt that many analysts covering the company really expect that kind of performance although i think the likely trajectory of expected margin improvement as shown by the 1st call consensus will prove to be too conservative obviously the question was raised during the conference call the answer isnâ t particularly surprising josh tilton hey guys thanks for squeezing me in just a quick one for brett given all the challenges that you guys mentioned what gives you the confidence that you re not going to have to take numbers down again in the back half of the year brett tighe look we ve baked everything in that we know at this point right we ve taken into account from regardless of what number you re looking at it s current rpo revenue billings we baked in those headwinds that we ve talked about today whether it be the sales integration issues we ve talked about the attrition or even the macro so we do feel confident in the guidance and taking a similar approach and being very prudent about that like we have in the past oktaâ s basic issues and how the company is moving to fix its problems the most significant issues for this company has essentially been that of sales force execution and go to market messaging these are the issues that have upended revenue projections for now those kinds of errors should never happen as they are entirely within the control of the company that said were there not these issues the shares would never have imploded to this valuation even in this toxic market for growth shares i believe that the greatest percentage returns are going to come from identifying those companies with a strong competitive position in a hot space that is generally recession resistant and that is what okta is despite the unforced miscues the ceo had much to explain in terms of what has been happening to okta and how it can be fixed one issue which seems to be very basic relates to defining which product within the okta offering is appropriate for which use case there is overlap between identity management for employees and customer identity management and apparently the overlap has led to salesforce dissension and elevated turnover the problem surfaced in the wake of combining the two sales forces at the start of this current fiscal year okta before the merge had a solution for customer identification as well as a solution for employee identification essentially its core business autho only focused on identity management solutions that are incorporated by developers into web sites that customers access the customer identity space is newer and enjoys stronger growth the tam of both spaces is comparable autho certainly has had marketplace momentum in the customer space most often called ciam customer identity access management and that continued long after the merger when the sales forced were merged it became very difficult to match use cases with solutions the company needed to offer a single customer identity solution and that solution needed to be transcendent for all b2b saas applications that developers are building while it sounds as though it ought to be a simple problem to remediate like many other things the devil is in the details and apparently the details were not carefully considered in advance of combining the two sales forces even on the conference call after explaining about the two product families that are offered by okta some analysts were a bit confused about how the integration of the two sales forces might actually work in practice there was a need to consolidate and train the sales forces with messaging that identified which solution was appropriate for which use case one of the advantages that okta has is that it is a platform neutral solution that offers enterprises the opportunity to optimize their identity management paradigm by standardizing on a single vendor to sell that paradigm the company has to reach the ceo level of its prospects to explain why identity management of both customers and of a workforce are priorities that cannot be properly handled by software in which identity management is an afterthought the message is simple it is desirable to partner with a vendor who can offer the whole range of identity management solutions on a multiplicity of cloud deployments and for many different use cases it seems obvious from afar but part of the sales force integration issue was dysfunction in oktaâ s go to market sales motion at least the company has identified the problem fixing the sales motion is not going to happen instantaneously but is more of a process the most visible element of the integration issue comes from the salesforce attrition turnover rate depending on the place in the economic cycle okta indicated it had averaged about 15 turnover or a bit less in the years before the pandemic turnover is now a bit greater than 20 and much of that turnover has been amongst the former salespeople of autho here is some of the comment from todd mackinnon specifically on the issue like if you re working for auth0 this pre ipo company your it s smaller your territory is probably eight states in the us and now you re working for okta and you re expected as of the first of this year you re being asked to sell to these multiple buyers with multiple products and your number of states or your territory really got smaller because we have this much more scale that sales team i could see why some of them decided to go maybe work for a smaller company and so forth i have to confess that in listening to that part of the conference call and contrasting it with my own experience i got quite agitated whatâ s being described is a rookie mistake and seemsâ well the term unforced error comes to mind i can personally guarantee that the combination of smaller territories with an aggressive hiring plan that will make territories even smaller will inevitably lead to massive sales turnover because salespeople canâ t see how they will be able to achieve objectives and make any money no commission accelerators to be found about the best thing about that is that it is relatively easy to fix and from what i gleaned from the conference call the company is taking steps to remediate that issue again from mr mackinnon but we re starting to see a lot of these trends reverse already which is great we ve talked about a lot of the things we re doing i m sure those are having some effect although some of them are recent but just in terms of the industry i think a lot of small companies especially the prospects don t look as good the valuations aren t as high the money is not flowing there as much as it was i ve already seen a few go to market folks that left for smaller companies and they ve come back and the grass wasn t always greener while i wonâ t accuse the rest of the answer as being the most articulate it probably is reflecting some early trends in which salespeople are discovering that the environment has changed and there prospects are currently better in a larger more stable organization than in a start up whose prospects of going public any time soon are limited it isnâ t terribly surprising that authoâ s sales force has been composed of risk takers who wanted to bet on a huge pay day from an ipo and when instead the company was bought and they werenâ t catered to they went to another situation that appeared to have a similar upside without the potential income from an ipo selling identity management for okta is probably a more attractive alternative currently than had been the case recently particularly after some remediation of the comp plan as management has spoken about the other major issue is that of competition recently gartner held what it called an identity management conference yes there really are such things as identity management summits at the conference some of the presenters and attendees talked about an increased presence by microsoft msft in the space and it was apparently these presentations that were a precipitating factor in the recent cleveland research downgrade cited earlier the fact is however that the microsoft solution is really focused on applications running in azure microsoft has been in the space for almost 10 years at this point and a company such as microsoft that sells applications more or less has to have an identity management solution in order to be considered as a real vendor microsoft s solution was initially built for to be an on prem product there was no azure back when the product was first launched although of course microsoft has a cloud based solution it is unlikely to have the competitive chops that okta brings to this market most customers at least those who are serious about identity management are going to want a specialist vendor because almost inevitably they have a multiplicity of clouds and they need to work with a vendor whose specialty is a multi cloud environment and that obviously is not microsoft identity management can get far more complicated than it might seem and when the subtleties are properly presented and explained oktaâ s position is very strong but of course the issue is carefully crafting the right message and making sure that sales reps are well trained to explain that message carefully and to the right audience oktaâ s problem isnâ t that microsoft had an enhanced set of functionality but that the company needs to do a better job with trained reps presenting the benefits the company offers to the appropriate audience other presenters at gartner s summit conference focused on what are called identity governance iga and okta privileged access management pam which are different sub categories in the space where okta has introduced recent offerings of course i wouldnâ t expect the ceo especially given his role and history at okta to ever admit to a competitive deficiency but i thought he response to the queries was credible and struck me as more likely to be accurate than some of what can be presented in gartner forums and so when i hear people say that iga is iga light it s great because that means it s working that means it s so simple that employees can do these access requests and improve these things just in their chat they don t have to go to some legacy tool it means that the integrations are a snap it comes pre integrated to thousands of apps so i think there s i think you re going to i think the industry is going to see that first of all iga is much bigger than we think it is because the solutions have been constraining the size of the pie it s kind of like everyone said that the itsm market was very small in servicenow started but a better product made the market bigger i think you ll see a similar thing here investor concerns about competition arenâ t going to abate just because of company presentations and outsiders making some competitive assessment are always in a position of having to avoid sensational claims or stories based on an agenda i confess to the temptation myself i know a couple of very satisfied okta users in a large enterprise but looking at the preponderance of the evidence as best as i can i donâ t think oktaâ s problems are competitive but self inflicted wounds stemming from very flawed strategies to integrate two dramatically dissimilar sales paradigms oktaâ s opportunities identity management at a high level is required as part of a cyber security solution there are two primary components to the access market one having to do with the ability of employees to sign on to applications within their corporate firewalls and the other market in which customers can sign on to manage their accounts and to order from vendors there are obviously similarities between both markets but until okta bought autho competitors had focused on one segment or the other as mentioned earlier the key to oktaâ s future operational performance is to present to ceoâ s and other c suite decision makers the benefits they will enjoy by partnering with a leading vendor who has the most complete set of identity management solutions in both spaces and whose solutions are basically cloud neutral while market share data can be slippery at best the okta future is predicated on its ability to grab market share and to achieve the kind of market dominance it enjoys in the single user sign on market a subset of employee identity management the employee identity management market where okta started is currently estimated to have revenues of 13 billion rising to 37 billion by the end of the decade identity theft use cases continue to rise they actually increased 45 in 2020 and rose further last year just in north america the cost of identity theft was said to be 56 billion according to the study linked here attackers use machine learning to generate multiple variants of malicious code every day the consumer identity access management market is thought to be a bit smaller at this time than the workforce identity market but it is growing more rapidly this linked analysis forecasts that ciam as it is often abbreviated has a multi year cagr of 17 okta developed a solution of its own in ciam but with the acquisition of autho it now has the leading market share in the space autho had been oktaâ s leading competitor oktaâ s investor presentation speaks to a tam of 80 billion composed of workforce identity iga and pam of 50 billion with the tam of the ciam space being estimated at 30 billion the tam is based on estimates for 2025 regardless of the precise number of the tam the identity management space is very large and affords okta a substantial growth opportunity for years to come the issue is sales execution messaging and overall go to market tactics and not demand opportunities for the solution okta has the leading market share in both categories the analysis linked here by a market research firm puts its market share at 37 it has a higher share than that in single user sign on perhaps the most basic identity management solution as the analysis linked here shows there is considerable overlap in terms of functionality between ciam and iam which plays strongly to oktaâ s strength i have linked here to the latest gartner magic quadrant analysis for access management which continues to show okta and autho in the leaders quadrant along with microsoft i also have used forresterâ s wave analysis which shows okta with an unambiguous lead in the space the forrester wave review basically suggests that microsoft despite efforts to move beyond its own base of azure and other microsoft centric users is far better suited for microsoft centric users than as a general competitive offering there are to be sure many competitors in the identity management space and there are even more analysis of the vendors in the space i have chosen one to link here identifying many competitors but there wasnâ t anything particular about its analysis that makes it better than the others for some years now okta has been gaining market share in the space as it continues its move upmarket and to add features functions and integrations which is a key differentiator for most users okta has been able to gain market share because of best of breed functionality and because it is platform cloud neutral and because it has always been a cloud first solution so when looking at cagr estimates it is important to note that they do not differentiate between on prem and cloud thus oktaâ s cagr estimates are always going to be greater than the cagr for the market as a whole since cloud is growing far faster than on prem in access management in addition almost all application software vendors have some kind of identity management built into their software but increasingly users want more sophisticated solutions with more features and which work across multiple clouds than are offered by stack application vendors most market research analysts highlight that trend and it should over time be the other major factor in oktaâ s market share gains oktaâ s revenue forecast obviously should be considered as quite disappointing when considering the trends in the market while it is probably impossible to identify which factor is causing a specific percentage of the decline in bookings crpo balances i think it is fair to conclude that even with such macro headwinds as their might be the company should be able to grow its revenues by near 30 so the forecast it has presented of 2 sequential growth followed by 5 in a quarter that usually has significant positive seasonality is far below what i think ought to be a realistic goal for okta should investors buy okta shares now reviewing the company s business model okta shares are so beaten down that they could have a dead cat bounce and at these valuations rumors of pe interest and potential investment by activist investors are likely it was a significant factor in the initiation of the shares at a buy rating by the jeffries analyst that said the ability of the shares to achieve sustainable appreciation will await a more benign market environment for high growth it shares and that in turn will be a function of changes in macro conditions such as inflation changes in employment and the tenor of fed speakers but beyond that okta will have to demonstrate that it is returning to sustained market share gains the opportunity is there and okta certainly has the most complete and functional set of solutions particularly for larger enterprises and the need to prevent identity theft just keeps growing and the consequences for ignoring solutions to remediate the threat are also escalating so it is really a matter of basic blocking and tackling the company management has articulated the tactics to achieve that but it will almost certainly be 2 3 quarters between the identification of problems and their remediation becomes discernible replacing and training lost salespeople and seeing them reach full productivity is always a process of some duration okta is still in the process of realizing some cost synergies inherent in the combination with autho and a bit of that was discernible in the results of the previous quarter non gaap gross margins ticked up slight on a sequential basis rising to 77 last quarter non gaap research and development spending actually declined sequentially and was about 21 of revenues the non gaap sales and marketing expense ratio also showed a small sequential decline although at 37 of revenues there is still much room for improvement although general and administrative expense also fell noticeably at 14 of revenues non gaap that ratio is still very elevated the company has a clear path to profitability given the progress it has been making in that direction and the unit economics of its business and so far as it goes even sbc expense fell from year earlier levels although much of that has to do with the timing for the recognition of option expenses which are recorded when they vest in accordance with the black scholes paradigm as mentioned sbc expense last quarter was still elevated at 38 of revenue down from 41 the prior quarter the year earlier figure was much higher but is not terribly relevant given the timing of vesting the companyâ s operating cash flow margin last quarter was about nil the year over year comparison is not relevant because of the impact of autho on year earlier results the biggest element of the performance in free cash flow this past quarter was the increase in a r balances the quarter according to the cfo was more back end weighted than usual reflecting extended decisioning on the part of some enterprise customers and some large deals were with government agencies such that average duration of contracts in the quarter declined and impacted the increase in deferred revenues the current quarter is also likely to see an elevated proportion of federal cyber security spend as it extends beyond the end of the governmentâ s fiscal year and cyber security spending by the government is apparently at rates of close to 40 okta shares even after their mini bounce since the low that was made in the wake of the downgrade by cleveland research sell at an ev s of about 4 5x that ratio is noticeably less than the average ev s for a low 30 3 year cagr i expect that the company after it remediates its sales execution issues and in a less stressed economic environment can return to mid high 30 revenue growth the company has forecast that it will achieve single digit free cash flow margins this year considerably greater than its forecast for non gaap eps part of that is seasonal and p art will be a function of the likely fall in receivables days outstanding changes in free cash flow are often a function of duration of larger deals and are thus notoriously difficult to forecast but the path to non gaap profitability that is discernible will also encompass rising free cash flow margins having written analysis for donkeyâ s years donkeys have a life span of 40 years so i suppose i have exceeded that it is often the custom to provide a catalyst to support a recommendation i donâ t really like to suggest that a catalyst for this recommendation is the percentage by which shares have fallen although to be sure okta screens well on that dubious distinction this is a contrarian call no one really likes recommending companies with so many moving parts in senior management or whose management team has made some significant unforced errors but that said okta is still the leading company in a hot space and despite some assertions to the contrary i donâ t see any degradation in its competitive position and as i see it its position is such that its long term market share gains should resume once it addresses sales force turnover and improves its messaging to the enterprise okta shares as mentioned have many attractions for institutional investors including size liquidity and a very specific position within cyber security a market space that many institutions want to overweight in this very perilous macro environment despite my previous unpleasant experience in owning the shares i am planning to return for what is hopefully a more favorable experience this time around as with most contrarian calls timing is never exact or guaranteed but my view is that by the time everyone agrees that the companyâ s problems are solved its relative valuation will balloon this is one case in which i would rather be early than late editor s note this article was submitted as part of seeking alphaâ s best contrarian investment competition

it was a mini budget with a major impact shortly after the uk chancellor announced his plans for a new era full of tax cuts there were dramatic falls in the pound a nervous response from mortgage lenders and an urgent intervention from the bank of england such high levels of uncertainty especially during a cost of living crisis have led to widespread criticism of liz truss s new government and a huge boost in the polls for the labour party aside from a u turn on ditching a tax cut for the highest earners at the time of writing truss appears to be sticking to most of her plan but she should take note perhaps of the way her predecessors in no 10 have dealt with economic whirlwinds of the past for there have been plenty some of their effects lasted years and caused major political upheaval here s a reminder of some of them the 1931 devaluation crisis in september 1931 the uk was forced to abandon the gold standard the cornerstone of its economic policy and devalue the pound it was a humiliating moment which came after the british economy and its finances had been severely weakened by the first world war and its aftermath from 1925 the bank of england had kept interest rates high to keep the pound at a fixed parity to gold but by 1931 with rising unemployment and banks failing throughout europe this was not enough as gold reserves drained from the bank it was forced to approach american bankers for a loan to stabilise the currency those bankers demanded drastic public spending cuts as part of the deal including a 20 cut in unemployment benefits the labour prime minister ramsey macdonald believed he had no choice but to agree despite opposition from members of his cabinet and the trade unions in august 1931 macdonald resigned and formed a cross party national government made up mainly of conservatives despite this the pressure on the pound proved too great and in september the gold standard had to be abandoned nevertheless in the following month the national government won a landslide victory attacking the labour party for its economic mismanagement labour did not return to power until 1945 the 1976 imf crisis in september 1976 the uk s economy was in such a poor state that the labour government was forced to go cap in hand to the international monetary fund imf to ask for a record us 3 9 billion loan it was a pivotal moment which seemed to symbolise britain s post war economic decline the uk economy was already facing multiple problems with a growing balance of payments deficit inflation at over 15 an unsustainable government deficit and rising unemployment in return for its support the imf insisted on major cuts to public spending the labour government led by jim callaghan was split over whether to accept these terms but eventually gave in cutting back large swathes of government investment including its council house building programme worse was to come the squeeze on public spending coupled with high inflation led to the government trying to limit pay increases especially in the public sector the 1976 crisis and the subsequent strike wave in the 1978 1979 winter of discontent severely damaged labour s economic credibility opening the way for the election of a conservative government under margaret thatcher the 1992 erm crisis on 16 september 1992 black wednesday the pound came under intense pressure on foreign exchange markets without the support of european central banks britain was forced out of the european exchange rate mechanism erm the centrepiece of government s plan to curb inflation despite desperate measures from the bank of england which raised interest rate in a single day from 10 to 15 that evening the conservative chancellor norman lamont announced that britain was temporarily suspending its membership of the erm after a difficult and turbulent day the conservative government led by john major never fully recovered its reputation for economic credibility while bitter divisions emerged over the future of uk s economic relations with the rest of europe five years later with the economy still weakened and the government cutting spending and raising taxes the labour party under tony blair won a landslide victory in 1997 the 2008 global financial crisis in september 2008 the global financial system suddenly ground to a halt as fear spread throughout the financial system that major banks were insolvent the immediate cause was the collapse of a major us investment bank lehman brothers which held too many risky financial assets with plummeting values it soon became clear that many other banks both in the us and the uk also held too many of these assets as contagion spread governments scrambled to save the entire banking system and the world economy from collapse by october with major british banks running out of cash the labour government nationalised the royal bank of scotland and lloyds while the bank of england provided large undisclosed cash loans to prop them up in total the potential liability to the uk government amounted to pound 1 5 trillion the swift action prevented a global banking collapse which would have crippled the world economy but it still led to a severe and long global recession while the cost of the bailouts led government debt to soar the hard won economic credibility of the labour government under gordon brown was shattered and a conservative liberal democrat coalition government was formed in 2010 in the midst of new market jitters over a looming crisis in the eurozone although these crises had different origins a number of common themes emerge firstly the evidence suggests it is difficult for governments to buck the financial markets when traders have lost confidence in their economic policy credibility in financial markets is fragile it takes a long time to establish can be swiftly lost and hard to recapture the danger for governments is that problems in one financial market can often spillover into others through contagion sometimes with unexpected and global consequences secondly studies have shown that cuts to public spending often one of the most common responses to a crisis can be damaging reductions in spending especially on infrastructure can make it harder to repair the economic damage and stimulate growth finally there is evidence that the damage to a government s economic credibility has long lasting effects on political confidence permanently changing voting intentions weakening support for established parties who have been in power it can lead not only to electoral defeat but disenchantment with the whole political process author steve schifferes honorary research fellow city political economy research centre city university of london

we haven t heard much recently about elon musk s ongoing battle to either finish buying twitter or find a way out of the deal having become unhappy with the condition of the company and its user base one interesting development did pop up over the past week however a court in delaware publicly released six months worth of text messages that musk sent and received between janauary and june of this year in all of these conversations the one thing that an article at slate focuses on is the appearance of musk s inner circle being essentially a collection of yes men who tend to agree with everything he suggests not one of them apparently cautioned against his decision to purchase twitter or if they did they used other channels slate clearly views the decision as a bad one that will cost musk a vast sum of money no matter how it works out and they treat it as a self inflicted wound this development raises some obvious questions more to do with how this court case is being handled than musk s own personal appetites and impulses advertisement elon musk does not have anyone in his life who is willing to tell him no or if he does they don t appear to have his cellphone number on thursday the delaware court of chancery released an astonishing trove of text messages that musk sent and received this year as he contemplated and then went ahead with making an offer to buy twitter for 43 billion not long after twitter accepted the offer and musk signed some paperwork apparently without bothering to do due diligence he changed his mind and attempted to terminate the deal something twitter is now suing to force through unless he gets away scot free far fetched but possible he will either pay a small number of billions of dollars or many billions of dollars and also maybe own a company he does not want all of this was a colossally bad idea but as i read through the 40 pages of text messages which span from january to june of this year one thing that struck me was that no one chatting with the tesla and spacex ceo was willing to counsel him against the deal if there was anyone in his life doing so on some other platform they weren t heeded because musk made the offer assembled the financing announced it to the world and most importantly signed the contract that now weighs approximately as much as a cybertruck and is hanging from his neck i suppose the first question to address is how elon musk s private text messages made it into the public domain normally a person s private digital communications should be precisely that private the exceptions to that rule would arise if the person is accused or at least suspected of a crime and law enforcement was looking for evidence to build a case but this isn t a criminal investigation as far as i know it s a question of a contractual dispute even if the court needed that information we never should have seen it advertisement it indeed sounds as if many in musk s inner circle were egging him on to purchase twitter as the article suggests and to turn it into a haven for free speech to be fair i was guilty of doing the same on my own twitter account but musk appears to have agreed with those who were agreeing with things he had already tweeted in public it does not appear that any of these contacts gave elon musk the idea to buy twitter and eliminate the censorship they were simply echoing his own thoughts was it a bad deal probably the slate article notes that most investment gurus were already predicting that when the fed began raising interest rates the stock value of the big tech and social media companies would take a serious hit that happened as predicted turning musk s offer to buy twitter at 54 20 per share from a generous offer into a totally bonkers one fair enough i suppose but none of these leaked messages reveal the inner workings of musk s mind during the period when he went from looking totally serious about the purchase to regretting the entire episode did musk truly want to put an end to the censorship and make the platform a haven for free speech there doesn t seem to be any indication that he didn t but it s fair to ask whether his complaint about the number of bots on the platform was a legitimate one or whether he was looking for a loophole to get out of the contract he had signed advertisement the bots clearly would impact the total potential advertising revenue twitter could generate for him but i m fairly sure that most of us who use the platform were aware of the prolific armies of bots that inhabit it while not an invalid concern it still made the deal seem less financially sensible but he signed the contract and it now appears that he will either be left paying some number of billions of dollars to get out of it or a massively larger number of billions of dollars to take control of a company that he is no longer enamored with and yet circling back to the original question is elon musk in this situation because he didn t have any brave people in his life who were willing to point this out or had he already considered the odds and the ramifications and decided it was worth the risk anyway i would suggest you look at the success of tesla spacex and his other ventures the man isn t a fool or an idiot remember the old adage about an idiot and his money being soon parted perhaps elon wasn t talked out of it because he didn t need to be talked out of it and if it turns into a loss on his bottom line that was a calculated risk he was willing to take

barge mounted drill rig and from platforms on land has extended some of the mineralized structures which were historically mined at the lac herbin mine some 300 metres to the west and south assay results are still pending since 2019 the company has been exploring the bruell project located 40 kilometres east of val d or under an option agreement with sparton resources expenditure commitments and cash payments have now been fulfilled to grant eldorado 75 ownership in the 29 square kilometre bruell property exploration completed under the option agreement includes targeting programs consisting of geophysical surveys mapping and till and outcrop sampling more recently culminating in 4 745 metres of diamond drilling 11 drillholes in 2022 testing a variety of targets on the property efemcukuru turkiye recent exploration drilling at efemcukuru has targeted untested veins in the western part of the license area these veins located between 400 and 1 500 metres west of the currently producing kestane beleni vein include the muhtar i and ii huseyinburnu dedebag and volkan veins collectively referred to as the west veins they have been mapped over a cumulative strike length of over 4 5 kilometres and extensive outcrop and trench sampling identified high grade gold values on surface in numerous locations earlier this year eldorado acquired the exploration license underlying the western extension of several of the veins which expanded eldorado s footprint in the region figure 3 geology map showing the efemcukuru west vein system and gold assay results grams tonne from surface outcrop and trench samples initial drill testing of parts of the muhtar ii vein began in early 2022 with a total of 7 030 metres in 23 drillholes completed to date several have intersected significant gold and silver mineralization within a segment of the vein measuring approximately 100 metres in strike length and extending downdip for approximately 250 metres notable intercepts include 2 05 metres at 16 76 g t gold and 1 702 0 g t silver drillhole kv 837 1 85 metres at 19 73 g t gold and 73 0 g t silver drillhole kv 833 2 0 metres at 7 96 g t gold and 17 9 g t silver drillhole kv 834 and 1 35 metres at 13 00 g t gold and 15 0 g t silver drillhole kv 842 ongoing drilling of the west vein target area is currently testing the step out of the muhtar veins and will shift to the huseyinburnu volkan and dedebag vein targets later in the year and into early 2023 resource conversion drilling at efemcukuru has been focused on the kokarpinar and bati vein systems kokarpinar and bati are satellite vein systems to the kestane beleni vein which contains all mining to date and hosts the majority of the reserves at efemcukuru over 42 350 metres of resource conversion drilling has been completed on the kokarpinar and bati vein systems at efemcukuru since the previous mineral reserve and mineral resource statement update announced in december 2021 this drilling has targeted the northern part of the kokarpinar south vein and most of the inferred resource areas in both bati 1 and bati 2 veins results of the conversion drilling at efemcukuru will be incorporated in the company s 2022 mineral reserve and mineral resource update expected later this year kassandra mines greece at the olympias operation in greece recent underground exploration drilling has targeted extensions to high grade indicated and inferred resource lenses of the north zone in the upper part of the mine in the 2022 program a total of 1 151 metres were drilled in 10 drillholes at the north zone several of these intersected high grade massive sulfide intervals up dip from the current resource including 6 1 metres at 20 60 g t gold and 668 4 g t silver drillhole ol 1109 5 5 metres at 10 66 g t gold

president cyril ramaphosa will visit britain next month on the first state visit by any foreign leader to the country since king charles iii succeeded his mother queen elizabeth ii on her death last month like us president joe biden s hosting of ramaphosa at the white house on 16 september britain s invitation to him so soon in the new king s reign seems to reflect in part britain s desire to boost his flagging leadership it may also reflect london s ambivalence about south africa s controversial non aligned position on russia s war against ukraine this will be the first state visit hosted by his majesty the british high commissioner to south africa antony phillipson said on monday it reflects the importance of the relationship with south africa the visit will offer a chance to celebrate our modern day partnerships delivering prosperity and security for both countries as well as to set out how we can work together bilaterally and globally to strengthen those links for the future trade and investment trade and investment will feature strongly in the visit observers said though ramaphosa will be visiting britain at a time when its economy has been rocked by the cumulative effects of brexit covid the war in ukraine rising inflation and a messy transfer in the leadership of the conservative party from boris johnson to liz truss truss is battling to find her feet and has just been forced to make an embarrassing and politically damaging u turn on her proposal last week to scrap the top 45 rate of income tax paid on earnings above 150 000 a year this had roiled financial markets and slashed the value of the pound visit daily maverick s home page for more news analysis and investigations another very likely topic of discussion between ramaphosa and truss will be the just energy transition partnership jetp through which the uk european union us germany and france have pledged 8 5 billion in financing to help south africa transition from its almost total dependence on coal fired electricity towards renewables while protecting the livelihoods of coal workers and communities britain is known to be concerned that almost a year after the jetp was signed south africa has not yet managed to draft a comprehensive programme of bankable projects london may also have invited ramaphosa to boost his political stature at home as he faces strong headwinds before seeking a second term as anc president at the party s elective conference in december like most south africans britain has been disappointed by ramaphosa s failure to get a firm grip on the anc and the country but also believes he is the only anc leader who has any hope of salvaging south africa russian invasion russia s war against ukraine is also sure to feature in ramaphosa s discussions with truss britain and the us like other western countries have been concerned by south africa s non aligned stance on the war and its failure to condemn russian president vladimir putin s aggression outright these concerns appear however to have drawn the us and britain closer to south africa rather than pushing them further apart washington and london both seem to have invited ramaphosa to meet biden and truss respectively in part to whisper some quiet advice in his ear about the need to be more critical of russia before putin does something truly catastrophic like detonating a nuclear weapon but the courting of the south african president may also reflect british and american concern that if they are too critical of him south africa may move even further from the west into russia s and also china s camp south africa is already a member with these two states of the brics bloc together with india and brazil when ramaphosa and biden met in the oval office each apparently urged the other to use his influence to seek a peaceful resolution to the ukraine conflict though ramaphosa is probably unlikely to be chided too sharply by the british government some observers believe that truss is known for her forthright views on foreign issues and could give ramaphosa a piece of her mind for his failure to condemn putin royal formalities on the formalities phillipson said king charles and the queen consort would host ramaphosa and his wife dr tshepo motsepe at buckingham palace during the state visit from tuesday 22 november to thursday 24 november the high commissioner noted that the king when he was still prince charles had first visited south africa in 1997 travelling to pretoria johannesburg durban and cape town from 31 october to 5 november charles and the queen consort had also visited pretoria and johannesburg from 2 to 6 november 2011 and attended the funeral of nelson mandela on 15 december 2013 queen elizabeth had invited three former south african presidents on state visits to the uk mandela in july 1996 thabo mbeki in june 2001 and jacob zuma in march 2010 buckingham palace also noted in its announcement of ramaphosa s state visit that charles had attended the state banquet in buckingham palace during mandela s state visit on 9 july 1996 during mbeki s state visit in 2001 charles hosted a lunch for mbeki with scottish business leaders at the palace of holyroodhouse in edinburgh charles and the queen consort welcomed zuma at the beginning of his state visit in 2010 dm

gas prices decreased during the past month due to weakening global economic sentiment and the threat of a recession on the other hand in europe two lines of the north stream 1 pipeline and one line of

quarter of 2022 however eia expects henry hub natural gas price to be about 6 mmbtu in 2023 as u s natural gas production increases thus i expect et to report strong 3q 2022 financial results also i

return on assets during h12022 the company improved its net profit margin the net profit margin sat at 5 1 in the second quarter of 2022 year over year compared with its amount of 4 14 at the same time in 2021 meanwhile it declined slightly versus its amount of 6 19 at the end of 1q2022 moreover across the board of return on assets the roa ratio in q2 2022 shows that 1 22 of the company s net earnings is related to its total assets energy transformâ s return on assets improved slightly during the previous quarter and sat at 1 22 in 2q2022 versus its level of 1 16 at the end of the first quarter of 2022 however the company has increased its roa by 57 bps year over year compared to its previous level of 0 65 at the same time last year we all know that oil and gas profit margins are so volatile due to the volatility of energy prices thus considering this reality energy transferâ s profitability ratios cater a good capture of its ability to generate income relative to its revenue and assets see figure 3 figure 3 etâ s profitability ratios author based on sa data furthermore we can analyze et s coverage ability across the board of its interest coverage and cash coverage ratios its icr in q2 2022 indicates that 4 7 times the company can pay its interest expenses on its debt with its operating income notwithstanding a decline in its interest coverage ratio of 4 71 in the second quarter versus the previous level of 4 82 in 1q2022 etâ s icr is more than twofold compared with the same time in 2021 meanwhile as a conservative metric to compare the company s cash balance to its annual interest expense et s cash coverage ratio in q2 2022 was 0 17 which was unchanged versus the first quarter of 2022 for both the operating cash flow and current liabilities were almost constant in sum there may not be concerns about energy transfer s ability to cover its obligations see figure 4 figure 4 etâ s coverage ratios author based on sa data energy transfer stock valuation i used competitive companies analysis cca to evaluate energy transfer stock i have updated my peer group compared et with other competitors and used the cca method to estimate the stock s fair value in my

average of 9 89x shortly et s financial ratios versus its competitors indicate that the company is attractive as a potential investment see table 2 table 2 et stock valuation author based on sa data summary due to the acquisition of the enable oklahoma intrastate transmission system combined with expanded ngl pipeline and export activities i expect et to report strong financial results in the second half of the year as it did in the first half etâ s market share of worldwide ngl exports has doubled over the last 24 months to approximately 20 and natural gas price in the european union is expected to remain high as long as the war in ukraine continues also crude oil and natural gas production in the permian basin is increasing my valuation shows that et is worth more than 20 per share

by michael s derby new york reuters federal reserve bank of new york president john williams said on monday that while there have been nascent signs of cooling inflation underlying price pressures remain too high which means the u s central bank must press forward to get inflation under control clearly inflation is far too high and persistently high inflation undermines the ability of our economy to perform at its full potential williams said in the text of a speech to be delivered before an audience in phoenix tighter monetary policy has begun to cool demand and reduce inflationary pressures but our job is not yet done williams who also serves as vice chairman of the fed s interest rate setting federal open market committee did not offer a view about what s next for monetary policy but he said the fed will continue to press forward with actions aimed at cooling demand in a bid to help lower inflation back to the fed s 2 target inflation was at 6 2 in august compared with the same month a year ago williams said lower economic growth and higher unemployment are very likely to be side effects of the fed s inflation fighting mission economic activity will likely be close to flat this year with only modest growth next year and the unemployment rate now at 3 7 will likely rise to 4 5 by the close of 2023 he said the fed has raised its overnight target rate range aggressively this year rising from near zero levels in march to the current range of between 3 and 3 25 officials have penciled in more rate rises over the course of this year and into next year which could lift the funds rate to around 4 6 by next year based on forecasts released by the fed at its policy meeting last month there s an active debate over the size of the rate rise at the fed s next gathering with many speculating the fed will again hike by 0 75 percentage point many market participants are questioning the need for rate rises however out of fears fed action will break something in financial markets and send the economy into recession others reckon the economy has already seen the worst of the inflation surge and that price pressures are set to ebb of their own accord in his remarks williams acknowledged that some inflation categories like commodity prices are already cooling off but that s not enough he said goods demand remains very high and labor market and services demand is outstripping available supply this is resulting in broad based inflation which will take longer to bring down he said williams said inflation could ease to 3 next year i see inflation moving close to our 2 goal in the next few years he said adding that the fed will do what it takes to lower inflation to help rein in demand to levels consistent with supply and therefore bring inflation down monetary policy needs to do its job williams said the fomc is taking strong actions toward that end reporting by michael s derby editing by leslie adler

from the merica dept i get that stock photos are a thing and that political campaigns or teams may be pressed for time but some things really shouldn t be so hard if you follow politics you may be aware that house republicans led by minority leader kevin mccarthy unveiled an agenda for 2023 politics it s calling commitment to america i ll leave any discussion of the agenda itself to sites that focus on politics i will note however that if this whole thing sounds familiar to you then you re old enough to remember newt gingrich s contract with america which is heralded as an important primer that led to the gop gaining 54 house and 9 senate seats in the 1994 elections mccarthy in other words is recycling an existing play in politics which is perhaps not terribly strange since the video house gop leaders put out to announce the commitment to america managed to use a bunch of stock footage to demonstrate its points and that stock footage it appears managed to depict any country it could other than america for instance the video begins talking about the american dream over a photo of an oil rig drilling oil however this video snippet an apparent nod to america s natural resources wasn t even filmed in america it s stock footage created by serg grbanoff a filmmaker based in russia grbanoff told huffpost that he filmed this scene in russia s volgograd region huffpo has the screenshots so you can go see for yourself but it s the same image only flipped mirrored with the goings on in the world the russia thing is kind of weird but it s not the only image from russia used in another scene with the words liberty and the pursuit of happiness at the bottom of the screen a young boy is seen smiling and playing with a model airplane that photo is also one of grbanoff s and again was shot in russia it seems that all of these are taken off of shutterstock for what it s worth and it s not only photos taken in russia that appear in the video another section of the video talks about how the other party has doomed us all with crime and inflation over a photo of a woman walking through a grocery store a slovakian store as it turns out but this is footage from a european grocery store if you look closely at the screenshot you can see a tag hanging on one of the store shelves that says akcia a slovak word meaning action informally akcia is used to designate sales in slovakian stores other images used appear to have come from ukraine as well which strikes this author as odd so what does this all mean nothing massively important obviously but it does strike me as more than a bit lazy to have this big rollout video showing what the house minority leadership thinks are good and bad things about america only to have the accompanying images show a bunch of countries that are decidedly not america when asked for comment mccarthy s spokeman was very mccarthy about it all interesting how you guys aren t remotely interested on the issues facing the american people in the video responded mccarthy spokesman mark bednar a little tone deaf considering much of what was shown in the video had nothing to do with the american people but i digress just do a bit more vetting on this sort of thing folks at the very least it will prevent people like me from poking some fun at you filed under gop russia stock footage
listen to the story listen 4 54 new supreme court justice ketanji brown jackson was a lively participant monday as the supreme court heard arguments in a major case pitting environmental regulators against property rights advocates backed by industries with a history of pollution at issue were the 1977 amendments to the clean water act which congress passed to strengthen the ability of the epa to protect the waters of the united states including wetlands adjacent to other waters the case presents an opportunity for the conservative court to dramatically narrow the reach of the law on one side are conservative groups business groups and oil gas coal and other industries often associated with pollution and on the other side are environmental groups and government regulators the case was brought by a couple who bought a plot of land near priest lake in idaho planning to build a house but the epa told them that they would have to apply for a permit because the construction could harm neighboring wetlands which act as a filtering mechanism for priest lake much of monday s argument focused on what it means to be an adjacent wetland covered by the clean water act the property owners basically say the various wetlands that serve to prevent pollution do not abut their property while the argument was not decisive indications are that five of the six conservatives were likely to side with the property owners though justice brett kavanaugh pointed out that the existing regulations have been applied by seven consecutive administrations both democratic and republican justice neil gorsuch representing the apparent views of some of his fellow conservatives took special issue with what he viewed as potential vagueness in the statute and appeared concerned that property owners could unknowingly violate the law how does any reasonable person know whether or not their land is adjacent to he asked i imagine that most of the water flow in quite a large geographic area drains into the lake eventually justice jackson emphasized in her early questions that the clean water act s legislative purpose should be used to understand how it should be interpreted my question is why would congress draw the coverage line between abutting wetlands and neighboring wetlands when the objective of the statute is to ensure the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nation s waters jackson asked are you saying that neighboring wetlands can t impact the quality of navigable waters justice elena kagan in turn stressed the significance of the words congress used when writing the statute if you look to dictionaries both legal and non legal what they show is that adjacency actually is not the same as touching or contiguity she said adjacency has something to do with proximity of course but the definitions are actually remarkably explicit about the fact that two things can be adjacent to each other without touching each other the court s other actions in other actions the court issued a bunch of orders dealing with many of the cases that piled up over the summer when the court was in recess among the cases the court declined to hear was an appeal brought by mike lindell the mypillow ceo who is a close trump ally he will now have to face a 1 3 billion lawsuit brought by dominion voting systems the company is accusing him of promoting false claims that its machines rigged the election in another action the court turned away challenges to a federal ban on devices known as bump stocks that enable semi automatic weapons to fire like a machine gun the court did however announce nine new cases they will hear this term including a big social media case that could determine whether social media companies can be held financially responsible for content they host the family of a woman killed in paris in a terrorist attack brought a challenge to the broad immunity that social media and internet companies have for material posted online the case involves the algorithms that youtube owned by google has created to recommend content to its users in this case youtube relying on its algorithm referred some users to jihadi videos created by isis the woman s family claimed youtube violated u s anti terrorism laws by employing an algorithm that spread isis created content but youtube like all the other internet content purveyors is protected from lawsuits under a different law the communications decency act passed in 1996 before today s social media explosion the act says that content hosts like youtube can t be sued as the publisher or speaker for any information provided by other users copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

by aziz el yaakoubi riyadh reuters global recession can be avoided if governments fiscal policies were consistent with monetary policy tightening but likely there would be countries falling into recession next year the international monetary fund s managing director said on monday in the context of monetary policy tightening fiscal policy cannot stay idle because the cost of living crisis is hitting parts of society dramatically kristalina georgieva said we do need central banks to act decisively why because inflation is very stubborn it is bad for growth and it is very bad for poor people inflation is a tax on the poor georgieva told reuters in an interview during a visit to saudi arabia she added fiscal policies that indiscriminately support everybody by suppressing energy prices and providing subsidies are working against monetary policies purposes so you have monetary policy putting a foot on the brakes and fiscal policy putting a foot on the accelerator she said after taking part in a conference on food security in the saudi capital riyadh governments across the globe have stepped in to support their populations amid high food inflation and shortages by following the u s federal reserve s interest rate hikes sending shockwaves through financial markets and the economy earlier monday a united nations agency warned of the serious consequences of a monetary policy induced global recession for developing countries it called for a new strategy including corporate windfall taxes supply side efforts and regulation on commodity speculation georgieva called on the fed to be extremely prudent in its policies and be mindful of the spillover impact on the rest of the world adding its responsibility is very high agreements with tunisia egypt the imf sees labor markets in the united states are still quite tight demand is still quite significant for goods and services and the fed has to continue on the course of tightening in that environment she said we are likely to see unemployment going up and that will be the time for the fed has to say we have done our job we can ease in the future we are not there yet the imf on friday approved a new food shock borrowing window under its existing emergency financing instruments to help vulnerable countries cope with food shortages and high costs stemming from inflation exacerbated by russia s war in ukraine georgieva said somewhere between 10 and 20 countries most of them in africa are likely to ask for access in the window and are eligible to receive funding she highlighted the imf s mission in malawi saying the country may enter into a full imf loan agreement after receiving emergency financing the fund is also in advanced discussions with egypt and tunisia georgieva added as both governments are struggling under economic crises that have strained public finances i can confirm that with both countries we are in a very advanced stage of discussing staff level agreements whether it would be within days or weeks hard to predict but it will be very soon she said we re looking at sizable programs the exact size is always determined through negotiations and finalised with the authorities reporting by aziz el yaakoubi editing by aurora ellis

a decrease in the fund s net assets a decrease in the fund s net assets may cause an increase in the fund s annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the fund s market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the fund s net asset value per share the distribution policy may also negatively affect the fund s investment activities to the extent that the fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold for the purpose of paying the distribution each fund s board has the right to amend suspend or terminate the distribution policy at any time the amendment suspension or termination of the distribution policy may affect the fund s market price per

rio de janeiro brazil s jair bolsonaro and his leftist rival luiz inacio lula da silva on monday buckled up for four more weeks of intense election campaigning after the president s unexpectedly strong showing in the first round set up a tight oct 30 runoff vote lula a two term former president who was jailed on corruption convictions that were later overturned won the most votes in sunday s presidential election and for many analysts is still the favorite to win the race later this month but bolsonaro s better than expected performance revitalized his campaign giving credence to his claim that the pollsters were wrong to write him off in brazil s most fraught election since the end of military rule in 1985 the far right leader s strong showing also prolonged questions about whether brazil s democratic institutions will withstand his unfounded allegations that the country s voting system cannot be trusted walking her dog in rio de janeiro s lagoa neighborhood marcia oliviera 69 was outraged at how surveys misread bolsonaro s support advertisement the polling companies have zero credibility she said calling lula a crook a thief a snake charmer i find it unbelievable that people could vote for him most polling firms had given lula a 10 15 point lead ahead of sunday s vote raising the possibility of a first round victory for the leftist but with 99 99 of electronic votes counted lula had taken 48 4 of votes versus 43 2 for bolsonaro meaning that neither secured the over 50 needed to avoid a runoff the remaining votes went to nine other candidates who are now eliminated from the race with less than a month to go until the next vote both candidates will be looking for creative ways to eke out a win on monday bolsonaro s government announced it had pushed forward a welfare payment due at the end of october the one off change means all recipients will now receive two payments this month with the second coming five days before the runoff vote bolsonarismo hangs on the president s strong showing extended to his colleagues in congress ensuring his conservative movement will endure in the longer term bolsonaro s right wing liberal party pl won 99 seats in the 513 member lower house up from 77 and right leaning parties allied with bolsonaro now control half the chamber pl candidates won 13 of the 27 seats up for grabs in the senate with two more possible in runoffs a party spokesman said the result thrilled brazilian markets on expectations that it may force lula to move to the center and limit his room for dramatic policy changes even if he does finally triumph advertisement brazil s real brl brby strengthened roughly 4 5 against the dollar in afternoon trading while the ibovespa stock index bvsp rose 4 7 state run companies led the gains on brazil s main stock index with shares in sao paulo state sanitation company sabesp sbsp3 sa jumping about 16 5 on expectations that a bolsonaro ally would become governor and privatize the firm state run oil company petrobras petr4 sa and public lender banco do brasil bbas3 sa both rose by about 8 investors are betting that a potential second bolsonaro term could see a wave of privatizations support for distant third and fourth place finishers also fell short of recent surveys suggesting some of their backers may have shifted to bolsonaro when it came time to vote attention will now turn to whom centrist senator simone tebet and center left former lawmaker ciro gomes will send their votes tebet won 4 of votes while gomes secured 3 both said on sunday night they would announce decisions about endorsements in the coming days after his unexpected surge many analysts said the electoral momentum was now with bolsonaro if he does pull off a dramatic comeback it would break with a wave of victories for leftists across the region in recent years including mexico colombia argentina and chile robert wood lead economist for latin america at the economist intelligence unit said he expected lula to win eventually but with a much narrower margin than the polls currently indicate still tensions may remain high until the inauguration ceremony in january he added on sunday night bolsonaro adopted a more level tone than usual expressing confidence that victory was within reach and avoiding his usual unfounded attacks on brazil s voting system in the run up to the vote he had made repeated baseless allegations about the integrity of the electronic voting system and had suggested he may not concede if he loses advertisement i plan to make the right political alliances to win this election he told journalists pointing to the significant advances his party made in congress lula put an optimistic spin on the result saying he was looking forward to another month on the campaign trail and the chance to debate bolsonaro head to head inside his campaign however there was clear frustration that he had fallen short of the hoped for outright win as
