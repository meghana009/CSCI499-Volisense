singapore registered company behind the terra protocol doesn t have a permanent office the singapore address it provides is a registration agent home to hundreds of singaporean companies its offices

terraform labs and do kwon asserted that american regulators don t have jurisdiction over kwon a korean residing in singapore they have no ties to the u s so how can they be targeted by regulators they argued but they might find themselves dealing with singapore s justice system and while the country has a favorable securities framework compared to the u s its courts are known to be otherwise strict should the singaporean government feel like the nation s reputation is at stake because of a registered company with few material ties that blew up tens of billions of dollars it will come after them hard and may start the process of closing the door entirely on crypto firms that use a singaporean shell but do business abroad if that happens will terraform and kwon also claim the no

for nova and we are excited to be recommencing drilling to further unlock the estelle gold trend with the view to adding additional tonnage to the already large resource particularly in the higher indicated category from both the rpm and korbel main deposits for inclusion in the very important upcoming phase 2 scoping study the phase 1 scoping study announced in february while showing that korbel main was a viable project in its own right was constrained by the amount of indicated resources available from a single ore source however as the sensitivity analysis demonstrated a small increase in the resource grade will substantially increase both the npv and irr of the project we anticipate the inclusion of the high grade rpm feed ore through the proposed korbel central processing plant with minimal additional capital expenditure required as the current proposed plant has the flexibility to receive feed from ore sorter grade control and multiple ore sources will result in significantly higher economic metrics being proved for the project in the phase 2 scoping study due later this year like i have said in the past not all that many opportunities come around to drill systems this large and of such high grade as we have at the estelle gold trend with an established 9 6 moz total gold resource on a small area with both deposits remaining wide open and many other prospects yet to be explored as we continue to unlock the wider district our exploration efforts to date have produced results at an extremely low cost per discovered ounce and we intend to maintain this run rate with additional drill rigs and the on site prep lab allowing economies of scale with the team s experience commitment vision and passion we look forward to keeping the market updated as we advance the company through this truly exciting and transformational period as we continue to progress on our plans of unlocking a large gold trend containing multiple bulk tonnage gold deposits with the ultimate goal of becoming a world class tier one global gold producer the absolute focus of the company and the drill plans this year is on converting more of the korbel main inferred resource into the higher indicated category and expanding and converting the highgrade rpm 1 5 moz 2g t resource into indicated to feed into the company s phase 2 scoping study scheduled for delivery later this year the proposed lower priority extensional drill holes are provisional and subject to change as assay results are returned drill rigs may also be moved around from the plan based on assay results as they come in and if justified further drill rigs may be added nova has grown its delineated world class global gold resource inventory very quickly at the estelle gold trend development

and so we come to commencement that glorious moment of achievement when a high school or college graduate will be awarded a hard earned diploma and venture into a complex world full of promise and fright uh huh except for over 40 million young americans who are saddled with a collective debt of well over 1 5 trillion and who are being blamed by conservatives like roy exum for having made hasty immature decisions to rack up so much debt in the first place now i have never read or heard mr exum s personal stance on this issue and i don t want to be presumptuous in that regard but i have yet to see any conservative who did not take a hardline stance against student debt forgiveness but consider young people fresh out of high school are among the most financially naïve people in our society yet predatory loan sharks both in our government and the private sector made available to them loans of limitless amounts regardless of their ability to pay them back in a timely fashion but those predatory agencies are not being held accountable in any way they acted and still are acting very much like the crooked banksters who intentionally loaned out money to credit unworthy people during the housing bubble which led directly to the crash of the stock market and the recession of 08 and who got bailed out even though their actions were deliberate and self serving those banskters and wall street shysters not only did they get bailed out they handed out fat bonuses to their ceos and who came to the rescue of the 5 million homeowners who were upside down on their mortgages or who lost their homes altogether nobody obama said he would but he failed to deliver as he only verbally slapped the wrists of those who were doling out bonuses with tax payer money and consider this i am 72 when i went to college a state university i was able to afford it by working a full time job in the summer and a part time job of no more than 15 hours per week during the school year i paid for everything tuition books lodging and meals and came out with zero debt plus pell grants were rather easy to come by even into the early 1990s that is as it should be but college tuition over the years has risen exponentially to such a degree that the students from low income families cannot afford it even by working in addition to going to school and pell grants have become extremely rare and not nearly adequate to cover the overall costs and while college costs have risen the pay rate for low income workers has been stagnant for decades lagging far behind ever increasing inflation and finally consider this that 1 5 trillion dollars of debt is keeping over 40 million young people from contributing anything meaningful to our society and our economy as they are unable to buy a home start a business or do anything but play the role of an indentured servant they are having to devote the vast majority of their time to paying off a debt so large that many of them will be a lifetime paying it off that debt is not just a drain on them it is a drain on our entire economy notice that conservatives don t bat an eyelash when it comes to our government doling out relief money or bailout money or huge annual subsidies to corporate monopolies and billionaires but when it comes to government doing anything whatsoever for the benefit of the people who desperately need some assistance they scream like a stuck pig and yell socialism or communism go figure but such is the nature of an oligarchy in which the rich make the rules for their own benefit and have the audacity to say that anyone who does not aspire to their level of greed is a loser and a slacker rick armstrong so conservatives never help lower and middle income families obtain an advanced degree well rick have you ever heard of the tennessee promise program maybe this will help what is tennessee promise tennessee promise is a scholarship mentoring and community service program that began fall semester 2015 it provides students a last dollar scholarship meaning the tennessee promise will cover tuition and fees not covered by the pell grant the hope scholarship or tsaa funds the promise was passed in 2015 by an overwhelmingly republican legislature and signed by a republican governor i would point out that this is a last dollar scholarship which basically pays for everything there is no reason any student in tennessee cannot obtain at least an associates degree and find a well paying job and many scholarships are available for these grads if they want to obtain a ba or bs the government and their academic supporters have a great scam going you actually mentioned it when you stated college costs have risen exponentially in your letter academia increase costs especially salary and the government guarantees loans to these unsuspecting high school grads who then borrow 100 000 to get a degree in some worthless liberal arts program then they are shocked when they graduate and either can t find a job or get one paying half of what the students who used the promise program to learn how to do something make with no student debt harvard paid elizabeth warren 400 000 over a two year period to teach one class a semester this is a woman who has never had a real job in her life leaching off of academia and government i will have to say i agree with you 100 percent about both parties letting the wall street banks get off after the financial crisis banks are just legalized mafia doug jones ooltewah student loan debt and student loan crisis has been in the news for several years and has been very much a topic of conversation during the biden administration i agree with the financial analysis of mr armstrong and am glad mr jones shot holes in his cheap shot at republicans given the vast amount of publicity and discussion surrounding the student loans i expect that the student loan industry should all but die off going forward with all the newly informed young people that qualify to attend an institution of higher learning surely with all the publicity these high level high achieving students will read and comprehend the loan agreement if they are still considering using a loan for attending a university and perform a basic financial risk reward analysis put simply if your job prospects don t pay enough to repay the loan in addition to everything else you would like spend your future earnings on don t take the loan if you do accept the loan then you are obligated to repay it according to the terms of the agreement the stupid tax is a real thing michael craig some of the institutions peddling student loans are certainly predatory let us not pretend that most high school students are in a position to fully understand the sort of obligation that they are being pushed and or cajoled into when they sign that dotted line this is done by people with a financial interest in sealing the deal but no accountability for the end result they have a conflict of interest add the fact that many of these young people are living close to the edge financially and they have loan officers and sometimes financial advisors telling them it is perfectly acceptable to borrow more money than they need for tuition and books this is common practice in recent years some lenders have settled multi billion dollar lawsuits regarding unfair practices one in particular made loans to people very likely to default because they knew the government would pay if the borrowers didn t they also made loans for students to attend institutions they knew to be inflating graduation rates and job placement rates this is a complex issue i don t profess to have a perfect solution but if we allow education to be dependent upon means we aren t going to like the results likewise if we do not protect students from being the latest crop for wall street to consume we all lose student loans should not have been a replacement for pell grants and other need based financial aid but that has become the situation at the very least there should be robust oversight and fair terms for these loans no person should pay on a loan for years only to find that they owe more than the original loan amount college has become another way for banks and other financial institutions to take advantage we should all have an interest in making education attainable for those who desire it and work toward it if individuals should be held accountable for their financial obligations that should mean all individuals not just those with student loan debt and not just average joes this should extend to banks and other financial institutions automakers oil companies tobacco companies and all others deemed too big to fail corporate welfare comes from taxpayer money and i would venture to say that it costs us a whole lot more than people defaulting on student loans where was the call for accountability when corporate america fleeced the covid relief funds and used the money for feathering their nests to the detriment of average americans where is it now when they continue to artificially inflate prices while people live without necessities spare me the righteous indignation it rings very hollow darlene kilgore take money from hard working responsible taxpayers and give it to people who make poor choices may make sense to liberals but not to me steve campbell

gift this article anyone can read no subscription required susan pollack a property manager who was shopping one afternoon last week at a costco in marina del rey calif said she was startled that the price of a bulk pack of toilet paper had surged from 17 to 25 at her local kosher butcher shop the prices were rising even higher more than 200 for a 5 pack of short ribs i told my husband we re never having short ribs again she said global forces such as supply chain disruptions severe weather energy costs and russia s invasion of ukraine have contributed to rising inflation rates that have spooked stock market investors and put president biden s administration on the defensive but the pressure is felt most directly by shoppers doing their weekly runs to grocery stores where some items that used to be plentiful have been missing for months and where prices for produce meat and eggs remain stubbornly high at a stop and shop in elizabeth n j hagar dale a 35 year old instacart shopper pointed out that a single packet of powdered drink mix that once sold for 25 cents shot up to 36 cents in early may two days later it was selling for 56 cents she said lord forbid if you have a big shop to do dale said as she left the grocery store with a customer s order you re penny pinching such price hikes have led to sticker shock resignation and a determination to sniff out bargains you look for more deals said ray duffy a 66 year old retired banker in an unapologetically american t shirt who was coming out of a lidl grocery store in garwood n j recently you go shopping he said it s something you do store hopping and bribing with banana bread there are plenty of supermarkets in south riding va where susana yoo lives but she drives nine miles to centreville to shop at h mart a korean grocery store where fresh vegetables like large bunches of green onions cost slightly less from there she will go to trader joe s which has pretty good prices for meat then it s off to costco for nonperishable bulk items that can be stored to save a little money i have to go to three different places yoo said alyssa sutton a 53 year old home theater business owner left king s food market in short hills n j a grocery chain where a 13 ounce jar of bonne maman preserves was selling for 6 49 this inflation thing is a real problem she said when you re paying twice as much to fill your gas tank and twice as much for everything you ve got to say to yourself well do i really need to buy everything at king s sutton said she grabs staples at king s then drives to cheaper markets like trader joe s where she says fruit and vegetables are more affordable it takes time she said it takes planning lisa tucker 54 of gainesville va drives a few extra miles to giant because the food prices are lower than they are at stores closer to her house she buys in bulk when the prices are favorable on a recent run she bought eight boxes of cereal because they were selling for 1 77 each and has enrolled in multiple loyalty rewards programs it s strategic she said tucker also looks for meat that is nearly expired and therefore steeply discounted on tuesday tucker snapped up a soon to expire one pound package of beef for 3 74 marked down from 7 49 to get a heads up from meat department staffers about such deals she said she will sometimes bring them homemade banana bread tucker tells them if a discount sticker is about to be slapped on some boar s head bacon let me know eating less meat and planning menus on the fly angie goodman a housekeeper from culver city calif usually eats meat once a week but now that steaks have doubled in price she said she might have to cut back to once a month goodman 54 said she makes about 15 an hour a figure that has remained stagnant as the cost of living has skyrocketed basic things are very expensive she said it s crazy isabel chambergo 62 a warehouse worker in elizabeth n j said that meals she once planned at home are now mapped out while she is shopping so she can use her phone to scan items for digital coupons that saves 10 to 15 per shopping trip she said that s how i manage chambergo said as she left a stop and shop in elizabeth with her husband arturo 62 it helps a little she said it s not a lot but i m trying to buy healthy things that also fill us up that is if she can even find the ingredients she needs chambergo said she used to buy a quinoa and rice mix at stop and shop that she used to make hearty soups but it has not been on the shelves for at least two months duffy the retired banker said he has had a hard time finding square shaped spaghetti his go to for his favorite lo mein the sauce sticks better to square shaped spaghetti he said it is normal for grocery stores to have 7 percent to 10 percent of items out of stock but the events of the last two and half years pandemic outbreaks extreme weather russia s invasion of ukraine have caused that number to trend 3 to 5 points higher said katie denis a spokeswoman for the consumer brands association the availability of pasta and grains has been especially constricted by the war with both ukraine and russia effectively exiting the market she said in an email weather in europe last year also constricted the durum wheat which specifically affected pasta denis said i didn t buy anything fun today shoppers are also denying themselves at the giant in gainesville va kimberly heneault said she paused in front of a display of coffee creamers and saw they were double the usual price oh you know what i don t really need that she said to herself and moved on pollack the property manager in california said that while inflation is not straining her budget the prices have made her reconsider purchases that were once impulsive for example she almost bought an electric shaver for her son but then she saw it cost 90 i go through so much money all the time pollack 61 said and it s like wow i didn t buy anything fun today al elnaggar 22 and hamza mojadidi 23 students at the university of california los angeles were also shopping at the costco in marina del rey where they had bought several items in bulk including clementines cartons of water and ramen noodles mojadidi said they have stopped buying eggs and cut back on halal meat which was already more expensive than other cuts because the animals are slaughtered in accordance with the muslim religion mojadidi said they stopped in front of the meat market at costco eyed the lamb shanks and walked away he said he considers himself luckier than other students at the university at least he said he has a car and can drive to costco to buy food in bulk and save some money i m just taking extra loans to pay for my expenses mojadidi said i m maxing out on my credit cards

on vacation for the rest of the month going to portugal commentary will resume on june 1 good luck to us all the market is a fickle mistress the major central banks were judged to be behind the inflation curve much teeth gashing finger pointing federal reserve chair powell was blamed for denying that a 75 bp hike was under consideration bank of japan governor kuroda was blamed for keeping the 0 25 cap on the 10 year japanese government bond yield even though european central bank president lagarde had indicated previously that rates could be increased within weeks of the end of the bond purchases many observers embraced it as a new sign that the ecb was belated to hike rates as early as july for the better part of three weeks the swaps market has been pricing in a 20 bp rate hike it peaked not when lagarde spoke last week but on april 22 the us 10 year breakeven rate the difference between the yield of the inflation protected security and the conventional note yield rose from 2 60 at the end of last year to a high a little bit above 3 05 on april 22 since then it has been trending erratically lower and bottomed near 2 63 before the cpi report it finished last week around 2 74 falling about 12 bp on the week the three week decline is the longest since january many observers write and speak as if the fed needs to catch up to the market but this seems like a variant of the hubris virus that they often diagnose the central bank with the relationship is much more complicated consider that a week ago the swaps market was pricing in a terminal fed funds rate of 3 75 after elevated cpi and ppi prints the terminal rate is now ironically projected close to 3 0 or consider that shortly after the fed s statement and before powell s press conference the december fed funds futures contract implied a 2 89 yield it finished last week near 2 63 there is an industry built on criticizing the federal reserve the fed is damned if they do and damned if they don t it is an easy mark when it raised by 25 bp in march it was criticized for not being more aggressive when the fed raised rates by 50 bp earlier this month it was blamed for taking 75 bp off the table often the same voices criticize the fed for risking a recession many accept that the economic contraction in q1 was the result of gdp math importing too many goods relative to exports and accumulating inventories at a slower pace than the record set in q4 were critical drags consumption and business investment rose that is ultimately what drives the economy nevertheless some pundits play up the risk that the us is on the verge of a recession we have expressed concerns about tightening monetary and fiscal policy as the economy slows we brought attention to the doubling of oil prices which has preceded the last three us recessions the inventory cycle looks mature and is unlikely to be the tailwind going forward the build up of savings and pent up consumer demand appear to have run their course however the doom and gloom camp is over hyping the case monetary policy is known for its variable lags the federal deficit may be halved this year but that still leaves it above 5 of gdp the us job growth remains impressive through last month non farm payrolls have risen by over 2 mln this year it is not far off the pace in the same period last year 2 2 mln weekly initial jobless claims are hovering around 200k roughly half the pace of may 2021 yes the improvement in the labor market will slow and it will have to slow much more than it has to support a recession scenario after the contraction in q1 like those who see a currency war every year or so the doom and gloom camp or the always critical of the fed crowd are crying wolf and therein lies the importance of the economic data in the days ahead there may be no reason to let the facts interfere with a good story but the economic data may show a solid gain in consumption and continued growth in industrial output or to say the same thing the data should show an expanding not contracting economy april retail sales are expected to rise by a solid 1 by the median forecast in bloomberg s survey after a revised 0 7 from 0 5 gain in march we already know that auto sales were stronger which likely lifted the headline figure some economic models use components for gdp calculations which exclude autos gasoline building materials and food services the models pick up the information from different time series are expected to rise by 0 6 after a revised 0 7 gain from 0 1 in march industrial output rose by nearly 3 in q1 and that pace will not be sustained last year industrial output rose by 0 3 a month in april output may have increased by 0 4 among the first places to look at financial conditions biting are the interest rate sensitive sectors like housing april housing starts will be reported on may 18 a decline is indeed expected after two months of gains but the takeaway is that the level of activity is elevated march housing starts were the highest in 16 years the same is true of permits another place to look for financial conditions biting is in the translation of foreign earnings into dollars for us companies figures cited in barron s from sentieo a financial analytics company noted that 20 us companies with market caps of more than 100 bln cited the dollar s appreciation as a headwind which is twice from a year ago what was left unsaid was that there are around 100 such companies meaning something on the magnitude of 80 of the giants did not complain about the dollar s appreciation in addition to translation there is an issue of competitiveness too according to the oced s model of purchasing power parity the euro sterling and yen have not been this undervalued in at least 30 years it may not be a short run consideration but it can impact the relative competitiveness and exposure of even purely domestic us companies to a foreign competition that may not have been there a couple of years ago in addition to the divergence of monetary policy part of the current political and economic environment is that america s two rivals russia and china are shooting themselves in the foot america s penchant for exaggerating the strength of russian strength has again proved wide of the mark moscow s ability to project its power will be curtailed nato will be bigger than before more members and a greater presence and russia s economy has been traumatized despite the capital controls induced rouble appreciation china s covid response seems over the top and is hobbling the economy despite the best efforts of the chinese government the world has gotten a glimpse of the gap between the chinese people and the rulers in beijing for years chinese officials have raised questions about the us model but the chickens have come home to roost and china s developmental model is being questioned in new ways the sharp drop in chinese lending in april is a warning of a dismal economic performance as the lockdowns and social restrictions crippled around half of its economy the silver lining is that shanghai may appear from the lockdowns shortly and a v type recovery is possible if covid can be brought under control there is scope for china to cut its benchmark 1 year medium term lending facility mlf rate which has remained at 2 85 since being cut by 10 bp in january a reduction in the mlf at the start of the new week would boost the chances of a cut in the loan prime rate at the end of the week japan has two data points that will be of interest first it will report q1 gdp it is expected to have contracted by 0 4 0 5 the covid restrictions and earthquake weakened the economy after growing by 1 1 in q4 22 the government has responded with a spending package and in any event the economy already appears to be recovering second japan will report the national cpi figures for april at the end of the week the market got a hint of what to expect from the surge in the tokyo cpi in addition to rising food and energy prices the dropping of last year s cuts in cell phone charges will lift measured inflation excluding fresh food and energy japan s cpi rose above zero in april for the first time since july 2020 the market does not pay much attention to japan s trade figures that seems to be the most straightforward explanation why so many observers insist on characterizing japan as export oriented japan will report its april trade figures early on may 19 in tokyo a sharp deterioration is expected jpy1 2 trillion deficit from a jpy414 bln shortfall in march it will be the ninth consecutive monthly trade deficit in april 2021 it recorded a nearly jpy227 bln trade surplus the uk reports employment figures april cpi and retail sales employment growth is expected to slow and average earnings growth will likely be little changed economists anticipate the unemployment rate to remain in the trough near 3 8 which is also where it was at the end of 2019 still it is understood to be a lagging indicator uk retail sales likely fell for the third consecutive month when gasoline is excluded with two exceptions it has been falling since last may as the cost of living squeeze intensifies meanwhile cpi will surge a 54 rise in the household energy cap was announced in february effective in april that alone will lift the month over month rate by more than 1 5 the bank of england forecast the year over year rate to rise to 9 1 from 7 0 in march lastly we note that uk prime minister johnson is expected to address northern ireland s protocol in a speech in the coming week tensions have been rising and the recent election defeat for the democratic unionist party allows it to play the obstructionist role it refuses to join the government unless the protocol that was a result of extended negotiations is jettisoned turning to the price action dollar index the dollar index rose for the sixth consecutive week and pushed to almost 105 00 for the first time since late 2002 the main driver is the aggressiveness of the federal reserve and secondarily the poor news stream from europe russia and china the momentum indicators are stretched but do not appear poised to turn lower the 104 00 area may provide support as it capped the upside for a little bit there is little on the charts until closer to 106 00 euro the single currency continues to struggle to sustain even minor upticks it has fallen for the past four sessions and made a new five year low near 1 0350 ahead of the weekend a break of the 2017 low 1 0340 leaves very little to deter a test on parity given the elevated volatility three month 9 5 a move to 1 0 is not so much a tail risk the 1 05 area now may offer the nearby cap a convincing move above 1 06 would suggest a bottom of some import could be in place japanese yen the exchange rate and us yields continue to move nearly in lockstep the direction seems more important than the level on a day to day basis in the first four sessions last week the 10 year us yield fell nearly 30 bp and the dollar fell from around jpy130 50 to about jpy128 30 the yield rose ahead of the weekend and the dollar traded a full yen off the lows the momentum indicators have pulled back as one would expect with a nearly 3 pullback in spot we often find the dollar yen pair to be rangebound and when it does trend it frequently is moving to a new trend we suspect that the jpy127 00 area marks the lower end of the range british pound sterling fell for the fourth consecutive week and it is poised to fall further the 1 20 area is the next important target there have been 23 sessions since april 13 and sterling has fallen in all but four sessions and none of them was last week in fact sterling takes a seven day slump into next week s activity it fell to almost 1 2155 before the weekend its lowest level since may 2020 the momentum indicators are stretched but show little inclination of turning initial resistance is likely around 1 2250 but probably takes a move above 1 24 to be of technical significance canadian dollar the close movement of the yen and us 10 year yield has a parallel with the canadian dollar and the s p 500 for the past 30 and 60 sessions the correlation of the changes is tighter with the canadian dollar and the s p 500 than between the yen and us yields the us dollar reached almost cad1 3080 on may 12 its highest level since late 2020 the recovery in us equities ahead of the weekend sent the greenback to almost cad1 2900 a break of the cad1 2850 area is needed to boost the chances that a high is in place the macd appears poised to turn down from extreme levels the slow stochastic has fluctuated a bit but is essentially flat this month despite the rise in spot macroeconomic fundamentals look to be among the best in the g7 australian dollar since the central bank induced bounce in the australian dollar may 4 it has tumbled about 6 to the may 12 low of around 0 6830 nearly half of that decline was recorded on may 11 and 12 yet the bounce ahead of the weekend was not particularly impressive it was unable to rise above the previous day s high 0 6955 and the close was still the second lowest since mid 2020 the aussie fell by 2 3 last week and it was the sixth weekly decline in the past seven it lost around 8 this run the momentum indicators are stretched the macd could turn higher in the coming days but the slow stochastic is still trending lower in oversold territory the next important target on the downside is around 0 6760 the halfway point of the aussie s rally from the pandemic low near 0 5500 in march 2020 to slightly above 0 8000 a year later mexican peso the peso s resilience is impressive even if under appreciated while the us dollar has been appreciating multiyear highs against the other major currencies the peso has held its own the peso has appreciated by a little less than 2 this year leaving aside the russian rouble only two other emerging market currencies are up for the year the brazilian real has appreciated by 9 6 and the peruvian sol has gained nearly 6 the swaps market is pricing in 135 bp rate increases in the next three months when there are three meetings which is about what the fed funds futures have priced in for the federal reserve the momentum indicators have flatlined near mid range support is seen near mxn20 00 which held earlier this month initial resistance may be around mxn20 25 mxn20 30 it takes a four day rally into the week ahead chinese yuan there is nothing special about the chinese yuan in some ways it is falling like nearly all the currencies the yuan has depreciated by about 6 4 so far this year the bulk of the move has taken place in the last four weeks the greenback rose from around cny6 37 to reach a high a little more than cny6 81 before the weekend we suspect the dollar would be higher but the pboc seems to be moderating its rise by setting the dollar s reference rate lower than the market projects consistently since returning from the labor holidays earlier this month we suspect the yuan may begin stabilizing and do not expect it to rise above cny6 85 initially support may be in the cny6 72 cny6 74 area

stock market in south korea yonhap south korea s main stock market saw its trading volume shrink more than 16 percent this month from a year earlier data showed monday as investors remained on the sidelines amid inflation worries and other negatives the daily trading volume of the country s main bourse averaged 940 million shares during 10 sessions between may 2 and friday down 16 4 percent from a year ago according to the data from the korea exchange in particular the average daily trading volume of the top 10 caps excluding major battery maker lg energy solution tumbled nearly 40 percent over the cited period pharmaceutical giant samsung biologics posted the biggest on year drop of 87 3 percent trailed by steel titan posco holdings with 63 5 percent and leading automaker hyundai motor with 45 percent analysts attributed the drop in trading volume to monetary tightening in major economies and concerns over us inflation and a downturn of the world s largest economy which spooked investors and left them on wait and see mode trading volume of a stock market tends to decline on a bullish market and vice versa amid growing market volatility the benchmark korea composite stock price index kospi plunged to a 1 1 2 year low of 2 550 08 on thursday before bouncing back a day later us consumer inflation soared 8 3 percent in april from a year earlier well above a market forecast of 8 1 percent stoking worries over america s economic downturn making matters worse seesawing cryptocurrencies in major bourses across the global have further disheartened stock investors here market watchers said they voiced concern a rebound in south korea s key stock index may not be on the horizon for the time being as us inflation is unlikely to level off in a short period of time given the fed s tight policy the war in ukraine and china s coronavirus lockdowns of major cities yonhap
global stocks ended the week with a strong rally the s p 500 closed up more than 2 while the tech heavy nasdaq composite index was up nearly 4 however this was not enough to reverse the steep sell off from earlier in the week and the s p 500 still logged its sixth straight weekly decline the first time it has done so since 2011 after a few false moves stocks were finally able to break out of their cycle of declines possibly on the back of some good news about the potential end to china s strict covid lockdowns and general oversold conditions attracting bargain hunters there are also some early bullish signs that could help markets to recover as we move to the second half of may peak inflation hopes along with resilient corporate profit margins and 85 of companies beating their eps expectations for q1 expectations of more china policy support and a push back by a number of fed officials on the prospect of a 75bp rate hike have all helped to lift the market mood however there are still risks to be aware of including stagflation fears a global shift to more hawkish monetary policy and forced selling in equity markets on the back of steep declines could all hinder a potential rally in risky assets this week as mentioned above there are stumbling blocks to a prolonged recovery in market assets thus whether or not a recovery can be sustained could depend on two key fundamental releases this week 1 uk cpi data april s uk cpi data is expected to be mega when it is released on wednesday analysts are expecting a rise in the monthly headline rate of 2 6 which would push the annual rate of headline inflation up to 9 1 a huge jump from the 7 recorded in march if expectations are correct this would be the highest annual rate of inflation recorded since the index began in 1989 the reason for this is the 54 rise in the energy price cap which has sent energy prices soaring this jump in headline inflation is expected and the bank of england now expects prices in the uk to peak above 10 this autumn when the energy price cap is lifted once again thus a market mechanism that was designed to be consumer friendly is actually the main reason why uk inflation rates are higher than elsewhere and why they will take longer to decline the boe is right to be worried about growth as persistently high inflation data is expected to crush growth in the second half of this year adding to andrew bailey s list of concerns should be the expected jump in core cpi which is expected to rise to 6 2 from 5 7 in march the surprise increase in core cpi in march rocked faith in the pound last month while a large increase in headline cpi is a given due to the energy price cap confirmation that core prices are continuing to jump higher could cause further damage to a delicate pound the energy price cap is expected to have caused headline cpi to rise by 1 6 there will also be significant upward pressure on prices from the increase in vat on hospitality higher water bills and a rise in telecoms costs higher prices have already dented growth in the service sector which underperformed in march and weighed on gdp growth this may just be the beginning for service sector contraction and once this pillar of the uk economy starts to de stabilise then it is only a matter of time before growth rates sink dodging a recession seems unlikely for the uk with this economic backdrop the ftse 100 has held up fairly well during the recent bout of market turmoil however the same can t be said about the ftse 250 which is still below the 20 000 mark although it rose in tandem with blue chip stocks at the end of last week since the uk is nowhere near peak inflation unlike the us we think that uk asset prices could lag their us peers in the coming months as the chances are higher that us stocks embark on a recovery sooner than their european peers likewise the pound has also taken the brunt of concerns about the uk s economic outlook wednesday s data is likely to confirm the threat of stagflation in the uk thus the pound could come under further selling pressure this week especially versus the dollar but also the euro gbp usd staged a feeble rally at the end of last week at the start of trading this week it is lower once more 1 2250 looks like a key level of resistance with 1 2160 the low from last week acting as support for now eur gbp may have fallen back from the 0 8560 highs at the end of last week however we expect this pair to trade sideways until the cpi data from the uk is confirmed if cpi rates are worse than expected we expect eur gbp to continue to rally 2 us retail sales one of the reasons why us stocks have sold off rather than capitulated over the last 6 weeks is that the market feels confident about consumer balance sheets in the us a red hot labour market and a build up of savings rates are helping to protect the us consumer us retail sales data is due for release on tuesday of this week and the market expects a 0 7 increase in sales for april the interesting thing about us retail sales data for april is that sales are expected to expand although the preliminary reading for the may michigan consumer sentiment index fell to 59 1 the lowest level since 2011 the index plunged nearly 10 from april reversing recent signs of stabilisation buying conditions for durable goods reached its lowest level since the index came into existence in 1978 added to this consumer satisfaction with their own financial conditions is at its lowest level since 2013 the other interesting reading from this survey was that inflation expectations are relatively well anchored at 3 within the range seen over the last 10 months thus people are complaining about inflation they may not be keen to buy big ticket items but this week s retail sales data could see us consumers continue to spend on themselves including on air travel and leisure activities since inflation in the us is expected to have peaked and the fed is pushing back on the prospect of a 75bp rate hike we could see retail sales remain steady regardless of weak consumer sentiment even so we will be looking at the minutia of the us retail sales report closely especially car sales and other big ticket items to see if spending could moderate down the line however a resilient us consumer could boost market sentiment and lead to a further recovery for risky assets this week

dramatically at times russia is one of the biggest exporters of nickel which is mainly used in steel production and battery manufacturing according to the imf there are still ongoing risks to the global economy from restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic particularly if lockdown measures continue to hit production in china in the view of kion group the material handling market was initially only moderately affected by the effects of the war in ukraine in the first quarter of 2022 demand for industrial trucks in kion group s sales markets was still above the previous year s level in the view of kion group the market in the emea and americas regions grew strongly in the reporting period order intake in the apac region was slightly higher than the previous year s level in the view of kion group driven by the continuing positive trend in china at the same time significant supply limitations are continuing as a knock on effect from the coronavirus pandemic in addition the industry is being adversely affected by the lack of preliminary products for production and loss of key transport routes due to the war in ukraine across the sector supply chain delays hampered the delivery of urgently needed upstream products to production sites this led to significantly and persistently longer delivery times including for kion group brands due to industry association amendments to rules for the publication dates of market data for new orders of industrial trucks there is no reportable data available for order figures on the overall market in the reporting period project business for supply chain solutions was also hit due to delays on the supply side in the view of kion group the global market for supply chain solutions has continued to grow strongly in the reporting period the emea and americas regions contributed to the high level of market activity once again it is too early to fully appraise the impact of the war in ukraine and the international sanctions against russia and belarus on economic development in the kion group s customer industries the mid to long term growth trend substantiated by market studies is still intact in the view of kion group driven by continued growth in e commerce urbanization demographic change and the increasing demands on delivery speeds segment development in detail order intake in the industrial trucks services segment rose by 15 6 percent to 2 082 billion previous year 1 800 billion the 18 9 percent increase in new truck business was primarily due to higher order intake for counterbalanced forklift trucks this marked a continuation of the trend from the previous year towards electric forklift trucks warehouse trucks also achieved strong growth in total the number of new orders in the first quarter of 2022 rose by 29 3 percent to 87 000 units in service business order intake grew in all categories at 1 718 billion revenue in the industrial trucks services segment were 13 2 percent above the previous year s level 1 519 billion the growth was due to the high number of orders on hand accumulated by the end of 2021 however due to the ongoing sluggish supply of upstream parts in the emea region in particular there were delays to the delivery of new trucks therefore the usual price increases in the fourth quarter of 2021 have not yet impacted the value of revenue in the segment in all relevant product categories the previous year s figures were exceeded with the increasing demand for electric forklift trucks continuing service business grew by 12 2 percent this was due primarily to rental business as well as the increase in the after sales area service business accounted for 52 2 percent of external segment revenue previous year 52 7 percent adjusted ebit fell to 114 2 million previous year 131 0 million mainly impacted by significant increase in material prices and logistics costs as well as inefficiencies on the production side due to delivery bottlenecks on account of this the adjusted ebit margin dropped to 6 6 percent in the reporting period previous year 8 6 percent and was thus at the level of q4 2021 the supply chain solutions segment recorded order intake of 843 2 million in the first three months of 2022 a rise of 1 6 percent year on year previous year 829 8 million the orders are primarily attributable to new and upgrade investments in e commerce as well as in general merchandise and the grocery sector project business business solutions was down slightly compared with the previous year in the higher margin services business order intake rose strongly again compared with the previous year total revenue in the supply chain solutions segment was up 18 5 percent to 1 020 billion previous year 860 7 million despite the lack of stability in supply chains and the resulting limited availability of materials the group pressed ahead with ongoing customer projects particularly in e commerce grocery and general merchandise service business accounted for 20 1 percent of external segment revenue close to the previous year s level 19 9 percent at 74 0 million adjusted ebit in the supply chain solutions segment was lower than in the previous year 101 7 million the main causes of this were inefficiencies due to bottlenecks for upstream parts in addition to higher material prices consequently the adjusted ebit margin was 7 3 percent previous year 11 8 percent and was thus at the level of q4 2021 outlook in view of the ongoing and substantial uncertainties in the procurement markets which are being significantly exacerbated by the war in ukraine and renewed coronavirus lockdowns especially in asia the executive board of kion group ag decided on april 4 2022 to withdraw the outlook for 2022 that had been published in the 2021 annual report although the kion group believes that the fundamental driving factors in the intralogistics indus try remain intact there are significant uncertainties with regard to evaluating the group s business performance over the further course of the year from the current perspective it is not possible to reliably assess how the war in ukraine or the coronavirus pandemic will unfold or what their eco nomic impact will be the bottlenecks in the procurement markets which are persisting for much longer than anticipated and continuing sharp rises in the cost of materials and logistics costs will have a particularly adverse effect on the kion group s adjusted ebit and free cash flow this applies to both segments in equal measure the kion group intends to produce a new

on a humid august afternoon in 2020 two caskets one silver one white sat by holes in the ground at a small graveside service in the town of travelers rest south carolina the family had just lost a mom and dad both to covid 19 they died five days apart said allison leaver their daughter who now lives in maryland with her husband and kids when leaver s parents died that summer it was a crushing tragedy and there was no life insurance or burial policy to help with the expense we just figured we were just going to have to put that on our credit cards and pay it off and that s how we were going to deal with that leaver a public school teacher said with a laugh of resignation but then in april 2021 the federal emergency management agency offered to reimburse funeral expenses for covid victims up to 9 000 which is roughly the average cost of a funeral and the assistance was retroactive leaver applied immediately if this horrible thing had to happen at least we weren t going to be out the cash for it she said pixabay stock image a year into the program the federal government has paid more than 2 billion to cover funeral costs for people who die of covid more than 300 000 families have received reimbursement averaging 6 500 but fewer than half of eligible families have started applications and fema said there is no limit on the funding available at this time many surviving family members have run into challenges or don t know the money is still available fema launched a massive call center to manage applications hiring 4 000 contractors in denver survivors must call to initiate the process as applications are not accepted online fema received a million calls on the first day leaving many people waiting on hold once leaver talked to a representative she started assembling the death certificates and receipts from the funeral home and cemetery she uploaded them online and heard nothing for months eventually she called and learned that one problem was that the receipts she submitted had different signatures one was her husband s another her sister s and although it was a joint funeral to get the full amount per parent the government required separate receipts for each parent s funeral leaver said she was frustrated but determined to get it done come hell or high water plus she said it was summer break and she had time but many other eligible families haven t applied or say they don t have time clerical challenges have discouraged participation especially for those whose loved ones died early in the pandemic said jaclyn rothenberg fema s chief spokesperson some people with death certificates didn t necessarily have covid listed as the cause of death she said we do have a responsibility to our taxpayer stewards to make sure that that is in fact the cause rothenberg said fema is trying to resolve everyone s problems even though the agency has spent the 2 billion initially budgeted she said there s a new pot of stimulus funding from the american rescue plan act comparing fema s data to official covid fatalities through march 15 showed that washington d c led the nation with applications for 77 of deaths states clustered in the south had the highest participation rate in the program with north carolina approaching applications for two thirds of deaths other states remain well below a 50 participation rate in oregon and washington fewer than 1 in 3 covid deaths resulted in an application eligibility is generally not the hurdle there are no income limits and life insurance does not preclude participation and there is still no deadline one of the few disqualifiers is if a funeral was prepaid we need people to continue helping us get the word out rothenberg said we know we have more work to do fema is launching an outreach campaign to promote the program the agency is focusing on the populous states of california new york pennsylvania and texas and targeting vulnerable populations the government is also leaning on community groups connected to those who most need to know about the money covid survivors for change founded by chris kocher has been helping people navigate the process including through a facebook webinar we were able to connect people to some of the survivors that had been through that process already just to help them walk through it kocher said many just need someone to complete the application for them stephanie smith of carlisle kentucky lost her father to covid her mother who was 83 at the time had no chance of filing an application at a minimum applying requires scanning or faxing she s a very smart spunky lady but she s never used a computer smith said smith was able to jump through the hoops without much trouble and 9 000 she said is enough to make life considerably easier as her mom adjusts to being a covid widow she probably would not have attempted to do it because the whole process would have been overwhelming for her she said this story is part of a partnership that includes nashville public radio npr and khn it can be republished for free details

silao mexico u s automaker general motors gm has agreed to raise wages by 8 5 percent following negotiations with a new independent union at its pick up truck plant in the central city of silao the wage increase is one of the highest recent pay raises in the local car manufacturing industry the agreement with the union is also the first major pay increase since the signing of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca which aims to reduce the wage gap between u s and mexican workers it remains to be seen if such raises can be easily duplicated in other factories industry officials said the independent mexican labor union sinttia earlier won the rights to represent workers at the pick up truck plant in silao as well as wages the deal promises larger bonuses a 14 percent increase in grocery vouchers and a mandatory day off on christmas eve union officials said the new contract also stipulates that gm and the union will form working groups to negotiate work schedules a protocol for dealing with sexual harassment cases and a program to push back against inflation in the coming years according to the two year contract salaries will be up for review in one year said alejandra morales sinttia s secretary general adding that she hoped workers at other plants would see news of the raise as a sign of what independent unions can accomplish before there were deals just between companies and unions today it s possible for us workers to have real negotiations said morales a gm silao employee for nearly 12 years as quoted by reuters ahead of a workers vote to approve the agreement later this month gm has not commented on details of the contract sinttia which has pushed for raises above the rate of inflation reported at 7 68 percent in april initially proposed an increase of 19 2 percent gm countered with an offer of 3 5 percent

point the s p500 reached a 20 correction this provided some hope for the australian market on friday having crashed through 7 000 points from tuesday s opening and then recovering the asx200 held valiantly on to 7 000 through to mid morning on thursday when once again the sellers won out but if the signs on wall street were signalling oversold on thursday night locally the call was equivalent it didn t hurt that us bnpl company affirm had reported in thursday night s aftermarket and jumped 30 block sq2 duly jumped 15 in our market on friday and zip co z1p 5 9 firing up the tech sector in general which ultimately closed up 7 0 on the day tyro payments tyr rose 9 8 it was a day for everything that had been beaten down on inflation rate hike fears to come roaring back no more was this evident than in the consumer sectors with discretionary up 2 4 and staples returning to a more familiar 0 8 while communication services rose 2 1 megaport mp1 jumped 9 6 one of most beaten down sectors of all throughout the week was real estate and it bounced 3 0 csl csl has been holding out relatively well since its plasma collections returned to normal but it jumped 3 3 taking the healthcare sector up 3 0 with some help from the highly volatile medical duo of polynovo pnv up 14 to top the index and clinuvel pharmaceutical cuv up 13 5 healthcare was the winner among the big cap sectors but the banks did their bit up 1 4 while energy rose 2 5 on a bounce in oil prices and materials dismissed lower metals prices and gained 1 6 after a tough week all sectors closed in the green the index had opened higher from the bell regaining the 7000 mark in the first 20 minutes from that point the buying fed on itself and it was a steady path upwards to close on the high of the day so is all forgiven such snap back rallies from oversold positions are part and parcel of the bear market although the asx200 had not fallen by as much as 10 let alone 20 before friday the index closed down 1 2 for the week the reason we have not fallen so hard is because earlier on we were rallying on surging commodity prices china soon put an end to that and beijing is continuing to tighten restrictions one interesting stock move on friday was that of a2 milk a2m which fell 1 5 despite the us suffering a critical shortage of baby formula and now scrambling to secure imports oversold rally ii michigan uni s bi monthly index of us consumer sentiment fell to 59 1 points from the end april s 65 2 to mark its lowest level in more than 10 years in other news fed chair jerome powell said in an interviewer the question whether we can execute a soft landing or not it may actually depend on factors that we don t control but wall street shrugged the signs were there on friday not for the first time that the stock market had reached oversold levels and the bounce off the 20 mark for the s p500 during thursday night s session was one of the strongest to date despite friday night s solid bounce the s p500 still closed down 2 4 for the week to mark its first six week losing streak since 2011 the dow posted seven down weeks for the first time since 2001 wall street nevertheless remains concerned about the us economy and about what the fed might do to it critical to the us economy is the consumer thus weak sentiment numbers are not encouraging but such sentiment stands in contrast to the ongoing reopening trade most notable in airline and hotel bookings running rampant despite prices also running rampant impacted by airline fuel costs analysts point to such contrast to suggest pent up demand from covid weary consumers supported by their sound household balance sheets is sufficient to stave off a consumer spending strike at least in the short term but sudden snap back rallies are part and parcel of bear markets so no one is prepared at this stage to call a bottom interesting news on friday was that elon musk had declared via a tweet that his bid for twitter was on hold this had twitter shares down 10 and tesla shares up 6 given musk had warned he may need to use tesla shares as collateral the problem is a question over the number of fake accounts on twitter which might falsely overblow account numbers musk is prepared to cop a small amount but not too large an amount so for now that has to be determined commodities spot metals minerals energy

bloomberg the uk is fast becoming the epicenter of the global stagflation crisis as the bank of england s policy tightening campaign and the soaring cost of living put the world s fifth biggest economy on the verge of recession it s about to get even worse according to a clear majority of market participants in the latest mliv pulse survey more than two thirds of 191 respondents see the currency tumbling to 1 15 a 6 decline from current levels to lows unseen even in the post brexit chaos meanwhile a similar proportion expect 10 year gilt yields to climb to 3 the gloomy outlook threatens to hamstring policy makers in their bid to combat the economic downturn while heaping fresh pain onto consumers and businesses already reeling from the fastest inflation in three decades while few countries have been left unscathed by the pandemic and its inflationary aftermath the uk s decision to leave the european union has made it more vulnerable say 80 of mliv readers as the central bank is forced to tighten policy aggressively pulse respondents see 10 year yields gapping higher all that risks creating a historic cashflow squeeze for british borrowers just as wavering consumer confidence causes a slowdown in spending a 6 decline in the pound on a trade weighted basis in the current quarter would likely lift inflation 0 6 percentage point higher than otherwise in the quarters ahead according to bloomberg economics shok forecasting tool we re getting into a more stagflationary environment where growth is expected to slow sharply but inflation pressures to remain elevated keeping pressure on the bank of england to tighten into the slowdown said lee hardman a currency strategist at mufg in london that s a negative mix for the currency uk households are facing the second worst year on record for real disposable income according to boe data going back to 1964 meanwhile many of the much touted brexit benefits have yet to emerge trade deals have done little to replace the seamless exchange of goods and services the uk enjoyed with the world s largest trading bloc the city of london which enjoyed more than three decades of near unbroken growth as europe s financial hub must now resort to workarounds to maintain access to the eu when mliv readers were asked to predict the top three financial centers in the next decade 92 cited new york followed by the uk capital at 68 pointing to a growing split between the two cities that were once neck and neck shanghai was next with 36 for those with a glass half empty disposition the results also suggest almost a third of mliv respondents expect london to lose its status as one of the world s top financial hubs the costs of brexit faded into the background when the pandemic hit a huge wave of government money staved off an immediate reckoning but this year as the bill for brexit and covid starts to emerge the boe faces a stark balancing act the monetary authority issued the most gloomy outlook of any major central bank this month warning britons to brace for a prolonged period of stagnation or even recession in the view of mliv readers its hawkish policy pivot could have been better flagged with just 16 of respondents rating the boe the best central bank at setting market expectations that was ahead of the ecb but far behind the federal reserve which snagged 34 of the vote still they have all been poor was the clear favorite suggesting fed chair jerome powell shouldn t be patting himself on the back either a drop in the pound to 1 15 would imply retesting the low reached during the height of the pandemic selloff the currency never fell that far in the tumultuous aftermath of the brexit referendum or in any of the subsequent political crises although the dismal outlook is in part a strong dollar story the mooted threshold is historic other than in the march 2020 rout the only time the pound has traded below 1 15 was in 1985 after us rate hikes boosted the greenback according to data compiled by bloomberg going back to 1971 meanwhile a 3 yield on 10 year gilts would be quite the move given the rate sits at about 1 74 currently implying more trouble for indebted borrowers while cooling the red hot housing market it s not all bad news for uk money managers though some 58 of mliv readers see the ftse 100 continuing to outperform the s p 500 index which is more heavily weighted to interest rate sensitive growth stocks a weaker pound would actually support the export led uk index more than three quarters of the respondents were based in either europe or north america and they disagreed strongly about the relative performance of uk and us assets while two thirds of those in europe expect the ftse 100 to beat the s p 500 just 44 of respondents in north america agreed for more markets analysis see the mliv blog for previous surveys and to subscribe see ni mlivpulse 2022 bloomberg l p

just over one week before georgia s republican gubernatorial primary incumbent gov brian kemp and his allies backing a massive new economic development project in the peach state are concealing key details of the agreement from the public with critics alleging the use of underhanded tactics and shady backroom deals to push it through despite local opposition state and local officials in georgia earlier this month announced a deal to dole out 1 5 billion of incentives to electric vehicle startup rivian for it to build a 5 billion manufacturing plant east of atlanta that will create 7 500 jobs the incentive package by far the largest georgia has ever offered to a company includes major tax credits a 25 year no cost lease and more than 198 million in site and road improvements on the 1 978 acres where the plant will be built in morgan and walton counties the deal to construct rivian s new electric vehicle manufacturing hub was first announced in december since then kemp has touted it as the biggest economic development project in georgia history however kemp and other backers of the deal didn t advertise that the land transactions for the site still haven t closed standard confidentiality provisions within the real estate agreements prohibit sharing information until closings on the real estate have occurred said marie gordon communications director for the georgia department of economic development the transactions are continuing to move through the process the rural land on which the rivian plant will be developed will be owned by the state of georgia and leased to the joint development authority jda of jasper morgan newton and walton counties which in turn will rent the land to rivian officials in georgia had to acquire much of the land from private sellers who were asked to sign non disclosure agreements ndas to prevent them from discussing the transactions sources told just the news of the nearly 2 000 acres meant for the rivian plant about 675 earmarked for the project are owned by alan verner and his four siblings the verners could pocket more than 20 million combined according to the atlanta journal constitution which described alan verner as integral to bringing the 5 billion plant to georgia verner was serving as chairman of the jda when talks to sell the land began early last year he vacated the position in august when talks were well advanced while ethics experts have expressed concern about a potential conflict of interest the jda and people close to verner have said he had no involvement in jda votes and meetings concerning rivian just the news attempted to find out if the land designated for the rivian plant was appraised and if so for how much requests for information were denied because the land deals are still pending your request for information relates to pending land transactions and any documents related thereto are not subject to disclosure of the open records act until such time as they are closed said ben sheidler a principal at an outside firm representing the jda on public relations matters the land deals are contingent on title being cleared they are in the process of being closed now however sources in georgia told just the news there are still substantive issues with permitting and raising the necessary funds that have held up finalizing the transactions the department of economic development didn t respond to inquiries asking for more detailed explanations of why the land deals haven t closed this lack of clarity and transparency is part of a broader issue that has long dogged the rivian project for months local residents have been complaining about the lack of transparency surrounding the rivian deal which has been brokered by state and local authorities in secrecy many georgians were taken by surprise and first learned about the project when it was initially announced in december and kemp didn t reveal the 1 5 billion of incentives until after his final gop primary debate earlier this month several state and local officials have signed ndas prohibiting them from discussing details of the rivian deal and denied open records requests for the ndas citing the fact that they pertain to pending land transactions and an active economic development project sources also described to just the news how the jda has frequently switched the location of meetings at the last minute and given little notice for the public to be aware of and make plans to attend such meetings no one who i ve voted for has voted on anything related to the rivian deal said one resident who chose not to be named former sen david perdue who s challenging kemp in the gubernatorial primary has echoed these complaints kemp completely shut out the local community and hid the massive 1 5 billion price tag until the day after the last debate perdue told just the news shelling out 200 000 per potential job for an unproven soros funded start up is downright reckless but that s exactly what kemp has done perdue was referring to the fact that liberal megadonor george soros is one of the biggest investors in rivian a california based company committed to fighting climate change he got the 200 000 figure by dividing the 1 5 billion in taxpayer dollar incentives by the 7 500 jobs expected to be created by the new plant last week ford sold 8 million shares or about 8 of its investment in rivian which reported 2 5 billion in losses for the fourth quarter of last year and 1 59 billion in losses for the first quarter of this year rivian which has failed to meet production expectations closed the week with a stock share price about seven times less than its 180 per share peak in november real economic growth is straightforward added perdue the state should help create an attractive environment to spur organic growth and the hardworking folks who live in the local community should be involved in the process every step of the way when asked to respond to claims that the jda hasn t been transparent the jda referred just the news to the frequently asked questions section of its website land acquisition matters and active economic development matters are permitted to be discussed in executive session and documents pertaining to the same and held as confidential until such time as a final agreement is reached and transactions are closed the jda website states the purpose of confidential discussions is to allow for fair negotiations between governments and private parties and to be a good steward of public funds the website also defends the use of ndas to protect companies from disclosure of their private information while they make decisions and negotiate new locations and says jda members aren t permitted to discuss executive session matters with anyone outside the jda regardless of whether they signed an nda once a decision is reached and an economic development agreement is signed all government roles responsibilities and incentives are promptly disclosed to the public under the georgia open records act according to the jda rivian publicly chose georgia as the site for its plant in december and both parties announced the specifics of the incentives package on may 2 when asked to address claims of state and local authorities not being transparent about the rivian deal the department of economic development issued the following statement the georgia department of economic development has consistently posted updates at www georgia org rivian since the project was announced the state has followed the law and gone above and beyond to work with the local community and will continue to do so including through committees put into place by the state to allow for a consolidated forum to provide feedback the unanswered questions about transparency come days before georgia s gubernatorial primary on may 24 critics accuse kemp of touting the project while trying to keep a lid on the unresolved issues ahead of a contested election kemp s office didn t respond to a request for comment one of the key transparency issues concerning the rivian project occurred in february when the state of georgia took over the rivian project after the jda asked for assistance citing lack of resources this allowed officials to bypass local rezoning hearings which were scheduled for the jda to address concerns about the effects of heavy industrial development on land in morgan county that s predominately rural with large lot residential homes some georgians opposed to the rivian plant are worried about overdevelopment loss of farmland environmental issues and general disruption to their daily lives such as increased traffic days before the hearings the jda penned a letter quietly nudging state officials to take over the rivian project the state takeover was necessary because opponents of the plant were going to prevail in the zoning battle in morgan county according to one source who described the episode as indicative of the underhanded dealings involved in this project the jda and the department of economic development didn t address this specific claim when sent requests for comment rivian itself previously said it would host events this spring to discuss residents concerns for us to be successful in georgia it s important that we spend time listening to local concerns addressing them as best we can and working hard to be the kind of neighbor the community would like to see the company told bloomberg earlier this year rivian has yet to hold such a sit down according to residents the company didn t respond to a request for comment for this story

i wonder what the poor folks are having tonight everything is interesting in its own way there was a song written by ray stevens titled everything is beautiful from 1970 it began with little children singing jesus loves the little children then the lyrics and music are from stevens himself everything is beautiful in its own way like the starry summer s night or a snow covered winter s day and everybody s beautiful in their own way under god s heaven the world s gonna find a way there is none so blind as he who will not see we must not close our minds we must let our thoughts be free for every hour that passes by you know the world gets a little bit older it s time to realize that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder nothing to see in the heartland from the first time i heard it was a favorite it s true everything is beautiful in its own way that s what someone who can see the world through the eyes of a child would say it s the way many people viewed the world over the ages and it s the way we might consider viewing it today another way to say it would go like this everything is interesting in its own way like the verdant fruited plain or the things we see every day now it doesn t mean we just go along seeing bunnies and rainbows all the time but there are interesting animals to see and we do have rain followed by prismatic displays now and then i ve heard people complain we drove all the way across kansas and it was so boring that always amazes me so you drove across one of the most productive agricultural regions of the world the breadbasket of north america and you noticed nothing i actually feel sorry for people like that did you miss the grain elevators were there no union pacific trains stretching to the horizon no cattle no oil wells no charming towns no contour farming no wooden box cars now serving as sheds and hen houses no post offices with wpa murals no stone fence posts no dramatic sky no flint hills no sturdy farm folk no wheat of any

take a ride in a plane gave him an aerial view of the greatest fleet in history off the coast of normandy in june 1944 another invitation took him on a jeep ride beyond the front where he saw another soldier win the silver star for discovering that the germans had pulled back behind the moselle river he saw the top allied brass in paris he took a detour to walk around stonehenge because he d heard of it he passed all of those memories to my brothers and me but better yet he passed along the interest and the curiosity for more than 50 years now there has been a steady chorus of doomsayers

new york may 16 2022 globe newswire the pension fund coalition for inclusive capitalism an initiative of the coalition for inclusive capitalism and the ira m millstein center for global markets and corporate ownership at columbia law school today released an open resource to help pension funds structure contract language establishing minimum environmental social and governance esg impact guidelines in investment agreements with asset managers the pension fund coalition for inclusive capitalism has developed model esg impact contract language for use in asset owner agreements signed with asset managers encompassing a range of approaches to pension fund investments in public and private equity markets the resource is intended to protect against superficial implementation of impact oriented standards and afford asset owners the ability to better direct and monitor their asset managers to ensure they invest in line with their priorities for capitalism to be inclusive and sustainable capital must be invested to both provide shareholder returns and prove its positive impact on people and planet said lynn forester de rothschild founder and chair of the coalition for inclusive capitalism and founding and managing partner at inclusive capital partners the most powerful lever of investment change lies with asset owners who demand that managers demonstrate both stock price returns and concrete proof of overall impact the pension fund coalition for inclusive capitalism co chaired by theresa whitmarsh and hiro mizuno collaborated with public pension fund managers and legal advisors to provide pension funds and other asset owners a guide for structuring esg impact provisions in investment agreements the tools include model mandates reporting requirements and sample esg impact criteria which pension funds can use as a baseline for negotiating esg impact provisions in the context of asset manager relationships most public pension funds have little control over how or whether their assets are invested with esg impact guidelines the model language addresses this gap by ensuring long term value creation standards are upheld said hiro mizuno united nations special envoy on innovative finance and sustainable investments and former chief investment officer of the japan government pension investment fund the world s largest pension fund the model language is designed for ease of use and can be tailored to asset owners esg and long term investment priorities flexible across a range of scenarios approaches and public or private markets it offers portfolio and legal teams pragmatic esg tools for model mandates voting rights reporting requirements sample esg factors and criteria the resource also includes guidance for fund managers and legal teams on other key considerations in determining esg objectives within their broader investment agreements as asset owners those who oversee pension plans are distinctly focused on the long term in the interests of beneficiaries and future retirees pension fund fiduciaries are looking for better ways to address the integration of social and environmental factors as part of successful sustainability said theresa whitmarsh co chair of the millstein center chair of fcltglobal and former executive director of the washington state investment board with these tools pension funds will have more ways to ensure that their capital is being deployed by asset managers in strategies that fit with a preferred approach to sustainability and esg integration on may 18 at 12 p m edt the

theresa whitmarsh and hiro mizuno register to join here pension fund managers familiar with the work added the following it s important that large asset owners including pension funds treasurers and endowments know how to structure an optimal relationship with their investment managers said illinois state treasurer michael frerichs asset owners have a vested interest ensuring that their managers are using best in class practices that add value and serve their needs this includes the integration of esg factors into investment decisions the adoption of strong proxy voting practices and the provision of robust reporting on investment management and stewardship activities the model language published today will help investors structure strong relationships with their managers and it will help create uniform standards across the market pension investors and asset managers must create long term value for clients and beneficiaries by considering social and environmental outcomes said

rally as investors seek to lock in profit from the five week bullish run in the market thus we see more of a choppy theme as cautious trading takes center stage ahead of the monetary policy committee mpc meeting scheduled later in the month notwithstanding we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings cordros securities stated in a weekend note to investors meanwhile in their latest review of nigerian equities analysts at fsdh securities said nigerian equities have further room for upside particularly among fast moving consumer goods fmcg companies which have been able to finally pass on more cost increases to consumers in the report titled fsdh top pick analysts said they remained bullish on upstream oil and gas companies and oil palm companies following indonesia s decision to ban exports of palm olein which is expected to trigger a surge in cpo prices clearly the trend of activities in the equities market has changed as domestic institutional investors are now taking bigger bets on nigerian equities following expectations of prolonged bearish sentiments in the bonds market this narrative will likely continue for an extended period as bond yields are projected to continue the uptrend which would cause institutional investors to raise allocations to equities particularly as new funds flow into the market however we advise investors to exercise patience and wait for the recent rally to cool off before taking positions in the market as the market is over stretched in the short term fsdh stated the report selected 10 stocks which could yield above average returns for investors these included unilever nigeria lafarge africa nigerian breweries international breweries seplat energies flour mills of nigeria transnational corporation of nigeria ecobank transnational incorporated mtn nigeria communications and okomu oil palm the report noted that nigerian equities market had extended its stellar 2022 performance into april as investors were in upbeat mood aggressively taking positions in the equities market particularly with a focus on consumer goods names as well as oil palm companies according to the report the improved sentiments was first kicked off by dividend reinvesting activities by investors but was further spurred on by the outstanding first quarter 2022 earnings season the report outlined that impressive outings from companies like okomu guinness nigeria nigerian breweries unilever nigeria and lafarge africa among others triggered a buying spree as investors interest notched a new level overall the benchmark all share index asi gained 5 7 per cent in april to close the month at 49 638 94 points the rally in the nigerian equities market was broad based as all major sectors closed higher the rally was led by the oil and gas sector with average gain of 19 1 per cent in april 2022 the report noted that the rally in oil and gas stocks was reflective of the bullish sentiments in the crude oil market particularly for seplat energies which was also expected to make a quarterly dividend payment in addition announcement of a board meeting by oando triggered a buying spree in the stock the report pointed out that a solid outing for fmcg stocks in first quarter 2022 earnings season bolstered the performance of the consumer goods sector which gained 11 5 per cent in april 2022 meanwhile global equities market kickstarted second quarter 2022 on a bearish note as fears of a surge in interest rates underpinned risk off sentiments towards equities this was broadly in line with fsdh s outlook for the month of april as only one of the equity indices tracked across united states us and european equities market closed northwards in april heading into may we continue to advise investors to underweight exposure to stocks for developed economies this is premised on the expectations of further downside in the us and european markets following the fomc s decision to hike interest rates by a further 50 basis points largest move since 2000 we expect investors to remain on the edge as they price in further rate hikes for the rest of the year fsdh stated

policies the onslaught on wages and conditions and the threat of nuclear war the sep s campaign is aimed at establishing the political independence of the working class from all of the parties that defend capitalism an essential premise if it is to wage a struggle for socialism in particular any genuine socialist party must wage an intransigent political struggle to break workers from the labor party which in the past claimed to represent the working class but has functioned throughout its history as the main bulwark of australian capitalism similarly it must dispel any illusion that parties such as the greens which completely accept the framework of parliament and the profit system offer any progressive alternative the campaign of socialist alliance like other pseudo left organisations is based on a diametrically opposed perspective its aim is to channel the growing opposition of workers and young people back behind the discredited parties of the political establishment socialist alliance promotes labor and the greens as a lesser evil to the liberal national coalition of prime minister scott morrison socialist alliance s program is summed up in one of its main election articles which declared kicking out morrison and electing a minority labor government dependent on greens support on may 21 would open up opportunities to push harder for progressive reform workers and young people socialist alliance states should vote for these parties and pressure the greens to pressure labor into enacting progressive reform socialist alliance has advanced the same line in every election that it has contested in the 2007 and 2010 elections it called for workers and youth to triple the value of their vote by casting a ballot for socialist alliance and then directing preferences to the greens and labor then as now the pseudo left party presented the elections as an opportunity to pressure the official parties into implementing progressive policies what were the consequences however between 2007 and 2013 the labor governments of kevin rudd and julia gillard whose election socialist alliance supported carried out sweeping attacks on the social rights of the working class instituted the fair work australia industrial relations framework that bans virtually all strikes and integrated more closely australia into us war plans after the 2010 election the minority gillard labor government struck a power sharing arrangement with the greens establishing a de facto labor greens government as socialist alliance had advocated it was one of the most right wing governments in australian history gillard with the full support of the greens escalated australia s involvement in the neo colonial war in afghanistan committing to a troop surge and brutal counter insurgency operations that resulted in war crimes at the same time the government supported the us led persecution of julian assange for his exposure of the illegal wars in iraq and afghanistan gillard aligned australia with the us preparations for conflict with china in 2011 she welcomed us president barack obama into the australian parliament where he announced the us pivot to asia against china and signed a basing agreement for us marines in northern australia on the social front the labor greens government kicked 100 000 single parents off their benefits forcing them onto the poverty level unemployment allowance it launched the education revolution aimed at opening up public education up to the full forces of the market and slashing government funding similar measures were introduced in health and the provision of disability services far from pressuring labor to the left the greens loyally supported gillard as she implemented all of these regressive policies withdrawing from the de facto coalition they argued would open the door to the liberal nationals so it was necessary to provide labor with a blank cheque the labor greens government that socialist alliance is advocating now would implement far deeper attacks on the social and democratic rights of working people because the capitalist system that they defend at all costs is in a far deeper crisis globally in this election labor is seeking to outflank the coalition from the right it is pitching itself to the financial elite as a more reliable instrument for implementing sweeping cuts to social spending and deepening pro business restructuring of the economy labor has likewise condemned the coalition for not building up the military as quickly as is required for an imminent us led war with china the greens campaign is solely focused on appeals to labor to establish a power sharing arrangement after the election holding up the gillard government as the model to be followed socialist alliance s election campaign is characterised by crass parliamentary cretinism an inordinate amount of its campaign material is focused on explaining that casting a vote for socialist alliance is not a wasted ballot because people can direct then their preferences to the greens and labor in other words socialist alliance is not standing in opposition to these right wing parties of big business but is seeking to channel leftward moving sections of workers and young people behind them socialist alliance similarly promotes the trade unions and insists that any struggle by workers must be subordinate to their bureaucratic leaderships for the past forty years the unions have enforced unending attacks on jobs wages and conditions while working with governments and the employers to suppress the class struggle socialist alliance s campaign material is parochial and dovetails with the official election campaign which is aimed at suppressing any discussion of the major issues confronting the working class it says virtually nothing about war under conditions of the reckless us nato war against russia in ukraine threatening to escalate into a nuclear conflict like the pseudo left as a whole socialist alliance is a pro imperialist organisation that has backed us regime change operations in syria and libya during the war in ukraine it has called for unconditional support to washington s far right proxy government in kiev socialist alliance occasionally mentions the covid pandemic but it is silent on the central role of labor and the greens in enforcing the pro business reopening of the economy which has resulted in a massive surge of illness and death socialist alliance never raises the need for a fight to eliminate the virus through the coordinated action of workers internationally because this requires a political fight against labor and the unions and the turn to a genuine socialist perspective socialist alliance similarly says virtually nothing about the unprecedented crisis of world capitalism or the emerging struggles of the international working class its election program does not advocate socialism or the need for a workers government but instead it calls for radical democracy and community power these slogans combined with denunciations of the rich and big business are virtually indistinguishable from those of any number of populist demagogues like them socialist alliance is peddling the fraud that democracy is possible for working people in a capitalist society dominated by the banks big business and the billionaires and under conditions where basic democratic rights and legal norms have been under sustained attack by governments both labor and coalition above all the empty populism of socialist alliance is directed against the genuine socialist perspective advanced by the sep as the sep has explained throughout the election the working class must build its own international movement aimed at the abolition of capitalism and the establishment of world socialism as the sole means of preventing the threat of nuclear war and ending the pandemic the social and democratic rights of the working class can only be established through the overthrow of the profit system and the establishment of workers political power the banks and the corporations must be placed under ownership and democratic workers control and society reorganised to meet social need not private profit this perspective is anathema to the pseudo left socialist alliance represents an affluent layer of the upper middle class in academia the union bureaucracy and the top echelons of the public sector whose affluent lifestyles are based on the suppression of the class struggle on the stock market boom and imperialist war socialist alliance promotes identity politics based on race gender and sexuality to divide the working class suppress discussion of the major issues of war and capitalist crisis and to advance the strivings of its middle class constituency for greater privileges within the framework of capitalism workers and young people seeking to fight for a genuine socialist perspective should reject pro capitalist politics

growth this range takes into account the negative impact of approximately 0 6 million due to the closure of our activities in russia and certain regions of ukraine and headwinds of approximately 4 million due to y y changes in fx rates excluding these we would have expected q2 22 revenue to grow 10 11 y y if we do not see further deterioration in the macro environment for the full year 2022 we believe revenue growth will be 10 13 y y this range includes the negative impact from suspending activities in russia and certain regions in ukraine which we estimate accounts for approximately 3 million in revenue in 2022 and approximately 20 million in headwinds due to y y changes in fx rates excluding these our expectation for revenue growth for the full year would be 12 15 y y assuming no

this is the first article in a five part series the us and its nato allies canada included are waging war on russia in all but name their governments corporate media and establishment parties claim that the nato powers are funneling tens of billions of dollars in weaponry to kiev in order to protect ukraine s sovereignty and save its democracy in reality their provocative actions have brought the world to the precipice of a global conflagration fought with nuclear weapons as the world socialist web site has exhaustively documented american imperialism long planned for and instigated war with moscow over ukraine it led nato s eastward expansion over the past three decades to encircle russia and goaded putin into launching his reactionary invasion by refusing to so much as discuss moscow s security concerns washington and wall street are determined to subjugate russia plunder its abundant resources and tighten thereby the military strategic encirclement of china in pursuit of these predatory geostrategic and economic objectives the us and its allies have aligned with ukraine s far right parties and fascist militia that is with forces that venerate and seek to emulate the ukrainian fascists who collaborated with and sought the nazis patronage during world war ii in pursuit of an ethnically pure ukrainian state the ukrainian fascists participated in some of the most monstrous crimes of the 20th century including the holocaust washington aided and abetted by its german and canadian allies used the fascist right sector as its shock troops in the february 2014 coup that removed ukraine s elected pro russian president viktor yanukovych the imperialist powers then placed in power a government committed to harnessing ukraine to nato and the european union washington subsequently rearmed and reorganized ukraine s armed forces overseeing the merger of the fascist azov battalion into ukraine s security forces today these fascists comprise an important part of ukraine s elite troops as ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has himself boasted they are pivotal frontline fighters in the russian majority donbas region canadian imperialism has long sought to pass itself off as an altruistic force in global affairs but ottawa is playing an especially provocative and belligerent role in the ukraine war this is a continuation of its substantial role in the war s preparation and instigation under both liberal and conservative governments canada has worked closely with washington first in its drive to expand nato to include former warsaw pact countries and soviet republics and then since 2016 to permanently deploy nato expeditionary forces on russia s borders canada leads one of nato s four enhanced forward presence battle groups in poland and the baltic states and routinely dispatches warplanes and warships menacingly on russia s doorstep from 2015 hundreds of canadian armed forces trainers were deployed to ukraine where they worked alongside american and british military personnel to reorganize ukraine s armed forces this included helping integrate and train the fascists of the azov battalion member of the ukrainian national guard sporting the symbol of the fascist azov battalion while participating in canadian armed forces training exercise canada s military support for ukraine has increased exponentially as washington and ottawa have outlined ever more sweeping war aims since january canada has pledged to deliver 618 million worth of military aid including heavy weaponry to kiev by next march the trudeau liberal government has also led the charge for all out economic warfare against russia working in tandem with britain s tory regime it pressed for russia s exclusion from the swift banking system and the seizure of the assets of russia s central bank canada s belligerent role in ukraine is in keeping with its participation in the past three decades of us led wars of aggression in the balkans middle east and central asia these wars were invariably justified with lies about weapons of mass destruction preventing genocide or otherwise protecting the vulnerable but their true purpose was to dominate the oil rich middle east and project us and western imperialist power over the geo strategically critical eurasian landmass behind a barrage of war propaganda and inflammatory claims of genocide calculated to make any de escalation of the conflict impossible the canadian ruling class is pursuing its own predatory economic and geopolitical objectives under conditions of systemic global capitalist crisis it is determined to strengthen its eight decades old military security alliance with washington which it deems pivotal to securing and expanding its extensive global imperialist interests canada which deployed troops to siberia in 1919 as part of the imperialist attempt to overthrow the revolutionary workers government of lenin and trotsky also has its own strategic rivalry with russia this is particularly true in the arctic where climate change is making the exploitation of natural resources and sea lanes ever more viable but there is a third important factor propelling canadian imperialism s outsized role in the us nato war on russia the canadian state s longstanding alliance with and patronage of the ukrainian far right in the years immediately following the third reich s downfall the canadian state gave sanctuary to tens of thousands of members and supporters of the two rival factions of the organization of ukrainian nationalists oun and did so despite specific warnings that it was providing refuge to hitler s accomplices in horrific war crimes both the oun melnyk m and oun bandera b collaborated with and eagerly sought the nazis patronage members of the ukrainian insurgent army upa created in 1943 by the stepan bandera wing of the oun were welcomed to canada with open arms despite the upa s role in the murder of tens of thousands of jews and poles so too were members of the 14th grenadier division of the waffen ss the so called galicia division no matter that the nuremberg trials had found the waffen ss to be a criminal organization as a whole due to its role as an armed wing of the nazi party and routine perpetration of mass murder and other war crimes the canadian state and political establishment subsequently encouraged and assisted the ukrainian fascist emigres and their political descendants in the whitewashing of their crimes following a script developed by the cia which post 1945 used remnants of bandera s upa to mount an insurgency against the soviet union a new narrative was constructed it portrayed the far right ukrainian nationalists as fighters for national liberation and victims of nazism and godless communism not fascists and accomplices in the holocaust canadian imperialism has used these ultra reactionary forces ever since in pursuit of its foreign and domestic policy objectives in turn they have come to wield significant political influence with state support far right ukrainian nationalists came to politically dominate canada s substantial ukrainian immigrant community hitherto largely identified with socialist and left wing politics they served as a bulwark of canada s cold war foreign policy stoking virulent hostility to the soviet union whilst promoting through a network of government supported ethnic cultural organizations an exclusivist nationalism that explicitly celebrated the nazis ukrainian fascist collaborators in the late 1980s and 1990s the ukrainian canadian far right forces incubated by canadian imperialism were redeployed first to push for capitalist restoration and the dissolution of the soviet union then to support harnessing independent ukraine to nato and the eu the ukrainian canadian congress ucc has long served as the nexus of the collaboration between the canadian state and far right ukrainian nationalists as the ucc s own website boasts it was a state sponsored organization from its very beginnings it was established in 1940 under the auspices of canada s war department as the ukrainian canadian committee ucc leaders enjoy ready access to the highest levels of government and leading ucc members frequently accompany prime ministers and other senior government officials on their visits to ukraine thus in 2016 when prime minister justin trudeau proclaimed in kiev that the canadian armed forces were training ukrainian security forces to make them more effective in reclaiming eastern ukraine and crimea paul grod the then ucc president was at his side the ucc unabashedly defends the actions of the waffen ss s galicia division it has proudly boasted for decades about the affiliation of various canadian galicia division veterans associations to the ucc however its promotion of far right ukrainian nationalism has focused on celebrating the oun b stepan bandera the fascist style führer who led it from its founding in 1940 until his death in 1959 and the oun founded and led upa noted ukrainian canadian historian john paul himka described the ucc in 2010 as keepers of the oun upa flame who have put the glorification of these radical right nationalists at the very center of the ukrainian national identity project more recently he told radio canada international a lot of the community organizations are headed by the bandera faction of the organization of ukrainian nationalists canada s deputy prime minister holding a fascist banner associated with the oun bandera the alliance between canadian imperialism and ukrainian fascism is most strikingly embodied in the person of chrystia freeland canada s deputy prime minister finance minister and chief architect of its feminist foreign policy freeland has been among the keenest advocates in western imperialist governments of all out economic war against russia and has led the push within the trudeau liberal government for ukraine to be supplied with heavy weaponry she is playing an active role in the internal politics of ukraine prevailing on zelensky in january not to jail his pro us predecessor the oligarch petro poroshenko at the same time she is serving as a high placed interlocutor between washington and its kiev clients according to freeland she speaks to ukraine s prime minister and finance minister daily in a 2015 article entitled putin s big lie freeland described herself as a proud member of the ukrainian canadian community she wrote my maternal grandparents fled western ukraine after hitler and stalin signed their non aggression pact in 1939 they never dared to go back but they stayed in close touch with their brothers and sisters and their families who remained behind for the rest of my grandparents lives they saw themselves as political exiles with a responsibility to keep alive the idea of an independent ukraine which had last existed briefly during and after the chaos of the 1917 russian revolution that dream persisted into the next generation and in some cases the generation after that this story one she has repeated often frequently with touching tributes to her grandfather and his role in schooling her in ukrainian culture and nationalism is a politically calculated false narrative in short a lie freeland s maternal grandfather mykhailo chomiak was an influential and handsomely rewarded nazi collaborator for five years from early 1940 through the first months of 1945 he edited the sole ukrainian language newspaper in nazi occupied poland krakivs ki visti krakow news lionized adolph hitler celebrated the nazi war of extermination against the soviet union incited hatred for jews and promoted the formation of the ukrainian or galicia division of the waffen ss it was printed on a press stolen from a jew who perished in a nazi death camp chomiak was a member of the oun m from which bandera and his supporters split in 1940 the oun m was even more willing to directly and slavishly serve the nazis than the oun b it did so through the ukrainian central committee utsk which was disguised as a social welfare organization to avoid the nazis ban on political organizations the leader of the utsk volodymyr kubijovych was the publisher of krakivs ki visti when the 14th grenadier division of the waffen ss the so called galicia division was established in early 1943 kubijovych was its first officially enrolled member after the war chomiak and kubijovych came to live on different continents but they maintained a lifelong correspondence about advancing the ukrainian nationalist cause their collaboration ended only with the death of freeland s grandfather in 1983 when freeland s political ancestry was exposed in 2017 she and the trudeau government curtly dismissed it as russian disinformation they were quickly joined by the entire political establishment and corporate media freeland with the complicity of the opposition conservatives and new democratic party brazenly refused to discuss the role of her beloved grandfather the globe and mail ottawa citizen national post and other prominent dailies published reports that conceded chomiak had edited a newspaper in nazi occupied poland however these accounts were part of a carefully curated release of information they downplayed and covered up krakivs ki visti s role in promoting support for the nazi war of extermination against the ussr and in inciting hatred toward jews as the nazis carried out the holocaust with the assistance of the ukrainian fascists it was even suggested that as lamentable as was krakivs ki visti s support for the nazi war in the east it had contributed to the preservation of ukrainian culture canada s corporate media had no interest in investigating freeland s political ancestry nor in placing it in a broader historical context none assigned a reporter or commissioned a historian to review the krakivs ki visti archive or to examine canada s role in providing a safe haven to tens of thousands of ukrainian nationalist nazi collaborators chomiak s world war ii editorial activities were universally portrayed as an historical anecdote totally irrelevant to contemporary events neither the media nor the political establishment could admit to let alone tolerate any serious investigation of the canadian state s longstanding patronage of the ukrainian far right to have done so would inevitably have shone light on the fascists in ukraine and their canadian ideological mentors and enablers on those with whom ottawa is now so closely cooperating in the nato war to protect ukrainian independence and democracy there is no shortage of relationships to explore from the us and canada s use of ukrainian fascists as shock troops in the 2014 coup to the canadian armed forces training of the fascists embedded in ukraine s armed forces and the state sponsored ucc s ideological and material promotion of the ukrainian far right and its exclusivist virulently anti communist nationalism freeland routinely associates herself with the legacy symbols and rituals of the world war ii ukrainian fascists in 2016 she concluded a keynote address to the ucc by leading its members in chanting the banderite salutation glory to ukraine glory to the heroes see video clip she has spoken before the league of ukrainian canadians which was founded by cadres of oun b and upa in 1949 and is devoted to this day to propagating far right ukrainian nationalism and cult like devotion to the fascist bandera just days after russia s invasion of ukraine freeland put her political colours on display marching in a save ukraine demonstration clutching the oun s red and black banner freeland s political ancestry and above all her fusion of liberalism with ukrainian fascism past and present have in no way impeded her political rise on the contrary her political stock has only risen further underscoring that canadian imperialism is more than ready to align with the most reactionary forces in pursuit of its predatory aims and ambitions a recent article in the ostensibly liberal toronto star titled freeland s crusade began in alberta declared her grandparents came to canada as refugees and now their granddaughter is a key figure in the fight to save their homeland that says a lot about freeland but it also says a lot about the kind of country canada aspires to be whether it s fate or coincidence we are fortunate to have someone so resolute and so knowledgeable in the right place at the right time neither fate nor coincidence has anything to do with it freeland s position as second in command of the canadian imperialist state and likely successor to justin trudeau as prime minister is the outcome of the decades long alliance between the canadian state and far right ukrainian nationalists the exposure of this collaboration before working people in canada and internationally is a critical element in the fight to build a global movement against imperialist war the ruling elites of the nato powers are relying on a vast propaganda campaign and ignorance of the historical issues involved to portray their predatory drive to carve up russia as a crusade for democracy and human rights documenting the historical record of their fascist ukrainian allies and the ultra reactionary traditions that they evoke and seek to revive will assist working people in cutting through this propaganda opposing nato aggression and taking up the fight against imperialist war and its source in the capitalist profit system this article s subsequent parts will examine the actions and ideology of the ukrainian fascist allies of hitler to whom canadian imperialism gave refuge after world war ii this will include a review of the pro nazi propaganda and anti semitic exhortations of krakivs ki visti and the political activities of its publishers as well as the record of bandera s oun b and upa the fourth part will document the support the canadian state gave the ukrainian fascists in covering up their participation in ethnic cleansing and genocide and in developing a large infrastructure of cultural and academic organizations dedicated to promoting far right ukrainian nationalism canadian imperialism s fascist friends will go on to discuss the role the far right forces incubated by canadian imperialism played in pressing for capitalist restoration in the soviet union and independent ukraine s transformation into a vassal of the western imperialist powers it will conclude with an exposure of how ottawa and the canadian armed forces worked with these far right forces in both canada and ukraine in preparing and instigating war with russia to be continued

against the continued increase in inflation it is now almost certain that rbi will raise rates in forthcoming june and august policy and will take it to pre pandemic level of 5 15 percent by august

how informative is the einstein quote about doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome vote labour get conservative in the 52 years since 1970 at 14 elections the scottish electorate voted for the party that formed the westminster government only five times two of them in 1974 thus as well as 2014 the decline in labour support may reflect a growing awareness of and refusal to thole a democratic deficit which meant that scotland must accept a government largely the will of another part of the uk which in most cases in the last 50 years scotland didn t vote for brexit has only accelerated this perception this undermines much of mr russell s argument is it a good idea to be the party of the whole of the mainland uk elections since then would seem to suggest not he repeats again that independence would mean an end to redistribution from the wealthy south east of england and london to scotland a situation professor mark blyth has compared to being on the dole some of us think scotland could do better lastly i would not dispute mr russell s view about the difficulties of converting what remains of the labour party in scotland to independence but does he not realise that such dogmatism itself is another of his party s problems alasdair galloway dumbarton better together led to collapse it was interesting to read peter a russell s explanation of where labour has gone wrong after the party s support nose dived in the 2014 referendum campaign mr russell doesn t mention labour campaigning alongside the tories as a factor but speaking to voters during and after that campaign i would suggest that was the straw which finally broke the camel s back mr russell suggests that labour suffered because it did not champion its own past achievements in scotland but the truth is that labour once a party to be proud of had rested on its laurels and taken scotland for granted for decades perhaps mr russell resides in a leafy glasgow suburb but the state of much of glasgow s housing stock was a disgrace and notorious for having the worst slums in europe crumbling damp riddled tenements resulting in pasty faced children with hacking coughs it should be remembered that it was johann lamont a former leader of labour in scotland who complained that scottish labour was treated as a branch office by the uk party however scotland stayed very loyal to labour over many years it was said that in some areas a dead cat would get elected if it was wearing a labour rosette last year at the holyrood elections labour suffered its worst result last week it managed to beat the tories but after all the tory sleaze boris johnson s partygate disgrace and the flip flopping douglas ross even the proverbial dead cat could have beaten the tories ruth marr stirling shaming the legacy of keir hardie peter a russell letters may 13 writes that labour was the only party whose usp was that it was the party of the whole of the mainland uk i think that the tories and libdems would beg to differ but that is beside the point the point of course is that it was hardly ever the party of government of the whole of the uk mr russell then goes on to give his insider s view on how to manipulate and manage a political party from the inside all excellent stuff for the edification of the political outsider like me but all he succeeds in is confirming to me the reasons i left the labour party in the first place as a passive member i had at last came to realise that the purpose of the labour party was the perpetuation of the labour party and its insiders in scotland he writes independence would mean an end to redistribution from the wealthy south east of england and london to scotland how s that for an inspiring political vision for a nation mr russell as so many unionists do is telling us that we are condemned to being a parasitic nation living off the wealth of its neighbour what vision what leadership how inspiring keir hardie will be birling in his grave john jamieson ayr we must retain our influence it is fair to say that the uk has been london centric for centuries this was the case even before the union of scotland and england when the king of scotland took on the role of king also of england he moved to london and visited scotland only once during the remaining 20 odd years of his reign during the ensuing centuries much of the known world became london centric and london remains today one of the most cosmopolitan and influential cities in the world and there is little doubt that decisions taken in westminster during the foreseeable and indefinite future will have the potential to have enormous effects in scotland and other places regardless of the outcome of our current constitutional debate it is therefore of utmost importance that we work out what is the best way for the people of scotland to influence these westminster decisions by retreating north of the border or by keeping our hands on the levers of power at westminster it seems obvious that the removal of the scottish electorate and its representatives from westminster can only reduce the account that will be taken of scottish interests in westminster decision making rather we might go forward with confidence in the scottish ability to influence these decisions michael sheridan glasgow call me an internationalist has there been a collective decision by uk union supporting commentators from memory taken place around a year ago that all references to the snp the independence movement the yes movement and the greens will henceforth be referred to as nationalists i support scottish independence yet on any objective test i score highly as an internationalist so does any person i ve ever met within any of the organisations above i am an independence supporter not a nationalist if anyone called me that to my face i d very quickly point out the error or at least ask them to define what they mean by it in my experience the term could more accurately be applied to the british unionists on the other side iain cope glasgow in case ronald oliver letters may 13 is considering patenting the phrase truth decay american troubadour rodney crowell beat him to it on track 4 of his superb 2007 cd sex and gasoline incidentally phil everly was on backing vocals davie fulton johnstone ditch this flawed school ethos it is reported that teachers at bannerman high school glasgow are threatening to go on strike over violent and disruptive pupil behaviour they have my sympathy they should refuse to tolerate routine abuse and violence from pupils taking strike action if necessary sadly the scottish educational establishment seems utterly incapable of addressing the issue of deteriorating behaviour the scottish government education scotland the general teaching council for scotland the teaching unions and unfortunately much of the teaching profession are in the thrall of restorative approaches under this utopian ideology punishment is deemed ineffective unnecessary and counter productive mini counselling sessions are all that is required to keep even the most recalcitrant miscreant in check as chaos engulfs one classroom after another as a direct result of this delusional project all that the experts can prescribe is more of the same teachers need to rebel against the idealistic strategies imposed from above by people who read about the latest educational fashions rather than teach children in the scottish parliament opposition parties willingly describe the problem but offer no solution vital and fundamental questions of educational philosophy are entirely neglected by a whole establishment marinated in a stifling mono culture attempts to open up discussions of foundational presuppositions are usually met with bemused incomprehension it s like speaking a foreign language we are sacrificing a generation on the altar of a flawed and failing ideology it s got to stop richard lucas leader scottish family party glasgow

confident in the fundamental strength of our business and our ability to execute on what we can control since last summer conversion of users to subscriptions and retention remain stable indicating that our business is in a steady state of growth not a deteriorating one giving us confidence that once macroeconomic conditions improve we will return to higher levels of growth as of today we expect total revenue in q2 22 to be 342 346 million representing 8 10 y y growth this range takes into account the negative impact of approximately 0 6 million due to the closure of our activities in russia and certain regions of ukraine and headwinds of approximately 4 million due to y y changes in fx rates excluding these we would have expected q2 22 revenue to grow 10 11 y y if we do not see further deterioration in the macro environment for the full year 2022 we believe revenue growth will be 10 13 y y this range includes the negative impact from suspending activities in russia and certain regions in ukraine which we estimate accounts for approximately 3 million in revenue in 2022 and approximately 20 million in headwinds due to y y changes in fx rates excluding these our expectation for revenue growth for the full year would be 12 15 y y assuming no further deterioration in the macro environment further despite macroeconomic headwinds we remain committed to driving profitable

new week begins on a negative note the friday relief across the us equities and which was put on the back of jerome powell saying that the bigger rate hikes are off the table for now couldn t prevent the dow jones extended losses for the seventh consecutive week the longest losing series streak since 2001 nasdaq fell near 3 and the s p500 ended last week near 2 5 lower at the cusp of the bear market datatrek estimates that the s p500 would need to fall to 3525 level to discount the 50 50 odds of recession and odds of recession are mounting goldman sach s blackfein said that the chances of recession in the us is getting very very high and goldman sachs cut its american growth forecast to 2 4 from 2 6 this year and from 2 2 to 1 6 for next year as a result the broad based recession talk is the major catalyzer this monday activity in us and european futures hint that friday s rebound was certainly nothing more than a dead cat bounce recession worries and soft energy prices will likely weigh on the ftse index despite a relatively cheap sterling russia is not happy in the energy markets the barrel of us crude trades below the 110 mark on recession worries but the mounting geopolitical tensions in europe will certainly limit the selloff finland and sweden who have been neutral so far are now willing to join nato plus germany decides to cut the russian gas to the end of the year if the russians don t turn off the tap before that and the eu is expected to reveal its latest plan about how to reduce its energy dependence all this to say that the geopolitical tensions will likely keep the oil bulls alert but clearly not as aggressive as a couple of weeks ago as the recession worries now loom and weigh on the energy rally still ishares diversified commodity index rebounded fast since its dip last week as the narrow supply will continue playing in favour of higher commodity prices in the coming months china could be a gamechanger for the recession worries if the government decided to stop its unnecessarily costly covid zero policy one good news is that shanghai people now see the light at the end of the tunnel as the lockdown measures could finally be lifted by the end of this month if there are no new cases detected but the risk of similar measures in other big cities including beijing are omnipresent the chinese central bank cut the interest rates for new mortgages to boost the housing market and the slowing growth let s hope the chinese stimulus does a better impact than the rest of its economic and public health policies bitcoin shrugs off the terra stress bitcoin and ethereum shrugged off the stress of the terra dollar s collapse last week and stabilized above the 30k and the 2000 respectively over the weekend the consolidation means that the trust in major cryptocurrencies hasn t been damaged by the terra incident yet it s likely that investors would become pickier when choosing a token to invest in as the terra s collapse showed that the cryptocurrencies no matter how popular they are are not risk free moving forward the major cryptocurrencies will likely benefit from the protection of a strong support this could lead to a divergence within the industry and maybe some sector wide safe haven flows toward bitcoin and ethereum however bitcoin is still far from becoming a haven asset in proper terms and it will certainly continue trading parallel to risky assets therefore if we see the equity meltdown extend this week we could well see bitcoin slip and consolidate around the 25k tested last week

dominance of a market powering exponential growth lithography based machines used by the world s leading chip manufacturers we believe asml has one of the strongest technological competitive advantages of any company in europe alistair wittet comgest growth europe asml is a business that revels in its obscurity it cheerfully describes itself as the most important tech company you ve never heard of perhaps it s true that this netherlands based business operates away from the gaze of most consumers but its tech wizardry underpins just about every aspect of our lives in a digital age from mobile phones and notebook computers to artificial intelligence autonomous cars and the cloud what makes the company and the semiconductor manufacturers it supplies all the more interesting however is that they are all still largely conforming to a prediction made nearly 60 years ago about the exponential growth of computing power by the american businessman and engineer who co founded intel corporation one gordon moore more moore s law in 1965 when he was director of research and development at fairchild semiconductor gordon moore shared his observations about the growth of the semiconductor industry in an article for a magazine his principle later revised and modified was essentially that the number of transistors that can be crammed onto any given microchip can be expected to double roughly every two years moore also observed that even though this would radically increase a computer s processing power the cost of the hardware would progressively fall the implicit principle in moore s thinking that the size and cost of computing devices would shrink almost in inverse proportion to their capabilities has been the guiding principle for semiconductor manufacturers ever since it has been the framework for their growth strategies and the backdrop to their r d budgets the consensus among many experts is that the point will come probably during this decade when moore s law runs out of steam asml is not convinced however arguing that developments such as changes in the composition of transistors or combining several chips into one mean there is plenty of time left for the theory to still hold true asml s history asml was established in 1984 as a joint venture between the electronics giant philips and a microchip manufacturer called advanced semiconductor materials international initially called asm lithography and working from a small office in eindhoven the company started to develop machines that could be used to make microchips smaller cheaper and more breathtakingly fast with each iteration its techniques are now so successful that asml s products are used by many of the world s leading chip manufacturers including intel taiwan semiconductor and samsung electronics the company which went public in 1995 is listed on the amsterdam arm of the euronext stock exchange and on nasdaq in the us with a market value of just under 250bn 213bn lithography the basics asml s core products are central to the ability of semiconductor manufacturers to cover their microchips with increasingly complex patterns of transistors in essence lithography involves projecting light through a blueprint of the pattern that will be imprinted on to the chip only much larger the company s systems take the encoded pattern shrink it and then copy it onto the photosensitive silicon wafer that forms the basis of each individual chip this process is repeated multiple times with the chip being moved slightly with each imprint asml has different systems for the various layers in a microchip asml dominates this market taking about four fifths of global lithography machines sales canon and eikon are competitors however the market itself is concentrated among relatively few manufacturers that means asml s sales are poorly diversified geographically and by customers which is a key business risk asml s top 10 relationships company relationship intel

asml s core investment proposition is built around its leadership in a market that is still exponentially growing in terms of our fix the future megatrends that puts it at the core of technological change and specifically digital infrastructure literally powering the global digital economy worldwide sales of semiconductor chips totalled 555 9bn 455bn last year according to the semiconductor industry association and analysts estimate that this figure will double by around 2030 the company s systems help to make every sort of semiconductor from the high end logic processors and memory chips that facilitate artificial intelligence machine autonomy and industrial scale data storage to the ultra low cost kit in mobile phones and tablets that enable them to control the central heating system or arrange to restock the fridge asml generated net sales of 18 6bn in 2021 which it estimates could increase to between 24bn and 30bn in 2025 the company reckons that its gross profit margin of 52 7 last year could rise to between 54 and 56 by the same time the group s shares are also bolstered by asml s strategy of returning cash to investors by buying back its shares in the open market the company bought back a chunky 17 16bn of shares last year and aims to use the scheme to return a further 9bn to investors by the end of 2023 asml s high conviction backers source citywire morningstar latest disclosed holdings data roadblocks there are some big bumps in the road though surging demand has led to a global shortage in the supply of microchips a problem that has been exacerbated by disruptions to what is a complex supply chain leading to manufacturers the world s chip makers are investing billions in new production facilities putting the pressure on suppliers such as asml to invest as well in order to keep pace asml has not disclosed a precise figure for the size of its planned investment but it says that its efforts to increase capacity are ongoing and include building new facilities and hiring thousands of additional staff it recruited 5 000 extra people in 2021 alone ultimately of course higher demand is good news for the company however it will increase its annual costs furthermore the war in ukraine has potentially enormous implications for neon a rare gas that is used in the lithography based chip making process ukraine is a key supplier of the gas a byproduct of the russian steel industry accounting for between 45 and 54 of the world s total neon output according to calculations by reuters asml says that it has been gradually reducing its reliance on ukraine as a source of neon and now buys less than 20 of its requirements from the country however it should still feel the effect if prices continue to rise elite manager holders asml is a conviction holding for the comgest growth europe fund which first began researching the company in 2009 and has held a substantial position for the past four years alistair wittet portfolio manager of the fund highlights both the long term structural growth of the semiconductor industry and asml s competitive advantage within it we believe asml has one of the strongest technological competitive advantages of any company in europe the company employs more than 12 000 engineers in research and development working on solving a range of extremely demanding engineering puzzles he says it has spent many billions of dollars over multiple decades working on these challenges and has collaborated closely with other specialised european technological leaders such as carl zeiss ag to overcome key challenges in developing the extremely advanced optics system used by lithography machines decades of strong decision making and focused r d investments have enabled the company to attain the unique and enviable monopoly position it enjoys today the company has also taken greater control of the production of the precise scientific measuring systems used in its technology and in our opinion this will make it even more difficult for challenger companies to achieve a comparable performance to asml s lithography machines kate fox an investment manager for the baillie gifford positive change fund similarly highlights the company s technological prowess but further argues that it is helping to democratise access to new and life changing technologies companies such as asml and tsmc have played a crucial but seldom recognised or lauded role in reaching the milestone of over half of the global population being connected to the internet semiconductors made by tsmc using asml s equipment have enabled the rollout of network infrastructure 2g 3g 4g and now 5g networks across the globe and price deflation in mobile devices fox says connectivity has many benefits crucially it enables greater access to information that can expand knowledge and aid decision making it provides access to vital tools and services such as an ability to make safe payments and means of transferring money and it brings sellers and buyers together connectivity can enable inclusivity and productivity making it an incredibly powerful tool in addressing poverty she adds that semiconductors are enabling the energy transition and electrification as well as facilitating massive change in healthcare where genetics data and machine learning are improving society s understanding of biology and the development of new diagnostic tools while it may be true that many investors are unfamiliar with asml it s a similar certainty that all of them will have benefited in some way from what it does

bruce kreitler while this probably isn t much of a surprise to anybody there are a lot of shortages of things that we used to be able to dependably buy whenever we wanted them and not only are things in short supply very often actually most of the time the price has gone up for instance some of the chemicals that i use have nearly doubled in price oddly one chemical that i use and it s definitely one of the more expensive ones actually has come down in price i m sure that s a mistake that the manufacturer and or distributer will correct soon enough one of the things that is in short supply or let s just say not available as easily as normal is plants and while this is true somewhat across the board for all plants i m mostly interested in trees on a side note though perennials and trees are harder to get because they take longer to grow to any size and a lot of them were wiped out even at the growers and distributors not just in peoples yards oddly enough while annual color plants can be re grown rather quickly there has been a huge demand for them that keeps them a little hard to get in other words plant shortages all around even in the things that can be grown quickly getting back to trees one of the things that i m not doing is selling planting trees this year the reason is because the supply has become so erratic and prices on them change so fast i can t keep up what i ve been doing is sending my customers who want trees to nurseries because they are much closer to the suppliers and can do a much better job of getting the trees that someone wants and give them a firm price mostly this ability is because they have trees in stock and have frequent discussions about what is and isn t available with their suppliers when i first started planting trees for people if someone wanted a large tree in their yard i could simply get with them about what kind they wanted and what size then i could just order and plant it for them that s not how it goes today by any stretch of the imagination in fact i know of some growers that even last year or maybe considering what happened because of last years cold weather event started cutting off the people who had only dealt with them on small orders or infrequent ones more bruce kreitler beware sloughing bark s bite more bruce kreitler stressed trees need a little extra tlc more bruce kreitler don t go up the wrong tree when meeting pets this didn t happen to me and i also have to add that i don t think the companies who did this were being greedy or doing it out of any ill will it s just that they knew they were going to have a limited ability to supply customers and they were going to have to concentrate on the ones who helped them stay in business keep in mind that what was lost at growers suppliers and nurseries was a huge economic loss for those businesses one of the things that i was hoping would develop out of the tree shortages i have described is that in the constant search for more plants some of the old varieties of trees that don t get planted much these days but are good trees would start showing up that has happened a little bit but so far not too much oh well we are going to have years of these shortages ahead of us at least for trees so maybe i will start seeing some silver poplars chitalpas catalpas or arizona cypresses poking out of the ground here and there

tooth cmt disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited severe debilitating progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies cmt1a the most common type of cmt is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1 5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in europe and the u s and about 1 500 000 people worldwide the genetic mutation responsible for cmt1a is a duplication of the pmp22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein the duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the pmp22 protein and failure of schwann cells to produce normal myelin neuronal sheath the lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss as a result of peripheral nerve degradation patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning they might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders first symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life patients with the most severe form of cmt1a end up in wheelchairs representing at least 5 of cases to date no curative or symptomatic

a painting by andy warhol sold for a final price of 195 million last week breaking the auction record for an american artist and for any 20th century art work at a sale for charity at christie s in new york four bidders competed for shot sage blue marilyn 1964 after less than four minutes of bidding the painting was sold to art dealer and gallerist larry gagosian it is unclear whether he bought the painting for himself or on behalf of a client according to forbes gagosian s super rich clientele includes billionaire mega collectors such as david geffen leon black steve cohen and leonard lauder the previous auction record for an american artist was set only five years ago in 2017 a painting of a skull by jean michel basquiat a friend and collaborator of warhol sold for 110 5 million at an auction at sotheby s the price of shot sage blue marilyn was almost double the previous auction high price for a warhol work double disaster 1963 one of his car crash paintings was sold for 105 4 million in 2013 in fact shot sage blue marilyn has become one of the most expensive artworks ever sold at auction its price surpassed that of pablo picasso s les femmes d alger version o which sheikh hamad bin jassim bin jaber al thani of qatar bought for 179 million in 2015 this series of rising prices and broken auction records reminds us that the world of fine art which is part of the cultural heritage of mankind is dominated by a tiny extraordinarily wealthy elite for this layer works of art are not aesthetic objects but investments and tokens of prestige the warhol sale took place at the beginning of a spring auction season once again being held in person the ongoing pandemic is of no importance the focus of the participants is the potential profit to be made there s been a huge amount held back for two years and there s a huge amount of pent up demand from new clients art adviser philip hoffman told the new york times everyone was waiting for the right moment and the right moment has come the way that auctioneers gallerists and collectors talk about the artwork is revealing we did sell the most expensive painting of the 20th century alex rotter of christie s told the times this is a big achievement one imagines him licking his lips the top of the market is still strong and there is a lot of demand for quality art dealer bill acquavella told the times look what real estate is selling for there are other assets that are bringing prices that you haven t seen before within the greater market for trophy art the figure of 200 million is very much in keeping with prices realized in the private dealer market for quite a few years art appraiser david shapiro told artnews in fact some had speculated that shot sage blue marilyn would bring in as much as 400 million and were disappointed in its final price it was an incredibly healthy price but at the same time i believe the buyer got a deal art adviser abigail asher told the times in the death of the artist how creators are struggling to survive in the age of billionaires and big tech 2020 author william deresiewicz noted that a 2009 study revealed a direct correlation between the run up in prices and the growing concentration of wealth consistent with the behavior of markets in other luxury goods like high end real estate a one percentage point increase in the share of total income earned by the top 0 1 percent the researchers discovered triggers an increase in art prices of about 14 percent the new money is hedge fund money oligarch money asian billionaire money more than half of the global art market by aggregate value consists of sales of 1 million or more art collecting at that level is an affair of ultra high net worth individuals people with liquid assets of 30 million or more though one insider told me that the bar is more like 250 million that the largest sum ever paid for a piece of 20th century art was spent on a trivial empty work is not unimportant or coincidental shot sage blue marilyn is a 40 inch by 40 inch silk screened painting of iconic actress marilyn monroe the well known image is based on a promotional photo for the movie niagara 1953 in which monroe starred alongside joseph cotten the work is one of five marilyn paintings that warhol executed in 1964 almost two years after monroe herself had died by probable suicide it is likely that warhol chose his subject not only for her glamor but also for the scandal surrounding her death the painting s title reflects what happened to the work after warhol had completed it in 1964 a woman named dorothy podber walked into warhol s studio which he dubbed the factory and shot at a stack of marilyn paintings sources differ on the questions of whether warhol had invited her to do so and whether he believed podber intended to shoot photographs of the paintings this legend reflects the anarchy that prevailed at the factory as well as warhol s own penchant for sensation the silk screening technique which warhol borrowed from commercial art removes any trace of the artist s hand from the painting nor does the work convey any critical or in depth analysis of its subject in his most prominent work warhol borrows from advertising and tabloid celebrity journalism passing on reality as it immediately appears in those debased realms with this passivity warhol implicitly denies any significant role for the artist as we argued in 2019 warhol did not encourage us to develop ourselves or build a better world his is the art of the voyeur or at worst the self promoter he reinforced and actively participated in the cult of celebrity in uncritically bringing the banality of popular culture into the world of fine art he relinquished all that is most vital and nourishing in art for the artist as well as for his audience the imaginative reinterpretation of reality that element apparently appeals to art collectors with hundreds of millions of dollars to spend in the 1980s gagosian began amassing the enormous wealth with which he bought shot sage blue marilyn by reselling works by well established and highly regarded modern artists like the stock traders who were rising to economic dominance during the same period gagosian appropriated profits for himself without creating anything of value little wonder that gagosian or whichever moneyed client on whose behalf he acted would invest in a blue chip celebrity artist like warhol the artist s reputation is international and largely unquestioned for the social layer that gagosian represents the name warhol has a significance like that of cartier or hermès the orgy of wealth in the art market must encourage demoralization and cynicism among artists on the one hand and intense outrage on the other the way forward in art can only take in direct opposition to the concentration of fabulous riches that leads to the cultural impoverishment of society

immunotherapy by harnessing the power of the immune system to tackle cancer and inflammation today announces that both the u s food and drug administration fda and finnish medicines agency fimea have cleared faron s investigational new drug ind application to begin the company sponsored bexmab study bexmab is a novel phase i ii study to assess safety tolerability and preliminary efficacy of bexmarilimab faron s wholly owned investigational precision cancer immunotherapy in combination with standard of care soc therapy in patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia aml myelodysplastic syndrome mds or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cml this marks the first time bexmarilimab will be assessed as part of a clinical study in hematologic malignancies we are pleased that our ind application was cleared to proceed and we can further explore the strong scientific rationale for combining bexmarilimab and azacitidine said marie louise fjällskog m d ph d chief medical officer of faron research has shown a clear survival benefit among certain blood cancer patients with low clever 1 expression a receptor known to be expressed on immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment by adding bexmarilimab to standard of care we expect to downregulate clever 1 expression thereby increasing antigen presentation and allowing the immune system to better identify and kill cancer cells the primary objective of the bexmab study is to determine the safety and tolerability of bexmarilimab in combination with soc treatment and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose secondary objectives include characterizing the pharmacokinetic profile of bexmarilimab in combination with soc treatment azacitidine and to assess the immunogenicity of bexmarilimab based on initial safety data there is potential for phase ii expansion and to include a first line triplet therapy of bexmarilimab azacitidine and venetoclax in newly diagnosed aml patients who are not able to tolerate chemotherapy patient recruitment is expected to begin in the coming weeks we know from pre clinical research some of which was presented recently at eha that certain blood cancer cells especially with myeloid background carry significant amounts of cell surface clever 1 said dr markku jalkanen chief executive officer of faron this corresponds with the presence of considerable amounts of soluble clever 1 which limits t cell activation leading to a possible systemic loss of immune capacity directly targeting clever 1 could ignite the immune system limit the replication capacity of cancer cells and allow current chemotherapy treatments to be more effective in addition to the bexmab study focused on hematologic malignancies faron is also investigating bexmarilimab in solid tumors the ongoing phase i ii matins clinical trial is assessing bexmarilimab as a potential monotherapy in late stage heavily pre treated patients across multiple tumor types additionally the company expects to initiate a trial assessing the safety and tolerability of bexmarilimab in combination with an approved anti pd 1 molecule in multiple solid tumors later this year for more

associated macrophages tams in the tumour microenvironment converting these highly immunosuppressive m2 macrophages to immune stimulating m1 macrophages in mouse models bexmarilimab has successfully blocked or silenced clever 1 activating antigen presentation and promoting interferon gamma secretion by leukocytes additional pre clinical studies have proven that clever 1 encoded by the stabilin 1 or stab 1 gene is a major source of t cell exhaustion and involved in cancer growth and spread observations from clinical studies to date indicate that clever 1 has the capacity to control t cell

since the beginning of march china has confronted the highly contagious omicron variant of the sars cov 2 virus brought into the country from outside with a high degree of social mobilization and considerable difficulty but so far with considerable success that has not stopped the american corporate press from repeatedly and severely denouncing china s zero covid policy condemnations that rise in vitriol in proportion to china s progress in beating back the tide of infections line up for mass covid testing in shanghai a year ago before the abandonment of the zero covid policy in this regard the recent new york times report by the newspaper s shanghai bureau chief alexandra stevenson who reports on the news of the financial world is particularly foul headlined the world tried to move beyond covid china may stand in the way it caters to the prejudices of a deranged reactionary upper middle class layer who have staked their fortunes on ever rising financial markets stevenson opens with a provocative statement as the rest of the world learns to live with covid 19 china s top leader xi jinping wants his country to keep striving to live without it no matter the cost before addressing the various assertions the times article makes it bears reviewing the present state of the pandemic in china the current wave of infections across mainland china began in early march since then china has documented close to three quarter million cases of which a significant majority were asymptomatic because of broad public health measures that included lockdowns and business closures dynamic mass testing and redirection of resources to build isolation centers and bolster medical treatment facilities deaths were kept to less than 600 essentially all occurring in shanghai except two in the northeast province of jilin by comparison over the same period the us reported 90 000 deaths from covid the chinese health authorities reported that there were 1 789 covid cases on sunday of which 71 were newly imported after reaching a peak of almost 27 000 in mid april the number of cases in shanghai china s financial hub and the epicenter of the omicron wave had dropped to 1 369 of which 166 were symptomatic the seven day average has fallen below 3 000 daily cases down more than 90 percent from its peak four weeks ago outside of shanghai only 349 new cases were registered across mainland china already many shanghai based companies are resuming operations city officials are targeting mid may for opening after achieving zero covid community transmission more than 99 percent of all new cases are currently among those under lockdown or quarantine accounting for 2 million of the city s 26 million inhabitants nearly 18 million residents 70 percent are in designated precautionary areas including communities villages companies and other sites without a positive case for more than two weeks the elimination strategy appears promising despite repeated claims in the corporate media that omicron can t be eliminated deaths have been kept to the lowest possible level life has been preserved and the country is transitioning to reopening its production and distribution centers given this premise stevenson should be asked what she means by china s intent to live without covid no matter the cost the cost for who obviously she cares only about the financial cost for western investors not the cost in human lives for the chinese people the day before stevenson s report appeared in the times president joe biden acknowledged in a perfunctory prerecorded statement using only 213 words that over 1 million americans have died from covid this is the same president who said as a candidate in october 2020 that a president like trump who had allowed more than 200 000 deaths from covid should be considered disqualified from office under biden s tenure in the white house more than 600 000 have lost their lives to the pandemic stevenson made no mention of this as part of the cost of living with covid nor does she acknowledge that the times has played a central role in promoting the herd immunity policy that has morphed over the last two years into living with the virus as the ruling classes in the imperialist countries have repeatedly prioritized profits over lives allowing the pandemic to run wild rather than impose temporary lockdowns on business operations that have been proven effective in halting the spread of the virus this let it rip policy has led to the deaths of more than 20 million people globally pushed hundreds of millions into poverty and forced billions to face the manifold health consequences of chronic infections with a virus that will reinfect populations again and again thomas friedman pioneered the phrase the cure can t be worse than the disease in a times column published march 23 2020 which asserted that measures such as lockdowns and school closures to block the spread of the sars cov 2 virus were off limits because they would destroy the economy this slogan was picked up by the trump administration and the media because it served the interests of finance capital now it serves as the basis of the policy of the biden administration stevenson is duplicitous when she writes for more than two years china kept its covid numbers enviably low by doggedly reacting to signs of an outbreak with testing and snap lockdowns the success allowed the communist party to boast that it had prioritized life over death in the pandemic unlike western democracies where deaths from the virus soared first the issue of prioritization isn t life vs death stevenson conceals the real issue it s life vs profits and if western democracies were envious of china s low covid numbers then why didn t they emulate the lessons of chinese public health experiences and save the lives of their populations finally it is a basic tenet of well established public health policies going back to the 19th century to insist on doggedly chasing every infection to prevent mass outbreaks this is not a specifically chinese doctrine and has nothing to do with the stalinist politics of the chinese communist party instead of dealing with these facts however stevenson first depicts the lockdowns as harrowing and anti democratic and then cites the observation of an unnamed economist that the policy is zero movement zero gdp the realities are otherwise however china s economy remains intact its per capita death rate of four per million from covid versus the us with 3 068 deaths per million has shown the superiority of the zero covid strategy stevenson s no matter the cost is only a more obscene version of the formula proposed by friedman openly declaring that when human life clashes with corporate profit profit must win out it is telling that the one prominent health official whom she cites as part of her anti china diatribe against zero covid is the world health organization s who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus he said last tuesday we have discussed this issue with chinese experts and we indicated that the approach would not be sustainable and considering the behavior of the virus i think a shift would be very important the who director s comment is a reactionary statement refuting his previous statements that the world should fight to save every life possible this is the same organization that for two years resisted accepting the scientific evidence that the virus was airborne rather than carried in large droplets the comment only betrays objectively the subordination of all public health measures to the interests of international corporations like the us centers for disease control and prevention the un health agency has been transformed into an appendage of global finance capital stevenson does cite an important study published in nature from fudan university in shanghai which found that if omicron were allowed free rein in china in six months the country could expect 112 million symptomatic cases 5 1 million hospital admissions 2 7 million icu admissions and 1 6 million deaths as well as the catastrophic collapse of its health system the clear import of this study is that unleashing covid in china would be a colossal catastrophe not only for china but for the world since 100 million more cases means 100 million more opportunities for the virus to mutate into even deadlier and more infectious variants but stevenson ignores this in favor of her obsession with financial rather than human cost she proceeds to write investors and business leaders worry that china s rigid adherence to its zero covid policy could send the economy into free fall it is high time for the government to change its strategy said fred hu a prominent chinese investor the benefits of zero covid no longer outweigh the economic costs he added sticking to the zero covid strategy would decimate its economy and undermine public confidence in support of this concern stevenson writes by one estimate nearly 400 million people in 45 cities have been under some form of lockdown in china in the past month accounting for 7 2 trillion in annual gross domestic product this is a number created in the spirit of mark twain s aphorism against lies damn lies and statistics china s lockdown procedures are highly segmented with cities broken up into small districts each with rules enforced by local committees if one district in a city of 10 million is under lockdown generally because of a single positive test then the entire 10 million is counted in the estimate prepared by nomura bank hence the slippery phrase employed by stevenson some form of lockdown the times writer also ignores a salient fact that entirely refutes her portrayal of the zero covid policy as repressive and undemocratic it is widely popular among the chinese people something that is generally acknowledged even in hostile media reports americans living in china have praised this policy including one who commented on stevenson s article sean who is now working from home in shanghai writes as an american living in china i click on every article regarding china and many many are like this taking perverse delight in putative failure of china s zero covid policy this is unseemly but also factually delusional the usa has nearly 3 000 deaths per million from covid china has 3 china s economy has not gone into recession china s gross domestic product gdp exceeded 114 trillion yuan about 18 1 trillion in 2021 registering an increase of 8 1 percent over the previous year and an average growth of 5 1 percent over the preceding two years he concludes there is so much ideologically motivated disinformation in western media it s infuriating to someone who lives here sean s post attracted more than 100 favorable responses in the comment section following stevenson s article becoming the second highest rated by readers rather than deal with this dose of reality the times evidently prefers to suppress it engaging in its own form of political censorship no less noxious than the stalinist variety sean s comment praising the zero covid policy has now been deleted
