mr martín eurnekian ceo of corporación américa airports noted we are very proud of the way the company has navigated the unprecedented crisis over the past year showing an ability to be both prudent and agile as we moved into a second wave of covid 19 in latin america during the first quarter which resulted in travel restrictions and lower demand that negatively impacted passenger traffic in some of our countries of operations we were better positioned to mitigate the effects of the crisis our sustained focus on cost controls and cash preservation allowed us to achieve positive comparable adjusted ebitda of 14 million in 1q21 excluding one time fees despite passenger traffic levels of nearly a third of pre pandemic levels in the same quarter of 2019 since the onset of the pandemic we have made significant progress in the successful execution of our covid 19 mitigation strategic plan and remain dedicated to continue the consistent execution of this plan one of our key goals this year is to restore the value of our business by finalizing the re equilibrium processes following the successful 10 year concession extension in argentina and full economic re equilibrium for 2020 in brazil we also remain focused on preserving liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet while keeping a lean structure across our operations and maintaining tight control on costs as the level of activity progressively increases in terms of passenger traffic dynamics we are observing a pick up in traffic in brazil armenia and ecuador primarily driven by a faster pace in the roll out of the vaccination program and better sanitary conditions italy is also expected to benefit from the rollout of the vaccination campaign warmer weather and lower restrictions during the european summer season we also expect overall better trends as vaccination campaigns begin to pick up in argentina and travel restrictions are progressively lifted later in the year in both uruguay and argentina longer term we are convinced the desire to travel will resume and strong pent up demand will contribute to drive sustained traffic growth in closing we are confident in the potential of our business and we continue working towards building a leaner and stronger company that will allow us to deliver profitable growth once demand returns operating financial highlights in millions of u s dollars

detail page 23 of this report definitions and concepts commercial revenues caap derives commercial revenue principally from fees resulting from warehouse usage which includes cargo storage stowage and warehouse services and related international cargo services services and retail stores duty free shops car parking facilities catering hangar services food and beverage services retail stores including royalties collected from retailers revenue and rent of space advertising fuel airport counters vip lounges and fees collected from other miscellaneous sources such as telecommunications car rentals and passenger services construction service revenue and cost investments related to improvements and upgrades to be performed in connection with concession agreements are treated under the intangible asset model established by ifric 12 as a result all expenditures associated with investments required by the concession agreements are treated as revenue generating activities given that they ultimately provide future benefits and subsequent improvements and upgrades made to the concession are recognized as intangible assets based on the principles of ifric 12 the revenue and expense are recognized as profit or loss when the expenditures are performed the cost for such additions and improvements to concession assets is based on actual costs incurred by caap in the execution of the additions or improvements considering the investment requirements in the concession agreements through bidding processes the company contracts third parties to carry out such construction or improvement services the amount of revenues for these services is equal to the amount of costs incurred plus a reasonable margin which is estimated at an average of 3 0 to 5 0 about corporación

their trucks usually from auctions or individuals seeking to rehome or sell their horse and they often misrepresent their true intentions the horses are then often transported for over 24 hours

zynlonta is a cd19 directed antibody drug conjugate adc once bound to a cd19 expressing cell zynlonta is internalized by the cell where enzymes release a pyrrolobenzodiazepine pbd payload the potent payload binds to dna minor groove with little distortion remaining less visible to dna repair mechanisms this ultimately results in cell cycle arrest and tumor cell death the u s food and drug administration fda has approved zynlonta loncastuximab tesirine lpyl for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory r r large b cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl not otherwise specified nos dlbcl arising from low grade lymphoma and also high grade b cell lymphoma this indication is approved by the fda under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial the fda approval was based on data from lotis 2 a large n 145 phase 2 multinational single arm clinical trial of zynlonta for the treatment of adult patients with r r dlbcl following two or more prior lines of systemic therapy the trial included a broad spectrum of heavily pre treated patients median three prior lines of therapy with very difficult to treat disease including patients with high grade b cell lymphoma the trial also enrolled patients who did not respond to first line therapy patients refractory to all prior lines of therapy and patients who had stem cell transplants and car t therapy prior to their treatment with zynlonta results from the trial demonstrated an overall response rate orr of 48 3 70 145 patients which included a complete response cr rate of 24 1 35 145 patients and a partial response pr rate of 24 1 35 145 patients patients had a median time to response of 1 3 months at the most recent data cut off for patients enrolled in the trial the median duration of response

cami camidanlumab tesirine cami formerly adct 301 is an antibody drug conjugate adc comprised of a monoclonal antibody that binds to cd25 humax tac licensed from genmab a s conjugated to the pyrrolobenzodiazepine pbd dimer payload tesirine once bound to a cd25 expressing cell cami is internalized into the cell where enzymes release the pbd based payload killing the cell this applies to cd25 expressing tumor cells and also to cd25 expressing tregs the intra tumoral release of its pbd payload may also cause bystander killing of neighboring tumor cells and pbds have also been shown to induce immunogenic cell death all of these properties of cami may enhance immune mediated anti tumor activity cami is being evaluated in a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or

wednesday had the look of a tipsy market trying to sober up from a crash of as much as 31 per cent in bitcoin and even worse declines in other cryptocurrencies to deep losses in so called meme stocks like amc entertainment holdings inc and gamestop corp the fervor for risk taking that has defined 2021 took a major stumble some of these assets were able to bounce back up and keep on carrying on bitcoin cut its plunge to less than 10 per cent by the end of the day for example yet there are plenty of hangovers to go around to put it more kindly michael shaoul of marketfield asset management uses the acronym hope for some of the stocks that have face planted that s short for highly optimistic projected earnings as the recovery in the economy continues to boost more cyclical stocks at the expense of speculative growth companies he says it creates potential for more waves of panic like this to roil markets the recent broader embrace of cryptocurrencies by traditional investors only compounds the issue three years ago when bitcoin blew up it really didn t matter shaoul said in an interview on bloomberg television but right now there is real institutional money and some real wealth management money in bitcoin and of course there s a significant amount of market cap the carnage was widespread across cryptocurrencies a slump partly attributed to china reiterating that their use in transactions is forbidden in that country and partly attributed to a lingering reaction to elon musk s about face last week on accepting bitcoin as payment for cars made by tesla inc while dip buyers spared bitcoin from its worst day of the year other coins suffered major losses tokens including litecoin and dash remained mired in a downturn that saw each lose more than 30 per cent while ether the second largest crypto shed roughly a quarter of its value the joke coin doge which took the internet by storm in recent weeks following a red hot rally lost more than 20 per cent to trade around us 0 36 according to coinmarketcap com that s down from a high above us 0 70 notched earlier this month yet the apparent role that bitcoin s plunge played in creating broader market wide volatility is an alarming sign considering the notorious volatility of the virtual currency the result on wednesday was a deterioration in overall financial conditions as tracked by a bloomberg index that measures the state of everything from equities to credit yields and money markets according to medley global advisors macro strategist ben emons that s due in part to bitcoin s growing reputation as the boomer coin he wrote in other words it s the one being embraced the most by the older members of the financial industry and a growing list of chief executive officers in the corporate world shares of companies that have at least dipped a toe into the bitcoin waters paypal holdings inc square inc microstrategy inc and tesla all followed the cryptocurrency lower during the day before recovering at least partially cathie wood s ark innovation etf fell as much as 4 5 per cent before recouping more than half of the loss while canada s purpose bitcoin etf sank as much as 22 per cent before ending the session 9 per cent lower it shows that companies with direct ties to bitcoin can attribute for a large extent to an equity selloff emons said by the end of the day the closing prints on the stock market tape belied the drama that began shaking the financial world before the sun even rose over new york the s p 500 finished the session down 0 3 per cent paring a drop of more than 1 6 per cent the nasdaq 100 index managed to finish 0 2 per cent higher after plunging 1 7 per cent the cboe volatility index was up less than 1 to 22 18 the renaissance ipo etf which had sank as much as 3 8 per cent closed down only 0 3 per cent and the ipox spac index of special purpose acquisition companies lost less than 0 4 per cent yet lingering quietly among all of the volatility wednesday was a market that s been notorious for shaking things up since long before bitcoin came on the scene u s treasuries yields on the 10 year note climbed four basis points to almost 1 68 per cent on wednesday keeping the specter of higher interest rates alive and well as a risk to stocks at the start of the year my two biggest worries were notably higher yields and a bubble bursting in tech shares jim reid a strategist at deutsche bank wrote in a note as we get closer to mid year yields are indeed a lot higher across the globe and tech is deflating from its february peaks

noticed the world is stressful at the moment to sup some chilled champagne and let the strains of the world melt away the idea is incredibly appealing that said for most of us a fixed hot tub is

as compared to the 300 800 price tag for an inflatable one most search inquiries for inflatable hot tubs look for information on lay z spa hot tubs specifically as the brand has a reputation for providing high performing hot tubs at affordable prices they re also the brand of hot tub we ve seriously impressed with tempted here s what to know ahead of purchasing an inflatable hot tub what is an inflatable hot tub as you d imagine an inflatable hot tub is one you blow up with air most are smaller than traditional hot tubs though you can get 8 seaters which are quite large pre formed they have all the required jets the number of which depends on the model you buy and waterways which are connected to a unit housing a heater and a pump instead of being permanently plumbed into the mains you fill a hot tub from a hose instead once filled a hot tub will take between 8 12 hours to heat up depending on size the heater can keep it warm year round once turned on though although this will incur power costs for usage what do you need at home to make it work any inflatable hot tub will come with a pump that circulates the water as well as a heater to heat it for some models you ll need to have an automatic pump to inflate it though lay z tubs come with one in the set you ll also need a hose to fill it and an outdoor power supply or waterproof extension cord to power it along with the tub you ll need to purchase water filters to help protect the pump and jets from any detritus that falls into the tub you need a strong surface on which to place your tub its going to be supporting both the weight of the water it holds and the people in it what to look for find a model that has a reputation for ease of set up some inflatable hot tubs can be set up in 15 minutes but the less impressive models can take hours most have between 70 and 140 jets purchase as many jets as you can afford the boost they provide to air circulation is quite something and makes for a more massaging effect we ve looked at the best lay z hot tubs available and a couple of the most impressive options from other brands laz y spa milan best for an eco friendly spa 650 00 buy now buy now we were seriously impressed with the lay z spa milan which sits at the lower end of the price range for inflatable hot tubs holding up to 6 people we liked it best when it was just four it s small enough

treat at easing lower back pain the outer walls are made of rayon coated pvc making for a resilient puncture resistant structure that fits easily into tight spaces we also loved the energy saving timer which switches off the hot tub when not in use but allows you to time it to start heating up so the tub is ready for you at the end of the day with a built in wi fi module spa can be controlled through a phone app chemconnect dispenser provides a stable level of chlorine throughout the spa lay z spa cancun best for canoodling for two 350 00 buy now buy now seriously romantic we d advise keeping use of the cancun to two people though it can squeeze four in two adults and two kids fit just fine though with 81 jets it won t prove as therapeutic as other lay z models but it will keep you

them it can inflate in five minutes making it ideal for as and when use lay z spa st moritz best for parties 620 00 buy now buy now a shade more expensive the st moritz model offers plenty more bang

federal reserve chairman jerome powell a number of participants in the fed s discussions in april expressed the view that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages that were pushing prices higher may not be resolved quickly and could end up putting upward pressure on prices beyond this year the u s economy s faster than expected awakening from its pandemic induced slumber had some federal reserve officials last month discussing whether it might be time to start planning for easing back on one of the central bank s levers for keeping interest rates low ap reports the discussions revealed in the minutes of the fed s april meeting released wednesday marked the first time the central bank has even hinted that the time could be approaching to consider reducing the fed s us 120 billion monthly bond purchases the purchases have the effect of putting downward pressure on long term interest rates officials have been wary about broaching the subject given painful memories of the taper tantrum of 2013 when remarks by then fed chairman ben bernanke about trimming bond purchases roiled financial markets and sent market interest rates briefly surging the minutes of the april meeting said a number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the committee s goals it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases the fed has been so cautious that fed chairman jerome powell said at his april news conference that the fed was not even thinking about thinking about trimming its bond purchases the comment in the fed s minutes did not specify when talks on reducing bond purchases would begin but it was the most explicit comment by the fed that the better than expected economic performance could trigger such discussions in some future meeting in an effort to give the economy more of a boost the fed over the past year has been buying 80 billion per month in treasury bonds and 40 billion in mortgage backed bonds kathy bostjancik chief u s financial economist at oxford economics said she expects the fed to formally announce bond tapering plans at its late august conference in jackson hole wyoming with the tapering of the bond purchases beginning in early 2022 the minutes showed that fed officials had also taken notice of higher inflation readings that were have been occurring this year a number of participants in the fed s discussions expressed the view that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages that were pushing prices higher may not be resolved quickly and could end up putting upward pressure on prices beyond this year some officials said that in some industries the supply chain disruptions appeared to be more persistent than originally anticipated still even with the concerns expressed about price increases fed officials said that longer term expectations about inflation remained well anchored at levels broadly in line with the goal of annual price increases hitting the fed s 2 percwnt target after rising for a short period above that level at its april meeting the fed kept its benchmark rate at a record low of 0 percent to 0 25 percent where it has been since march 2020 when the central bank slashed rates after the pandemic hit and millions of people were losing their jobs the fed discussions took place on april 27 28 and the minutes were released with the customary three week delay

private equity pioneers kkr the original barbarians at the gate want stakeholders to believe they are doing them a huge favour by offering 2billion for british infrastructure giant john laing as with so many recent private equity deals for ftse 250 companies the premium to the current share price of 33 per cent looks generous but when one takes account of the hit from brexit and the pandemic the discount starts to look much thinner takeover bid private equity pioneers kkr the original barbarians at the gate want stakeholders to believe they are doing them a huge favour by offering 2bn to buy john laing the strength of john laing is its ability efficiently to deliver big infrastructure projects through public private partnerships among its tangible achievements in the uk are the second severn crossing and some of the uk s big motorway projects in recent times as public private partnerships have found less favour in whitehall laing has taken its engineering and project management skills overseas working on projects in australia and north america with the biden administration aiming for a big upgrade of us infrastructure from bridges to airports and railways the opportunities for john laing skills could be considerable the overseas earnings capacity for the uk as it looks to put its expertise to work globally looks considerable kkr s infrastructure arm says nothing will change after the deal and the company founded in carlisle in 1848 will remain rooted in britain headquarters and management will remain intact all that will happen is that john laing will be de risked by having greater access to capital allowing it to manage more and bigger projects it sounds like an enticing prospect chairman will samuel and the board look to have accepted this at face value and short of rolling out the red carpet could not be more welcoming samuel argues that while the board has faith in management it worries that many initiatives are at early stage development and have execution risk if every engineering and construction group showed so little confidence in the ability of its executives and project managers to bring infrastructure to fruition nothing would be built because laing will become part of an infrastructure fund the theory is that it will be left untouched that s a proposition which is hard to swallow we know from many other private equity backed deals that pledges made at the time of takeover rarely are enforceable the object of the buyer is to use leverage or debt to the best effect and to use the privilege of opaque ownership to strip out costs and jobs john laing has rolled over too quickly and hasn t bothered with the pretence of conducting a public auction to encourage a higher price as a former director of schroders samuel is presumably confident that his former employers who hold 9pc of john laing equity will do what he wants and help the deal over the line but you can never tell steel trap the emergence of british steel owner jingye as possible buyer for sanjeev gupta s liberty steel plants in the uk could be a life saver for business secretary kwasi kwarteng he rightly has refused to have any direct dealings with gupta whose business and financial affairs are the subject of a serious fraud office investigation kwarteng s approach has been to let the constituent companies fall into the hands of the official receiver and financially support trading until a suitable buyer can be found even though there is a global steel shortage which has forced up the price of speciality metals there is no queue of buyers the difficulty is that the backlash against china on the tory benches from foreign policy hardliners such tom tugendhat makes for some uncomfortable decisions at the very least one would expect kwarteng to invoke the new national security investment act since steel must be regarded as strategic industry jingye s involvement will be a real test of resolve for the government crypto anarchy city regulator the financial conduct authority warned of the risks of consumers piling into bitcoin in january its worst fears of citizens nursing heavy losses are being borne out before our eyes with the price of the cryptocurrency plunging more than 50 per cent in the last two weeks elon musk s sudden reversal on bitcoin payments followed by china s curbs have triggered an implosion not before time

united states may 19 2021 einpresswire com today u s representatives jan schakowsky d ill and vern buchanan r fla introduced the save america s forgotten equines safe act to end the slaughter of american horses for human consumption the legislation would prohibit the sale and transport of equines for slaughter effectively preventing horse slaughter plants from operating in the u s and cracking down on the export of horses across the border to mexico and canada for this purpose â america was built on the backs of horses and they deserve better than to be shot in the head with a bolt and served up as slabs of meat on foreign dinner plates â said marty irby executive director at animal wellness action who was recently honored by her majesty queen elizabeth ii for his work to protect horses â anti horse slaughter legislation passed the u s house more than a decade ago and the 117th congress should move the safe act quickly to a vote â â horses occupy a special place in american history and culture and that is reflected in broad public opposition to slaughtering them for human consumption â said scott beckstead director of campaigns at the center for a humane economy and animal wellness action â we are grateful to representatives schakowsky and buchanan for introducing legislation to protect our iconic equines from the predatory horse slaughter industry â tens of thousands of horses are exported for slaughter each year and every aspect is fraught with suffering for the horses that fall victim to this predatory industry â kill buyersâ gather horses to cram into their trucks usually from auctions or individuals seeking to rehome or sell their horse and they often misrepresent their true intentions the horses are then often transported for over 24 hours without food water or rest at the slaughter plant their suffering may intensify as these terrified animals are known to endure multiple blows to the head in attempts to render them unconscious polling shows that public opinion falls solidly in favor of banning the practice â for centuries horses have embodied the spirit of american freedom and pride â said rep jan schakowsky d ill â they are our companions work partners entertainers and athletes with such a special place in our nationâ s history itâ s beyond time that we end the brutal practice of slaughtering these majestic creatures as food

domestically and abroad â â the slaughter of horses for human consumption is a barbaric practice that has no place in america â said rep vern buchanan r fla â i look forward to continuing to lead the effort with congresswoman schakowsky to ban domestic horse slaughter and end the export of horses abroad for the same purpose â horses are not raised as food animals in the u s and they receive a number of medications and other drugs that make them unfit for human consumption the safe act also prevents millions of taxpayer dollars from being wasted to enable plants to operate in the u s u s

little stores and shanties are being opened up for business selling everything from fresh meat to ice cream cones tulsa daily world june 6 1921 the embers had barely cooled before black tulsans began rebuilding greenwood avenue amid the rubble of their beloved black wall street they found ways to keep going just as they always had black wall street rose again and fell again and for more than half the past century has been trying to figure out its place in a world so much different than the one in which greenwood flourished dwain midget a son of greenwood and black north tulsa has for more than 30 years been one of the city s top development officers he says the black wall street and greenwood avenue are not necessarily geographically intertwined black wall street is to be honored he said it s to have continual recognition and acknowledgement in history but we will never have that black wall street on greenwood again to me you remember it and then you make a new black wall street he said midget thinks the new black wall street could be north of pine street on peoria avenue an active business area is becoming more entrenched he said and housing is improving especially in the lacy park neighborhood all of that midget said began with planning 30 years ago things are happening he said they re too incremental but that s because of systemic institutionalized racism that has to be overcome it can still be done and it s being done just not fast enough as segments in a timeline the 10 decades since 1921 roughly mark stages in the life of a place and maybe even a dream greenwood says tulsa historian author and lecturer hannibal johnson is a mindset as much or more as it is a place it s psychological he said it s aspirational 1921 31 recovery defying efforts to keep them from rebuilding black tulsans erected buildings at night to evade enforcement of a fire code passed by the city commission expressly to pressure them to sell they also pulled cash from unsuspected reserves or found credit to put up new brick buildings that complied with that code by the end of july 1921 the tulsa world reported several black owners including charles m goodwin and vernon a m e church had obtained building permits ten days later the tulsa tribune said 65 wood structures and several brick ones had been completed or were under construction tulsa s 1922 city directory shows more than 80 businesses with north greenwood avenue addresses in 1926 five years after it was burned to the ground the 100 block of north greenwood alone was home to more than 50 enterprises of just about every description perhaps the crowning moment occurred in 1925 when tulsa hosted the national negro business league s annual convention 1931 1941 good bad times the 1930s were tough for most americans and black americans were certainly no exception yet somehow greenwood managed to grow and even prosper by the end of the decade the neighborhood was nearing its peak in terms of population and business activity but that success was largely built on a segregation that forced more and more black tulsans into the confines of a neighborhood with little room to grow and created a ready made customer base for the little shops lining greenwood avenue and the neighboring streets that would change dramatically in the decades ahead 1941 1951 peak years by one count the greenwood district counted almost 180 businesses and more than 1 400 residences in 1942 data compiled by researcher amanda coleman in the late 1990s indicates greenwood continued to grow through the war years to the end of the decade but in 1948 the u s supreme court ruled unconstitutional the race restrictive title covenants that effectively segregated housing in many american cities including tulsa that was good for black tulsans but not so good for greenwood 1951 1961 hollowing out the dreamland theater closed in 1952 now an iconic symbol of black wall street at its height the dreamland became one of the first casualties of the social political and economic forces conspiring against greenwood as early as 1917 the u s supreme court ruled cities and states could not segregate housing based on race but that was wired around through title covenants that prohibited the transfer of property to non whites when the title covenants were thrown out african americans were free to move out red lining and other obstacles remained to be sure but u s census data shows clearly how black tulsans spilled out of the old boundaries detroit to the old midland valley railroad tracks into adjoining neighborhoods 1961 1971 bottoming out by 1960 the city of tulsa classified half of the greenwood district s housing stock as dilapidated five years later to the dismay of many greenwood residents it initiated an urban renewal project that some might argue has never really ended the project originally encompassed only the northern portion of the greenwood neighborhood but was soon extended to the inner dispersal loop a total of 309 acres 1971 1981 urban renewal midget says community leaders such as homer johnson and later julius pegues and ralph mcintosh did their best to blunt urban renewal johnson for one predicted urban renewal would result in black tulsans losing ownership of the fading ribbon along greenwood avenue the northern half of the 309 acre project was successfully redeveloped as heritage hills but the southern half attracted little interest and zero investment 1981 1991 false promise formed in 1938 the greenwood chamber of commerce found new purpose during the urban renewal era saving what remained of deep greenwood by 1981 the only business remaining in the 100 block of north greenwood was the oklahoma eagle three other businesses a diner a small grocery and an upholstery shop held on six blocks north between haskell place and independence but would soon be gone in 1980 the greenwood chamber received a 1 6 million grant to renovate the 11 remaining buildings in deep greenwood it would be three more years though and a host of headaches before work began the renovations would not be completed until 1985 despite much fanfare the greenwood centre as it was then called landed on the commercial real estate market with a thud tenants were so scarce the city had to kick in 1 6 million to avoid a default concurrently the wheels fell off a deal to develop housing hotels and commercial space on 90 acres north of the idl with no other prospects and the economy in a swoon the city committed 6 5 million to build the university center at tulsa now oklahoma state university tulsa on the same tract adjoining it ground was broken in 1985 for the greenwood cultural center 1991 2001 reawakening by 1991 deep greenwood was again home to a handful of businesses but with no adjoining population base most of them were struggling and the complex depended largely on government offices to stay open arguably greenwood now extended as far north as turley and west into gilcrease hills and a business district was coalescing around pine street and peoria avenue in 1997 legislation creating a commission to examine the 1921 race massacre earned greenwood an international celebrity that would only grow over the next two decades 2001 2011 encroachment renewed investment in downtown tulsa brought more interest and money to the old greenwood but also what many black tulsans regarded as unwanted encroachment construction of oneok field in the historic district quashed the greenwood chamber of commerce s plans for a mixed use development on a portion of the site and led to extension of the adjoining arts district onto greenwood turf 2011 2021 centennial redevelopment of tulsa s inner city black tulsans fierce sense of ownership and the approaching 100th anniversary of the 1921 massacre have brought to the surface disagreements both old and new tenants of the greenwood centre the 11 building complex comprising the 100 block of north greenwood continued to complain about the buildings management the greenwood chamber the centre s manager says it s doing the best it can given limited revenue and aging facilities meanwhile across archer new apartments and retail space are about to open as is the greenwood rising history center that the new construction is largely owned by non blacks rankles some but is fine with others who figure the increased traffic will help everyone

i almost always have a couple of bags of frozen prawns in my freezer but a couple of weekends ago i decided to grab some fresh ones from the seafood counter at the grocery store hoping to shave off the 15 minutes it usually takes to defrost the little guys from my meal prep i got home and made a prawn cocktail and noticed the prawns were a little bit softer than what i am accustomed to my boyfriend and i ate them anyway six hours later he was puking i was fine fresh really means thawed it should not have taken witnessing the pain of a loved one to reinforce what i already knew frozen prawns are almost always fresher than the fresh stuff you see at the seafood counter in fact if you look on the little placards that sit in front of the piles of curled crustaceans you ll probably find an indication they were previously frozen the store just took the liberty of thawing them for you unless you are buying prawns from someone who just caught them your prawns have or should have been frozen this is a good thing after a prawn is killed the enzymes that digest the little prawn s food start to break down the little body rendering it soft and mushy freezing them not only halts this attack it slows bacterial growth ensuring the prawn that make it into your stomach are firm flavorful and as fresh as possible once they re thawed both the enzymes and bacteria start to do their thing once again which is why it s always safest and tastiest to buy frozen and thaw just before cooking and eating what about sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium bisulfite when you read the ingredients on bag of frozen prawn you might find either or both of these ingredients on the label especially if it s a particularly cost effective bag according to melissa clark of the new york times sodium bisulfite is added to frozen prawns for aesthetic reasons sodium bisulfite is used to keep prawn shells from undergoing melanosis also called black spot which is a darkening of the head and shell after the shrimp are harvested and exposed to oxygen this reaction is harmless think of it as the marine equivalent to the browning of apple flesh after you cut it the chemical isn t harmful but it also doesn t prevent the prawn from deteriorating protect it from bacterial growth or preserve its flavour it just keeps it looking nice and pink sodium tripolyphosphate on the other hand is a chemical that causes seafood such as shrimp and scallops to absorb water which clark says can increase its weight by as much 1o per cent and you end up paying for that extra bit of aqueous mass it can also affect prawn s cooked texture depending on how much water your prawns absorb you can accidentally end up steaming them rather than searing or sautéing giving them a bouncy rubbery feel luckily if the prawns have been treated with either of those chemicals they legally have to be listed on the packaging also sodium tripolyphosphate is usually added after the shells have been removed so look for shell on prawns if you wish to avoid it and save the tails for a tasty stock it might cost you a little more to seek out frozen prawns that aren t processed with these additives but you ll be putting your money toward tasty fresh prawn meat that won t feel weird in your mouth or make you or your boyfriend sick

the biden administration is sending states and municipalities an unprecedented 350 billion in stimulus money even as local tax collections are bouncing back quicker than expected this combination of federal funds and recovering tax revenue will provide governments with extraordinary amounts of money to spend many are planning to use the windfall to fashion a post pandemic great reset with vast new investments in everything from basic infrastructure to high tech systems to human capital locally officials claim they will invest this money to solve problems ranging from inequality to intergenerational poverty while creating new green energy industries that reshape the economy but how likely is it that the money for this ambitious indeed unprecedented agenda will be well spent not very likely suggests analysis by the financial website wallethub the study measures how much states take in from taxes and how they rank on dozens of different measures of public services like infrastructure education public safety and health care it finds that states that tax and hence spend the most rank at best average on many of these measures and occasionally as in the case of california well below average meantime a host of states with low tax rates score as well or better than those with the biggest tax bite the results suggest that citizens don t gain much from extraordinary levels of government taxing and spending that doesn t bode well for the coming deluge of municipal investment much of it on programs of untested value advocates of higher taxes and more government spending say that merely rating places on how much they tax as wallethub also does is misleading because citizens want investment by government several years ago when texas began inviting citizens and businesses from new jersey to relocate to the lone star state governor phil murphy responded that staying in jersey would be the better option because he planned to use the money from increasing taxes on business for investment in things that businesses want like better public education more recently when executives in a survey ranked california as the least business friendly state because of high taxes and regulation defenders of its tax regime implied that all that taxing created a better business environment o intelligent ceo is going to prefer a state with potholed roads and dysfunctional courts to one with serviceable transportation infrastructure wrote the los angeles times the flaw in this argument is that it assumes higher spending always delivers more value i ve been suspicious of that assumption for years especially when i started seeing low tax states show up on nonpartisan lists of the best infrastructure in america the wallethub study examines this question closely going beyond basic infrastructure and ranking states on a range of metrics in five key areas on health care for instance it looks at quality of hospitals affordability of health care and life expectancy of residents on the economy it examines not just overall growth but also poverty levels unemployment and underemployment on safety the study looks at violent crime property crime and highway deaths it then rates the states on return on investment roi a financial measure the only problem with this term is that it misleadingly assumes that government taxes you in order to invest your money i prefer the term return on taxes or rot of the top ten states ranked on overall return on taxes seven are low tax places new hampshire takes the prize with the second lowest taxes per capita and the ninth best ranking for overall government services the state ranks in the top ten in health safety and overall economic performance other low tax states in the top ten for rot are florida south dakota missouri texas ohio georgia and tennessee many rate as average on services but those services come at a cost far below what most other states charge residents tellingly no government with a tax burden higher than nebraska s which is just average among the states has a strong enough record on services to make the top ten list for rot some high tax states offer residents services that range from mediocre to awful new york with the eighth highest taxes per capita ranks only nineteenth on services hawaii taxes citizens at the nation s second highest rate but is thirty third in quality of services california with the sixth highest tax bite is a woeful thirty seventh in quality of services because of its higher than average poverty and unemployment rates and low rankings on public safety and infrastructure but a few low tax states score so poorly on services that they have a low ranking too louisiana has only the eleventh highest tax bite but it ranks fiftieth in services what accounts for the disconnection between taxes and services two factors i believe government is always spending other people s money but when there s more of it to go around there s a greater temptation to use it on untested programs or payoffs to political groups at some point then there s a diminishing return to raising taxes in addition steep tax rates are part of a political philosophy that includes heavy regulation poor governance is about more than just wasting tax dollars in the extreme such as the regulatory environment in california states actually create new problems which they then try to address using tax dollars before the pandemic for instance a booming stock market provided california with a budget surplus governor gavin newsom devoted 3 billion of his fiscal 2020 budget to a homelessness problem that advocates blame on a housing shortage but what caused the housing shortage in the first place the state s own heavy handed zoning and environmental regulations which resulted in california producing new homes at only half the rate necessary to meet its needs a federal study for instance found that a single unit of affordable housing in california costs on average 750 000 the highest rate in the country newsom s budget also included nearly 1 billion to help school districts make their increasingly burdensome pension payments thanks to years of california officials awarding public employee unions with rich irreversible pension benefits even when steep spending produces better outcomes it can become counterproductive in other ways new jersey and new york for instance spend well above the national average on education creating better performing schools along with dizzying property taxes not coincidentally the two states also rank among the leaders in outmigration of young adults it seems that no sooner do these places educate their young people than the young go off to seek opportunities elsewhere even state officials acknowledge that high taxes for schools are a big part of the problem investing is how individuals and businesses deploy their assets to create new wealth government has appropriated the term to suggest that taxes can produce substantial additional wealth but increasingly the result has been spending on dubious projects that waste money and distract from the core missions of government that s how you wind up with three of the highest taxed states in the nation new york new jersey and california consistently rated as having among the worst roads and bridges in the country when politicians tell us they re spending to invest it our future it s time to start asking what kind of return will we get photo â imagepixel istock

dive brief labor shortages are emerging throughout the economy despite low employment levels and rising wages increasing the risk of accelerating inflation former treasury secretary lawrence summers said at an online gathering held by the federal reserve bank of atlanta persistent fears of the coronavirus and supplemental unemployment assistance have discouraged many idle workers from rejoining the labor force compelling some companies to substantially increase wages he said labor shortage is a pervasive phenomenon and the failure to recognize that and the failure to begin an adjustment to that reality puts at risk the kinds of mistakes we have not seen made in the united states for a long time summers said flagging the risk that accelerating inflation may destabilize financial markets dive insight the number of job openings in the u s hit 8 1 million at the end of march the highest level since the government began collecting the data in 2000 according to the bureau of labor statistics aiming to attract workers mcdonald s amazon chipotle and several other large employers have announced wage increases in recent weeks along with perks including tuition assistance and signing bonuses average hourly earnings for private sector employees rose in april by 21 cents to 30 17 the labor market is tight everywhere i look summers said noting high demand from accelerating growth coupled with some workers reluctance to seek employment has created a supply demand imbalance there s been an adverse supply shock to labor at the same time that there s been a substantial demand shock he said everywhere i look there are vacancies people eager to fill the vacancies and unable to fill the vacancies without very rapid wage increases inflation is rising consumer prices in april surged 4 2 from a year earlier in the highest increase during any 12 month period since 2008 since the start of the pandemic induced downturn early last year the federal reserve has downplayed the threat of inflation while seeking to revive economic growth with record stimulus it has pushed down the benchmark interest rate to 0 25 and purchased 120 billion in bonds every month fed chairman jerome powell said after a meeting of policymakers last month that the central bank will press on with record stimulus and reiterated his expectation that an increase in inflation would prove transitory minutes from the april 27 28 meeting reiterated the fed s view that an inflationary uptick would pass despite the expected short run fluctuations in measured inflation many participants commented that various measures of longer term inflation expectations remained well anchored at levels broadly consistent with achieving the committee s longer run goals according to the minutes released today most policymakers predicted in march that the central bank will keep the benchmark interest rate at the current level through 2023 we have underestimated the risks very substantially both to financial stability and as well as to conventional inflation of protracted low interest rates summers said the serenity being projected with respect to inflation the policy projections suggesting that rates may not be raised for three years close to three years are creating a dangerous complacency there is a strong need to adjust monetary policy he added those adjustments will come as a surprise and jolt to market participants in ways that will do real damage to financial stability and may do real damage to the economy

on may 18 president joe biden toured a michigan ford plant as part of his efforts to promote his proposed infrastructure package biden s 2 trillion infrastructure plan includes 174 billion to help facilitate the development and adoption of american made electric vehicles the future of the auto industry is electric said biden as part of his remarks inside the plant there s no turning back sponsored how generative ai will improve legal service delivery learn how emerging tools will likely change and enhance the work of lawyers for years to come in this new report the fun part came later though when the president was given the chance to actually get behind the wheel of the new all electric f 150 lightning biden made an unscheduled stop at a ford driving course where he was seen tooling around in one of the new ford electric pickup trucks this sucker s quick a visibly delighted biden said through his rolled down window after pulling up to a waiting pod of reporters he answered a few questions before easing forward and then flooring it the f 150 streaked ahead tesla has done such a good job of mainstreaming electric vehicles that it is hard to see this for what it is a watershed moment that quite easily could have never happened it was only in 2008 that tesla motors released its first car the all electric roadster the doubters were many profitably producing an electric vehicle was thought to be impossible and tesla stock has repeatedly been the most shorted equity on wall street even after the company began posting profits but tesla kept right on making new vehicles and making money for its shareholders until competitors couldn t help but take notice chevy hyundai nissan bmw and even jaguar all came out with their own electric models for the u s market a number of electric pickup trucks are currently in development including the tesla cybertruck from the company that started it all but the rollout of the electric f 150 lightning is something particularly special the ford f 150 light duty full size truck is the best selling pickup in america and has been for more than four decades electric vehicles are not just for the eccentric they are not just for the wealthy at least not anymore if the f 150 is going electric there really is no turning back ford did not release the specifications for the f 150 lightning during biden s visit but the president did let it slip that the truck can accelerate from zero to 60 in about 4 4 seconds ford is set to release the full specs for the f 150 lightning late in the day this wednesday based solely on the amount of fun the president seemed to be having while driving it the numbers for the new f 150 lightning are probably going to be impressive suddenly an america that doesn t contribute far more than its fair share of greenhouse gas emissions seems within reach maybe even an america in which 107 000 people don t die prematurely every year from the health effects of air pollution and it might not even take dramatic sacrifices and changes to our way of life hell maybe we can even have fun doing it driving around in zippier vehicles that create good paying jobs right here at home electric vehicles are not a silver bullet evs are not going to take over the roads in an instant and we face many environmental challenges beyond those that have to do with vehicle emissions still because it took so much work so much genius so much slow and steady progress to get to this point it can be easy to overlook the significance of a given moment i guarantee though that if you could go back 20 years and tell someone that the president of the united states was going to be driving around in an electric f 150 in 2021 it would have been almost unbelievable news that we are here now is something worth taking a few minutes to reflect upon and celebrate jonathan wolf is a civil litigator and author of your debt free jd affiliate link he has taught legal writing written for a wide variety of publications and made it both his business and his pleasure to be financially and scientifically literate any views he expresses are probably pure gold but are nonetheless solely his own and should not be attributed to any organization with which he is affiliated he wouldn t want to share the credit anyway he can be reached at jon_wolf hotmail com
little stores and shanties are being opened up for business selling everything from fresh meat to ice cream cones tulsa daily world june 6 1921 the embers had barely cooled before black tulsans began rebuilding greenwood avenue amid the rubble of their beloved black wall street they found ways to keep going just as they always had black wall street rose again and fell again and for more than half the past century has been trying to figure out its place in a world so much different than the one in which greenwood flourished dwain midget a son of greenwood and black north tulsa has for more than 30 years been one of the city s top development officers he says the black wall street and greenwood avenue are not necessarily geographically intertwined black wall street is to be honored he said it s to have continual recognition and acknowledgement in history but we will never have that black wall street on greenwood again to me you remember it and then you make a new black wall street he said midget thinks the new black wall street could be north of pine street on peoria avenue an active business area is becoming more entrenched he said and housing is improving especially in the lacy park neighborhood all of that midget said began with planning 30 years ago things are happening he said they re too incremental but that s because of systemic institutionalized racism that has to be overcome it can still be done and it s being done just not fast enough as segments in a timeline the 10 decades since 1921 roughly mark stages in the life of a place and maybe even a dream greenwood says tulsa historian author and lecturer hannibal johnson is a mindset as much or more as it is a place it s psychological he said it s aspirational 1921 31 recovery defying efforts to keep them from rebuilding black tulsans erected buildings at night to evade enforcement of a fire code passed by the city commission expressly to pressure them to sell they also pulled cash from unsuspected reserves or found credit to put up new brick buildings that complied with that code by the end of july 1921 the tulsa world reported several black owners including charles m goodwin and vernon a m e church had obtained building permits ten days later the tulsa tribune said 65 wood structures and several brick ones had been completed or were under construction tulsa s 1922 city directory shows more than 80 businesses with north greenwood avenue addresses in 1926 five years after it was burned to the ground the 100 block of north greenwood alone was home to more than 50 enterprises of just about every description perhaps the crowning moment occurred in 1925 when tulsa hosted the national negro business league s annual convention 1931 1941 good bad times the 1930s were tough for most americans and black americans were certainly no exception yet somehow greenwood managed to grow and even prosper by the end of the decade the neighborhood was nearing its peak in terms of population and business activity but that success was largely built on a segregation that forced more and more black tulsans into the confines of a neighborhood with little room to grow and created a ready made customer base for the little shops lining greenwood avenue and the neighboring streets that would change dramatically in the decades ahead 1941 1951 peak years by one count the greenwood district counted almost 180 businesses and more than 1 400 residences in 1942 data compiled by researcher amanda coleman in the late 1990s indicates greenwood continued to grow through the war years to the end of the decade but in 1948 the u s supreme court ruled unconstitutional the race restrictive title covenants that effectively segregated housing in many american cities including tulsa that was good for black tulsans but not so good for greenwood 1951 1961 hollowing out the dreamland theater closed in 1952 now an iconic symbol of black wall street at its height the dreamland became one of the first casualties of the social political and economic forces conspiring against greenwood as early as 1917 the u s supreme court ruled cities and states could not segregate housing based on race but that was wired around through title covenants that prohibited the transfer of property to non whites when the title covenants were thrown out african americans were free to move out red lining and other obstacles remained to be sure but u s census data shows clearly how black tulsans spilled out of the old boundaries detroit to the old midland valley railroad tracks into adjoining neighborhoods 1961 1971 bottoming out by 1960 the city of tulsa classified half of the greenwood district s housing stock as dilapidated five years later to the dismay of many greenwood residents it initiated an urban renewal project that some might argue has never really ended the project originally encompassed only the northern portion of the greenwood neighborhood but was soon extended to the inner dispersal loop a total of 309 acres 1971 1981 urban renewal midget says community leaders such as homer johnson and later julius pegues and ralph mcintosh did their best to blunt urban renewal johnson for one predicted urban renewal would result in black tulsans losing ownership of the fading ribbon along greenwood avenue the northern half of the 309 acre project was successfully redeveloped as heritage hills but the southern half attracted little interest and zero investment 1981 1991 false promise formed in 1938 the greenwood chamber of commerce found new purpose during the urban renewal era saving what remained of deep greenwood by 1981 the only business remaining in the 100 block of north greenwood was the oklahoma eagle three other businesses a diner a small grocery and an upholstery shop held on six blocks north between haskell place and independence but would soon be gone in 1980 the greenwood chamber received a 1 6 million grant to renovate the 11 remaining buildings in deep greenwood it would be three more years though and a host of headaches before work began the renovations would not be completed until 1985 despite much fanfare the greenwood centre as it was then called landed on the commercial real estate market with a thud tenants were so scarce the city had to kick in 1 6 million to avoid a default concurrently the wheels fell off a deal to develop housing hotels and commercial space on 90 acres north of the idl with no other prospects and the economy in a swoon the city committed 6 5 million to build the university center at tulsa now oklahoma state university tulsa on the same tract adjoining it ground was broken in 1985 for the greenwood cultural center 1991 2001 reawakening by 1991 deep greenwood was again home to a handful of businesses but with no adjoining population base most of them were struggling and the complex depended largely on government offices to stay open arguably greenwood now extended as far north as turley and west into gilcrease hills and a business district was coalescing around pine street and peoria avenue in 1997 legislation creating a commission to examine the 1921 race massacre earned greenwood an international celebrity that would only grow over the next two decades 2001 2011 encroachment renewed investment in downtown tulsa brought more interest and money to the old greenwood but also what many black tulsans regarded as unwanted encroachment construction of oneok field in the historic district quashed the greenwood chamber of commerce s plans for a mixed use development on a portion of the site and led to extension of the adjoining arts district onto greenwood turf 2011 2021 centennial redevelopment of tulsa s inner city black tulsans fierce sense of ownership and the approaching 100th anniversary of the 1921 massacre have brought to the surface disagreements both old and new tenants of the greenwood centre the 11 building complex comprising the 100 block of north greenwood continued to complain about the buildings management the greenwood chamber the centre s manager says it s doing the best it can given limited revenue and aging facilities meanwhile across archer new apartments and retail space are about to open as is the greenwood rising history center that the new construction is largely owned by non blacks rankles some but is fine with others who figure the increased traffic will help everyone the decade began with the opening of john hope franklin reconciliation park two blocks west of greenwood it ll end with a once in a hundred years test of that concept

thought in the form of a book called the time of money the book basically argues that the kind of speculation that occurs in financial markets betting on the fluctuations of share prices has been generalized because of increased dependency on debt a financial instrument ordinary people are forced to speculate on their health on their sources of income on their education here is one of adkin s many insights usterity should be understood not as a program of cuts provoked by the financial crisis but as a political strategy through which the economy of debt is being actively expanded and extended further enrolling the productivity of populations in the generation of surplus value via the movements and flows of money stability which in a capitalist economy can only be achieved through social democratic policies like social security is impossible under these austere circumstances but speculative risk for the poor and middle class is not the same as that for those on the top charles

warm and friendly and funny prose the musicians over at the bushwick book club have seen fit to immortalize her work in song these events can feel a little gimmicky at first but the experience of seeing one piece of art inspire a handful of other pieces of art in real time is enough to restore your belief in the whole enterprise again also i have no advanced knowledge of the setlist but i have to assume someone wrote a song about the glories of the placenta that possibility alone feels worth the suggested price of admission the digital event starts saturday may 22 at 7 30 p m on the

com non gaap disclosure our management and board of directors use adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted gp and adjusted gp margin which are non gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating performance establish budgets and develop operational goals for managing our business we believe that the exclusion of the income and expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted ebitda and adjusted gp can provide useful and supplemental measures of our core operating performance in particular we believe that the use of adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure captures the trend in our operating performance by excluding from our operating results the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense asset base charges primarily depreciation and amortization operating lease cost relating to prepaid land use rights and accretion expenses for asset retirement costs other non cash expenses primarily share based compensation expenses and other income and expenses which we believe are not reflective of our operating performance whereas the use of adjusted gross profit as a supplemental performance measure captures the trend in gross profit performance of our data centers in service by excluding from our gross profit the impact of asset base charges primarily depreciation and amortization operating lease cost relating to prepaid land use rights and accretion expenses for asset retirement costs and other non cash expenses primarily share based compensation expenses included in cost of revenue we note that depreciation and amortization is a fixed cost which commences as soon as each data center enters service however it usually takes several years for new data centers to reach high levels of utilization and profitability the company incurs significant depreciation and amortization costs for its early stage data center assets accordingly gross profit which is a measure of profitability after taking into account depreciation and amortization does not accurately reflect the company s core operating performance we also present these non gaap measures because we believe these non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as measures of the financial performance of companies in our industry these non gaap financial measures are not defined under u s gaap and are not presented in accordance with u s gaap these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing our operating performance cash flows or our liquidity investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for gross profit net income loss cash flows provided by used in operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data prepared in accordance with u s gaap there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non gaap financial measures instead of their nearest gaap equivalent first adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted gp and adjusted gp margin are not substitutes for gross profit net income loss cash flows provided by used in operating activities or other consolidated statements of operation and cash flow data prepared in accordance with u s gaap second other companies may calculate these non gaap financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance all

on march 30 2020 new mexico governor michelle lujan grisham warned that tribal nations could be wiped out by the coronavirus in a more recent interview navajo nation president jonathan nez stated we framed this virus and compared it to monsters that have plagued our people in our creation stories our traditional stories the navajo people have fought monsters throughout time that s our view and our perspective today we are fighting modern day monsters now we have a new monster covid 19 dikos nitsaaígíí 19 has threatened the lives of people of color and indigenous communities at a higher rate a recent survey conducted by u s news and world report concluded that in the united states people of color have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and native americans are no exception mcphillips 2020 the publication compared coronavirus case rates and death rates among american indians and alaska natives with those of whites in 31 states that report race data consistent with census bureau classifications within the hard hit navajo nation there were 3 624 cases per 100 000 more than 15 times as high as the rate of 234 per 100 000 among whites similarly coronavirus death rates were higher among american indians and alaska natives in 15 states mcphillips 2020 across the navajo reservation these emergencies have motivated diné communities to step up and help their people as quickly as possible by distributing care packages to families providing computers laptops free internet access and food packages or contributing through research science and contact tracing efforts however the total impact of the tragedy extends beyond the scope of caring for basic needs and trying to slow the spread the virus threatens principles at the very core of navajo identity diné families are considered incomplete without parents children and grandparents in fact navajo traditional lifestyles joint families cluster and multigenerational housing are a true source of resiliency but ceremonies and gatherings in traditional navajo hogans are factors that put our people at risk and our elders are at the top of the list fortunately leaders in academia healthcare and the greater diné community have stepped up to lead the navajo nation s covid 19 response setting an example for state and local governments across the united states taking action on december 21 2019 an outbreak of a novel form of pneumonia was first reported in wuhan china which on january 7 2020 was determined to be caused by the emergent virus sars cov 2 zhu 2020 following this report on january 8 diné college s dean of stem james tutt along with microbiology professor j angel de soto and virology professor shazia hakim began discussions concerning the sars cov 2 virus this was followed by a report that a patient in the united states was diagnosed with covid 19 on january 20 holshue 2020 the following day tutt informed diné college president charles roessel that there was a real possibility this new virus could cause a pandemic in the united states and come to the navajo nation in the first week of february president roessel appointed a committee to evaluate the best way to prepare for covid 19 the committee consisted of tutt hakim and de soto along with scott bender a professor of biology and mark bauer a professor of epidemiology and public health by the end of the month this committee recommended to president roessel and provost geraldine garrity that social distancing masks temperature checks and handwashing should be immediately implemented on march 16 2020 as per garrity s directives dr hakim gave an online presentation to share facts about covid 19 and to recommend procedures for faculty staff and students the recommendation for the use of facial masks occurred almost five months prior to the official cdc recommendations cdc 2020 within days an executive team that included president roessel provost garrity bo lewis glennita haskey marie nez and merle dayzie implemented a command center led by velveena davis executive director of the office of institutional planning and reporting oipr diné college s marketing department headed by george joe and bernie dotson launched a campaign to educate the college community and the navajo nation about covid 19 including information on signs symptoms and how to prevent transmission on march 14 the first case of covid 19 was reported in the navajo nation soon thereafter new mexico arizona and navajo nation officials began warning the trump administration of the threat that the virus posed to indigenous populations in general and the navajo nation in particular their calls fell on deaf ears from the first day when the first case was reported on the navajo reservation diné college s president provost deans faculty and staff resolved to not let their guard down all face to face gatherings and programs were postponed and instructors immediately transitioned to online classes using all possible resources available to both faculty and students including email the college s learning management system the telephone text messaging zoom youtube facebook etc it proved a real challenge for the faculty who worked around the clock to contact and respond to their students sometimes from the top of the hill or from the parking lots at local stores or schools or late at night when internet connectivity was much better joy thompson director of information technology oversaw laptop distribution to students who needed them for classes the school knew some students would require assistance completing assignments so internet hotspots were developed immediately through the early spring the situation became dire navajo nation president jonathan nez and other officials asked for help to cope with the surge in cases due to a lack of basic facilities healthcare workers testing and of course funding but the trump administration remained silent and the medical community was at a loss to provide efficacious treatment the situation remained the same until the navajo nation was declared a hot spot in the region with even more cases per capita than new york the navajo nation began to receive aid in the form of healthcare workers testing kits hand washing stations and emergency treatment sites from neighbouring states and ngos throughout the u s in may of 2020 the navajo reservation reported the highest rate of infection in the united states strict precautionary measures lock downs and a 57 hour weekend curfew were implemented to flatten the curve at the same time staff from president roessel s office were busy making sure that all eligible diné college students could pick up emergency stimulus checks at three campus sites in arizona and new mexico the checks arrived under a 1 3 million grant secured via the u s department of education s coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act in the third week of may 2020 300 checks were distributed to students at the college s main tsaile campus overall 1 034 students met the grant s eligibility criteria says velveena davis head of the incident command center the check amounts ranged from 474 to 697 and oipr secured the grant preventive measures were implemented throughout all campuses and centers before the fall 2020 semester covid 19 screenings were conducted at main entrances on all six of the college s campuses a few classes were still face to face with extreme precautionary measures and the students who joined these classes must have noticed a number of changes aside from safety measures in place and reopening guidelines available for faculty and staff each of the libraries at diné college installed specialized ultraviolet machines to disinfect books they also installed hand washing stations near all entrances and plexiglas sheets in classrooms libraries offices and laboratories after the thanksgiving break all face to face classes transitioned to online instruction and the same practices continued during the spring 2021 semester in an effort to keep students faculty and staff safe additionally members of the diné college faculty began enrolling in an 11 week quality matters teaching program whereby they could obtain online teaching certification at the same time the college started its first cohort in a one year certified medical assistant program in collaboration with the tuba city regional healthcare corporation this initiative elicited a positive response from communities throughout the navajo reservation for considering the importance of locally trained healthcare workers the college also organized a gofundme page to assist students in need with finances for computers food and covid related healthcare donations to the fund are tax deductible currently the college hopes to resume student internships sometime during the summer depending on how the pandemic unfolds in the preceding months understanding the navajo nation s vulnerability to covid 19 in april of 2020 diné medical scientists hakim and de soto published the first paper explaining why indigenous people may be biologically more susceptible to the coronavirus de soto 2020 this was followed by one of the earliest comprehensive papers on the pathophysiology of the virus hakim 2020 the navajo people along with other native americans are vulnerable to covid 19 due to both genetic and environmental reasons scientists de soto and hakim reported that indigenous people have an elevated ace2 receptor which serves as the entry point for the sars 2 virus into the lungs beginning the process that can lead to pulmonary and often cardiac failure de soto 2020 while it is true that navajo people suffer from high rates of obesity diabetes hypertension lung disease and autoimmune conditions this is just one factor in addition it is hard to practice proper hand hygiene when there is a lack of running potable water as over 50 of housing in the navajo nation lacks rudimentary plumbing many people must haul water but as the more physically mobile members of the family get sick they are no longer able to do so others do not have the income to purchase soap hand sanitizer or even food this is only exacerbated when they must drive an hour to the closest store only to find that such supplies are out of stock reportedly there are only 13 grocery stores throughout the reservation where shoppers can find fresh fruits and vegetables kreider 2019 moreover many homes do not have a physical address where ups or fedex can deliver items there were reportedly only 170 hospital beds 13 icu beds 52 isolation rooms and 28 ventilators on the entire reservation the navajo nation needs more allied healthcare workers laboratory technicians technologists nurses medical assistants and physician assistants to help diné communities to fulfill this need it is important to train a local workforce the navajo youth who are knowledgeable in community needs and cultural sensitivities it is vital to offer more training programs to prepare a local workforce in stem and applied biological and health sciences collectively most healthcare facilities on the reservation are providing general diagnoses at a primary level there are no molecular diagnostic laboratories at any healthcare facilities that can be utilized for quick diagnoses of presumptive covid 19 patients for all critical testing samples are sent off reservation to state laboratories not only because of a lack of facilities but also because advanced level testing requires highly skilled laboratory technicians and technologists or medical laboratory scientists who are all in short supply the resulting time lag is dangerous because delayed results can have a detrimental outcome and increase the care and cost burden on the medical facility and the patients their families and the community this situation can be improved by expanded diagnostic capabilities and a locally trained healthcare workforce within the navajo nation looking ahead on january 7 2021 it was reported that covid 19 had affected more than 87 654 861 individuals around the world as the count continued to rise at unprecedented rates although the pandemic has posed a terrible health crisis it is time to consider the deficiencies and lessons learned health facilities in tribal communities do not have all the required tools and equipment that are needed for rapid diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals for most of the services they must look to neighbouring states and border towns patients samples are sent outside the reservation and that takes time further patients must be transferred to large cities because the right resources are unavailable now is the time to discuss what we have learned from this outbreak and what we must do to prevent such situations in the future the team at the diné college school of stem was able to secure a grant from the american society for microbiology to conduct a conference entitled emerging infection tribal communities what we learned from the covid 19 pandemic held on february 19 2021 experts and tribal leaders from the u s and canada were able to come together at the same forum to share their views and experiences they discussed how different tribal communities and minorities were dealing with this monster what they were lacking and what they need that conference was an eye opener and the hope is that it will be a steppingstone for the development of advanced research and scientific facilities within tribal communities especially within the navajo nation at diné college there is a strong stem faculty with commendable backgrounds in medical science microbiology molecular biology public health biochemistry chemistry mathematics and the physical sciences within the last couple of years the college has developed a number of public health related programs recently incorporating the certified medical assistant program to that list looking forward to developing more programs in biomedical sciences medical laboratory science and medicine the college is now working to build more technologically advanced and well equipped facilities needed to provide innovative diagnostic capabilities and training for our navajo youth and communities the college seeks to train its own local workforce to combat situations like the current pandemic we want to bring infrastructure like telemedicine to our communities which can improve access to appropriate care this is why the college is working hard to identify scientific grants diné college s grant office has remained helpful in securing these opportunities and guiding the college community throughout the process conclusion diné college was among the first institutions of higher education nationwide to implement a comprehensive approach in response to the covid 19 pandemic major universities soon afterwards used diné college as a model on steps to take moreover diné college medical scientists were at the forefront of medical research to study and understand the pathophysiology of covid 19 and why native peoples are especially prone to the disease they also investigated the best methodologies of treatment indigenous and other minority medical scientists and clinicians quietly led the fight against covid 19 as indigenous administrators set the example on how to respond to the pandemic on december 6 2020 diné college medical scientists published the first comparative evaluation of the pfizer moderna sputnik and astrazeneca vaccines de soto dec 2020 additionally the college s incident command office continues to work with indian health services and 638 facilities within the navajo nation to make sure all diné college staff faculty employees and students receive vaccinations the main force behind all of diné college s achievements is our dynamic president dr charles monty roessel the year was a challenge

file in this dec 1 2020 file photo federal reserve chair jerome powell listens during a senate banking committee hearing on capitol hill in washington federal reserve officials at their april 2021 meeting reaffirmed the view that the central bank s ultra low interest rate remained the best policy approach but some officials cautioned that some factors pushing inflation higher may not be resolved quickly in minutes of their discussions released wednesday may 19 2021 a number of participants in the discussions expressed the view that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages that were pushing prices higher may not be resolved quickly and could end up putting upward pressure on prices beyond this year al drago the new york times via ap pool file washington the u s economy s faster than expected awakening from its pandemic induced slumber had some federal reserve officials last month discussing whether it might be time to start planning for easing back on one of the central bank s levers for keeping interest rates low the discussions revealed in the minutes of the fed s april meeting released wednesday marked the first time the central bank has even hinted that the time could be approaching to consider reducing the fed s 120 billion monthly bond purchases the purchases have the effect of putting downward pressure on long term interest rates recommended videos officials have been wary about broaching the subject given painful memories of the taper tantrum of 2013 when remarks by then fed chairman ben bernanke about trimming bond purchases roiled financial markets and sent market interest rates briefly surging the minutes of the april meeting said a number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the committee s goals it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases the fed has been so cautious that fed chairman jerome powell said at his april news conference that the fed was not even thinking about thinking about trimming its bond purchases the comment in the fed s minutes did not specify when talks on reducing bond purchases would begin but it was the most explicit comment by the fed that the better than expected economic performance could trigger such discussions in some future meeting in an effort to give the economy more of a boost the fed over the past year has been buying 80 billion per month in treasury bonds and 40 billion in mortgage backed bonds kathy bostjancik chief u s financial economist at oxford economics said she expects the fed to formally announce bond tapering plans at its late august conference in jackson hole wyoming with the tapering of the bond purchases beginning in early 2022 the minutes showed that fed officials had also taken notice of higher inflation readings that were have been occurring this year a number of participants in the fed s discussions expressed the view that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages that were pushing prices higher may not be resolved quickly and could end up putting upward pressure on prices beyond this year some officials said that in some industries the supply chain disruptions appeared to be more persistent than originally anticipated still even with the concerns expressed about price increases fed officials said that longer term expectations about inflation remained well anchored at levels broadly in line with the goal of annual price increases hitting the fed s 2 target after rising for a short period above that level at its april meeting the fed kept its benchmark rate at a record low of 0 to 0 25 where it has been since march 2020 when the central bank slashed rates after the pandemic hit and millions of people were losing their jobs the fed discussions took place on april 27 28 and the minutes were released with the customary three week delay the fed will next meet on june 15 16 against a backdrop of rising concerns in financial markets that inflation after years of being dormant may have started to accelerate the government reported last week that consumer prices jumped in april by 0 8 the largest monthly gain in more than a decade with prices rising across a wide range of products powell and other fed officials have insisted that the inflation seen now will prove to be transitory a product of a re opening economy and supply bottlenecks they believe that in a few months price gains will slow to a more sustainable pace however some analysts are concerned that the fed s insistence on keeping interest rates at such low levels could lead to an inflationary surge that will be hard to bring under control but powell and other officials contend that if inflation does accelerate they have the tools to bring it back under control a point that officials emphasized in the minutes
there is an investment adage that goes when the taxi driver starts the conversation and offers you some share tips that s close to the top of the market and it s time to get out this explains why i was absolutely blown away when a close family friend who has never owned a share outside their compulsory super asked me on the weekend to advise on whether he should buy 20 000 of tesla shares one of the most volatile large cap stocks in the world if not the most volatile tesla is also one of the most expensive in fact its market capitalization of us 556bn exceeds the combined worth of the four largest car manufacturers toyota volkswagen daimler and general motors i am a huge fan of the tesla product the vehicles are absolutely brilliant well designed they look great and who doesn t enjoy the idea of being able to go from 0 to 100km per hour in just 2 4 seconds moreover they are green and we all know electric vehicles are the future but that doesn t mean that i am an investor the tesla believers are extremely passionate about the company and ceo elon musk they marvel at his audacity his ingenuity his brilliance his unorthodoxy and his entrepreneurial spirit the electric vehicle and lithium ion battery revolutions are here and tesla is leading the way through spacex musk is working to democratise space travel although the payback comes from launching satellites and space delivery vehicles the non believers and there are many in this space look at the valuation of the company it trades on a forecast enterprise value revenue multiple of 11 2 times on an astronomical trailing price earnings ratio of 579 times and on a forecast forward pe multiple of 93 times they scoff at the volatility of the share price which at us 577 87 has put on 1 209 over the last five years yet over the last year it has been as high as us 900 40 and as low as us 157 00 per share tesla tsla 5 16 to 5 21 those looking to the future point to the enormous investment by tesla s competitors in electric vehicles in fact this is the only investment going on as car manufacturers rush to comply with a forthcoming european commission ban on the sale of cars and vans with internal combustion engines volvo jaguar ford europe and bentley have said they will move to an all electric line up by 2030 while volkswagen and general motors will offer a majority of zero emissions vehicles within the next 15 years with joe biden in the white house there is a similar momentum building for electric vehicles in the usa on tuesday biden visited ford s ev plant in michigan ahead of the launch of an electric vehicle model of its f 150 lightning truck ford s biggest selling vehicle by aussie standards a big ute while tesla has a huge lead in evs and batteries the other manufacturers are coming the dilemma for tesla is how to respond does it stay up market and offer high margin low volume luxury evs or does it go down market and compete in the low margin high volume mass market one thing is for sure the price of evs will come down over the next years as competition hots up betting against tesla is michael burry of the big short fame according to a filing last week he has taken a us 530m position that will pay handsomely if tesla s share price falls as it is mainly through put options his potential losses are capped but it is nevertheless a big call if he wins he will be one of the few to profit many have tried short selling tesla shares only to fall foul of musk and a rising share price a master of self publicity musk has used twitter and other media to energize the troops to lend support i am somewhat ashamed to admit that i have no firm idea where tesla s share price is heading i think it is over valued and will invariably face the headwinds of competition but i can also see the army of believers who want to back tesla and musk including a number of institutional investors so it might go up or it might go down which is sounding like a 50 50 play my advice to my friend well if you have done your research and most importantly it is money you can afford to lose go ahead the tesla share price might go back up to test its us 900 high or down to test support around us 180 if you can t afford to lose the money or don t like 50 50 plays don t invest in tesla consider some lower risk options like fang an asx exchange traded fund from etf securities that tracks an index of 10 tech stocks including tesla or onshore some blue chip stocks such as cba and csl while the latter may go down in the short term over 10 years i reckon it is a 90 10 play that they will higher in price than they are today plus pay some dividends along the way

the best inflatable spa hot tubs including the best laz y spa hot tub this article contains affiliate links we may earn a small commission on items purchased through this article but that does not

the 300 800 price tag for an inflatable one most search inquiries for inflatable hot tubs look for information on lay z spa hot tubs specifically as the brand has a reputation for providing high performing hot tubs at affordable prices they re also the brand of hot tub we ve seriously impressed with tempted here s what to know ahead of purchasing an inflatable hot tub what is an inflatable hot tub as you d imagine an inflatable hot tub is one you blow up with air most are smaller than traditional hot tubs though you can get 8 seaters which are quite large pre formed they have all the required jets the number of which depends on the model you buy and waterways which are connected to a unit housing a heater and a pump instead of being permanently plumbed into the mains you fill a hot tub from a hose instead once filled a hot tub will take between 8 12 hours to heat up depending on size the heater can keep it warm year round once turned on though although this will incur power costs for usage what do you need at home to make it work any inflatable hot tub will come with a pump that circulates the water as well as a heater to heat it for some models you ll need to have an automatic pump to inflate it though lay z tubs come with one in the set you ll also need a hose to fill it and an outdoor power supply or waterproof extension cord to power it along with the tub you ll need to purchase water filters to help protect the pump and jets from any detritus that falls into the tub you need a strong surface on which to place your tub its going to be supporting both the weight of the water it holds and the people in it what to look for find a model that has a reputation for ease of set up some inflatable hot tubs can be set up in 15 minutes but the less impressive models can take hours most have between 70 and 140 jets purchase as many jets as you can afford the boost they provide to air circulation is quite something and makes for a more massaging effect we ve

bitcoin has lost about 38 of its value since april 13 including a volatile day on wedesday example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new york even by bitcoin s standards wednesday was pretty wild the price of the famously volatile digital currency fell nearly 30 at one point after the china banking association warned member banks of the risks associated with digital currencies the decline narrowed to below 10 in the afternoon but bitcoin had still lost about 70 billion in market value in 24 hours bitcoin has lost about 38 of its value since april 13 when it hit a high of more than 64 800 according to coindesk the china warning was just the latest headwind before wednesday tesla s decision to not accept the digital currency as payment for cars after it said it would and murmurings in washington about tighter regulation of digital currencies had put pressure on bitcoin the price is still up about 31 in 2021 and nearly 300 from a year ago here s a look at bitcoin and digital currencies in general ___ how bitcoin works bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously the coins are created by users who mine them by lending computing power to verify other users transactions they receive bitcoins in exchange the coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with u s dollars and other currencies some businesses take bitcoin as payment and a number of financial institutions allow it in their clients portfolios but overall mainstream acceptance is still limited bitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next transactions can be made anonymously making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts speculators and criminals bitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet either online through an exchange like coinbase or offline on a hard drive using specialized software according to coinbase there are about 18 7 million bitcoins in circulation and only 21 million will ever exist the reason for that is unclear and where all the bitcoins are is anyone s guess what happened to the price on wednesday a statement posted on the chinese banking association s website said financial institutions should resolutely refrain from providing services using digital currencies because of their volatility virtually every cryptocurrency fell after the industry group s statement as of 4 15 p m eastern time wednesday bitcoin was down more than 7 at around 40 310 per coin most cryptocurrencies lost between 7 and 22 of their value and shares of coinbase dropped 5 4 it s not unusual for the value of bitcoin to change by thousands of dollars in a short time period though swings totaling around 20 000 in one day are extreme on the last trading day of 2020 bitcoin closed just under 30 000 in mid april it flirted with 65 000 doesn t elon musk have a role here yes and a fairly big one musk announced in february that his electric car company tesla had invested 1 5 billion in bitcoin in march tesla began accepting bitcoin as payment those actions contributed to the run up in bitcoin s price and musk also promoted the digital currency dogecoin which also spiked in value however musk reversed course in just a short time saying last week that tesla would stop accepting bitcoin because of the potential environmental damage that can result from bitcoin mining the announcement sent bitcoin falling below 50 000 and set the tone for the big pullback recently in most cryptocurrencies a number of bitcoin fans pushed back on musk s reasoning fellow billionaire mark cuban said that gold mining is much more damaging to the environment than the mining of bitcoin a 2019 study by the technical university of munich and the massachusetts institute of technology found that the bitcoin network generates an amount of co2 similar to a large western city or an entire developing country like sri lanka but a university of cambridge study last year estimated that on average 39 of proof of work crypto mining was powered by renewable energy primarily hydroelectric energy there had been some concern among bitcoin investors that tesla would sell some or all of its bitcoin holdings but musk indicated in a tweet wednesday that tesla was sticking with its investment ___ but some companies are using bitcoin the digital payment company square and its ceo jack dorsey also the ceo of twitter have been big proponents of bitcoin overstock com also accepts bitcoin and in february bny mellon the oldest bank in the u s said it would include digital currencies in the services it provides to clients and mastercard said it would start supporting select crypto currencies on its network bitcoin has become popular enough that more than 300 000 transactions typically occur in an average day according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain info still its popularity is low compared with cash and credit cards ___ there is skepticism around bitcoin yes plenty of it tracking bitcoin s price is obviously easier than trying to figure out its value which is why so many institutions experts and traders are skeptical about it and cryptocurrency in general digital currencies were seen as replacements for paper money but that hasn t happened so far federal reserve chair jerome powell has said the central bank prefers to call crypto coins crypto assets because their volatility undermines their ability to store value a basic function of a currency while some banks and financial services companies are getting in on it others are staying away ___ could a digital currency sell off cause widespread damage regulators aren t very worried about a possible crash in digital currencies dragging down the rest of the financial system or economy even with the recent sell off digital currencies have a market value of about 1 72 trillion according to the website coinmarketcap com but that pales compared with the 46 9 trillion stock market 41 3 trillion residential real estate market and nearly 21 trillion treasury market at the start of the year the european central bank said wednesday that the risk of cryptocurrencies affecting the financial system s stability looks limited at present in large part that s because they re still not widely used for payments and institutions under its purview still have little exposure to crypto linked instruments earlier this month the federal reserve said a survey of market contacts found roughly one in five cited cryptocurrencies as a potential shock to the system over the next 12 to 18 months that s a turnaround from the fall when a similar survey found none mentioning cryptocurrencies how much oversight is there washington officials have been talking about regulating digital currencies more and worries about a heavier hand have played a role in the recent swoon in prices gary gensler who took over as chairman of the securities and exchange commission last month has said that cryptocurrency markets would benefit from more oversight to protect investors in a hearing before the house s financial services committee earlier this month gensler said neither the sec nor the commodity futures trading commission which he used to head has a regulatory framework for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges yet he said he thought congress would ultimately have to address it because there s really not protection against fraud or manipulation ___ how bitcoin came to be it s a mystery bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name satoshi nakamoto bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention but proponents say that doesn t matter the currency obeys its own internal logic ___

bell tolls for john laing infrastructure champion has rolled over too quickly for private equity predators says alex brummer private equity pioneers kkr the original barbarians at the gate want stakeholders to believe they are doing them a huge favour by offering 2billion for british infrastructure giant john laing as with so many recent private equity deals for ftse 250 companies the premium to the current share price of 33 per cent looks generous but when one takes account of the hit from brexit and the pandemic the discount starts to look much thinner the strength of john laing is its ability efficiently to deliver big infrastructure projects through public private partnerships among its tangible achievements in the uk are the second severn crossing and some of the uk s big motorway projects in recent times as public private partnerships have found less favour in whitehall laing has taken its engineering and project management skills overseas working on projects in australia and north america with the biden administration aiming for a big upgrade of us infrastructure from bridges to airports and railways the opportunities for john laing skills could be considerable the overseas earnings capacity for the uk as it looks to put its expertise to work globally looks considerable kkr s infrastructure arm says nothing will change after the deal and the company founded in carlisle in 1848 will remain rooted in britain headquarters and management will remain intact all that will happen is that john laing will be de risked by having greater access to capital allowing it to manage more and bigger projects it sounds like an enticing prospect chairman will samuel and the board look to have accepted this at face value and short of rolling out the red carpet could not be more welcoming samuel argues that while the board has faith in management it worries that many initiatives are at early stage development and have execution risk if every engineering and construction group showed so little confidence in the ability of its executives and project managers to bring infrastructure to fruition nothing would be built because laing will become part of an infrastructure fund the theory is that it will be left untouched that s a proposition which is hard to swallow we know from many other private equity backed deals that pledges made at the time of takeover rarely are enforceable the object of the buyer is to use leverage or debt to the best effect and to use the privilege of opaque ownership to strip out costs and jobs john laing has rolled over too quickly and hasn t bothered with the pretence of conducting a public auction to encourage a higher price as a former director of schroders samuel is presumably confident that his former employers who hold 9pc of john laing equity will do what he wants and help the deal over the line but you can never tell steel trap the emergence of british steel owner jingye as possible buyer for sanjeev gupta s liberty steel plants in the uk could be a life saver for business secretary kwasi kwarteng he rightly has refused to have any direct dealings with gupta whose business and financial affairs are the subject of a serious fraud office investigation kwarteng s approach has been to let the constituent companies fall into the hands of the official receiver and financially support trading until a suitable buyer can be found even though there is a global steel shortage which has forced up the price of speciality metals there is no queue of buyers the difficulty is that the backlash against china on the tory benches from foreign policy hardliners such tom tugendhat makes for some uncomfortable decisions at the very least one would expect kwarteng to invoke the new national security investment act since steel must be regarded as strategic industry jingye s involvement will be a real test of resolve for the government crypto anarchy city regulator the financial conduct authority warned of the risks of consumers piling into bitcoin in january its worst fears of citizens nursing heavy losses are being borne out before our eyes with the price of the cryptocurrency plunging more than 50 per cent in the last two weeks elon musk s sudden reversal on bitcoin payments followed by china s curbs have triggered an implosion not before time

idaho lawmakers are among the first in the country to attempt to ban critical race theory in public schools conservatives across the nation have seized on the term over the past year although the concept has been around since the 1970s it s a theory underpinned by the idea systemic racism continues to exist in the united states and impacts opportunities for and treatment of people of color adrienne evans executive director of united vision for idaho said when diverse groups of students aren t included in the country s collective story it sends a powerful message about who is and isn t valued the ramifications for excluding this kind of truthful albeit hard history is deeply disturbing evans explained it has a serious impact on students and children has a serious impact on how we contextualize the world that we live in house bill 377 which passed this session withholds funding from public schools and higher education institutions if teachers compel students to adopt or affirm the tenets of critical race theory supporters said it inflames divisions among people of different backgrounds evans pointed out such conservative organizations as the american legislative exchange council have been leading the charge against critical race theory and note bills to ban or limit it have been introduced in at least ten states this is a really concentrated coordinated effort to undermine public education and to cast america as something other than what we are and that in and of itself is indoctrination evans contended evans stressed the country is doomed to repeat its past sins if it can t come together to understand its history we have to speak out loudly that this is not the kind of representation that we need and it is really deeply harmful to all of us and to our collective future together evans concluded
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video bitcoin has lost about 38 of its value since april 13 including a volatile day on wedesday new york even by bitcoin s standards wednesday was pretty wild the price of the famously volatile digital currency fell nearly 30 at one point after the china banking association warned member banks of the risks associated with digital currencies the decline narrowed to below 10 in the afternoon but bitcoin had still lost about 70 billion in market value in 24 hours bitcoin has lost about 38 of its value since april 13 when it hit a high of more than 64 800 according to coindesk the china warning was just the latest headwind before wednesday tesla s decision to not accept the digital currency as payment for cars after it said it would and murmurings in washington about tighter regulation of digital currencies had put pressure on bitcoin the price is still up about 31 in 2021 and nearly 300 from a year ago here s a look at bitcoin and digital currencies in general ___ how bitcoin works bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously the coins are created by users who mine them by lending computing power to verify other users transactions they receive bitcoins in exchange the coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with u s dollars and other currencies some businesses take bitcoin as payment and a number of financial institutions allow it in their clients portfolios but overall mainstream acceptance is still limited bitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next transactions can be made anonymously making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts speculators and criminals bitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet either online through an exchange like coinbase or offline on a hard drive using specialized software according to coinbase there are about 18 7 million bitcoins in circulation and only 21 million will ever exist the reason for that is unclear and where all the bitcoins are is anyone s guess what happened to the price on wednesday a statement posted on the chinese banking association s website said financial institutions should resolutely refrain from providing services using digital currencies because of their volatility virtually every cryptocurrency fell after the industry group s statement as of 4 15 p m eastern time wednesday bitcoin was down more than 7 at around 40 310 per coin most cryptocurrencies lost between 7 and 22 of their value and shares of coinbase dropped 5 4 it s not unusual for the value of bitcoin to change by thousands of dollars in a short time period though swings totaling around 20 000 in one day are extreme on the last trading day of 2020 bitcoin closed just under 30 000 in mid april it flirted with 65 000 doesn t elon musk have a role here yes and a fairly big one musk announced in february that his electric car company tesla had invested 1 5 billion in bitcoin in march tesla began accepting bitcoin as payment those actions contributed to the run up in bitcoin s price and musk also promoted the digital currency dogecoin which also spiked in value however musk reversed course in just a short time saying last week that tesla would stop accepting bitcoin because of the potential environmental damage that can result from bitcoin mining the announcement sent bitcoin falling below 50 000 and set the tone for the big pullback recently in most cryptocurrencies a number of bitcoin fans pushed back on musk s reasoning fellow billionaire mark cuban said that gold mining is much more damaging to the environment than the mining of bitcoin a 2019 study by the technical university of munich and the massachusetts institute of technology found that the bitcoin network generates an amount of co2 similar to a large western city or an entire developing country like sri lanka but a university of cambridge study last year estimated that on average 39 of proof of work crypto mining was powered by renewable energy primarily hydroelectric energy there had been some concern among bitcoin investors that tesla would sell some or all of its bitcoin holdings but musk indicated in a tweet wednesday that tesla was sticking with its investment ___ but some companies are using bitcoin the digital payment company square and its ceo jack dorsey also the ceo of twitter have been big proponents of bitcoin overstock com also accepts bitcoin and in february bny mellon the oldest bank in the u s said it would include digital currencies in the services it provides to clients and mastercard said it would start supporting select crypto currencies on its network bitcoin has become popular enough that more than 300 000 transactions typically occur in an average day according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain info still its popularity is low compared with cash and credit cards ___ there is skepticism around bitcoin yes plenty of it tracking bitcoin s price is obviously easier than trying to figure out its value which is why so many institutions experts and traders are skeptical about it and cryptocurrency in general digital currencies were seen as replacements for paper money but that hasn t happened so far federal reserve chair jerome powell has said the central bank prefers to call crypto coins crypto assets because their volatility undermines their ability to store value a basic function of a currency while some banks and financial services companies are getting in on it others are staying away ___ could a digital currency sell off cause widespread damage regulators aren t very worried about a possible crash in digital currencies dragging down the rest of the financial system or economy even with the recent sell off digital currencies have a market value of about 1 72 trillion according to the website coinmarketcap com but that pales compared with the 46 9 trillion stock market 41 3 trillion residential real estate market and nearly 21 trillion treasury market at the start of the year the european central bank said wednesday that the risk of cryptocurrencies affecting the financial system s stability looks limited at present in large part that s because they re still not widely used for payments and institutions under its purview still have little exposure to crypto linked instruments earlier this month the federal reserve said a survey of market contacts found roughly one in five cited cryptocurrencies as a potential shock to the system over the next 12 to 18 months that s a turnaround from the fall when a similar survey found none mentioning cryptocurrencies how much oversight is there washington officials have been talking about regulating digital currencies more and worries about a heavier hand have played a role in the recent swoon in prices gary gensler who took over as chairman of the securities and exchange commission last month has said that cryptocurrency markets would benefit from more oversight to protect investors in a hearing before the house s financial services committee earlier this month gensler said neither the sec nor the commodity futures trading commission which he used to head has a regulatory framework for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges yet he said he thought congress would ultimately have to address it because there s really not protection against fraud or manipulation ___ how bitcoin came to be it s a mystery bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name satoshi nakamoto bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention but proponents say that doesn t matter the currency obeys its own internal logic ___

bitcoin has lost about 38 of its value since april 13 including a volatile day on wedesday example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video new york even by bitcoin s standards wednesday was pretty wild the price of the famously volatile digital currency fell nearly 30 at one point after the china banking association warned member banks of the risks associated with digital currencies the decline narrowed to below 10 in the afternoon but bitcoin had still lost about 70 billion in market value in 24 hours bitcoin has lost about 38 of its value since april 13 when it hit a high of more than 64 800 according to coindesk the china warning was just the latest headwind before wednesday tesla s decision to not accept the digital currency as payment for cars after it said it would and murmurings in washington about tighter regulation of digital currencies had put pressure on bitcoin the price is still up about 31 in 2021 and nearly 300 from a year ago here s a look at bitcoin and digital currencies in general ___ how bitcoin works bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously the coins are created by users who mine them by lending computing power to verify other users transactions they receive bitcoins in exchange the coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with u s dollars and other currencies some businesses take bitcoin as payment and a number of financial institutions allow it in their clients portfolios but overall mainstream acceptance is still limited bitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next transactions can be made anonymously making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts speculators and criminals bitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet either online through an exchange like coinbase or offline on a hard drive using specialized software according to coinbase there are about 18 7 million bitcoins in circulation and only 21 million will ever exist the reason for that is unclear and where all the bitcoins are is anyone s guess what happened to the price on wednesday a statement posted on the chinese banking association s website said financial institutions should resolutely refrain from providing services using digital currencies because of their volatility virtually every cryptocurrency fell after the industry group s statement as of 4 15 p m eastern time wednesday bitcoin was down more than 7 at around 40 310 per coin most cryptocurrencies lost between 7 and 22 of their value and shares of coinbase dropped 5 4 it s not unusual for the value of bitcoin to change by thousands of dollars in a short time period though swings totaling around 20 000 in one day are extreme on the last trading day of 2020 bitcoin closed just under 30 000 in mid april it flirted with 65 000 doesn t elon musk have a role here yes and a fairly big one musk announced in february that his electric car company tesla had invested 1 5 billion in bitcoin in march tesla began accepting bitcoin as payment those actions contributed to the run up in bitcoin s price and musk also promoted the digital currency dogecoin which also spiked in value however musk reversed course in just a short time saying last week that tesla would stop accepting bitcoin because of the potential environmental damage that can result from bitcoin mining the announcement sent bitcoin falling below 50 000 and set the tone for the big pullback recently in most cryptocurrencies a number of bitcoin fans pushed back on musk s reasoning fellow billionaire mark cuban said that gold mining is much more damaging to the environment than the mining of bitcoin a 2019 study by the technical university of munich and the massachusetts institute of technology found that the bitcoin network generates an amount of co2 similar to a large western city or an entire developing country like sri lanka but a university of cambridge study last year estimated that on average 39 of proof of work crypto mining was powered by renewable energy primarily hydroelectric energy there had been some concern among bitcoin investors that tesla would sell some or all of its bitcoin holdings but musk indicated in a tweet wednesday that tesla was sticking with its investment ___ but some companies are using bitcoin the digital payment company square and its ceo jack dorsey also the ceo of twitter have been big proponents of bitcoin overstock com also accepts bitcoin and in february bny mellon the oldest bank in the u s said it would include digital currencies in the services it provides to clients and mastercard said it would start supporting select crypto currencies on its network bitcoin has become popular enough that more than 300 000 transactions typically occur in an average day according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain info still its popularity is low compared with cash and credit cards ___ there is skepticism around bitcoin yes plenty of it tracking bitcoin s price is obviously easier than trying to figure out its value which is why so many institutions experts and traders are skeptical about it and cryptocurrency in general digital currencies were seen as replacements for paper money but that hasn t happened so far federal reserve chair jerome powell has said the central bank prefers to call crypto coins crypto assets because their volatility undermines their ability to store value a basic function of a currency while some banks and financial services companies are getting in on it others are staying away ___ could a digital currency sell off cause widespread damage regulators aren t very worried about a possible crash in digital currencies dragging down the rest of the financial system or economy even with the recent sell off digital currencies have a market value of about 1 72 trillion according to the website coinmarketcap com but that pales compared with the 46 9 trillion stock market 41 3 trillion residential real estate market and nearly 21 trillion treasury market at the start of the year the european central bank said wednesday that the risk of cryptocurrencies affecting the financial system s stability looks limited at present in large part that s because they re still not widely used for payments and institutions under its purview still have little exposure to crypto linked instruments earlier this month the federal reserve said a survey of market contacts found roughly one in five cited cryptocurrencies as a potential shock to the system over the next 12 to 18 months that s a turnaround from the fall when a similar survey found none mentioning cryptocurrencies how much oversight is there washington officials have been talking about regulating digital currencies more and worries about a heavier hand have played a role in the recent swoon in prices gary gensler who took over as chairman of the securities and exchange commission last month has said that cryptocurrency markets would benefit from more oversight to protect investors in a hearing before the house s financial services committee earlier this month gensler said neither the sec nor the commodity futures trading commission which he used to head has a regulatory framework for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges yet he said he thought congress would ultimately have to address it because there s really not protection against fraud or manipulation ___ how bitcoin came to be it s a mystery bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name satoshi nakamoto bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention but proponents say that doesn t matter the currency obeys its own internal logic ___

8 seaters which are quite large pre formed they have all the required jets the number of which depends on the model you buy and waterways which are connected to a unit housing a heater and a pump

info still its popularity is low compared with cash and credit cards ___ there is skepticism around bitcoin yes plenty of it tracking bitcoin s price is obviously easier than trying to figure out its value which is why so many institutions experts and traders are skeptical about it and cryptocurrency in general digital currencies were seen as replacements for paper money but that hasn t happened so far federal reserve chair jerome powell has said the central bank prefers to call crypto coins crypto assets because their volatility undermines their ability to store value a basic function of a currency while some banks and financial services companies are getting in on it others are staying away ___ could a digital currency sell off cause widespread damage regulators aren t very worried about a possible crash in digital currencies dragging down the rest of the financial system or economy even with the recent sell off digital currencies have a market value of about 1 72 trillion according to the website coinmarketcap com but that pales compared with the 46 9 trillion stock market 41 3 trillion residential real estate market and nearly 21 trillion treasury market at the start of the year the european central bank said wednesday that the risk of cryptocurrencies affecting the financial system s stability looks limited at present in large part that s because they re still not widely used for payments and institutions under its purview still have little exposure to crypto linked instruments earlier this month the federal reserve said a survey of market contacts found roughly one in five cited cryptocurrencies as a potential shock to the system over the next 12 to 18 months that s a turnaround from the fall when a similar survey found none mentioning cryptocurrencies how much oversight is there washington officials have been talking about regulating digital currencies more and worries about a heavier hand have played a role in the recent swoon in

little stores and shanties are being opened up for business selling everything from fresh meat to ice cream cones tulsa daily world june 6 1921 the embers had barely cooled before black tulsans began rebuilding greenwood avenue amid the rubble of their beloved black wall street they found ways to keep going just as they always had black wall street rose again and fell again and for more than half the past century has been trying to figure out its place in a world so much different than the one in which greenwood flourished dwain midget a son of greenwood and black north tulsa has for more than 30 years been one of the city s top development officers he says the black wall street and greenwood avenue are not necessarily geographically intertwined black wall street is to be honored he said it s to have continual recognition and acknowledgement in history but we will never have that black wall street on greenwood again to me you remember it and then you make a new black wall street he said midget thinks the new black wall street could be north of pine street on peoria avenue an active business area is becoming more entrenched he said and housing is improving especially in the lacy park neighborhood all of that midget said began with planning 30 years ago things are happening he said they re too incremental but that s because of systemic institutionalized racism that has to be overcome it can still be done and it s being done just not fast enough as segments in a timeline the 10 decades since 1921 roughly mark stages in the life of a place and maybe even a dream greenwood says tulsa historian author and lecturer hannibal johnson is a mindset as much or more as it is a place it s psychological he said it s aspirational 1921 31 recovery defying efforts to keep them from rebuilding black tulsans erected buildings at night to evade enforcement of a fire code passed by the city commission expressly to pressure them to sell they also pulled cash from unsuspected reserves or found credit to put up new brick buildings that complied with that code by the end of july 1921 the tulsa world reported several black owners including charles m goodwin and vernon a m e church had obtained building permits ten days later the tulsa tribune said 65 wood structures and several brick ones had been completed or were under construction tulsa s 1922 city directory shows more than 80 businesses with north greenwood avenue addresses in 1926 five years after it was burned to the ground the 100 block of north greenwood alone was home to more than 50 enterprises of just about every description perhaps the crowning moment occurred in 1925 when tulsa hosted the national negro business league s annual convention 1931 1941 good bad times the 1930s were tough for most americans and black americans were certainly no exception yet somehow greenwood managed to grow and even prosper by the end of the decade the neighborhood was nearing its peak in terms of population and business activity but that success was largely built on a segregation that forced more and more black tulsans into the confines of a neighborhood with little room to grow and created a ready made customer base for the little shops lining greenwood avenue and the neighboring streets that would change dramatically in the decades ahead 1941 1951 peak years by one count the greenwood district counted almost 180 businesses and more than 1 400 residences in 1942 data compiled by researcher amanda coleman in the late 1990s indicates greenwood continued to grow through the war years to the end of the decade but in 1948 the u s supreme court ruled unconstitutional the race restrictive title covenants that effectively segregated housing in many american cities including tulsa that was good for black tulsans but not so good for greenwood 1951 1961 hollowing out the dreamland theater closed in 1952 now an iconic symbol of black wall street at its height the dreamland became one of the first casualties of the social political and economic forces conspiring against greenwood as early as 1917 the u s supreme court ruled cities and states could not segregate housing based on race but that was wired around through title covenants that prohibited the transfer of property to non whites when the title covenants were thrown out african americans were free to move out red lining and other obstacles remained to be sure but u s census data shows clearly how black tulsans spilled out of the old boundaries detroit to the old midland valley railroad tracks into adjoining neighborhoods 1961 1971 bottoming out by 1960 the city of tulsa classified half of the greenwood district s housing stock as dilapidated five years later to the dismay of many greenwood residents it initiated an urban renewal project that some might argue has never really ended the project originally encompassed only the northern portion of the greenwood neighborhood but was soon extended to the inner dispersal loop a total of 309 acres 1971 1981 urban renewal midget says community leaders such as homer johnson and later julius pegues and ralph mcintosh did their best to blunt urban renewal johnson for one predicted urban renewal would result in black tulsans losing ownership of the fading ribbon along greenwood avenue the northern half of the 309 acre project was successfully redeveloped as heritage hills but the southern half attracted little interest and zero investment 1981 1991 false promise formed in 1938 the greenwood chamber of commerce found new purpose during the urban renewal era saving what remained of deep greenwood by 1981 the only business remaining in the 100 block of north greenwood was the oklahoma eagle three other businesses a diner a small grocery and an upholstery shop held on six blocks north between haskell place and independence but would soon be gone in 1980 the greenwood chamber received a 1 6 million grant to renovate the 11 remaining buildings in deep greenwood it would be three more years though and a host of headaches before work began the renovations would not be completed until 1985 despite much fanfare the greenwood centre as it was then called landed on the commercial real estate market with a thud tenants were so scarce the city had to kick in 1 6 million to avoid a default concurrently the wheels fell off a deal to develop housing hotels and commercial space on 90 acres north of the idl with no other prospects and the economy in a swoon the city committed 6 5 million to build the university center at tulsa now oklahoma state university tulsa on the same tract adjoining it ground was broken in 1985 for the greenwood cultural center 1991 2001 reawakening by 1991 deep greenwood was again home to a handful of businesses but with no adjoining population base most of them were struggling and the complex depended largely on government offices to stay open arguably greenwood now extended as far north as turley and west into gilcrease hills and a business district was coalescing around pine street and peoria avenue in 1997 legislation creating a commission to examine the 1921 race massacre earned greenwood an international celebrity that would only grow over the next two decades 2001 2011 encroachment renewed investment in downtown tulsa brought more interest and money to the old greenwood but also what many black tulsans regarded as unwanted encroachment construction of oneok field in the historic district quashed the greenwood chamber of commerce s plans for a mixed use development on a portion of the site and led to extension of the adjoining arts district onto greenwood turf 2011 2021 centennial redevelopment of tulsa s inner city black tulsans fierce sense of ownership and the approaching 100th anniversary of the 1921 massacre have brought to the surface disagreements both old and new tenants of the greenwood centre the 11 building complex comprising the 100 block of north greenwood continued to complain about the buildings management the greenwood chamber the centre s manager says it s doing the best it can given limited revenue and aging facilities meanwhile across archer new apartments and retail space are about to open as is the greenwood rising history center that the new construction is largely owned by non blacks rankles some but is fine with others who figure the increased traffic will help everyone the decade began with the opening of john hope franklin reconciliation park two blocks west of greenwood it ll end with a once in a hundred years test of that concept
