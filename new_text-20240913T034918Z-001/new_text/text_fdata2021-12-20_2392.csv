test methods developed at virginia tech are the first to be accepted by the faa to demonstrate compliance with new regulations for a capability that s crucial for the drone industry to expand the ability to fly these aircraft over people the faa s release late last year of a rule for flights over people was a long awaited indicator of progress in an industry where technological capability has typically outstripped regulatory approvals the official acceptance of test methods known in the industry as a means of compliance adds practical value to the rule s symbolic significance the rule provided an understanding of what s required to operate over people said tombo jones the director of the virginia tech mid atlantic aviation partnership an faa designated drone test site but to utilize the rule you need a solid process to demonstrate that you meet those requirements that s what this means of compliance provides and it will make it possible to use drones efficiently and safely for a wider range of operations it also reinforces virginia tech s position at the forefront of drone integration as the regulatory paradigm in the industry shifts to allow flights to become more routine the work is the latest win in a long running collaboration between the test site known as maap and injury biomechanics experts in the department of biomedical engineering and mechanics the two nationally recognized groups decided to pool their expertise to study the risks of drone human impacts shortly after the faa released its first set of commercial drone rules in 2016 regulations which explicitly prohibited flights over people the ban has been a consistent sticking point for the industry since having to avoid flying over anyone on the ground is a significant handicap for many otherwise ideal applications for small drones imagine wedding photography for example or delivery operations in urban areas it s also a crucial building block for flying beyond visual line of sight another industry focus if you can t see the drone anymore you can t guarantee there aren t people underneath it the faa has granted waivers to this provision when an operator has made a compelling case that their planned flights were low risk these waivers allowed the industry to expand and crucially spurred research into effective test methods but each waiver applied only to a narrow set of circumstances each new type of operation needed a separate waiver the new rule swept away the bulk of the red tape that characterized the waiver system by establishing a clear universal standard linked to the injury severity if a drone demonstrably wouldn t cause injury above a certain level it could be flown over people there are still some limits related to flying over large groups transitioning from operating via waivers to operating under a rule means that you no longer have to petition the faa on the safety of each operation on a case by case basis jones said it makes it dramatically more efficient to scale toward more ambitious operations it also reduces the business risk for drone manufacturers having a clear standard provides some assurance that there s a well defined pathway to being able to operate the faa released one means of compliance along with the rule a simple formula that used a drone s mass and speed to calculate the total kinetic energy the aircraft could transfer to a person during an impact a metric correlated with the severity of a potential injury maap chief engineer robert briggs said that the formula can establish an upper limit for risk without having to conduct testing but the underlying assumptions it uses also bars most drones from meeting the standard that assumption is that your drone acts like a rigid object that when it impacts a person there s no frangibility no deformation no complex dynamics happening for some drones that may be a valid assumption but for a lot of them it s not he said during a real impact a drone can deform crack or even break into pieces completely these structural weaknesses are often engineered into the design because they dissipate some of the kinetic energy that otherwise would be transferred to whatever the aircraft hit that lost kinetic energy provides the latitude that most commercial drones will need to meet the standard set by the rule virginia tech s test methods demonstrate how much energy a particular drone is likely to transfer under realistic conditions and how that compares to a rigid object with a specified kinetic energy threshold these methods built on years of work by maap and the group of injury biomechanics researchers led by steve rowson an associate professor of biomedical engineering and mechanics at virginia tech the partnership married maap s experience evaluating risk in drone operations which has yielded copious data on how and why an impact might occur and rowson and his colleagues highly regarded techniques for recreating impacts in a laboratory setting and correlating impact characteristics to injury risk fusing their expertise enabled landmark achievements including the first nationwide waiver for drone operations over people and the first drone air carrier certification the means of compliance expands the highly specialized testing needed for specific waivers into robust generalizable procedures that can be applied to a range of aircraft and a variety of operations now that it s accepted virginia tech can work with applicants like drone manufacturers to design and conduct testing for individual models of aircraft the applicant will submit the test data to the faa as part of a declaration of compliance with the new rule in the process the testing will continue to elucidate what it takes to fly safely over people we re really approaching this as a learning exercise briggs said as we begin conducting this testing with various companies we re going to learn a lot about potential injury severity from small drones including how it scales with size and design ultimately those insights will drive safer aircraft design and operational practices and help guide evidence based regulation maap exists to inform regulation briggs said one of our primary goals is to inform the regulations that will create a safer national airspace and that includes people on the ground

pldt inc is beefing up its management bench with a familiar face with competition in the space fiercer than ever the telco giant is bringing back former tv5 president and smart wireless business head noel lorenzana this was confirmed by no less than pldt and smart ceo alfredo panlilio advertisement i am strengthening my revenue group and noel will help by coming in as an adviser he told biz buzz lorenzana is a multiawarded executive who has worked in the philippines and overseas he joined the pldt group in 2012 and after taking on several roles was soon appointed to head the group s mediaquest holdings inc the owner of tv5 he quietly left in 2016 and has kept a low profile until recently when rumors of his return to pldt surfaced panlilio has been making steady changes in the few months since taking the top post at pldt the goal of course is to steer pldt to a position to capture new opportunities in what may become the beginning of the postpandemic era next year for lorenzana curious onlookers wonder whether he will stay in an advisory position for long or if he is being primed for a bigger role within the telco group as we say here abangan miguel r camusmpic 15 advertisement it has been 15 years since businessman manuel v pangilinan led metro pacific investments corp mpic listed on the philippine stock exchange rising out of the property rubble and reinventing itself as an infrastructure focused company the strategy that has worked well was to pick up distressed assets unlock efficiencies out of brownfields and identify allied areas for expansion along the way frenemies were made and tiffs with regulators emerged which come with the turf as these infra businesses are inherently highly regulated but the group has nonetheless built a formidable portfolio of businesses that people can t live without during a dec 15 virtual program to commemorate mpic s anniversary as a public company which also served as a fitting sendoff for retiring ceo jose joey ma lim and a way to honor other company pioneers lim reminisced about the group s key milestones mpic s first infra project was water concessionaire maynilad water services inc which it bagged in partnership with dmci holdings in 2006 it was a sinking enterprise that was losing two thirds of its water revenues to pipe leakage or theft and undergoing corporate rehabilitation when the group took over today maynilad provides 24 7 service to 9 9 million people 50 percent more than the population served back in 2007 after a four year courtship with the lopez group mpic also bagged north luzon expressway nlex in 2008 marking its debut in the tollroad business from having just 64 kilometers then mpic now operates 230 kms of local tollroads plus another 174 kms overseas by next year its toll bridge in cebu will connect the city center to the mactan airport new projects will double its footprint in this space by 2023 up to 2024 when the lopezes bowed out mpic likewise bagged crown jewel manila electric co meralco now its largest business with half of electricity demand passing through its power lines furthermore meralco has built an attributable power generation capacity of 1 521 megawatts and is aggressively pursuing 2 500mw renewable energy capacity in the next seven years the group also ventured into the health care business in 2007 by investing in its first hospital makati medical center in its first year makati med s earnings surpassed that which was generated in the prior 15 years combined today the group s hospital portfolio has grown to 19 hospitals which generate revenues that are second only to meralco s lim s final story was about light rail transit 1 operator light rail manila corp unfortunately it is still work in progress and although we are extremely challenged to complete this 11 km expansion in the midst of this pandemic we remain determined to finish what we started there is light at the end of the tunnel however as we

on sunday morning fareed zakaria opened his eponymous cnn show with a bizarre opening statement claiming he was puzzled by president biden s unpopularity at the show s open zakaria led off the segment exclaiming i have to confess i find joe biden s unpopularity puzzling he s rounding out his first year in the white house with the lowest end of first year approval ratings of any elected president in modern times with the exception of donald trump why is this biden is a genial likable person many of the policies he s pursued have been popular even some with republican support the country is doing reasonably well economically equally delusional was zakaria s suggestion that biden s decline in approval ratings have coincided with the withdrawal from afghanistan the rise of delta and the onset of inflation rather than being directly caused by the disastrous afghanistan withdrawal rampant inflation and the continued rise in the delta variant instead zakaria deduced that perhaps biden s 11 point drop from roughly 56 percent after his first 100 days in office to 45 percent today is a natural result of his inherent lack of political capital growth is coming back fast but restarting the global economy after a long period of induced paralysis has caused huge logjams and hiccups for a variety of reasons he argued essentially parroting the white house s talking points before admitting some of which can be blamed on biden this ultimately wasn t true because job growth numbers were sluggish at best zakaria ended the segment seeming to give biden a pass for his performance as president while also suggesting that americans have their expectations set too high for their presidents presidents often get rewarded for being around in good times whether they caused them or not in joe biden s case he has mostly handled his job with intelligence and decency but he s paying the price for the complicated times that we are living through oh ok so biden is just a bystander and isn t responsible for anything that s happening in the country it s almost hard to believe that someone can be this out of touch with reality biden may be considered genial and likable to some but honest observers will all admit that our nation s economy is not doing reasonably well economically also inflation doesn t just happen to a country it is made possible by bad economic policies someone should ve explained this to fareed zakaria before he went on television this morning and embarrassed himself this segment of a cnn host ignorantly claiming he is puzzled by biden s unpopularity was brought to you by simplisafe and inventhelp their information is linked so you can tell them about the biased news they fund to read the relevant transcript click expand

in bitcoin the right pumped up meme stocks and nfts very little in life is black and white instead of making ironclad predictions it makes more sense to give the odds of something happening here are some of the changes that we are 30 to 65 likely to see happen in 2022 2022 will be the year for five hour days a four day workweek and flexible staggered schedules the job market has been scorchingly hot and looks like it will continue into 2022 the rationale is based upon the fact that the employment rate is almost back to where it was before the outbreak and there are now over ten million jobs currently available businesses can t find enough workers to satiate demand it s so difficult that they are offering sign on bonuses higher pay free tuition and other benefits to attract recruit and retain workers additionally business leaders acknowledged that people want to be treated as adults and offered freedom and autonomy this includes offering an array of different workstyles customized to fit their specific needs this includes providing employees with choices such as three day weekends bespoke working hours and flexibility which means a worker can decide for herself where and when they work the downside there is a 50 chance that there will be a correction in the stock and real estate markets the prices of securities and home values rose so swiftly history shows that it may be time for a correction as nothing goes up in a straight line forever if the stock market gets hit hard falling over 20 bringing down real estate too we can likely see hiring freezes put in place by companies and some downsizings as business leaders will get highly concerned over a potential crash remote work rules the pandemic showed that it wasn t necessary to schlep into the office wasting almost three hours a day and losing quality time with family that you can never get back in addition to covid 19 we had the delta variant and now omicron businesses have scraped their return to work plans it s reasonable that workers will refuse to go into crowded cities such as new york or san franscio studies showed that people said they d quit their jobs if forced to stop working from home with omicron it is almost certain that the first half of 2022 will be mostly if not all remote working mothers won t be ignored during the pandemic public schools closed and kids sent home in states including new york and new jersey working parents bore the brunt of this decision their lives were instantly turned upside down parents faced a frustratingly brutal dilemma do i keep my job or take care of the children it was reported by the national women s law center that between august and september 2020 over 800 000 women left the workforce to look after their children with the omicron variant starting to surge and a number of colleges shutting down and sending students home or told to work remotely it s only a matter of time until this happens to public schools again instead of risking the loss of working mothers who may pull out of the workforce progressive forward thinking companies will be proactive the businesses will offer flexibility and possibly child care assistance via extra compensation if the company is large enough and has sufficient resources they might consider starting their own internal childcare facility to help out working parents particularly working moms mental health and emotional wellbeing benefits 2022 will be the year in which mental health emotional wellbeing and empathy will be brought to the forefront after two years of watching people fall sick and die isolated at home pulling back from socializing and dealing with fear and anxiety business leaders will address these issues they will recognize mental health issues and offer open and honest conversations empathetic leaders will inquire about what their workers need and provide those services this could include counseling sessions with a therapist for the worker and her family passses to fitness and wellness centers mental health apps and platforms extra days off no zoom days and company wide weeks off to allow everyone to decompress the rich get richer the pandemic has swiftly increased wealth and income inequality online companies such as amazon google facebook netflix microsoft apple and zoom have performed amazingly well and the executives were richly rewarded we ve seen a k shaped recovery in which the wealthy are getting even wealthier everyone else is on a downward slope financially billionaires have reaped unfathomable amounts of more money for instance elon musk and mark zuckerberg are now members of the 100 billion club as their respective share prices rose 677 and 39 during this time period this happened as millions of average americans lost their jobs and many families struggled to make ends meet this trend will continue with the federal reserve bank printing money and massive amounts of funds available to wall street we ll continue to see ipos and spacs minting new millionaires and billionaires if the stock market continues to push higher we ll see a tremendous increase in wealth inequality even greater than we have now with the vast amount of wealth in america in the hands of a small number of people the new precariat people who go from one gig to another and digital nomads one of the most exciting things to come out of the pandemic is that both companies and workers have opened up to new ideas there is no longer the need to do things just because we ve always done it this way we re entering a time period of rapid change the great resignation has led to millions of workers quitting their jobs to find better opportunities people are taking greater risks with their careers there will be a decline in workers opting in for the stability and predictability of their 9 5 jobs and a rise of a new precariat people who live from one short term job to the next many folks have decided to get out of their homes and work from different locations people have taken to doing their jobs at the beach or near ski slopes some decided to relocate to lower cost locations within the united states to save money while still receiving the same pay adventurous types traveled to other countries as digital nomads living in different countries all over the world digital nomads predominantly young professionals without kids are moving to cool interesting places in the u s and around the world we ve already seen housing prices rise in certain locations that attracted mobile white collar workers with large disposable incomes suburbs beach towns ski areas and other interesting areas will see an influx of these professionals driving up housing prices and rental costs we could foresee competition from cities states and countries to attract this talent to boost tax revenue this already happened during the pandemic when a number of places rolled out the red carpet to entice people to relocate there and work remotely normalization of job switching when i first started recruiting if i shared a resume of a person who was at a company for only a year or so i d be chastised they d derogatively say the candidate is a job hopper and attribute negative connotations to their desire to pursue a new job so soon the hiring managers and human resource professionals would contend that the person is either a poor performer and trying to leave before they get fired or is disloyal we are in a very different era it s more transactional with the great resignation organizations realized that people won t likely stay for too long silicon valley accounts for the most rapid changes in technology software and business styles it s been an enormous wealth creator also it has the highest employee turnover rate employees want to learn as much as possible at their job and build out networks with the people they interact with and get to know at the company armed with new knowledge and robust connections the person feels free to move onto another opportunity then the person will do the same thing again and again learn as much as possible widen your network and when it s time move on by jumping ship you can exponentially increase your exposure to smart people who can help with your career the hot job market has a drawback companies compromise on quality hires which are holding businesses back companies are battling to find hire and keep workers it s not easy in this new era people are emboldened to leave one sector and try something new many older workers left the job market because either they ve done well with their investments and saw the prices of their homes dramatically increase unfortunate seasoned workers left the job market because they couldn t secure a new job the flow of new immigrants who may have taken jobs appreciably slowed during the virus outbreak and the improved economy created new unfilled jobs the current job market is so incredibly challenging that companies are forced to compromise on the quality of candidates just to get the help to compound the problem by bringing aboard people who don t possess all of the needed skills and experiences it holds business back the recruiter role will proactively change in a hot job market recruiters are in big demand recruiting will change with the times the standard practice of hiring was to wait for an opening and then recruit to fill it with millions of americans quitting their jobs and over 10 million jobs open there is a dire need to think differently instead of sitting around and waiting companies looking to stay competitive will need to search for and engage with talent on a continual basis to accelerate their hiring this could alter the way recruiters work they ll need to be strategic and offer a continual personalized reach out to potential candidates in house corporate talent acquisition professionals must stay in close touch nurturing relationships with potential future applicants and build a solid pipeline so their company won t struggle when there is attrition and seats must be quickly filled there will be a rapid increase in venture capital investment in human resources software to support these efforts by increasing efficiencies and accelerating a strong pipeline of qualified and interested candidates in a way that hr teams alone cannot achieve employer branding will be key in 2022 businesses advertise their goods and services to obtain customers in a tight job market with no end in sight employers will need to brand themselves as a great place to work too brand recognition will rise to a top priority for companies in 2022 businesses will need to effectively communicate benefits perks and most importantly culture to attract talent and stay viable hr teams need to prioritize employer brand initiatives or even define and hire for a head of employer brand role to convey their culture values and vision and this effort shouldn t end at the exit interview company brand and culture should extend further to ensure employees are ambassadors for life why your future interview or job may be in the metaverse living in the real world hasn t been too great over the last two years we ve confronted covid 19 the killing of george floyd endless fighting about politics social unrest and the disastrous aftermath of afghanistan among other travails all these real world problems may make you yearn for a better place what s wild is that a brave new world is being created it s called the metaverse the term refers to a collective virtual space in which people can interact with each other in an augmented reality instead of zoom calls you can interact with coworkers and clients in a virtual environment that feels real the metaverse will offer new exciting opportunities to people it could be an enhanced work from home experience that makes you feel part of the team and not isolated alone in your apartment you can go on interviews communicate with clients and build businesses it feels that if this works there s an unlimited possibility of what can happen in a new virtual reality the omicron variant made companies reconsider their return to office plans there is a famous quote in the movie godfather just when i thought i was out they pull me back in it feels this way with the never ending pandemic there are brief glimpses of hope that it s over then suddenly a new variant surges the back and forth is not fair to workers and their families they re pressured to prepare and then rearrange childcare and other commitments people are not able to make long term plans if they don t know if they ll be told to come into an office or not both workers and companies will come to the conclusion that returning to an office will not happen for at least the first half of 2022 in places like new york which was the original epicenter in the u s of covid 19 is now closing broadway shows and other events it s too risky for companies to make people take mass transit walk on crowded streets and have to be careful keeping socially distant in the office it s too much to handle as everyone s already frazzled for the foreseeable future the majority of people especially those working in big cities will be sent home to work
chinese loans and nigeria s sovereign immunity many nigerians are worried that the country is drowning in debt there is hardly a month the federal government does not talk about borrowing either commercial loans or the concessionary type however what is giving nigerians serious cause for concern is the possibility that china one nigeria s creditors may have planted a clause in the agreement that will force nigeria to give up its critical national assets if it fails to repay the loans assistant editor nduka chiejina reports on the status of the sovereign immunity clause nigerians once again suffered a panic attack when it was rumoured that the chinese government was taking over the ugandan international airport in entebe the basis for the alleged chinese takeover of entebe international airport was the inability of the ugandan government to meet its obligation to pay back the loan it collected from the chinese government in august 2020 there was a raging debate that the federal government has signed away the country s sovereignty to china by endorsing a clause which suggested that nigeria will waive its sovereignty and allow china to take over national assets it deems fit in place of the unserviced loan one year after the ugandan rumour has thrown up questions again about what nigeria has pledged to china as collateral for the loans collected what the government says the director general of the debt management office dmo ms patience oniha has assured nigerians that there is no threat to the nation s assets to ensure the safety of these assets oniha said nigeria prioritises debt service several measures which operate seamlessly have been put in place to ensure that data on debt are available and that debt is serviced as at when due she went on provisions are made explicitly for debt service on external debt and domestic debt in the annual budgets the dmo maintains proper records of debts domestic and external provides projections for debt service which are captured explicitly as debt service in the annual budgets and processes the actual payments for the debt service in conjunction with the office of the accountant general of the federation and central bank of nigeria government is so serious about servicing its debts so much so that proving funds for debt servicing takes utmost precedence when preparing the nation s annual budget while other segments of national life have to settle for debt service left over oniha stated that before any foreign loan is contracted including through the issuance of eurobonds they are approved by the federal executive council and thereafter national assembly the terms and conditions of the chinese and other loans she said are meticulously read through by officials of the federal ministry of justice before the federal ministry of finance signs off on the documents according to her an important and extremely critical step is that the loan agreements are cleared and approved by the federal ministry of justice and an opinion is issued by the honourable attorney general of the federation and minister of justice before the agreements are signed with regards to a party not meeting its end of the agreement oniha stated that the loan agreements provide that where there is a dispute between the parties the first action is that the parties should resolve it within themselves and if that fails they go to arbitration in other words a lender in this case china would not just possess an asset at the first sign of a dispute including defaults since june 2020 the dmo has been sensitizing nigerians on the issue of china loans through a publication on the dmo s website and has since then published information projects loan amount interest rate etc on all china loans to nigeria on its website how much loan has nigeria taken from china as of march 31 2020 the total borrowing by nigeria from china was usd3 121 billion n1 126 68 billion at usd n361 this amount represents only 3 94 per cent of nigeria s total public debt of usd79 303 billion n28 628 49 billion at usd n361 as of march 31 2020 similarly in terms of external sources of funds loans from china accounted for 11 28 per cent of the external debt stock of usd27 67 billion on the same date this data the dmo said shows that china is not a major source of funding for the nigerian government what are the terms of the loans from china and what were they used for the total borrowing from china of usd3 121 billion as of march 31 2020 are concessional loans with interest rates of 2 50 per cent per annum the tenor of twenty years that is 20 years to repay the loan and grace period moratorium of seven years these terms the dmo said are in accordance with the provisions of section 41 1a of the fiscal responsibility act 2007 in addition the low interest rate reduces the interest cost to government while the long tenor enables the repayment of the principal sum of the loans over many years these two benefits make the provisions for debt service in the annual budget lower than they would otherwise have been if the loans were on commercial terms the usd3 121 billion chinese loans are project tied the projects 11 in number as at march 31 2020 include the nigerian railway modernization project idu kaduna section abuja light rail project four airport terminals expansion project abuja kano lagos and port harcourt nigerian railway modernization project lagos ibadan section and rehabilitation and upgrading of abuja keffi makurdi road project the impact of these loans oniha said is not only evident but visible for instance the idu kaduna rail line has become a major source of transportation between abuja and kaduna also the new international airport in abuja has improved air transportation for the populace while the lagos ibadan rail line when completed will ease traffic on the busy lagos ibadan expressway the projects also have the added benefits of job creation not only by themselves but through direct and indirect service providers a number of which are small and medium enterprises it is widely accepted that investment in infrastructure is one of the most effective tools for countries to achieve economic growth and development using loans from china to finance infrastructure is thus in alignment with this position the dmo boss said what the lawyers say a former president of the nigerian bar association nba dr olisa agbakoba san told the nation last year that he believes there is nothing to worry about he dismissed the claim that the sovereign immunity clause will oust the country s immunity the contentious clause states that the borrower hereby irrevocably waives any immunity on the grounds of sovereign or otherwise for itself or its property in connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to article 8 5 thereof with the enforcement of any arbitral award pursuant thereto except for the military assets and diplomatic assets agbakoba described the clause as a standard contractual provision that is introduced when two sovereigns are doing business like china and nigeria or a non sovereign and a sovereign are doing business it is for the sovereign debtor such as nigeria to have her credit assessed speaking further agbakoba lamented that africa s credit rating is sub optimal no bank in nigeria will give a loan unless there are assurances of it being repaid if you re the governor of a state the bank manager will ask if i give you a loan will you not invoke your immunity and you say no then the manager will say let us have it in the contract that in the event you default you will not invoke your immunity so it s actually a waiver of immunity clause not a sovereign immunity clause he added that if you have good standing internationally for instance america will not waive its sovereign immunity because america is good for credit unfortunately few african countries are not good for credit so it is the creditworthiness issue that is the problem when the controversy over the chinese loans and possible forfeiture of some critical national assets to china in the event nigeria fails to pay back the loan was raging agbakoba said when the national assembly began to make all the noise it beat me hollow they absolutely got it wrong there s nothing like a sovereign immunity clause it s a contractual clause that simply says if you don t pay we ll go after your assets however mr norrison quakers san who also spoke to the nation on the issue last year disagreed with agbakoba according to him no country will willingly cede its sovereignty to another country on the basis of a contractual arrangement he observed that the agreement seemed to put china in a position of power over nigeria quakers said as far as i am concerned i haven t seen the agreement itself but i ve read some extracts here and there concerning the clause the only thing i see there is like an unfair contract a situation where someone has an upper hand an edge over you by saying ok you want this facility i ll give it to you but in the unlikely event of a default you will not define assets that i will hold on to to liquidate the debts what the analyst says dr uche igwe a senior political economy analyst and visiting fellow at the lse firoz lalji centre for africa in his article what do sovereign immunity clauses mean for chinese engagement with africa noted that while the economic relationship between china and many african countries is on the rise speculations are rife that the chinese government has a hidden agenda many see sovereign immunity clauses in chinese loan agreements as a ploy to re colonise africa from the back while others ask whether these loans form debt trap diplomacy igwe noted that chinese engagement with african countries has spanned over two decades traversing trade investment infrastructure financing and aid during this period china has catapulted from being a relatively small investor to the highest creditor in sub saharan africa the nature of these loans as well as the processes of procuring them he said are often opaque and confidential widespread allegations of bribery and kickback have continued to fuel acrimonious debates and political cacophony across the continent speaking on the controversial sovereign immunity clause igwe admitted that it is included in most standard chinese agreements the apparent reason is to prevent countries from raising sovereign immunity as a defence in case of any legal dispute however many politicians and opinion leaders in nigeria vehemently disagree rather they insist that many of the loans are trojan horses with hidden intentions that could lead to the surrender of choice sovereign assets he said igwe said some critics describe it as predatory lending and insist that the government in beijing is deliberately on a global lending spree showering african countries with billions of dollars in exchange for natural resources long term concessions as well as economic and political influence china is accused of systematically piling up a debt burden on african countries to a point where they will be struggling to pay the money back they are said to insist on juicy national assets as collateral for such loans yet china is reportedly reluctant to grant debt relief to africa to enable these poorer countries to cope with the economic havoc wreaked by the pandemic loans from china now 3 59bn says dmo the debt management office has clarified that loans from china to nigeria which presently stood at 3 59bn constitutes only 9 4 per cent of the country s total foreign debt stock of 37 9bn the director general of dmo ms patience oniha made this known in an interview with the news agency of nigeria on saturday in abuja she also clarified that the loans were largely concessional as no national asset was tagged as collateral nan reports that in recent times both the social and mainstream media have been awash with news about some african countries including nigeria facing the threat of losing some critical national assets to the asian country due to high level indebtedness nigeria s total debt stock as at september 30 was 37 9bn this figure comprised the external debt stock of the federal government 36 state governments and the federal capital territory but total loans from china stands at 3 59 billion dollars which is 9 47 per cent of the total external debt the loans did not require any national asset as collateral they were largely concessional she said oniha urged nigerians to always endeavour to verify sensitive information from official sources before disseminating it she explained that before foreign loans were contracted very sensitive steps were taken by multiple institutions of government to ensure that they were beneficial to the nation before any foreign loan is contracted including the issuance of eurobond they are approved by the federal executive council and thereafter the national assembly an important and extremely critical step is that the loan agreements are approved by the federal ministry of justice an opinion is issued by the attorney general of the federation and minister of justice before the agreements are signed several measures which operate seamlessly have been put in place to ensure that data on debt are available and that debt is serviced as at when due provisions are made explicitly for debt service in the annual budgets she said oniha explained that the loans agreements provided a number of steps to take to resolve dispute when they arise the first action is that the parties should resolve it within themselves and if that fails they go to arbitration in other words a lender in this case china would not just pounce on an asset at the first sign of a dispute including defaults the she said she explained that the dmo maintained proper records of debts provided projections for debt service and processed the actual payments for debt service she pointed out that those functions were carried out in conjunction with the office of the accountant general of the federation oagf and the central bank of

in the months since president joe biden warned russia s vladimir putin that he needed to crack down on ransomware gangs in his country there hasn t been a massive attack like the one last may that resulted in gasoline shortages but that s small comfort to ken trzaska trzaska is president of lewis clark community college a small illinois school that canceled classes for days after a ransomware attack last month that knocked critical computer systems offline that first day trzaska said i think all of us were probably up 20 plus hours just moving through the process trying to get our arms around what happened even if the united states isn t currently enduring large scale front page ransomware attacks on par with ones earlier this year that targeted the global meat supply or kept millions of americans from filling their gas tanks the problem hasn t disappeared in fact the attack on trzaska s college was part of a barrage of lower profile episodes that have upended the businesses governments schools and hospitals that were hit the college s ordeal reflects the challenges the biden administration faces in stamping out the threat and its uneven progress in doing so since ransomware became an urgent national security problem last spring u s officials have recaptured some ransom payments cracked down on abuses of cryptocurrency and made some arrests spy agencies have launched attacks against ransomware groups and the u s has pushed federal state and local governments as well as private industries to boost protections yet six months after biden s admonitions to putin it s hard to tell whether hackers have eased up because of u s pressure smaller scale attacks continue with ransomware criminals continuing to operate from russia with seeming impunity administration officials have given conflicting assessments about whether russia s behavior has changed since last summer further complicating matters ransomware is no longer at the top of the u s russia agenda with washington focused on dissuading putin from invading ukraine the white house said in a statement that it was determined to fight all ransomware through its various tools but that the government s response depends on the severity of the attack there are some that are law enforcement matters and others that are high impact disruptive ransomware activity posing a direct national security threat that require other measures the white house statement said ransomware attacks in which hackers lock up victims data and demand exorbitant sums to return it surfaced as a national security emergency for the administration after a may attack on colonial pipeline which supplies nearly half the fuel consumed on the east coast the attack prompted the company to halt operations causing gas shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the u s should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the u s provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer one reason may be increased u s government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russia based virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen ___ suderman reported from richmond virginia

on sunday morning fareed zakaria opened his eponymous cnn show with a bizarre opening statement claiming he was puzzled by president biden s unpopularity at the show s open zakaria led off the segment exclaiming i have to confess i find joe biden s unpopularity puzzling he s rounding out his first year in the white house with the lowest end of first year approval ratings of any elected president in modern times with the exception of donald trump why is this biden is a genial likable person many of the policies he s pursued have been popular even some with republican support the country is doing reasonably well economically equally delusional was zakaria s suggestion that biden s decline in approval ratings have coincided with the withdrawal from afghanistan the rise of delta and the onset of inflation rather than being directly caused by the disastrous afghanistan withdrawal rampant inflation and the continued rise in the delta variant instead zakaria deduced that perhaps biden s 11 point drop from roughly 56 percent after his first 100 days in office to 45 percent today is a natural result of his inherent lack of political capital growth is coming back fast but restarting the global economy after a long period of induced paralysis has caused huge logjams and hiccups for a variety of reasons he argued essentially parroting the white house s talking points before admitting some of which can be blamed on biden this ultimately wasn t true because job growth numbers were sluggish at best zakaria ended the segment seeming to give biden a pass for his performance as president while also suggesting that americans have their expectations set too high for their presidents presidents often get rewarded for being around in good times whether they caused them or not in joe biden s case he has mostly handled his job with intelligence and decency but he s paying the price for the complicated times that we are living through oh ok so biden is just a bystander and isn t responsible for anything that s happening in the country it s almost hard to believe that someone can be this out of touch with reality biden may be considered genial and likable to some but honest observers will all admit that our nation s economy is not doing reasonably well economically also inflation doesn t just happen to a country it is made possible by bad economic policies someone should ve explained this to fareed zakaria before he went on television this morning and embarrassed himself this segment of a cnn host ignorantly claiming he is puzzled by biden s unpopularity was brought to you by simplisafe and inventhelp their information is linked so you can tell them about the biased news they fund to read the relevant transcript click expand

vascepa amr 101 vascepa a prescription grade ultra pure omega 3 fatty acid derived from fish oil in july 2012 the u s food and drug administration fda first approved vascepa to treat patients with very high levels of triglycerides tg a type of fat found in blood and in december 2019 expanded the label to include the reduction of cardiovascular disease events including heart attack stroke and cardiovascular death in high risk patients to protect its market share amarin sought and obtained dozens of u s patents in connection with vascepa including for its formulation and method of use indeed going into the class period vascepa stood to have patent protection until 2030 when the last patent was set to expire at the same time amarin was engaged in patent litigation against applicants who submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas for generic drug products of vascepa exposing the company to real risks related to the validity and scope of coverage in its patent portfolio the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i there was an increasingly high risk that certain of amarin s patents would be invalidated ii once the district court invalidated certain of amarin s patents there was little to no chance of reversing that ruling iii the company s litigation was preventing it from effectuating a successful takeover iv defendants were downplaying the true threat the ongoing anda litigation posed to the company s business and future prospects and v as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times after markets closed on march 30 2020 defendants partially revealed the truth about the strength of amarin s patent portfolio that day the company announced that the united states district court for the district of nevada s rul in favor of the generic companies in the company s patent litigation against two filers of abbreviated new drug applications or andas for amarin s vascepa icosapent ethyl capsule franchise on this news amarin s share price plummeted over 70 5 to close at 4 00 on march 31 2020 on heavy trading volume analysts recognized that investors were beginning to learn about weaknesses in the patent protection the company had touted as seeking alpha sa news editor stephen alpher noted in an article titled amarin plunges after court decision on vascepa on march 30 2020 the company has lost its patent battle against generics to allay investor concerns defendant john f thero thero the company s president and chief executive officer ceo provided reassurance that e believe we are favorably situated to obtain an injunction against generic launch pending appeal subject to our posting a bond to secure generics lost profits in the event that generics prevail on appeal thus despite amarin s loss in the district court defendants expressed confidence in the appeal and in the strength of their patent portfolio and business prospects boasting that the company was continuing to pursue additional regulatory approval in other countries consequently investors saw the potential for a revival of amarin s key patents and still believed the company was a viable m a target then starting at 10 00 am et on september 2 2020 the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit held an oral argument for the company s patent litigation the very next day the federal circuit affirmed the district court s ruling as the oral argument had progressed and the federal circuit s ruling had become known to investors amarin s share price fell over 34 5 to close at 4 30 on september 4 2020 on heavy trading volume as the truth about the company s patent portfolio continued to emerge as sa news editor douglas w house noted on september 2 2020 arguments by attorneys representing the company are not going that well shares are down 27 on almost 7x higher volume 2 1 2 hours into session another sa analyst similarly noted on september 6 2020 amarin shares have taken a beating this week during the appellate hearing and especially after the adverse ruling came down on september 3 despite the appellate loss the company continued to assure investors about the strength of its patent portfolio on september 3 2020 the company issued a press release stating that it would be filing a petition with the u s supreme court for an en banc review of the federal circuit s decision and continuing to pursue additional regulatory approvals for vascepa in china europe and the additional countries in the middle east the company further stated that eographies outside the united states in which vascepa is sold and under regulatory review are not subject to this litigation and judgment no generic litigation is pending outside the united states as a result the market still believed that the company was a desirable target and well positioned to effectuate a successful takeover then on april 12 2021 amarin announced the retirement of defendant thero as president and ceo and the appointment of the company s senior vice president and head of commercial for europe karim mikhail mikhail as his successor effective august 1 2021 in announcing the ceo succession plan the company highlighted that previously mikhail had been responsible for reversing decline in the u s market and globally accelerating revenue by an additional 380 million through the launch of atozet and driving ebitda growth through international expansion prior to that mr mikhail led the successful commercial launch of dozens of products including ezetimibe and various molecules in diabetes hypertension immunology and oncology and served as merck s chief marketing officer for europe middle east and africa and chief operating officer for emerging markets on this news the company s share price fell over 14 3 to close at 5 08 on april 13 2021 on heavy trading volume as one analyst explained it on april 12 2021 amarin nvestors may be disappointed in the transition and that it may signal no near term m a on the table which is the clear and primary bull case to the stock however the strategic move could finally unlock the ompany s value because as noted on april 13 2021 by another analyst while defendant thero deserves some credit for overseeing the completion of the landmark reduce it trial he also must take responsibility for their legal failures their underwhelming sales performance and the share price for the new era mikhail brings with him substantial connections in europe from his time with merck despite defendants consistent reassurances in the strength of amarin s patent portfolio and its abilities to vigorously defend this critical asset on june 21 2021 investors learned that the supreme court rejected the ompany s bid to revive vascepa

presidents founding father john adams was the first vice president of the united states and then the second president his son john quincy adams became the sixth president his other son charles adams failed to live up to his family name charles had drinking problems for most of his life problems that started as early as 15 at that age charles was already studying law at harvard which almost kicked him out for running naked through the harvard yard while drunk there were moments when charles seemed to get his life together he graduated law school started a family and even had his own practice in new york after apprenticing to founding father alexander hamilton however he also invested in shady dealings and lost a lot of money that didn t belong to him charles s financial problems only exacerbated his drinking by the time he was 30 charles had abandoned his practice completely in 1798 john adams completely disowned his son calling him a madman possessed by the devil he swore never

prospects that were cut off 7 rainer hoess grandson disowns mass murderer auschwitz commandant watch this video on youtube just to be clear this is a case where being the black sheep is a good thing rainer hoess was disowned by his family and was considered a traitor for being the only one to regard his grandfather rudolf hoess as the monster that he was rudolf hoess was a nazi officer who served as commandant of the auschwitz concentration camp he introduced zyklon b to the gas chamber thus turning his camp into the most efficient killing machine in the history of humanity each day rainer s grandfather would kill 20 000 people by dinnertime reasoning that he was only doing his job despite this hoess was a hero in the family his son rainer s father hans jurgen grew up in the villa next to auschwitz he would play in the garden while thousands of people were being killed just a stone s throw away later on as a father hans would not allow anyone to disparage hoess according to rainer there was a dictatorship where you had to admire my grandfather like a hero as a teenager rainer found out the truth about rudolf hoess it was not a subject that many discussed openly every member of his family kept up the image of the good commandant except rainer s mother who was his only ally and frequently suffered for it at the hands of his father when he was 16 rainer ran away from home and never looked back now he spends his time speaking at schools against extremism 6 benson ford jr the ford name is automotive royalty ever since henry ford pictured above founded the ford motor company in 1903 since then it has become one of the largest automakers in the world and the company has stayed in the family for more than a century after henry ford died his son edsel assumed the leadership position in turn he passed it to his firstborn son henry ford ii william clay ford jr great grandson of henry is the current executive chairman of the company one member of the ford family who didn t live up to his lofty expectations is benson ford jr another great grandson of henry ford in his youth he was content to coast by on his family fortune preferring a lifestyle filled with parties gambling fast cars and drugs eventually he was persuaded to start learning the family business but even his own father was wary of placing the fate of the ford motor company in his hands that s why benson sr left his son a fortune in company stock but placed voting rights in the hands of a trustee unhappy with the decision benson has been arguing over ownership of the company since the 80s he s also been arrested on drug charges on more than one occasion and been accused of real estate fraud his most bizarre event was in a 1983 lawsuit where benson gave sworn testimony that he was part of a team ready to kill anyone including other fords to get him on the board of directors 5 donald nixon photo via wikimedia american presidents with embarrassing brothers is tradition by this point bill clinton had to deal with his brother roger s antics and billy carter even used his newfound fame to promote his own brew called billy beer donald nixon doesn t get brought up a lot mostly because richard nixon didn t need help in tarnishing his family legacy but he actually had a significant negative influence on his brother s political career it all started way before nixon s first presidential campaign in 1960 donald had ambitions of opening his own chain of restaurants called nixon s however the people didn t seem to have an appetite for nixonburgers and the chain was struggling on the verge of bankruptcy donald accepted a loan from howard hughes in 1956 of 205 000 fast forward a few years to richard s first presidential campaign and allegations that the nixons were in hughes s pocket started cropping up after losing the election to kennedy those same allegations haunted nixon during his failed candidacy for the governorship of california in his book nixon revealed that his brother donald felt horrible for potentially costing his brother the elections but richard never blamed him however during the watergate scandal it was revealed that while president nixon had the secret service wiretap his brother s phone to be aware of any similar problems that would jeopardize his 1972 reelection bid 4 king george iv photo via wikimedia the house of hanover left a profound mark on the history of great britain however not all members were a credit to their name george iv in particular became and remains to this day a royal punch line regarded as one of the worst monarchs in the history of great britain george s own father king george iii was nothing to brag about he was the mad king who lost america however george iv s extravagant lifestyle and penchant for self indulgence turned him into a national embarrassment even before he took the throne in 1820 there was a huge disconnect between how george expected to be perceived and the actions he took to achieve that image he accumulated giant art collections he organized sumptuous parties and pageants that were nothing more than strokes to his ego he became renowned for his army of mistresses as well as his poor treatment of his wife caroline of brunswick by the end of his life george s indulgent lifestyle turned him into a sickly bloated man who rarely left his private quarters when he died it became clear how little people cared for him the times s obituary said there never was an individual less regretted by his fellow creatures than this deceased king the duke of wellington called george the worst man he fell in with in his whole life and the king s courtier charles greville said a more contemptible cowardly selfish unfeeling dog does not exist 3 jessica mitford photo

i know christmas is near when i see grocery stores stock up on their oyster offerings maybe it s because i live in the midwest and oysters are a specialty imagine my confusion if i lived on either coast where oysters are probably plentiful like just on a normal tuesday of any week of any month of the year no i see oysters and immediately my mouth waters and i think of all of the christmas eves of my past where this amazing little pocket of deliciousness was the star of the stew and a staple in our household before opening presents that night dad always made the oyster stew and other than eating the scum the weird top film of milk that floated on top of the stew he served mom and my sister and me before he sat down to eat many times my little sister would be ready for her second bowl before dad took a bite of his first he took painstaking effort to count out each oyster so it was always even in everyone s bowl i realize now that he was probably doing this for a couple reasons 1 to make sure his daughters didn t fight over who got more and 2 to conserve the oysters because they ve always been expensive in the middle of the country to this day i think of dad every time i have oyster stew and it took almost half a century for me to know that i could have oyster stew even when it wasn t christmas eve it also took that long for me to realize mom knows how to make stellar oyster stew as well and yes it took entirely too long for me to learn to make my own oyster stew and i had to call my mom and sister for directions since dad had passed away and i could no longer learn from the oyster maker extraordinaire it turns out i am not that gifted in the kitchen oh i can make almost anything but it takes me four times as long as the average cook to do so i ve never been one to just whip something up i have to plan shop accordingly and have a whole day to make something this is why i ve always said my boys will only have to pass down two of my recipes with their future families popcorn and splendiferous salads which happen to be huge lettuce salads with whatever veggies shredded cheese meat seasonings i have on hand to make the salad special and splendiferous yes oyster stew seemed way out of my pay scale in the kitchen certainly it was much too complicated for a kitchen kook like i am to whip up with some practice even on non christmas eves i have perfected my recipe although i still need to consult my mom and sister almost every time i make it my mouth is watering just thinking about it it s ironic that i love it so much as i m a bit lactose intolerant and really despise milk plop those little oysters butter worcestershire and salt pepper vermont seasoning in that warm liquid though and i will eat it til the cows come home now that my version almost rivals that of my dad s you d think my family would be in culinary heaven every christmas eve not so i must have gone wrong somewhere in training my sons to love one of the most delicious things on this earth maybe i didn t play it up enough maybe i secretly didn t want to share the limited number of oysters with them maybe gasp they take after their father who loves a can of smoked oysters but just tolerates oyster stew if he absolutely has to i fear my love of oyster stew may stop with me unless i can train a future grandchild to slurp it up and beg for 2nds and 3rds of the magical liquid it just occurred to me what i can do to ensure this tradition lives on i ll train myself to eat the scum

toll free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased amarin is a biopharmaceutical company whose lead product since 2008 is vascepa amr 101 vascepa a prescription grade ultra pure omega 3 fatty acid derived from fish oil in july 2012 the u s food and drug administration fda first approved vascepa to treat patients with very high levels of triglycerides tg a type of fat found in blood and in december 2019 expanded the label to include the reduction of cardiovascular disease events including heart attack stroke and cardiovascular death in high risk patients to protect its market share amarin sought and obtained dozens of u s patents in connection with vascepa including for its formulation and method of use indeed going into the class period vascepa stood to have patent protection until 2030 when the last patent was set to expire at the same time amarin was engaged in patent litigation against applicants who submitted abbreviated new drug applications andas for generic drug products of vascepa exposing the company to real risks related to the validity and scope of coverage in its patent portfolio the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i there was an increasingly high risk that certain of amarin s patents would be invalidated ii once the district court invalidated certain of amarin s patents there was little to no chance of reversing that ruling iii the company s litigation was preventing it from effectuating a successful takeover iv defendants were downplaying the true threat the ongoing anda litigation posed to the company s business and future prospects and v as a result the company s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times after markets closed on march 30 2020 defendants partially revealed the truth about the strength of amarin s patent portfolio that day the company announced that the united states district court for the district of nevada s rul in favor of the generic companies in the company s patent litigation against two filers of abbreviated new drug applications or andas for amarin s vascepa icosapent ethyl capsule franchise on this news amarin s share price plummeted over 70 5 to close at 4 00 on march 31 2020 on heavy trading volume analysts recognized that investors were beginning to learn about weaknesses in the patent protection the company had touted as seeking alpha sa news editor stephen alpher noted in an article titled amarin plunges after court decision on vascepa on march 30 2020 the company has lost its patent battle against generics to allay investor concerns defendant john f thero thero the company s president and chief executive officer ceo provided reassurance that e believe we are favorably situated to obtain an injunction against generic launch pending appeal subject to our posting a bond to secure generics lost profits in the event that generics prevail on appeal thus despite amarin s loss in the district court defendants expressed confidence in the appeal and in the strength of their patent portfolio and business prospects boasting that the company was continuing to pursue additional regulatory approval in other countries consequently investors saw the potential for a revival of amarin s key patents and still believed the company was a viable m a target then starting at 10 00 am et on september 2 2020 the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit held an oral argument for the company s patent litigation the very next day the federal circuit affirmed the district court s ruling as the oral argument had progressed and the federal circuit s ruling had become known to investors amarin s share price fell over 34 5 to close at 4 30 on september 4 2020 on heavy trading volume as the truth about the company s patent portfolio continued to emerge as sa news editor douglas w house noted on september 2 2020 arguments by attorneys representing the company are not going that well shares are down 27 on almost 7x higher volume 2 1 2 hours into session another sa analyst similarly noted on september 6 2020 amarin shares have taken a beating this week during the appellate hearing and especially after the adverse ruling came down on september 3 despite the appellate loss the company continued to assure investors about the strength of its patent portfolio on september 3 2020 the company issued a press release stating that it would be filing a petition with the u s supreme court for an en banc review of the federal circuit s decision and continuing to pursue additional regulatory approvals for vascepa in china europe and the additional countries in the middle east the company further stated that eographies outside the united states in which vascepa is sold and under regulatory review are not subject to this litigation and judgment no generic litigation is pending outside the united states as a result the market still believed that the company was a desirable target and well positioned to effectuate a successful takeover then on april 12 2021 amarin announced the retirement of defendant thero as president and ceo and the appointment of the company s senior vice president and head of commercial for europe karim mikhail mikhail as his successor effective august 1 2021 in announcing the ceo succession plan the company highlighted that previously mikhail had been responsible for reversing decline in the u s market and globally accelerating revenue by an additional 380 million through the launch of atozet and driving ebitda growth through international expansion prior to that mr mikhail led the successful commercial launch of dozens of products including ezetimibe and various molecules in diabetes hypertension immunology and oncology and served as merck s chief marketing officer for europe middle east and africa and chief operating officer for emerging markets on this news the company s share price fell over 14 3 to close at 5 08 on april 13 2021 on heavy trading volume as one analyst explained it on april 12 2021 amarin nvestors may be disappointed in the transition and that it may signal no near term m a on the table which is the clear and primary bull case to the stock however the strategic move could finally unlock the ompany s value because as noted on april 13 2021 by another analyst while defendant thero deserves some credit for overseeing the completion of the landmark reduce it trial he also must take responsibility for their legal failures their underwhelming sales performance and the share price for the new era mikhail brings with him substantial connections in europe from his time with merck despite defendants consistent reassurances in the strength of amarin s patent portfolio and its abilities to vigorously defend this critical asset on june 21 2021 investors learned that the supreme court rejected the ompany s bid to revive vascepa

with connecticut s coffers swollen to their largest point in decades a progressive group featuring several current and former government officials challenged gov ned lamont and the legislature to overhaul a property tax system they say traps hundreds of thousands of residents in poverty stymies economic growth undermines schools and discourages regional collaboration the report from 1 000 friends of connecticut recommends pumping hundreds of millions of additional dollars annually into cities and towns particularly poor communities while creating a new system of refundable credits within the state income tax system to help low and middle income households cover their property tax bills but the cost of implementing all or even some of the friends group s recommendations would almost certainly require significant state tax increases to balance the books this would likely trigger opposition not only from minority republicans in the state legislature but also from moderate democrats and the governor the property tax which represents more than 40 of the combined state and municipal tax burden in connecticut is leading the state down a path of widely disparate educational opportunity fractured and inefficient delivery of needed services hollowed out cities widening racial and economic disparities sprawling suburbs fleeing businesses and an out migration of the next generation of talent the friends group wrote formed in the mid 2000s as a smart growth advocacy panel the friends group has focused increasingly on progressive fiscal policy its 15 member property tax working group which crafted the report includes former state legislators municipal officials and executive branch officials labor leaders academics regional government directors experts in finances and economics and journalists state punishes itself the coalition asserts the property tax is dangerous and inherently unfair for two reasons one is vertical inequity within a given municipality property owners rich middle class and poor all are taxed at the same rate a 2014 report prepared for the state department of revenue services showed the poorest half of all residents in the state effectively paid about 12 5 of all of their earnings on property taxes the other half paid between 7 7 and 0 9 and while that regressive element is present in all communities there s a second problem that does change from municipal border to border there s a huge variation in property tax rates across connecticut with the poorest communities having the highest rates and the wealthiest generally enjoying the lowest a problem referred to as horizontal inequity hartford s commercial property tax rate is about 74 mills double that of simsbury an affluent suburb about 40 minutes to the west because of these two inequities wealthier communities find it relatively easy to raise tax revenues to operate high quality schools and provide all other services to meet local needs poorer communities rely on a combination of property tax receipts and state aid that doesn t meet all local needs and still leave tax rates so high businesses often won t locate there connecticut punishes itself through the property tax which undermines the principal driver of the economy aggregate demand wrote university of connecticut economist fred v carstensen another member of the friends group but property taxes date back centuries in the northeast and connecticut has remained more reliant upon them than most other states connecticut s property tax burden is third highest among all states in the nation as a percentage of all state and local revenue ramping up aid tax relief to break connecticut s reliance on this source of funding the friends group offered several options one involves dramatically increasing and redistributing aid to cities and towns the state exempts its own property and that of nonprofit colleges and hospitals from local taxation yet it only reimburses communities for a portion of the taxes they lose fixing this problem alone would cost the state nearly 400 million per year similarly connecticut does not fully fund special education costs borne by local school districts and many years the state doesn t even cover the amount stipulated by law simply meeting that pledge would cost another 60 million annually the friends group also recommends that lamont and legislators revise formulas and other methodologies that determine how aid is distributed placing much more emphasis on local need and wealth at the same time the group urges policymakers to redesign a state income tax credit that s intended to help working families handle their property tax burdens but has been slipping in recent years the state created a credit against a portion of property taxes paid in the mid 1990s and generally increased it for the first 15 years but the program that distributed 380 million in 2010 via 500 credits has been so whittled down it now sends back only about 63 million in the form of 200 credits households without children stopped being eligible to receive credits in 2018 and lamont hasn t fulfilled a 2018 campaign pledge to bolster the program the friends group not only urges lawmakers to pump these credits back up but also make them refundable a credit has no value for a resident who earns too little to pay income taxes since tax liability can t be reduced below 0 but a refundable credit must be paid in the form of a refund even if a taxpayer s liability has been reduced to nothing friends group state can afford reforms now now is the time to act the report urges since the state s coffers are swelling due largely to a surging stock market and conservative savings programs over the past three years the state has amassed a record setting budget reserve of 3 1 billion equal to 15 of annual operating costs and because the reserve cannot exceed 15 by law lamont and the legislature also have directed almost 1 7 billion in additional surplus dollars to reduce state pension debt a long term problem expected to challenge state budgets for at least two decades to come but the friends group says connecticut should share one quarter of any of these surplus surpluses extra dollars that can t be saved because the reserve is full with cities and towns lyle wray executive director of the capitol region council of governments and a member of the friends group said the property tax poses as many fiscal challenges to towns as pension debt does to the state municipal grand lists the value of taxable property are growing on average by 0 5 annually while labor utility and other costs facing towns jump as much as 5 we have a horrible combination of high cost and low growth he said but group members also conceded that to fund the solutions they ve proposed state government would lose hundreds of millions of dollars possibly more than 1 billion annually what we have done is to propose a menu of reforms former norwalk mayor alex knopp said we are not suggesting that all of that could be done together and at once while the report doesn t recommend how the state should raise the money to pay for these costs members acknowledged lamont and legislators likely couldn t avoid major state tax hikes to keep the books in balance but john filchak longtime executive director of the northeastern connecticut council of governments and another member of the friends group said making these investments to drive down property tax rates would pay economic dividends over time the alternative is to watch many communities continue to stagnate and slump re arranging the lifeboats isn t going to get it done he said if people truly want to acknowledge the need for property tax reform then it s going to take a comprehensive approach there s no easy solution pushback likely there almost certainly will be political opposition to these proposals especially in 2022 as lamont and the legislature enter a state election year the governor repeatedly has said he wants to avoid major tax hikes as connecticut s economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic and while tax relief can be discussed major spending increases in the state budget are a problem governor lamont stated last week that he is exploring ways to alleviate the local property tax burden on connecticut s residents and businesses as the state maintains its strong fiscal position said chris mcclure spokesman for lamont s budget office he has said from the very beginning of his time in office that he will listen to ideas but they have to be realistic practical and the numbers have to add up house minority leader vincent j candelora r north branford said he expects republicans would have huge problems with portions of the friends group s report these kind of conversations are completely tone deaf to the world around us right now he said adding that lawmakers have their hands full simply mitigating the damage the pandemic has done to connecticut s health care and education systems but that doesn t mean the report would find no allies at the state capitol progressive democrats and labor groups have pushed hard over the past two years to invest more in communities government services and tax relief for low and middle income households the legislature s finance revenue and bonding committee challenged lamont last spring by recommending hundreds of millions of dollars in tax hikes on wealthy households and major corporations sen john fonfara d hartford co chairman of the panel proposed that much of the revenue from these recommended increases be focused almost exclusively to support economic development and vital services in poor urban centers and other distressed municipalities lamont blocked the tax hikes but agreed to a more modest urban relief fund to be paid for outside of the state budget with long term borrowing an impassioned fonfara responded last june during the state budget debate by comparing the lack of state government response to the minneapolis police killing of george floyd in may 2020 calling the policies a knee on the neck of the black community and other underserved communities of our state fonfara said thursday the new report reflects a growing awareness in connecticut that concentrated poverty and unequal access to education health care and affordable housing were getting worse before the coronavirus pandemic and continue to do so i m hopeful that the governor and legislature will recognize that these issues are not going to go away he said otherwise it will continue to create a greater divide in our state between the towns that have and the towns that don t and the people that have and those that don t keith m phaneuf is a reporter for the connecticut mirror www ctmirror org

hong kong after a bumper year of stock listings asian companies may find it hard to repeat the success in 2022 given the prospect of rising interest rates and china s tightening grip on big tech thanks to a blistering first half amid a global boom initial public offerings ipos in the region have reached us 190bil rm801 69bil so far this year already a record and up 31 from the whole of 2020 but the momentum has weakened notably in recent months as beijing escalated a regulatory assault on private enterprise putting major deals on hold and injecting uncertainties into next year
augusta maine instrument flight a company with more than seven decades of history at the augusta state airport has been sold to an idaho company that has pledged to build on what is already in place sprintbach aviation plans to invest both in the flight school and the charter business as it extends its reach from its base in southwest idaho we re serial entrepreneurs and we like that aspect of running businesses zach erlebach principal of sprintbach aviation said we fell in love with the legacy of this business and we ll figure out how to make the business work but we re going to do that with the community s help and we re going to invest heavily in the employees and keep going the deal a transfer of stock closed dec 8 the value of the transaction was not disclosed maine instrument flight encompasses a charter business maintenance shop flight school and fixed base operator that offers support services to general aviation the company founded by william l perry in 1946 was jointly owned by his children william h perry and shirley perry whitney until the sale earlier this month advertisement we were looking for history not a business to buy erlebach 31 said sprintbach aviation worked with business brokers to find prospects initially without much luck what they found did not pique their interest so they kept looking we found bill perry and we flew out here without much expectation erlebach said then we sat with bill and shirley and we swapped more stories that we talked about business we just fell in love with it perry 81 said he and his sister had considered selling more than a decade ago but interest in acquiring the business was not there there were tire kickers and people who wanted to see what an airplane looked like but no legitimate offers about a year ago perry said they decided to try again with the inbar group a business brokerage that focuses on the northeast when it opened an office in augusta perry who will continue as president of maine beechcraft a standalone business said the potential exists for expansion for the organization including the flight training advertisement brenda mcaleer associate provost and dean of the college of professional studies at the university of maine at augusta said she was aware perry and whitney were considering moving on from the business mcaleer said she met with erlebach and morris a month ago and their first question to her was if she wanted uma s pilot training program to grow i said absolutely mcaleer said while all details have yet to be ironed out the memorandum of understanding between maine instrument flight and uma signed eight years ago remains in effect the contract does not change because when bill and shirley sold maine instrument flight was sold as a unit and our contract is with maine instrument flight mcaleer said we re looking forward to working with the new owners i think they are going to come in with some different ideas it s just a new chapter in our relationship mcaleer said she was aware about a year ago that perry and whitney were interested in selling the company and she was concerned about who might buy it advertisement this is a very small state and people work on relationships and trust mcaleer said after meeting with zach and chad morris i am so relieved and looking forward to moving forward with them morris 34 is president of sprintbach aviation and a u s navy veteran the first focus for the company he said will be the uma program what they didn t have before is someone who has been through a veteran program and been through a university program morris said i already know a lot of the ins and outs of how it works how it s supposed to function and how to draw veterans into the program the primary focus for the school is how do we get more veterans morris said he had been a flight instructor at a large flight school in idaho where erlebach earned his pilot s license and they started talking about finding a way to do a business together erlebach said the flight school and the charter business which will augment the company s existing charter business in idaho is where the company will invest heavily the flight school presents a unique opportunity because of the demand for pilots which is expected to extend into the next five to 10 years advertisement you can get your pilot s license and not have an education to go with it erlebach said but airlines are much more comfortable if you can have both and you make a lot more money young pilots can come out of the university program with the ratings they need and they can make a lot more money in the market morris said the new owners plan to become part of the community and increase what already exists including the relationships perry has developed members of the erlebach family own and operate several businesses in the treasure valley of southwestern idaho west of boise among them sprintbach aviation we re really diverse and we re really successful in building businesses erlebach said we ve taken businesses that are really nothing and turned them into something we really like that send questions comments to the editors previous

have raised alarm bells previously over woolworths intentions when in the 2000s the retail giant made a bid to have pharmacies in woolworths stores wesfarmers effectively distanced itself from supermarket retail when it demerged from coles importantly wesfarmers now has a very limited market presence in these categories allowing us to approach the api acquisition without any material

but to miller consumers face plenty of bigger threats to the privacy of their data there are apps that track you on your smartphone 24 7 that attitude is a problem for american officials who are seeking to end dji s dominance in the us last week the us government blocked american investment in the company a year after donald trump prohibited it from sourcing us parts now lawmakers from both parties are weighing a bill that would ban federal purchases of dji drones while a member of the federal communications commission wants its products taken off the market altogether in many ways dji has become the poster child of a much wider national security threat the chinese government s ability to obtain sensitive data on millions of americans in recent weeks former top officials in both the obama and trump administrations have warned that beijing could be scooping up personal information on the citizens of rival nations while walling off data on china s 1 4 billion people advertisement each new piece of information by itself is relatively unimportant oona hathaway a professor at yale law school who served in the pentagon under president barack obama wrote in foreign affairs referring to surveillance and monitoring technologies but combined the pieces can give foreign adversaries unprecedented insight into the personal lives of most americans chinese president xi jinping has been far ahead of the west in realising the importance of data in gaining both an economic and military advantage according to matt pottinger a former deputy national security adviser in the trump administration if washington and its allies don t organise a strong response mr xi will succeed in commanding the heights of future global power he wrote in a co authored new york times opinion piece last month the data battle strikes at the heart of the us china strategic competition and has the potential to reshape the world economy over the coming decades particularly as everything from cars to yoga mats to toilets are now transmitting data harnessing that information is key to dominating technologies such as artificial intelligence that will drive the modern economy and crucial for exploiting weaknesses in strategic foes advertisement concerns related to data security will be a defining issue for the next decade as technological advances lead to explosive demand for ever more bits of information according to paul triolo a former us government official who specialises in global technology policy at risk consultancy eurasia group the result he says is likely an almost complete bifurcation of the internet reflecting the values of competing political systems the democratic and authoritarian digital worlds will be built on largely different hardware with different standards and limited points of connection he says this will drive up costs for businesses operating across these two spheres reduce innovation and lead to geopolitical tensions reduced trade and a much more complex world for companies to operate within other countries will be forced to choose sides in this divide and this will be painful and costly already data security concerns are starting to balkanise manufacturing supply chains and financial markets amid fears that governments will weaponise information gleaned from smartphone apps medical devices and consumer products such as drones advertisement policymakers in the us and china are rushing to implement more measures to protect their citizens data beijing has acted more swiftly passing laws this year aimed at preventing user data from seeping into the wrong hands while strengthening the government s ability to control information held by private companies part of a wider crackdown on its biggest tech companies xi mandated cybersecurity reviews for all chinese companies that want to list on foreign exchanges effectively prompting ride hailing giant didi global inc to delist in the us and head to hong kong after just five months the trump government homed in on data in 2020 moving to ban two of china s most widely used apps bytedance s tiktok and tencent holdings wechat while urging allies to embrace a so called clean network with communication networks free from chinese companies and equipment but the clean network never took off as us security partners in asia that rely on china for trade baulked at dividing the world into competing data blocs us president joe biden then revoked the bans on tiktok and wechat while ordering a sweeping review seeking recommendations on actions to protect sensitive american data the government has yet to release the results or articulate a clear policy on what data constitutes a national security threat advertisement despite that us policymakers are zeroing in on some companies in the data space that dominate their field in the drone world no company is more prolific than dji the chinese company commands more than 50 per cent of the us drone market research firm droneanalyst estimates it sells about 95 per cent of the unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs priced between us350 and us2000 targeted at consumers in 2019 trump signed a bill prohibiting the military from purchasing chinese made drones and drone components a year later the commerce department put dji on its entity list which bars us suppliers from selling to it without an exemption republicans with presidential ambitions such as senators tom cotton and marco rubio have co sponsored the bipartisan american security drone act which would ban all federal purchases of dji s drones the senate s top democrat majority leader chuck schumer has pushed similar legislation via a separate bill and dji could face more trouble soon brendan carr one of four fcc commissioners said in october that it should consider a ban on approvals of dji s equipment citing the vast amounts of sensitive data collected by its drones advertisement in an fcc statement carr warned dji may be a huawei on wings referring to the chinese telecommunications giant the us has sought to hobble with sanctions over spying concerns any moves by the fcc to stop approvals of dji s equipment would cripple the company s operations in the us according to conor healy government director for the surveillance research group ipvm eventually they just wouldn t have anything left to sell in the us healy says we re creating this situation where the chinese can t sell gear to the world and vice versa china has regularly blasted moves to block its companies from access to certain technology and markets accusing the us of abusing the concept of national security to hobble chinese companies at the same time policymakers in beijing have stressed the need to become self reliant on key technology such as advanced chips to end dependence on the west dji didn t answer questions from bloomberg news about its data policies or marketing strategies the company also didn t comment on last week s blacklisting by the us advertisement dji spokesman adam lisberg referred to a 2020 statement from when the commerce department put dji on its list of companies prohibited from purchasing from american suppliers without an exemption dji has done nothing to justify being placed on the entity list the company said we have always focused on building products that save lives and benefit society we are evaluating options to ensure our customers partners and suppliers are treated fairly the company has already reduced its reliance on foreign suppliers of semiconductors motors and cameras says david benowitz head of research at droneanalyst and a former dji employee they saw the writing on the wall they ve really isolated themselves he says dji is in its own space where it owns most of the things it relies on and whether being added to the treasury department s blacklist barring us investment has much impact on the closely held company is up for debate advertisement in august dji told investors which have included venture capital firms sequoia capital china and accel partners that getting added to the entity list had no material effect on sales and operations in north america dji earned us914 million in 2020 on revenue of us3 25 billion according to a person familiar with the situation as a private company in a competitive industry dji doesn t disclose details about its financial and market performance frank wang dji s billionaire founder who started the company in 2006 as a university student in hong kong rarely speaks to the media the company s president roger luo said in march 20202 it was in no rush to go public investors will pay attention to profit he said we want to avoid restrictions and focus on our passions amid concerns about chinese surveillance in 2019 dji introduced its government edition drones designed to ensure that photos video and other data never leave the device the information it said therefore can never be shared with unauthorised parties including dji advertisement the company has since expanded on those efforts offering users a local data mode that prevents the transmission of all drone data over the internet dji is committed to protecting drone user data which is why we design our systems so drone users have control of whether they share any data with us it said in july 2020 klon kitchen a security expert at the american enterprise institute says despite dji pledges the devices are not secure these drones are one update from being non compliant he says information could flow through apps that suck data out of users mobile phones he said but dji and other chinese companies face an even bigger hurdle few western governments trust beijing china s national intelligence law requires organisations to assist in espionage and keep those activities secret governments should assume that chinese spy agencies will find value in information gathered by dji s drones according to andrew shelley director of aviation safety management systems a new zealand advisory company that works with government clients advertisement for the average recreational user who might be taking selfies on the beach it s probably true that dji is not interested in their data he says but collectively the chinese government is interested in our data we don t understand just how much of a threat that is the barrage of concern over security risks from dji s drones is starting to hurt mostly in the lucrative market for corporate customers the company s share of the us2 billion 2 8 billion global commercial drone sector dropped to 54 per cent in the first half of 2021 down from 74 per cent in 2018 according to droneanalyst defenders of dji say the us attacks on dji are more about protecting the country s ability to make drones than fears about data dji s fightback strategy is fairly simple insulate the company from sanctions build products that are better and more affordable than anything on the market and win over the next generation of users last year dji started a new education division offering a small drone priced at just us240 as well as software to help school teachers instruct students on basic coding advertisement in october the company enlisted cinematographers including three oscar winners to promote a drone with new stabilisation technology and a range of other advanced features other devices include one that can stay in the air for as long as 46 minutes and another for crop dusting that can cover 40 acres in an hour even dji s rivals are impressed they re totally killer at what they do says george matus founder of teal drones a subsidiary of nasdaq listed red cat holdings which sells uavs for reconnaissance public safety and inspections to the us defence department dji has a huge workforce of engineers that makes sure every piece of hardware on their drones is perfect at the same time matus appreciates us actions against dji a teal drone was among five approved by the pentagon for military and federal use and the company is now seeking to double its some 20 person workforce and ramp up production capacity he said originally it was super hard competing against dji he says it became a race to the bottom on price and they just totally obliterated most of the market advertisement now government support has allowed companies like teal to survive and thrive american companies have some room to grow most of dji s us rivals are now smaller companies such as teal after larger competitors gopro and 3d robotics exited the market in october the pentagon s defence innovation unit announced a new round of 11 approved vendors for uavs most of them american and two from switzerland the lack of similar alternatives to dji is a concern for local police departments that receive some funding from washington and could be hindered by rules banning federal spending on dji equipment says luke goldberg president of enterprise uas owner of several drone distributors he says most us made commercial drones can cost as much as 30 per cent more and offer fewer features defenders of dji such as kay wackwitz chief executive officer of drone industry insights say the us attacks on dji are more about protecting the country s ability to make drones than fears about data advertisement worries about dji drones transmitting images of air bases or power plants to chinese intelligence are unrealistic says wackwitz whose consulting firm is based in hamburg germany the amount of data is way too big so where is the actual harm he said to me it appears to be a reason to push the chinese manufacturers out of the market still us policymakers from both major parties are becoming more convinced of the dji threat the popularity of the drones among ordinary american consumers only adds to the fear according to nazak nikakhtar a partner and co chairman of the national security practice at washington law firm wiley rein llp the consensus is that more likely than not our information is being collected by these chinese drones it s pretty scary she says but miller the youtube drone reviewer is confident dji will be able to withstand the latest assault from washington as consumers just want the best product for the best price possible i don t see dji going anywhere any time soon even with these blacklist placements unless washington cracks down on consumers from purchasing the drones in the first place he says bloomberg

worked with business brokers to find prospects initially without much luck what they found did not pique their interest so they kept looking we found bill perry and we flew out here without much expectation erlebach said then we sat with bill and shirley and we swapped more stories that we talked about business we just fell in love with it perry 81 said he and his sister had considered selling more than a decade ago but interest in acquiring the business was not there there were tire kickers and people who wanted to see what an airplane looked like but no legitimate offers about a

through a university program morris said i already know a lot of the ins and outs of how it works how it s supposed to function and how to draw veterans into the program the primary focus for the school is how do we get more veterans morris said he had been a flight instructor at a large flight school in idaho where erlebach earned his pilot s license and they started talking about finding a way to do a business together erlebach said the flight school and the charter business which will augment the company s existing charter business in idaho is where the company will invest heavily the

education to go with it erlebach said but airlines are much more comfortable if you can have both and you make a lot more money young pilots can come out of the university program with the ratings

on a windless morning in early december david johnson of fells point pulled his four seat plane from a hangar at martin state airport after getting clearance from air traffic control the 1977 grumman tiger aa 5b lighter than a mini cooper sped down the runway and into the air high above the chesapeake bay for the fifth year johnson would join volunteer pilots from across the region for the annual holly run bringing boughs of holly and hearts full of holiday cheer to tangier island va one of the region s last inhabited offshore islands tangier island is reachable only by boat or by plane its residents embrace their land and culture even as the island is rapidly going underwater from thousands of feet above the bay is a broad sheet of blue flecked by scabs of land and coastline forests are crisscrossed by snakelike rivers and streams wind off them like veins and capillaries it s this view and the solitude that comes with it that draws pilots such as johnson to the hobby of course the ability to skip traffic and make it across the bay in 15 minutes doesn t hurt advertisement johnson s first stop was kent island s bay bridge airport where he and his fellow volunteers gathered for breakfast and to pick up the bags of holly and say hello to one another this is literally the 100 hamburger excuse to fly said pilot al mcmath using aviation slang to describe a short flight to eat at a restaurant before flying home the tradition was started more than half a century ago by ed nabb sr the lawyer from cambridge in dorchester county md was a pilot who would fly to tangier island as a weekend escape it was his way of getting away from everything recalled his son ed nabb jr one year around christmas nabb sr realized that there were no holly bushes growing in tangier island s sandy soil so he brought some holly from his family s farm one weekend in time the event grew to include dozens of recreational pilots a batch of characters forever on the lookout for a reason to take off advertisement friends have asked nabb jr why pilots don t just order decorations and mail them to the island that s not the point he said if we wanted we could contact amazon and have them ship wreaths in participating in the holly run organized by volunteers and driven by the desire to do good for someone else lifts his spirits i get kind of the bah humbugs about christmas he said the holly run was canceled last year for just the second time in its history because of the coronavirus a late fall 2020 outbreak on the island sickened many of the residents i think we all agree after the last year it s awesome to have some joy and merriment said event organizer helen woods the flight instructor and owner of chesapeake sport pilot wore a green cap with pointy ears as she addressed the pilots who scarfed down plates of blueberry pancakes and sausage inside the hangar advertisement after taking over the event about a decade ago woods moved the holly run to kent island and expanded the donations to include art supplies and aid for the community a few years ago woods organized volunteer pilots to pick up feral cats from the island to be spayed and neutered this year donors gave more than 12 000 the money will go to residents who need help paying heating bills and buying groceries we all see the beauty of tangier but there s also a lot of poverty woods told the pilots many elderly residents are surviving on social security with little money to cover home repairs and other expenses there are worse issues than that the island is disappearing nabb jr said that when his father began flying there the island was about 1 200 acres with about 1 200 inhabitants just over 50 years later it has shrunk to 400 acres with 400 inhabitants a recent study suggested sea level rise and coastal erosion will make the island uninhabitable by 2053 advertisement after stuffing a bag of holly into the back of his plane johnson climbed into his seat flying south he radioed his location to nearby naval air station patuxent river where the u s navy tests its aircraft civilian pilots need to avoid infringing on the base s airspace past the massive coastal estates past hoopers and smith islands tangier came into view the land was reportedly given its name by captain john smith who believed it resembled the port city in morocco during the war of 1812 the british navy used the island as a base to launch attacks on washington and baltimore on the landing strip children with moms and grandmothers gathered to greet santa played by pilot ralph hoover he wore a red velvet suit made by his wife and his own bushy white beard his ride a shiny red white and blue plane that he assembled himself kids pressed around one of the plane s wings smiling and eager to collect the candy canes he handed out from a red satchel advertisement for island residents and their children the arrival of santa starts the christmas season said christine parks who brought her 4 year old grandson brady share this article share the event was bittersweet for resident mary parks who wiped away tears as she remembered how much her mom hedy bowden had enjoyed the holly run bowden died this past year her family included pictures of her at the holly run in a slide show they made for her funeral next to santa claus she was the holly run said friend katie daly mariano she loved everything about the holidays this month parks snapped photos of santa holding her infant granddaughter who slept through the whole thing minutes later tour guide gina crockett picked up johnson and santa in a golf cart the preferred method of transportation on the island the cart crossed a wooden bridge linking the eastern part of the island with the airstrip on the west while she drove crockett pointed out landmarks the historic cemetery the school on stilts a small grocery store sells necessities although most residents take boats to nearby crisfield md once or twice a month to stock up advertisement many residents share surnames park pruitt and crockett with the island s early settlers after centuries of isolation tangier island residents speak a unique dialect of english whose roots date back to their cornish ancestors we tone it down for outsiders said mayor james eskridge like many of the island s residents eskridge is also a waterman making a living through the chesapeake bay s crabs fish and oysters eskridge rose to momentary fame a few years ago after receiving a call from president donald trump who told him not to worry about rising sea levels when he s not managing the town or on the water eskridge is fielding phone calls and interview requests from reporters around the globe about climate change and sea level rise people often ask eskridge why tangier residents don t simply move he tells them when we talk about saving the island we re not just talking about saving a piece of land we re talking about saving a people a culture a way of life advertisement following a prayer service at the town s 19th century methodist church was lunch at lorraine s tangier island s sit down restaurant pilots ate cream of crab soup and soft shell crab sandwiches fresh as could be pilots are some of the restaurant s best customers says mariano who works as a server at lorraine s sometimes staff from the naval base will call in lunch orders and pick them up via helicopter mariano who grew up in northwest baltimore s mount washington neighborhood moved to tangier island 23 years ago after marrying a tangierman living on a remote island took an adjustment she said we don t have a walmart we don t have a mall you take the good with the bad the good she never worries about crime or violence like school shootings everyone is friendly and people look out for one another there is actually no better place in the world to raise children she said advertisement the bad kids have few career prospects as they grow up most move away many men get jobs on tugboats that keep them on the water for two weeks at a time and the island s future is precarious as residents were reminded during a harrowing episode this fall a storm in late october covered 90 percent of the island with water the floods breached the back door of mariano s house and didn t budge until the following day it s just the most hopeless feeling when you see the water coming in and know there s absolutely not a thing you can do to stop it it was worse than anyone had ever seen we ve had high water before but not like this eskridge said mariano whose youngest child will leave for college soon doesn t know how much longer she will be able to live on the island still she believes some residents will stay no matter what true tangiermen they just share a bloodline with the island she said this is who they are

the september 11 attacks 9 11 brought a significant qualitative change in pakistan s equation with the us till then the pak us relations with mismatched strategic objectives could at best be described as a partnership of convenience but the irate president george w bush s daunting proposal of 6 november 2001 either with us or against us and the helpless president pervez musharraf s instant nod under duress turned it into a forced marriage the us demanded and pakistan acquiesced to cooperate with the us led coalition against the taliban regime and the al qaeda outfit in afghanistan with alleviation of its financial woes as the presumed dowry within days the us offered an assistance package totalling 673 million all in the form of a grant it also rescheduled a 379 million debt and allowed us agency for international development us aid to reopen its office in pakistan after a 7 year closure in august 2002 the us rescheduled its 3 billion debt to pakistan this included 2 3 billion as official development assistance repayable over 38 years and 700 million as non official development assistance to be repayable over 23 years japan britain and other european countries followed suit this also cleared the way for a favourable rescheduling of pakistan s external debt and provided aid packages to assist with poverty alleviation and refugees the imf approved a 1 3 billion loan to help pakistan fight poverty and offset the economic impact of the war in afghanistan the poverty reduction growth facility was followed by the paris club rescheduling pakistan achieved in paris club what few others such as poland jordan egypt and yugoslavia were able to achieve its entire stock of debt of about 12 5 billion was rescheduled for 38 years for concessional component and 23 years of non concessional component with a grace period of 15 and 5 years respectively to gauge the relief implicit in this exercise one only needs to note that nearly 50 percent of this debt was due for payment in the next 5 6 years pakistan acquiesced to cooperate with the us led coalition against the taliban regime and the al qaeda outfit in afghanistan both asian development bank and world bank agreed to provide funding of about 1 5 billion through their concessional windows to support the reform efforts in the medium term pakistan succeeded in securing better access for its exports in european markets which would translate into a net gain of 400 million per annum a similar exercise was promised by the us in february 2002 the white house announced its intention to work with congress to increase assistance to pakistan particularly in areas related to debt relief increased trade educational reform and defence and security cooperation president bush agreed to offer pakistan up to 1

where the agency will have much more robust programmes afghanistan being the other country according to independent sources pakistan s economy registered solid macroeconomic recovery within five years while long term prospects remain ed uncertain given pakistan s low level of development medium term prospects for job creation and poverty reduction were the best in more than a decade poverty levels had decreased by 10 percent since 2001 and islamabad had steadily raised development spending in recent years including a 52 percent real increase in the budget allocation for development in fy07 a necessary step toward reversing the broad underdevelopment of its social sector the fiscal deficit the result of chronically low tax collection and increased spending including reconstruction costs

preserve growth foreign exchange reserves 10 95 billion in 2005 were bolstered by steady worker remittances similarly steps were taken to resuscitate cooperation in the field of defence in july 2002 the us announced its plans to sell six cargo planes to pakistan in the first major military sale since 1990 the 75 million deal included six planes associated equipment services and training facilities defending the decision the pentagon said the proposed sale will augment the foreign policy and national security of the united states the said aircraft would enhance pakistan s capability to support us led military offensive against the taliban and osama bin laden s al qaeda network within five years the wheel came full circle reminiscent of the level of relationship at the peak of the afghan jehad pakistan was declared a major non nato ally of us on june 28 2006 the defence security cooperation agency notified the congress of its intention to provide pakistan with a 5 1 billion foreign military sales package to upgrade the f 16s that served as the paf s top of the line fighters the lockheed martin corporation of us received a 144 million contract to begin production of 18 f

with airborne early warning systems awacs to the value of 855 million according to the pentagon pakistan intends to use the aircraft with the e 2c hawkeye airborne early warning system for its naval forces the refurbished aircraft would boost pakistan s ability to guard its shores and borders against the movement of terrorists and drug traffickers the dowry did boost pakistan economically and militarily but in return it had to extend undefined cooperation to the us led international security assistance force isaf against the taliban and the al qaida in afghanistan unconditionally which it did and more than offset what it got to be continued the writer is a former diplomat based in canberra and can be reached at khizar_niazi hotmail com
don t miss out on the headlines from costs followed categories will be added to my news a surge in case numbers of covid 19 has caused a sell out of rapid antigen tests in the lead up to christmas when people will arguably need them the most the diy at home tests which are available at priceline woolworths and chemists allow people to find out if they re positive for covid 19 in as little as 15 to 20 minutes that is for those who are able to find them the tests have been compared to toilet paper shortages of 2020 with sold out signs plaguing customers eager to reunite with families and friends 2020 toilet paper 2021 these things tweeted 10news national affairs editor hugh rimington with a photo of sign that read rapid antigen tests sold out can t see my mum tomorrow because for some reason every single shop in sydney is sold out of rapid antigen tests shared another resident on twitter middle of sydney no appointments at the gp all the pharmacies booked out no vax centres any longer rapid antigen tests sold out everywhere pre order for pick up next week and they re tweeted another in october health policy expert professor lesley russell had warned that the supply could become an issue the adjunct associate professor at the university of sydney s menzies centre for health policy said the demand for these tests were already apparent overseas the biggest australian manufacturer of rapid antigen tests has a large government supply contract with the united states where supply of such tests cannot keep pace with demand india has also recently acted to restrict export of rapid antigen tests she wrote for the conversation india has also recently acted to restrict export of rapid antigen tests prof russell said once approved in australia the tests should be equally distributed and accessible to date all the signs are the federal government is taking a hands off approach to the introduction of rapid antigen testing for home use she said but it s essential we have effective distribution mechanisms to cover all of australia we also need a regulated price structure and or subsidies to make the cost of these tests affordable tests should be free and accessible as prof russell predicted affordability has become a concern chemist warehouse has priced a pack of two tests at 24 99 and a pack of five tests at 49 99 with woolworths which is currently out of stock selling the tests for a similar price but it has no stock available online priceline has also sold out of the nasal and oral tests however they were priced at 9 99 each given the pent up demand increasing calls have been made for better affordability and accessibility around rapid antigen tests with individuals and organisations venting their frustration on social media rapid antigen tests should be free and accessible tweeted the official account for the australian council of trade unions a lot of people can t afford rapid antigen tests shared another twitter user who tagged prime minister scott morrison in her post the government should be sending some to each home it s not like they re doing anything else to keep us safe from covid it d be more useful than the shoddy military tech they keep spending our money on not the case for some overseas governments unlike australia some overseas governments have made rapid tests free or highly reduced their costs through subsidies in the uk where cases are once again breaking pandemic records of more than 89 000 daily infections households can request rapid tests which are sent to their homes or collected from a pharmacy or community centre a free service households can order one pack of seven tests daily the tests have also been made free in new york where the omicron variant is growing significantly tripling the city s seven day average to 3700 in the past month european governments have also largely absorbed the cost of rapid tests however prices differ depending on the country in germany france and denmark residents can purchase a pack of five tests for a39 what do rapid antigen tests do compared to pcr tests reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests which amplifies the genetic sequence of dna and can find small amounts of viral genetic material rapid antigen tests detect viral proteins found via a nasal or saliva sample while rapid antigen tests product results in 15 to 20 minutes they aren t able to detect the virus in the earlier stages of infection like a pcr test might through genetic sequencing pcr tests can also determine the variant a patient may be carrying it is also important to note that rapid antigen tests shouldn t be used to confirm a covid 19 diagnosis which must be done through a pcr test they re also currently prohibited for public use in south australia and western australia to date the tga has approved the use of 15 antigen tests from october 13 onwards the approved tests range in how sensitive they are at picking up covid antigens compared to standard pcr tests and vary between 80 per cent acceptable sensitivity to 95 per cent very high sensitivity once the sample is added to the tester a result will appear in 15 to 20 minutes picture istock when should you use a rapid antigen test the nursing and deputy head of griffith university s school of nursing and midwifery professor thea van de mortel says rapid antigen tests are best used as a screening tool where as pcr tests properly diagnose a covid 19 infection writing for the conversation she advocates people use a rapid test if they re planning to visit a sensitive site for example an aged care facility or someone who is at a high risk from covid prof van de mortel also advocates their use prior to going to events where the risk of transmission is higher like a nightclub music festival or large sporting event where social distancing was difficult the rapid antigen test is considered to be a screening tool in other words it can indicate that you might be
