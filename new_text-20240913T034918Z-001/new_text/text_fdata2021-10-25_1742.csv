continued development and generalization of its ai stack the company will be opening an office in seattle in 2022 the early data collected in seattle is also crucial for calibration localization and mapping simultaneously clams and zoox road network zrn teams who will start creating a 3d map of the city and populating it with road features bike lanes speed limits traffic lights and so on plus is now plus sunny plus formerly plus ai a global provider of self driving truck technology announced that the company is expanding its business presence into europe plus has hired bosch veteran and german native sun mi sunny choi as senior director of business development to accelerate its european expansion as the company grows its global footprint choi will help deepen existing and future collaboration with truck manufacturers suppliers and other europe based partners plus has already started global customer deployment of its autonomous trucking technology this year bosch continuous vehicle to vehicle communication for automated driving one of the cornerstones of automated driving functions is secure data communication between road users with the additional information supplied through such communication automation systems can adapt their driving maneuvers to suit the current driving situation better than would be possible using only the vehicle s own sensor technologies how the flow of data in vehicle to vehicle communication can be kept stable and secure is a matter that bosch escrypt kapsch nokia and telekom have been investigating over the past three and a half years in the european innovation project concorda in a consortium this was headed by ertico its europe a public private partnership pursuing the development and deployment of intelligent transport systems the primary focus here was to investigate suitable ways of ensuring continuous data transport between the road users in the vicinity of the vehicle previous research has concentrated mainly on occasional warning messages that were sent out in cases of imminent danger the approach now being pursued has resulted in particularly strict requirements in terms of securing the communication network against unauthorized access moreover fast and stable data communication between road users must be ensured at all times irrespective of the network quality for instance even when driving in tunnels the goal of the research was therefore to determine which benefits the various communication technologies offer for continuous secure vehicle to vehicle data transmission the objects used for testing in the concorda project were trucks driven in convoy on stretches of public highways during their journey the trucks shared safety relevant information such as acceleration and braking data the testing comprised three types of vehicle to vehicle communication firstly direct wi fi based communication its g5 secondly cellular based communication that is direct lte v2x pc5 and thirdly indirect communication over the mobile network lte with the latter method the truck s signals transmitted via the lte network were first routed to a server in the edge cloud of the mobile network and from there were then forwarded to the test vehicles as the trials showed all the tested systems more than adequately fulfilled the stringent standards with regard to information security thanks to their high transmission speed and low latency the two direct channels of communication are very well suited for use within a radius of up to 500 meters from the vehicle for example to immediately prepare the assistance systems for sudden hazards like emergency braking within a wider radius of up to 3000 meters indirect communication via the mobile edge cloud offers benefits by linking the vehicle s own data with the data from other road users or the infrastructure it is possible to implement additional more advanced functions in the area of automated driving using these methods nowadays most new trucks already come equipped with an lte unit by adding the direct secure channel of communication parallel use of the two technologies can provide the optimal solution in terms of stable continuous data transmission the results of the innovation project will be incorporated by the project partners into the further development of automated driving functions and communication technologies for trucks and cars that will make road traffic of the future even safer more efficient and more comfortable stradvision answers av questions with news arriving daily about autonomous

strategists at bank of america muse that xi may even be embracing a once in two decades restructuring of the economy akin to deng xiaoping s modernizations of the late 1970s and zhu rongji s revamping of state enterprises and finance in the 1990s bank of america corp and citigroup inc are among those sounding the warning that expansion will fall short this year of the 8 2 anticipated by the consensus of economists the slump could last into next year forcing growth below 5 they warn outside 2020 s 2 3 that would be the weakest in three decades beijing china s economy risks slowing faster than investors realize as president xi jinping s push to cut its reliance on real estate and regulate sectors from education to technology combine with a power shortage and the pandemic if so the data flow from china could confound even the pessimists and we are on guard for that scenario unfolding the strategists led by ajay kapur told clients in a report last week in which they predicted growth of 7 7 this year and 4 in 2022 beijing is determined to shift its economic model from its boom years in which the country loaded up on debt and propelled itself to become the second largest economy xi is now overseeing a plan to stabilize debt growth in order to ease financial risks curb inequality and channel financial resources into hi tech manufacturing to counter the threat of technology restrictions from the u s also read china s hypersonic missile test not surprising keeping it a secret is india awaits details data released last week already showed a sharp slowdown in growth to 4 9 in the third quarter from 7 9 in the previous quarter with more pain likely to come as electricity shortages persist even before the pandemic hit china was surprising economists with slower than expected growth caused by beijing s resolve to ease debt risks which meant it avoided broad stimulus even as the u s china trade war threatened expansion after modest easing to cushion the worst effects of the coronavirus its debt control policy resumed with real estate companies such as china evergrande group feeling the biggest impact xi also set about seeking to reshape the consumer technology private tutoring and real estate sectors with officials arguing they represent a wasteful use of the country s limited resources officials have mostly embraced the resulting slowdown china s premier li keqiang in march announced a growth target of above 6 for the year while analysts saw this as a signal that beijing was prioritizing other policy goals such as financial stability and environmental protection above economic growth most at the time saw the target as extremely conservative i ve joked that maybe li keqiang knew more than we did said bert hofman a former director of the world bank s china office who now heads the national university of singapore s east asian institute but beijing has signaled in recent weeks that it could loosen some policies telling banks to pick up the pace of mortgage lending even as it repeated vows not to use the property sector as a short term stimulus any policy loosening in the next few months will be aimed at preventing disaster rather than supporting growth hofman said as long as growth is above 6 i think china would feel relatively happy he added people s bank of china governor yi gang recently said he sees about 8 expansion for this year and to achieve that the economy would only need to expand 3 9 in the current quarter according to calculations from bloomberg economics china s slowdown comes as the global recovery from covid 19 risks losing momentum when china s economic engine sputters growth fizzles the world over said frederic neumann co head of asian economic research at hsbc holdings plc in hong kong also read evergrande crisis could spell the end of china s miracle growth among those at risk from less investment in china are commodity exporters such as australia south africa and brazil slower trade could also hit the likes of malaysia singapore and thailand the impact could be felt further afield according to tuuli mccully singapore based head of asia pacific economics at scotiabank countries such as chile and peru ship significant amounts of commodities to china and will feel the impact of weaker real estate and other fixed asset investment activity in china she said financial market spillovers may be more contained given the 18 peak to trough correction in china s csi 300 index this year did not spark global contagion said alvin tan head of asia foreign exchange strategy at royal bank of canada in hong kong one possible upside from a cooling chinese economy is that it could alleviate global inflation pressures tan said nonetheless the net impact is decidedly negative for a world that is still recovering from the pandemic tan said for now even the most pessimistic economists expect growth to come in above 7 5 this year a relatively rapid rate for an economy the size of china s beijing has set a goal of doubling gross domestic product from 2020 levels by 2035 which implies annual growth of around 5 that may prove to be a floor for policy makers china could see real estate investment fall 10 in the first half of next year and still achieve 5 annual growth as its credit cycle is close to its bottom and fiscal policy could pick up ahead of a crucial communist party congress in the autumn said bo zhuang china economist at loomis sayles investments asia he predicts beijing could set a growth target around 5 5 for next year still the recent weakness when combined with concerns over evergrande is prompting analysts to wonder if they remain too sanguine on near term prospects bank of america s strategists outlined a bearish scenario involving a disorderly adjustment to the real estate market in which property prices fall 10 cutting sales and deterring banks from lending to the sector in that scenario growth could reach as low as 7 5 this year and 2 2 in 2022 the other risk is that china s policy makers may struggle to flick the switch back to growth mode if they feel that s needed citigroup economists led by xiangrong yu noted that the electricity shortages that are crimping industrial production will make it harder to cushion growth by boosting investment in infrastructure that kind of policy could only work next year once the power crunch eases they said local governments are also struggling to find viable projects to invest in while property developers tight financing has slowed their land purchases threatening to undermine a 1 trillion revenue source for local governments property and energy problems will continue to affect growth in the fourth quarter said houze song a china economy researcher at u s think tank the paulson institute it seems likely that full year growth will end below 8 with assistance from james mayger bloomberg

the market while the australian stock market traded up last week it is still exhibiting indecision two of the four days last week closed almost at the same price they opened i have indicated that the reason why our market was not really moving was because the materials and financial sectors were trending in opposite directions although the tables are now turning as financials was up over 2 while materials traded just in the red for the market to rise or fall in a sustained move the financials and materials sectors both need to travel in the same direction given the sustained indecision and the fact our market has been up for three weeks i suspect we may now see a down week either this week or next week which will indicate whether the last two months of this year will be bullish or bearish while there are some great purchasing opportunities in the market right now it will pay to be a little more cautious than usual in the news telstra and federal government acquire digicel telstra in partnership with the australian government will acquire the pacific operations of telecommunications firm digicel the largest mobile phone carrier in the pacific for us 1 6 billion and an additional us 250 million subject to business performance over the next three years telstra will put it us 270 million in equity while the federal government will provide the remaining us 1 33 billion digicel was founded by irish billionaire denis o brien and has operations in papua new guinea fiji samoa vanuatu and tahiti the move is said to have political ramifications as the government looks to block the regional influence of china completion should occur within the next two quarters digicel pacific is a commercially attractive asset and critical to telecommunications in the region the australian government is strongly committed to supporting quality private sector investment infrastructure in the pacific region telstra ceo andy penn said we previously said that if telstra were to proceed with a transaction it would be with financial and strategic risk management support from the government we also said that in addition to a government funding and support package any investment would also have to be within certain financial parameters with telstra s equity investment being the minor portion of the overall transaction i am pleased that we have been able to achieve both of those outcomes lng will continue to surge morgan stanley nyse ms has upped its price target for australia s lng producers amid surging demand the us bank predicts lng demand will rise 50 by 2030 and has increased its targets for beach karoon oil search origin and santos by 11 22 we have assessed the demand outlook for major asian importing countries of lng morgan stanley analysts reported we think asia will consume significantly more natural gas in the early phases of the energy transition to green energy this will lead to higher lng prices and better project returns improving investor sentiment towards these projects we expect the recent strength in commodity prices to bode well for australian energy companies m a will likely be a key driver of value for australian energy as companies look to divest equity ownership in lng projects and prepare for expansion speaking of santos specifically the bank said balance sheet concerns and merger impacts have weighed on investor sentiment and trading multiples however we think the balance sheet of santos and carbon intensity of barossa is in better shape than the market realises santos is also beneficiary of higher spot gas

menafn somtribune as part of what is called the somaliland development forum series a high delegation led by the somaliland republic s foreign minister dr essa kayd raagsaale met with international aid partners including denmark finland eu uk sweden germany netherlands and the usa 0 in the kenyan capital of nairobi thursday the meeting first listened to somaliland s development plans which the minister of planning omar abdullahi presented in the form of a ndpiii roadmap as soon as that was taken out of the way the partners led by denmark went into what many understood as the objective of the meeting to grill the somaliland side on how and why a number of somalian families were sent back to somalia from las anod sool region the partners skimmed over the alarming security situation that precipitated the so called deportations putting a heavy emphasis instead on how the measures taken infringed on basic human rights biting deep into core concerns somaliland s international partners took the opportunity to express their strong concerns regarding the forced displacement of specific communities in somaliland while noting that somaliland regards these operations as matters related to security and recognizing the responsibility of all governments to safeguard and protect the lives of their people partners underlined the importance of upholding security with respect to due process and the rule of law a statement the partners released of the meeting said and then the axe swooped down the partners believe these actions were carried out in violation of basic human rights principles enshrined in somaliland s constitution and international conventions that somaliland has committed to the statement added the partners to hammer home their discomfort with the expulsions followed it up immediately afterwards with the standard carrot and stick stock format usually reserved for aid beneficiaries that was not intended to conceal an underlying threat while international partners commended somaliland s positive democratic and economic development over recent years these forced displacements constitute a serious setback and called on the government to immediately stop the forced displacements and arbitrary detentions witnessed in recent weeks the partners stated adding the partners also called on the somaliland government the houses and businesses of those displaced remain unoccupied and that a system be put in place that allows for legal and voluntary return for those who are not considered a security threat by the courts together the last two statements appeared to many somalilanders as a dictation that did not have any faith in how the government of somaliland ran its considered or addressed pressing issues but then came another statement that made observers as angry with the government and its delegations as it was with the partners perceived heavy handedness international partners also welcomed the promise from the high level delegation that forced displacement would stop and that assets of those displaced would be protected and could be reclaimed following due process the international partners will continue to monitor events in somaliland to ensure that these commitments are upheld reaction on the street was quick and abrasively direct tweeters sampled below emphasized somaliland s right to take whatever measure it deemed necessary short of killing or arbitrary mass detentions for longer periods in order to save citizen lives since the partners avoided deportations as somalilanders termed the las anod operation as if in agreement with somalia s claim that somalis cannot be deported from their own country meaning somaliland was part of somalia tweets appear to dwell more heavily on this issue from different angles the government of somaliland should ve released its own take of the meeting if it did not bow to pressure nowhere in the world do the so called international partners have a free rein in the

things are looking up for name brands post covid while things might still look gloomy in the retail arena as the covid 19 coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic keeps stretching out things are actually looking up especially for luxury brands fame market days a reconfigured online version of the capital s biggest design fair brought over vogue business head of advisory anusha couttigane for a webinar called ph fashion the leap to global the webinar was streamed via hopin on oct 20 ms couttigane concentrated on the effects of the covid 19 pandemic on world markets and post pandemic recovery strategies the luxury industry is expected to grow considerably according to data by bcg boston consulting group said ms couttigane in the context of covid 19 a full recovery is expected between the end of 2021 and 2022 when we look at that on a segment level the luxury personal goods industry although expected to grow significantly by 2025 it is actually going to account for a smaller proportion of the overall luxury industry i don t want this to ring any alarm bells because that segment is going to be expanding from an estimated value of 340 billion today to around 390 billion by 2025 with the potential for that segment to grow to 440 billion by next year she said that really depends on different economic scenarios of course there are still a lot of uncertainty in the world today she points that the search for experiences a known preference by millennials and the succeeding generations have changed how we consume it s actually experiences that are driving development and expected to expand further she says that suggests that there could be opportunities to collaborate or extend into sectors such as homewares or hospitality and leisure perhaps by collaborating with hotels for example to really further commercial success an article from bcg titled a new era and a new look for luxury by sarah willersdorf joël hazan guia ricci alexandre prénaud filippo bianchi javier seara and veronique yang says brands must create online experiences that feel exclusive and beyond what nonluxury retailers offer experiences should take into account not just shopping and purchase transactions but also related activities such as fashion shows private showings personal shoppers white glove delivery and other customized services key cities ms couttigane also points to the differing rates of post pandemic recoveries in cities when we look at this at a regional level it s really important to know that the post covid 19 recovery is taking place at a different pace depending on the city you re in she says that while london is heading in the right direction its pace is slower than capitals such as paris tokyo and amsterdam there s a much bigger recovery and progress in cities such as rome stockholm and new york when you re considering which cities to either expand in or grow your footprint or where you might have physical retail stock it s very important to note where the faster pace of recovery is taking place she said be prepared the perhaps slower returns on investment in these cities that are taking a slower trajectory towards recovery going online ms couttigane acknowledges the switch to online sales during the pandemic which arguably has made the world even smaller and more accessible we know that online has had a huge moment over the course of the pandemic it s been the primary way in which consumers have been accessing fashion goods she said there s a real focus on commercial performance online especially amongst smaller brands and businesses that are currently seeing a revenue of under 100 million euros if you are one of these businesses that are operating around a hundred million euros or less then it s really important to be aware that your rivals in that revenue segment are going to be investing heavily in digital and that s where you re going to see more fierce competition joseph l garcia

68 per cent of canadians think stephen harper is dishonest the other 32 per cent surely know he s dishonest but that s beside the point maybe it s because he spent public money to promote a jobs program that didn t exist maybe it s because his government s sole focus is promoting an economic recovery program that isn t real in any case spring is in the air cold and flu season is ending and canadians can finally breathe again with clear noses they can catch a fresh whiff of bullshit polls show they want a new pm and the good news is that some of them can have one enter pauline marois p m by name marois is making a great case for pm by title heck she already has it in quebec she also has the personality to replace chairman harper she refuses to participate in press events and she wants a majority also like the chairman she wants to redraw the map to her benefit perhaps that last comparison is unfair while our dear leader merely redrew riding boundaries to redistribute the vote in his favour marois suggests a complete redrawing of canada you re probably thinking boooooooooring we ve been there and done that back when baywatch was still a thing while it s true that canada has had referendums before it is important to understand that marois is not proposing a simple referendum p m wants a sovereign quebec with borders that function like the eu model so in north american terms no borders big change right no not really quebecers could still see the rockies out west and go to prince edward island so there is no reason to panic to keep financial markets from collapsing quebec will still use the canadian dollar with a permanent seat on the bank of canada thank god for pauline marois protector of the quebec citizen s right to passports access to alberta s oil and mountains and chance to experience p e i s charm and red dirt as for the border changes the rest of canada has to suck it up and deal with it this sounds outrageous so let s put it in context at the federal level emperor harper is trying to stop canadians from voting in quebec pauline marois is trying to make sure sovereign quebecers can still travel totally harmless or is there more to it some allege that marois thick accent is hiding institutionalized corruption and racism in la belle province others like quebec liberal leader philippe couillard say that focusing on separatism hurts quebec evidently there is a diversity of opinions on how quebec should approach the future let s add one more opinion to the mix dearest voters of quebec heed this advice from one canadian to another at least for the time being think carefully about what you are about to do you elected pauline marois to replace charest s liberals you gave marois a minority government to show the liberals that they had screwed up but that you weren t ready to throw the province to the dogs quite yet remember what happened in canada in 2006 we turfed the paul martin liberals to send them a message we replaced them with el dictator and his band of maniacs but we only gave them a minority so that they couldn t destroy our country a few years later in 2011 we upgraded them to a majority and well it s pretty much what we expected do you want the same thing to happen to your province polls suggest that marois is in majority territory so proceed cautiously some politicians are meant to lead minority governments for your own sakes count pauline marois among them

article 3 months old international oct 25 2021 tesla s latest result puts the critics and permabears firmly on the back foot reports danielle ecuyer tesla s q3 performance triggers earnings forecast upgrades among wall street analysts company now aiming to disrupt the insurance industry demand for tesla evs has even surprised management software and insurance expected to drive higher margin sales in years ahead by danielle ecuyer the tesla price has run up from us 600 in early june and unlike previous quarterly earnings reports last week s q3 results were not the usual sell the fact moment with the stock price reaching a record close of us 909 25 two days after the earnings report on any metric the earnings result was a stand up and be counted moment for tesla and analysts applauded the results with an average 13 upgrade in earnings for 2021 and 10 for 2022 according to gary black managing partner at the future fund in the most challenging of times with supply chain problems for all automotive manufacturers tesla glided through the cost input maze with a 57 increase in automotive revenues and a gross margin ex green credits of 28 8 the operating margin at 14 8 has now exceeded the medium term goals of the company the model 3 became the bestselling luxury sedan across the world and the model y is expected to be the bestselling car ever remembering that the current best sellers notch up one million annual unit sales per annum the great results were also achieved with a 6 decline in the average selling price asp and without the higher margin premium model s plaid and the refresh model x which are just coming back on stream at the freemont facility in california tesla investors will be looking forward to the model y ramp up as the new berlin and austin giga factories come on stream in 2022 in the q3 earnings call senior management reiterated that there remain unknown unknowns in the ramp ups so between ongoing supply chain and cost challenges the margin improvements displayed this quarter may be tested in the next 4 5 quarters but investors need to look beyond the short term to see the big picture the big picture tesla is aiming for 20m vehicles by 2030 and their current annual production rate is bumping up at around 1m evs prior to austin and berlin coming on stream the aim is to compound volume growth at 50 p a putting 5m evs in range by 2026 the standout comment from the earnings call was the admission that even management were surprised by the level of demand for electric vehicles and specifically tesla vehicles with lead times for deliveries running at 2 6 months depending on the geographic region much continues to be made on the bear case for tesla around valuation and the constant cri de coeur of the competition is coming the fact is tesla is keen for the incumbents to accelerate the transition to ev s and according to the world s largest producer of lithium albemarle ev demand will grow from 3 4m units in 2020 to 35m in 2030 plain and simple the market for evs is growing but the winners will be the companies with the ability to access the capital needed to invest for the transition adam jonas from morgan stanley calls the ev transition an arms race on technology batteries and talent and at this stage of the race tesla is winning on all fronts it is very challenging for the incumbents to even attract the best engineers when tesla is viewed as the leading light of engineering across so many aspects of their business model this leads me to probably the most interesting part of the q3 conference call the rollout of tesla s insurance product in texas the importance of insurance in the constant drive to reduce costs for consumers tesla worked out that insurance was one of the biggest challenges to reducing the financing costs for their evs so what if they used the data to create a personalised bespoke insurance product for tesla drivers some 150 000 connected drivers who are using the safety score on the full self driving fsd beta product have produced 100m miles of data although the insurance industry is heavily regulated tesla has been able to start selling tesla insurance to texas drivers the results thus far show that the probability of a collision using the safety score is 30 lower and that the data are supporting the personalised insurance product vehicle insurance based on real driving data allows for a cost reduction for those safe drivers the cost to decarbonise was recently estimated at us 6trn per annum by goldman sachs while analyst dan ives md and analyst from wedbush calls tesla the winner from the green tidal wave tesla s aim is to create the most technologically advanced vertically integrated energy and transport company based on software and machine learning or put simply computers on wheels the comparison with what apple has achieved is the most cited a hardware company that has transitioned to a software hybrid model and in tesla s case smart autonomous vehicles and a smart insurance business there are many regulatory hurdles to contend with to create the goal of an autonomous robo taxi fleet wall street valuations price targets valuing a company like tesla remains contentious on wall street in the bull pen there are now seven wall street analysts banks that have price targets above us 1000 as follows new street research us 1298 piper sandler us 1200 wedbush us 1100 oppenheimer us 1080 canaccord us 1040 bank of america us 1000 deutsche bank us 1000 followed by mizuho us 950 morgan stanley at us 900 credit suisse us 830 and wells fargo at us 860 gene munster from loup funds argues that in 3 5 years evs will represent 25 plus of total sales with software services such as the fsd and insurance products driving higher margin sales he even goes as far as to suggest an apple like gross margin of 40 is possible with a shift in the sales and earnings mix with revenue growth from us 70bn in 2022 to us 400bn in 2027 a 6x times revenue multiple results in a stock price of 2500 there is no denying that a lot needs to go right for that outcome but the bulls are firmly in a similar state of opinion by contrast the bears continue to value tesla like a traditional automotive manufacturer with barclays holding the permabear underweight valuation of us 300 tesla will most likely be the next us trillion dollar giant and whilst the story is far from risk free tesla has proven its credentials in terms of earnings growth and profitability there is one thing certain about tesla this story is far from over folks danielle

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video north carolina s rent and utility assistance program is in its second round of funding the hope program reports any changes would need to come from washington charlotte n c it took some growing pains but the north carolina office of recovery and resiliency reports its hope program is now awarding rent and utility payments to vulnerable families lightning fast meaning in a matter of just 20 to 25 days director laura hogshead said more people are eligible for the second round of hope assistance than probably realize it even so the apartment association of north carolina believes the program is overlooking some and the association is now calling for reform it s now time to move it a little bit forward and figure out who else was left behind under the initial wave of support aanc government affairs director janae moore said not to bash what the folks at the hope program are doing because they are doing a huge service for the state of north carolina but there are some gaps and those gaps deserve to be brought to the forefront the organization is touting a new survey which garnered responses from just 17 property management workers as a cause for reform moore said a third of those who participated many in eligible counties reported waiting at least two months for the state to deliver hope money meanwhile she said half reported they re not satisfied with the program moore said the aanc wants to see the rules change so landlords can ask for hope funding on behalf of their tenants and they can use the money to cover the high cost of abandoned apartments abandoned apartments are units renters moved out of before applying for aid or before landlords could take action i think what we should really be focused on is those who have been left out moore said for some 17 does not seem like a large number but you have to remember that property managers they are one individual but they have a number of properties across the state wcnc charlotte is always asking where s the money if you need help reach out to the defenders team by emailing money wcnc com hogshead was taken aback by the new criticism it was a sample size of 17 so i m not going to be swayed on eight and a half landlords because we have paychecks to 30 727 landlords she said i don t think it is a fair extrapolation on general satisfaction with the hope program i wish they would have reached out with concerns hogshead said the program now in its second round of funding has evolved into one of the most efficient in the country it has saved people from eviction she said it has saved people from spreading covid and we hear every day from grateful landlords and grateful families about what a difference this has made in their lives hogshead said unlike the first round when the state invented the program oversight for the second round comes from washington d c and those regulations require renters to apply for the money not their landlords hogshead said hope money can help cover abandoned apartments but only if the renter applies and requests it the landlord can t ask and that s the treasury s rule that s not something we made up she said those are federal rules that i can t change and so i d be happy to talk to them about that i think there s a more productive way to have this conversation she said the state is still accepting applications for rent and utility help most people are eligible for this program hogshead said she said the first round of hope funds included 133 million but the second round will have a much larger impact she said the state has until 2025 to spend 800 million those interested in learning more about eligibility or wanting to apply can do so by visiting their website or calling 888 927 5467
investors focus this week will be on earnings results with some of the most heavily weighted companies in the s p 500 poised to deliver their quarterly reports over the past couple of weeks most of the companies that posted earnings results topped wall street s estimates despite widespread concerns over the impact of supply chain challenges to corporate profits these better than feared results helped power both the s p 500 and dow to fresh record highs in the past week as of friday about 23 of s p 500 companies had reported actual results for the third quarter of these 84 topped wall street s expectations for earnings per share eps according to data from factset and the estimated earnings growth rate for the s p 500 stood at 32 7 based on actual results and expectations for companies still yet to report if maintained through the end of third quarter earnings season that would mark the third highest earnings growth rate posted for the index since 2010 given the string of stronger than expected results posted so far this week s docket of reports has a heightened bar to clear and that s especially set to be the case for the big tech companies including facebook fb apple aapl amazon amzn and alphabet googl most of these far outperformed the market last year but have seen their stock gains cool so far in 2021 amid concerns over rising interest rates chip shortages and slowing growth after a surge in online media usage and demand for software during the height of the pandemic despite the near term challenges however some strategists have struck an upbeat tone on the technology sector as a whole while the chip shortage will be a major conversation piece for tech investors during tech earnings season and clearly be an overhang we believe the street will instead look through any near term disruption and focus on the underlying healthy demand drivers into 2022 which look robust said wedbush analyst dan ives in a note last week a number of the closely watched technology companies that reported last week posted results that disappointed investors or highlighted the lingering impact of these myriad concerns snap snap the parent company of the disappearing photo sharing platform app snapchat offered a current quarter forecast that fell short of expectations with supply chain challenges for its advertiser customer base and privacy related changes to

consumer travel behavior and out of the home spending in their third quarter earnings releases and calls lost in the noise snap also highlighted opportunity driven by travel budgets returning which is a positive read through to googl s general search business daniel salmon bmo capital markets internet and media analyst wrote in a note on friday ongoing semiconductor shortages and supply related issues also dealt a blow to other tech companies tesla tsla said in its earnings report last week that a variety of challenges including semiconductor shortages congestion at ports and rolling blackouts have been impacting our ability to keep factories running at full speed and reports earlier this month from bloomberg suggested apple was likely to cut its iphone 13 production targets by as many as 10 million units amid chip shortages the company however is still expected to post still solid revenue growth of 21 bringing sales to 84 67 billion as consumer demand for the latest smartphones remained resilient especially in the u s and china rounding out this tech heavy earnings week will be amazon amzn which posts quarterly results alongside apple on thursday after market close the company has lagged the market since last reporting earnings in late july falling 7 3 since july 29 versus a 2 9 gain in the s p 500 investors have been especially cautious on amazon given widespread supply chain constraints rising labor costs and fears that e commerce sales and amazon web services growth could slow after a pandemic induced surge amazon shares had climbed by 76 in 2020 and the stock was the second best faang performer after apple that year concerns across top line bottom line and broader macro have collectively driven cautious sentiment into year end wrote jpmorgan analyst doug anmuth in a note last thursday however we believe there is still significant secular shift toward e commerce ahead and amazon has a very strong track record around investing into future growth opportunities macro issues related to supply chain port congestion and inventory are well documented and have intensified into the holiday season driving concerns that delays could impact timing of amzn receiving 1p 3p inventory and certain items could remain out of stock he added overall we believe amzn embedded some degree of disruption into the 3q guide and we believe amzn scaled inventory in anticipation of greater 2h demand in late july amazon said it expected third quarter net sales to total 106 billion to 112 billion missing consensus expectations at the time wall street

coronavirus vaccines hotez and his houston team needed an infusion of cash to build on their past work and make a vaccine that could as hotez told listeners then rescue the world from the deadly emerging coronavirus pandemic you d think that people would be pretty eager to support us to move this forward but so far it hasn t happened the houston pediatrician and vaccine scientist told the host dr peter attia on march 14 2020 by the following week major cities in texas began to shut down to avoid widespread community outbreaks but hotez s plea worked the donations started coming in support of efforts in the deadly new pandemic at the baylor college of medicine at the texas children s hospital center for vaccine development co directed by hotez and dr maria elena bottazzi in houston both of whom are celebrated pioneers in the area of vaccines for neglected tropical diseases like chagas and schistosomiasis maria bottazzi replaces vials of the rbd based sars cov 2 vaccine into a freezer at the tropical medicine lab at texas children s hospital center for vaccine development in houston on oct 5 2021 credit justin rex for the texas tribune among the gifts was a 1 million infusion of cash in may 2020 by the philanthropic arm of texas based tito s handmade vodka whose director of global impact and research sarah everett was tuned in when hotez asked for help in reviving their research we decided that somebody should help restart that work immediately everett said now nearly 18 months later the houston team s vaccine called corbevax by its maker in india is cheap has no patent can be made by many vaccine producers globally including those in low and middle income countries and is poised to receive approval for widespread global use the indian government has promised the biopharmaceutical company biological e limited which is making the vaccine in that country that it will buy 300 million doses with the potential for more a halal version of the vaccine for use in islamic countries because it doesn t contain animal based ingredients is also about to start clinical trials in indonesia and later this year the company hopes the vaccine will be endorsed by the world health organization for use globally which could open the doors to quicker authorization in several countries that need it but here in the united states this truly texas vaccine as its creators like to call it has no home a texas style vaccine the fact that the vaccine even exists can be traced to a lot of texas money including funds from the robert j kleberg jr and helen c kleberg foundation and the m d anderson foundation several high level and anonymous individual donors pitched in as well as the jpb foundation in new york those donations funded a vaccine prototype with the initial doses mixed in the houston lab and transferred to biological e in india in may 2020 by november bioe began clinical trials of the vaccine in india where the delta variant was first identified and which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the world total cost from creation to market was between 5 million and 7 million bottazzi said the u s government has yet to get on board operation warp speed the public private partnership created by the federal government to accelerate treatments and vaccines for covid 19 spent none of its billions at the houston lab most experts including hotez and bottazzi agree that s because most of the funding and the attention and the bets are on the vaccines made earliest in the pandemic and with the newest technology by pfizer moderna and johnson johnson and a few others we re pushing the new ways because they re better and faster said dr benjamin neuman a texas a m university virologist who has been doing coronavirus research since 1996 though he was not involved in any of the approved vaccines development why wouldn t you want to have it all justin rex for the texas tribune credit justin rex for the texas tribune a lab worker

hospital center credit justin rex for the texas tribune competition from new tech the mrna vaccines by pfizer and moderna use messenger rna a molecule the virus needs to produce a spike protein and bind to human cells to prompt the immune system to produce antibodies against that protein five years ago neuman said that process hadn t been made effective yet but by the time hotez was making his plea on attia s podcast moderna was already starting up clinical trials of its mrna vaccine in partnership with the national institutes of health the biomedical research arm of the u s government and the largest center of its kind in the world and by late 2020 when bioe was rolling out its phase 1 clinical trials with corbevax in india pfizer was already getting emergency use authorization from the u s food and drug administration the bottazi and hotez vaccine relies on a production process very similar to the way the hepatitis b vaccine is made that s been produced and used around the world for decades the two argue that the familiarity with the process and the ease with which the materials can be gotten makes it easier to quickly ramp up global production compared to the newer vaccines even if they came onto the market a little later but aside from a handful of philanthropies who can see the value of the domino effect more vaccinations outside this country help lower infections around the world and here hotez and bottazzi have heard nothing about producing or distributing here at home why weren t conventional vaccine technologies given the opportunity of being at the same table as all these other technologies bottazzi said the answer neuman says is that while conventional technologies or what he jokingly derided as the obvious answer have a role in global vaccine development the newer vaccines are stronger than the traditional types that bottazzi hotez and other scientists around the world are developing newer vaccines also have a quicker production process than the conventional vaccines said neuman a member of the international committee that named sars cov 2 the virus behind the covid 19 pandemic but neuman agrees that the newer vaccines have distribution challenges the tangles of intellectual property patents the availability of materials to produce billions of doses in a short period of time and the logistics of a more complicated transport and storage process those challenges can be solved neuman said but until then the majority of the planet should be vaccinated by any means necessary including with conventional vaccines like the one created by bottazzi and hotez if it proves to be safe and effective whatever gets the job done the fastest as long as it s safe for everybody involved he said peter hotez at the tropical medicine lab at texas children s hospital center for vaccine development in houston on oct 5 2021 credit justin rex for the texas tribune one plane flight away while the houston team waits for a production and distribution partner the team fields calls every week from other countries asking them for help getting access to the vaccine bottazzi said they ask if they can get the spare doses that americans are declining or if they can get connected to bioe to export to them from their indian made stocks or if the scientists will share the formula for the prototype the scientists share the formula with any country or lab who asks for it and help in other ways however they can we re kind of practicing our own version of texas vaccine diplomacy hotez said vaccination rates for developing countries are still in the single digits about 38 of the world population is fully vaccinated against covid 19 many african countries such as sudan kenya and ethiopia have a rate below 2 in india where nearly a billion doses of three different vaccines covishield covaxin and sputnik v have been distributed more than 80 of the population remains unvaccinated in brazil less than a third of the country is inoculated we re one plane flight away from seeing a variant that developed in a country that has very little vaccine end up on our shores and set off a new wave of the pandemic said dr james cutrell an infectious disease expert at ut southwestern medical center right now the world health organization is already monitoring several variants that have been traced to developing countries including indonesia 21 fully vaccinated peru with one of the highest covid 19 mortality rates in the world colombia the dominican republic and south africa much of sub saharan africa large swaths of latin america and other places like that they really don t have access to the vaccines said cutrell an associate professor in the department of internal medicine that makes it really important and attractive to have some of these cheaper easier to distribute but hopefully similarly effective vaccines with more traditional technology which i think this vaccine and other vaccines like it can contribute american problem international solution as the world scrambles for doses to meet the vaccination demand elsewhere this nation s vaccination effort has flagged hitting a wall of hesitation by a significant portion of the american public that is declining the new vaccines although they have proven to be safe and effective hotez and bottazzi believe their vaccine would likely be more accepted by those who don t trust a vaccine that is unfamiliar to them like those by pfizer and moderna but from the start inoculating reticent americans was never the houston team s first priority bottazzi and hotez began their work developing coronavirus vaccines as part of their mission at the national school of tropical medicine where hotez is dean and bottazzi is associate dean to inoculate developing nations against tropical viruses fast forward to january 2020 when sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 was setting off alarms in the u s medical community bottazzi and hotez began working to repurpose their coronavirus research program to develop a vaccine against the new virus and distribute it to the same countries they d focused on throughout their careers the speed with which the pfizer and moderna vaccines were developed and the fact they used newer formulas seemed to spook some americans and helped fuel politically motivated misinformation campaigns that chipped away at public acceptance and as this nation s vaccination rate hovers around 57 it s a matter of debate what is needed to achieve a higher level of immunity as a country neuman said he isn t so sure that a more familiar vaccine formula would change a lot of minds in the united states where the resistance appears to be more political than scientific i think that comes from a lot of different places and i think the main place is sort of you re not the boss of me he said who says you get to tell me what to do and i don t think it matters what it is even if it would make a difference the path to emergency use authorization for a covid 19 vaccine in this country starts with money for research for trials for materials and ends with firm commitments from the u s to support its mass production the bottazzi hotez shot at this point has neither and so hotez who is an internationally known and outspoken warrior against the anti vaccine movement and bottazzi redouble their attention abroad to protect americans who can t or won t protect themselves if they can get more of their vaccine overseas within a few months they can keep the variants from percolating and landing on u s soil it s a pretty ambitious audacious goal hotez said but i think we could get there disclosure ut southwestern medical center has been a financial supporter of the texas tribune a nonprofit

pharmaceutical deals have a particular resonance in a covid world but how do you get one over the line during a global pandemic thomas french was the lead associate on the macfarlanes team advising global biopharmaceutical company jazz pharmaceuticals jazz based in dublin on its 7 2bn acquisition of gw pharmaceuticals comprised of cash of 6 55bn and stock of 650m by way of a uk scheme of arrangement he explains that the transaction involved almost 50 lawyers from macfarlanes across a multitude of practice areas led by corporate and m a partner harry coghill and senior advisor charles martin recording a total of 3 500 hours of work this required a huge amount of internal coordination and teamwork to ensure we were all working towards the target deadlines in a systematic and joined up manner french says communicating across the team was key to achieving the success of the deal and was especially relevant under the constraints of the pandemic co ordinating different firms as well as internal teams we had a number of different law firms involved as well as a large internal team spanning multiple specialist departments such as tax ip employment pensions and so on and were operating to tight deadlines thankfully it all worked smoothly but that required a good deal of internal teamwork and coordination particularly during lockdown when everyone was physically separated jazz which focuses on developing life changing medicines for people with serious diseases was looking to diversify its commercial portfolio and pipeline therapy products leading to macfarlanes appointment to advise on its acquisition of gw alongside wachtell lipton who introduced the client to macfarlanes the jazz pharmaceuticals deal gw is currently the uk s largest cultivator and exporter of products derived from marijuana the deal capitalises on a trend which is seeing cannabis based medicines becoming gradually legalised around the world including north america and parts of europe making it one of the fastest growing healthcare sectors the acquisition of gw was transformational for jazz the 7 2bn purchase price is nearly the same as its own market capitalisation of c 9bn it gives jazz access to epidiolex a childhood epilepsy drug which in 2018 was the first cannabis derived medicine to receive us regulatory approval and also to become available on the nhs this deal is one of only around five deals that have ever been done involving this transaction structure an acquisition of a uk plc that is listed in new york and therefore not subject to the uk s takeover code given how few transactions of this type have been completed and the size of the transaction it is likely to become an important precedent particularly as more uk companies choose to list in new york rather than london as french explains this was a transformational deal for our client both in terms of size and in terms of the sector the deal was very bespoke as a result of falling outside the uk takeover code which allowed the parties to negotiate complex deal terms outside of the code restrictions on offer related arrangements for example jazz negotiated the inclusion of a circa 70m break fee payable by gw in certain circumstances if the transaction was terminated extra complications of gw shares on top of this there were other unique challenge presented by the deal circa 97 per cent of the shares in gw were held by just a single registered shareholder citigroup as the operator of an american depositary share programme with citigroup in turn issuing american depositary shares representing underlying gw shares the other 3 per cent of the gw shares were held by around 1 000 individual shareholders most of whom had very small shareholdings french explains the deal was structured as a scheme of arrangement and so needed the requisite shareholder approval under the companies act 2006 involving both 75 per cent in value and a majority in number of those voting the issue was that even though the citibank shareholder represented 97 per cent of the value it only counted as one vote for the purposes of the majority in number test which could potentially have skewed the outcome and undermined deal certainty however french says this was dealt with through a range of measures for example encouraging certain management shareholders to convert their adss into gw ordinary shares so that they could then be counted individually towards the majority in number test the management of these strategies required close monitoring and co operation with the lawyers acting for gw thomas french s professional background french joined macfarlanes corporate and m a team back in september 2016 having trained at slaughter and may and worked in the corporate team there until three years pqe i ve worked on a really wide range of deals during my time at macfarlanes including private m a public takeovers private equity and joint ventures he says the breadth of the corporate and m a practice is one of the things i ve enjoyed most about the firm as it means you are constantly having to learn and adapt and there is always an opportunity to try your hand at something new i ve found that a lot of the satisfaction and enjoyment comes from the people you deal with while working on the matter both internally and at the client some of the transactions i ve enjoyed the most have been those where the client was personally invested for example advising a founder on the sale of a financial services business and so very engaged and involved with the negotiations it has also been interesting to gain exposure to a wide range of different sectors including healthcare industrials agriculture financial services and so on the degree of co operation between the various law firms involved was what stood out most for french on this deal wachtell led the transaction from a new york law perspective with macfarlanes advising on english aspects and arthur cox on irish aspects and all three firms worked seamlessly as one team to deliver an excellent client service he says it also stood out because of a whole host of bespoke features including the fact that the takeover code did not apply and the complicated capital structure and share register of gw pharmaceuticals plc gw due to the existence of an adr programmed operated by citibank all of which gave rise to complicated but interesting structuring considerations however he says working under the constraints of the pandemic did provide valuable lessons for the future working remotely certainly added an extra challenge however it also enabled a more seamless international working structure as each firm had already adapted to the new working environment and methods of communication he says in my opinion the best outcome for the future will be to merge the two ways of working remote and in person to make sure they are properly balanced and everyone gets the upsides of both although the team had been working on the deal for nearly a year most of that work was done in less than a month at the start of 2021 so it required careful project management to ensure that it progressed smoothly to signing the firm had worked on another aborted 1bn plus transaction that involved the same very unusual fundamental structure at the very end of 2020 as a result it was familiar with the limited number of precedent deals and able to advise the client in detail about the areas in which it could achieve more favourable outcomes in critically important areas of the transaction documentation than if this had been a typical transaction governed by the uk takeover code with the addition of epidiolex a third high growth commercial franchise which in 2020 exceeded 500m in annual net sales jazz has already initiated a relaunch of the solution in europe under the trade name epidyolex jazz also expects the deal will deliver substantial shareholder value with an expectation of accelerated double digit top line revenue growth accretive in the first full calendar year following the merger the deal has generated significant interest from other businesses active in the sector including on social media and macfarlanes has undertaken considerable post completion work for jazz across the corporate financing and tax structuring teams this transaction was a great learning experience particularly in co ordinating a large number of internal and external parties to a tight deadline it also threw up a large number of interesting points of law and practice that will be useful for future transactions french says without the visibility that comes with working together in an office being clear and transparent on progress and having the confidence to reach out to colleagues for their support when capacity was tight was paramount you have to work harder to achieve the buzz and sense of team spirit which helps motivate everyone to perform to their best and get the deal across the line since this deal completed french has worked on a range of transactions including various private m a transactions such as the acquisition of a large uk farming business and the acquisition of a uk bank as well as a corporate joint venture in respect of an international shipping business reflecting on the range of work he s done at the firm french says we have a tight knit team and the breadth of the practice means i ve had the opportunity to work with most of the partners and across a wide range of different transaction types and sectors these have included advising smith williamson on its merger with tilney group creating the uk s leading integrated wealth manager group alongside corporate and m a partner tom rose and advising the management team of uk data centre and cloud company pulsant on its sale by oak hill capital and scottish equity partners to antin infrastructure partners working with corporate and m a partner jessica adam who heads up the firm s management team advisory practice macfarlanes prides itself on its ability to leverage an impressive partner associate ratio of just 2 1 as a result of this approach the firms says the team builds and maintains strong bonds with clients resulting in longstanding relationships with several major companies including jc flowers greenergy hayfin caledonia exponent air liquide legal general goldman jd wetherspoons smith williamson puma energy about thomas french 2016 solicitor macfarlanes 2013 2016 associate slaughter and may 2011 2013 trainee slaughter and may
the colorado water trust is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year with two decades of efforts to restore flows in colorado rivers but the trust s next 20 years will likely face greater challenges of climate change and population growth that are already taking a toll on the state s waterways the trust s main focus is to improve instream flows the flows and water levels in a stream or river back in 1973 the colorado general assembly recognized the need for a statewide instream flow program the colorado water conservation board cwcb was given the authority to acquire water rights or lease them for instream flow purposes instream flow water rights one of the beneficial uses under colorado s water rights law are the exclusive authority of the cwcb while the original purpose of the legislation was to protect the natural environment the instream flow program has expanded to address water requirements for declining sensitive and threatened and endangered species and protection of macroinvertebrate populations and rare riparian vegetation assemblages according to the cwcb since 1973 the cwcb has appropriated instream flow rights for 1 700 stream segments covering more than 9 700 miles of stream but the instream flow program got off to a slow start and drought was becoming an increasing problem in colorado one of the first big droughts was in the winter of 1976 77 which sent shock waves through colorado s economy and state government there was a gap the cwcb had the authority over junior water rights for instream flows but nothing in place to acquire senior water rights those junior rights are useful very high up in the mountains where there aren t a lot of other rights said andy schultheiss the trust s executive director senior water rights on the other hand are more secure but the state needed an outside group to scout opportunities for the state to buy or lease those senior water rights in 2000 water engineers water lawyers and conservationists began discussions on how to bolster the instream flow program and that led to the formation of the trust in 2001 like most new water programs in colorado the trust faced suspicion from water rights holders early on especially farmers and ranchers according to the colorado water exchange 80 of the state s water goes toward irrigation and that s mostly for agriculture it took us eight or nine years to develop our first project schultheiss said there s a lot of reluctance to try anything new that first major project came in 2009 when pitkin county and the cwcb signed an agreement brokered by the trust to allow the county to lend water for the instream flow program since then the trust has directed 13 5 million gallons of water through 588 miles of colorado waterways the approach today works like this the trust goes to a rancher and says how about you stop irrigating say aug 1 and we compensate you for the days you re missing and we give the rest of your water to the state to lease it to use in an instream flow reach that s a classic kind of trust project schultheiss said in an apparently groundbreaking permanent water sharing agreement in 2014 said to be the first in the west the trust purchased a portion of the water rights on the mckinley ditch to restore flows to a three mile segment of the little cimarron river a tributary of the gunnison river in spring and summer the water is available for agricultural irrigation late summer and fall the water heads down the little cimarron we ll take anything that keeps water in the streams schultheiss said of the trust s creative approach more recently the trust has played a major role in trying to protect the yampa river the yampa has been in trouble for years but in 2021 its lack of instream flows prompted the city of steamboat springs to close the river for most of the summer and fall to all commercial use within the city s jurisdiction no boating rafting or fishing the trust has been trying to improve instream flows on the yampa since the 2012 drought according to schultheiss in some years the water they buy from stagecoach reservoir represents a third or more of the water in the river he said featured local savings back in 2012 the trust recognized that there was water sitting in stagecoach with very few customers and we said why not why can t we just buy water and release water from stagecoach there s an in stream flow reach just below the dam and then there s the city farther down by 2021 the releases from stagecoach have been institutionalized according to schultheiss thanks to the yampa river fund a collaboration between the steamboat springs and the nature conservancy and with a 4 5 million endowment to pay for it the river got a record breaking 2 000 acre feet of water from stagecoach in a year with severe drought in northwestern colorado it was enough to keep the water temperatures down and avoid fish kills and other environmental damage marsha and troy doc daughenbaugh own the rocking c bar ranch a cattle and hay ranch at the base of elk mountain the ranch has been in the family for more than 50 years with senior water rights that go back to the 1890s marsha joined the board of the trust in 2020 after spending nearly two decades with community agricultural alliance in routt county including as its executive director that led her to become interested in water issues and the protection of agricultural water rights she first became aware of the trust from its releases to the yampa from stagecoach i was really stunned that there was an organization out there than even cared about the yampa river she told colorado politics when i started looking at what that was and who was running it i was so impressed there was an organization that said we think we can restore water by a market based form of operation and provide compensation through whoever actually does own all of those water rights but let that water be used all the way through the system as to the future daughenbaugh says the board needs to diversify to include more representation from agriculture out of its 16 members just two come out of ag which owns the most senior water rights in the state agricultural water holders are concerned that we are the low hanging fruit we will be the first ones asked to reduce the first asked to legislatively make some sacrifices daughenbaugh doesn t lease her water rights they need all of it for their cattle and hay operations but she s pleased with the trust s work on the yampa i think the yampa river would have faced some real difficulties if the trust hadn t been started without those instream flow releases you could walk across the yampa river without getting your ankles wet if we benefit the fish and if we keep the water temps cool enough that in my mind allows other things to happen to the benefit of the whole river system but is the trust s approach the right one or the only one in water terms the trust operates in what s known as a water market akin to a stock market for water water markets are a major interest of the walton family foundation which in april suggested legislative changes would be needed in colorado to change the transaction costs for water according to the wall street journal the foundation has put 200 million into projects for the colorado river with the money going to environmental organizations universities including the cu foundation and the law school s getches wilkinson center for natural resources energy and the environment and even colorado media outlets for reporting on the river s struggles but the journal report said the foundation is drowning out nonmarket solutions an oxford study noted in the article said that the voices being heard are the ones that agree with market based

sen tim kaine d va joined sen brian schatz d hi in introducing the state justice improvement act legislation that will make lasting changes to america s criminal justice system across the country courts often impose fines and fees without considering an individual s ability to pay disproportionately impacting low income communities and communities of color this legislation provides state and local courts with new and expanded federal funding opportunities to reform these punitive policies house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler d ny introduced companion legislation in the u s house of representatives this legislation is a vital step toward dismantling the harmful architecture of inequality kaine said eliminating excessive court fines and fees will help create a more fair justice system for all and give state and local courts the resources to implement effective alternatives to hold people accountable all americans deserve equal treatment under the law no matter how much money is in their bank accounts schatz said our bill will help to end the cycle of poverty and incarceration creating a justice system that treats people fairly and keeps our communities safe all americans regardless of their socioeconomic status deserve equal access to our nation s criminal justice system said nadler sadly numerous courts across the nation impose excessive fees and fines which have failed to improve public safety and instead have placed an undue burden on low income communities and communities of color our legislation will help address these injustices so that we take a step toward bringing an end to the poverty to prison pipeline and restore public trust in our criminal justice system individuals who are unable to pay face serious consequences including more fees license suspensions extended probation and incarceration as a result they can get trapped in the criminal justice system and may lose their jobs their homes and even their children in the 50 cities with the highest proportion of revenues from court fines the median african american population in each city was over five times the median across the country in addition the practice can be both costly and inefficient for cities and counties for example some counties in texas and new mexico spend an average of 41 cents to collect every dollar of revenue raised from fines and fees moreover there is no clear evidence that imposing large fines and fees deters crime in fact such fines may encourage crime a survey of counties in alabama indicated that nearly 40 percent of individuals committed a crime in order to pay off their court debt the state justice improvement act is a meaningful step towards creating a justice system that treats individuals fairly and ensures public safety the legislation will help jurisdictions enforce constitutional and equitable policies by broadening the activities available for federal funding the grants will be used to provide technical assistance and training to state and local courts as they develop effective alternatives to fines and fees should a person be deemed unable to pay the bill also requires the state justice institute to conduct a study on the effectiveness of these grants and to provide a report to congress with appropriate policy recommendations in the senate this legislation is also cosponsored by u s sens ron wyden d or richard blumenthal d ct jeff merkley d or cory booker d nj tina smith d mn and amy klobuchar d mn the bill has been endorsed by the american bar association brennan center for justice business roundtable dream corps justice fines and fees justice center national association of criminal defense lawyers national consumer law center on behalf of its low income clients national legal aid and defender association operation restoration safety and freedom fund r street institute and the law enforcement action partnership the full text of the bill is available here

multinational corporations all over the world represent pride to their countries they carry the flag of their countries beyond their economies and promote not just the business of the respective countries but also the culture in the developing countries the word multinational corporation is generally attributed to foreign companies from europe and the united states in africa for example africans do not see companies within the continent and outside their country as multinationals nigerians do not see multichoice shoprite or spar or even mtn as multinational companies just as the same nigerians do not know that glo dangote cement or first bank is a multinational business outfit but by definition they are businesses become multinational when they have a branch or branches outside the shores of their country of origin albeit we have found businesses without a branch or branches anywhere referred to as international by their owners i was guilty of such an act as a small kid after completing standard six primary school and while looking for money to go to secondary school i set up a lesson in our compound and labelled it adewale international lesson until one neighbour called me to ask if i had another branch of the lesson in benin republic i thought the name was elegant enough to attract students i did not even know which country was benin republic and my answer sent the man reeling with laughter let us keep the eagerness for my answer till a future occasion suffice it to say that anytime i travelled to the eastern part of nigeria passing through onitsha and seeing those signposts of small businesses with international appellation reminds me of my youthful folly there are many of such international businesses in lagos as we were growing up in this work of academics multinational corporations were being lampooned by academics in latin america and africa and probably some asian countries for transferring their huge profits to home countries many countries on these three continents have adopted the import substitution industrialisation model for development they thought it was a way of saving foreign exchange that they were using to import consumer goods in particular from the industrialised countries in addition to conserving foreign exchange it would be a way of generating employment and a short cut to technology transfer as their citizens would be engaged in the operations of the industries and be able to learn on the job the latin american countries were the first and major advocates of the isi but by the end of the 1960s it had dawned on them that the machines have arrived production had commenced with corresponding employment generation but the raw materials and machine spare parts have to be imported with over invoicing of imported goods which allowed more foreign exchange to be transferred abroad and under invoicing of exports that brings small amount of foreign exchange into the host economy periodically profits were being transferred in foreign currency out of the recipient continent without transfer of any technology after a little while the net flow of foreign currencies were in the negative as usual with the slow pace of activities in africa while the latin american economists were already making noise about the inappropriateness of the isi policy in the late 1960s african countries including nigeria started embracing the policy wholeheartedly in the early 1970s so multinational corporations also started shifting their base to africa coincidentally it was the period the cold war between the west and the east was thriving and africa was going through war induced colonisation and ideological perching the west led by the united states was promoting capitalism and democracy as its ideology while the east led by the soviet union ussr was the vanguard of socialism and communism which has an appeal of respect for labour as the central figure in production processes and the need to adequately take care of its welfare the academics of the left those who supported or professed socialism or marxism were seen as well informed vociferous and more importantly radical speaking big grammar that can easily suave students students were easily captured by the erudition of bade onimode and ola oni of university of ibadan mike kwanashie and bala usman of ahmadu bello university zaria and wagbafor and wangboje of university of benin among others those were the time universities were playing their roles as citadels of learning and professionalism such that hardly a month passed without a symposium on issues of national or international interest at the core of the debates in the universities sometimes were issues bordering on how capitalists from the west were exploiting the human and non human resources of the poor countries through their enterprises while socialist businesses from the east were for the welfare of host citizens yet up till date after the death of communism and socialism every developing country is pursuing policies to attract foreign direct investments as one of the goals toward industrialisation these days there seems to be less concern about repatriation of profits over and under invoicing and technology transfer but these trilogys are still in existence fortunately some developing countries like nigeria have come of age and can now boast of some multinational corporations or businesses businesses owned by aliko dangote mike adenuga femi otedola alhassan dantata folorunsho alakija as well as some banks like first bank plc access bank zenith bank guarantee trust bank and airlines like air peace and arik air have established their branches outside the shores of nigeria to that extent they have become multinational businesses thriving and making profits after all expenses are they repatriating their profits into their accounts in nigeria like other multinational businesses elsewhere do or keeping same abroad it is high time we asked and it is high time we showed interest we often hear of remittances from nigerians working abroad and sending money home to their families for investments or family welfare also are researchers or consultants working for international organisations or getting grants to carry out some investigations the estimated remittances received by nigeria from diaspora in 2018 amounted to 25 08bn 17 57bn in 2019 and 55 68bn between 2018 and 2020 though these data remain controversial in central bank s books the discrepancy can be explained within the context of the record of transfers kept by the banks of customers nigerians abroad and the record of the nigerian banks or correspondence banks that retain the money in their vaults while local banks here paid in domestic currency if the foreign currencies had been fully remitted it would have strengthened the country s stock of foreign reserves and that is why we must ask multinational businesses to remit their profits to nigeria as multinationals in other countries do in economics we talk about gross domestic product and gross national product they do not mean the same thing gdp simply refers to the value of final goods and services produced in a country in a given period usually one year while gnp is defined as the value of all products and services produced by the citizens of a country both domestically and internationally minus income earned by foreign residents although gdp provides a more accurate information about a nation s total economic activities the gnp can be higher than the gdp if the income earned by nigerian firms in overseas transactions exceeds the income earned by foreign firms within nigeria for example this is a typical picture of the united states economy do we calculate this for nigeria we need to but the nigerian multinational businesses must be transparent in giving us the true picture so that we can know our worth if nigerian multinational businesses kept their profits in their domiciliary or specially dedicated accounts in their banks here they would not need to be competing with domestic industries that also require foreign exchange to import raw materials and spare parts to keep their businesses going the stock of the central bank s foreign reserves would be strengthened with less pressure to meet demands for imports from all manners of businesses and the consequent rapid depreciation of the naira that is currently being witnessed these kind of benefits that industrialised countries enjoy from their multinational corporations make them do everything to promote and protect these corporations keeping their profits abroad strengthens the economies of those countries and they could even be lending us the money owned by our multinational businesses copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in whole or in

bloomberg cracks are emerging in the global solar industry threatening to flatten its growth trajectory just as the world needs clean power more than ever the sector is being slammed by a barrage of obstacles with rising materials costs forced labor accusations and a worsening trade war all hitting at once as a result panel prices are rising for the first time in years and some manufacturers have asked buyers to delay purchases if they can and although annual installations are still ticking higher wall street warns the pace of expansion may slow sharply if those hurdles continue unchecked the shocks to the system in the last two to three months are more or less unprecedented said jenny chase an analyst with bloombergnef we need to get to net zero as soon as possible and to do that we just need so much solar and wind we re not on track we need to ramp all this stuff up dramatically these setbacks may only be temporary with delays in installations expected to be largely resolved by the end of 2022 when new solar factories help ease supply chain issues but any snag in the sector s rollout will have lasting effects with the emissions from the fossil fuels burned instead trapping heat in the atmosphere for decades solar provided just 3 3 of the world s electricity in 2020 bloombergnef estimates that to be on target for net zero by 2050 the world needs to add 455 gigawatts of solar every year through 2030 last year was a record and it only added 144 gigawatts the recent stumbles are hitting right before the united nations cop26 climate talks begin later this month viewed by many as a crucial and last ditch effort to curb global warming it was easy to be optimistic about solar coming into the year joe biden s ascendance to the presidency china s 2060 net zero pledge and europe s green deal meant that for the first time all three dominant economies supported an energy transition at the same time and thanks to decades of painstaking work by researchers and companies solar can now produce energy cheaper than fossil fuels in most of the world even the technology s achilles heel the sun doesn t always shine was on the way to being solved by improvements in batteries demand has mostly held up its end of the bargain but the supply chain hasn t been able to match it largely to blame is polysilicon an ultra conductive material that s refined in factories mostly in china using caustic chemicals and copious amounts of mostly coal derived energy and with demand for panel production so robust there isn t enough of it to go around as early as january boci research ltd analyst tony fei warned that polysilicon factories could only make enough of the material for 170 gigawatts of panels far less than some of the most bullish estimates were calling for his call proved prescient and prices of polysilicon quadrupled from mid 2020 to mid 2021 now a power crunch spurred by a shortage of coal has cut supplies of the metal used to make polysilicon sending prices even higher rising steel aluminum and freight costs are also adding up and solar panel prices are on track for their first annual price rise since 2013 those hurdles are starting to show up in analysts forecasts guggenheim securities llc just removed its buy rating on four solar stocks citing rising risks to 2022 revenue it says aren t yet reflected in consensus estimates earlier this month daiwa capital markets lowered its forecast for 2021 installations by 15 gigawatts more than enough clean energy to power every home in new jersey with that capacity delayed until next year morgan stanley and citigroup have both cautioned about near term panel demand in china the world s biggest solar market while the u s will grow its pace of installations just 3 2 next year after a 58 jump in 2021 says bloombergnef we think that input costs are starting to impact 2022 project timing guggenheim analysts joseph osha and hilary cauley wrote in a research note amid rising costs projects that looked marginal when contracts were signed now look unviable polysilicon is also at the center of a second controversy nearly half the world s supply is made in xinjiang a region in western china facing allegations of forced labor and human rights abuses against the ethnic uyghur muslim population there that hit the solar world in june when the biden administration blocked imports of materials made by hoshine silicon industry co which supplies feedstock material to several polysilicon makers u s customs agents soon began issuing withhold release orders wro to detain china linked solar panels at the border and the issue hasn t been resolved in the months since there s lots of uncertainty in the industry because they do not know how strict the wro enforcement will be or currently is said kelsey goss research analyst at wood mackenzie who specializes in global solar supply chain and technology shortly after the first detainments a second trade fissure opened between china and the u s when a group of unnamed solar companies appealed to the biden administration to extend obama era anti dumping tariffs on chinese solar panels to those made by chinese owned firms in thailand malaysia and vietnam where the u s gets nearly 80 of its panels the u s department of commerce has yet to decide whether it will even investigate the appeal but just the threat of the case has caused some companies to stop sending panels to the u s according to the solar energy industries association trade group this had an immediate chilling effect on the market said george hershman president of swinerton renewable energy manufacturers started to hold orders immediately china s five biggest panel makers which account for around half the world s supply last month asked customers in an open letter to delay purchases to avoid supply chain carnage now some u s solar construction companies have started sending workers home because there are no panels available according to roth capital partners of course it s not all doom and gloom with solar even with the price hikes solar panels are still cheaper now than they were in october 2018 and installations keep inching higher new polysilicon factories and an eventual end to china s power crunch promise to bring prices back down by 2023 at the latest and even amid all the hubbub solar companies continued to improve their technology and manufacturing efficiency this year promising continued cost improvements in the future not to mention that solar s biggest competitor fossil fuels are mired in their own supply issues that have sent coal and natural gas prices to record levels that s scant relief though for installers like india s gautam das trying to add solar capacity today das 47 who left his job as head of treasury products at citibank india to start solar developer oorjan cleantech in 2016 is projecting revenue to grow five fold this year but he s faced a hiccup recently when the price of modules in india jumped by about 20 the company took hits to its profit on some projects and shared the increased cost with customers on others for some developments he said there was no choice but to delay installation and hope prices fall in a few months which is bad news for both the customers and overall emissions as a country and as an entrepreneur i believe more solar is better and faster is better he said but a 20 jump in a month that s a big uncertainty and a big hindrance to solar adoption 2021 bloomberg l p

it is reported that although the shale gas boom in the united states has brought long term and low priced oil to the market because the market is now more concerned about climate change and the decline in the willingness to invest in fossil fuels while the demand for oil has not increased oil production companies are also facing spending pressure which leads to a lack of structural investment in new products as a result oil prices will remain high for a long time and some commodities trading desks on wall street have reached a consensus that the long term price of oil is expected to rise by 10 or more analyst s point of view among the banks that support oil prices to remain high for a longer period of time goldman sachs expects crude oil prices to reach 85 a barrel in 2023 while bnp paribas expects crude oil prices to be close to 80 a barrel in 2023 in addition other banks including royal bank of canada are talking about a structural bull market in the oil market these forecasts mean that oil will become more expensive expectations of high oil prices support hundreds of billions of dollars in stock valuations of big international oil companies such as rds a us and bp us at the same time investors desire to lend is waning last week alone france s largest banks said they would restrict financing for the shale oil and gas industry from early next year in addition as financial institutions are reducing their investment in crude oil ecuador has had to double the number of banks that can provide credit guarantees to it of course not everyone supports the view that oil prices will remain high all the time crude oil supply gap in fact the concept of a supply gap is not new since the collapse in oil prices in 2014 analysts have been discussing the possibility that underinvestment could lead to demand exceeding supply however the collapse in energy prices caused by the novel coronavirus epidemic coupled with the focus on climate issues makes the situation look different this time although the number of global oil drilling may have recovered from last year s low it is still down more than 30 from pre epidemic levels the trend of oil supply and demand seems to be changing especially given the changes in the united states in recent years which has in fact become a wavering producer on the one hand listed us shale companies remain constrained in terms of growth for example when eog energy eog us said in february that it planned to increase production its shares fell sharply since then few crude oil producers have made similar comments in addition the impact of oil field production decline is becoming more and more obvious in november the permian basin permian basin was the only oil field in the united states with a significant year on year increase in production production in other fields is either flat or falling according to the u s energy information administration similarly while some opec major oil producing countries have excess stocks that can be used next year other oil producing countries including nigeria and angola have shown signs of slowing production summary at a time when investment in fossil fuels is dwindling even if demand does not peak any time soon there is still a shortfall in crude oil supply the international energy agency said earlier this month that if current demand continues to grow investment in fossil fuels will not be sufficient to meet demand the agency expects that under current policy oil demand will not begin to decline until 2030

increase was primarily driven by higher montana transmission loads and rates and warmer summer weather partly offset by higher operating costs lower supply cost recovery an unfavorable qf liability adjustment compared with the prior period and higher income tax expense we are pleased to report strong financial results this quarter however inflationary and supply chain pressures have left their mark we made the decision to accelerate construction of the 175 megawatt facility near laurel montana at the same time we decided not to move forward with construction of a 30 40 megawatt facility near aberdeen south dakota as originally proposed alternative options for the aberdeen project will be evaluated in the 2022 integrated resource plan the 60 megawatt project near huron south dakota continues with minimal interruption and should be online by early 2022 said bob rowe chief executive officer as we have consistently warned we continue to be concerned about our customers exposure to high energy prices and scarcity due to high prices the cost of market power purchases for our montana customers in july alone was nearly six times what we spent in the same month last year rowe continues we are glad to have the laurel project advancing expected online in the winter of 2023 2024 this new resource will alleviate a significant amount of the price and availability risk that our

administrator evaluated the bids with the following portfolio of projects selected laurel generating station the construction of a 175 mw natural gas fired generation plant near laurel montana at a cost of approximately 275 million including allowance for funds used during construction afudc which we will own beartooth battery a 20 year agreement to purchase capacity and ancillary services produced from a 50 mw battery energy storage facility that will be constructed in yellowstone county montana and powerex transaction a 5 year power purchase agreement for 100 mws of capacity and energy products originating predominately from hydroelectric resources on may 19 2021 we filed an application with the montana public service commission mpsc for advanced approval to acquire the laurel generating station and beartooth battery agreement as new capacity resources these resources together with the powerex transaction will help address our identified capacity shortage the powerex transaction was not included in the application for advanced approval filed with the mpsc recent upheaval in the construction market and specifically timely availability of critical components and escalating labor and construction costs has necessitated the flexibility to expend capital and make commercial decisions in advance of the timeline established by the mpsc advanced approval docket accordingly we withdrew our application on september 23 2021 and intend to seek approval from the mpsc to place the laurel generating station in rate base through a future filing we currently intend to file a separate application for advanced approval of the beartooth battery agreement on october 21 2021 the montana environmental information center and the sierra club filed a lawsuit in montana state court against the montana department of environmental quality mtdeq and us alleging the environmental review of our laurel generating station project was unlawful this lawsuit could delay the laurel project if the court were to require a full environmental impact study regarding the project set aside the air quality permit granted for the laurel generating station or determine that the underlying environmental statute violates the montana constitutional guarantee of a clean and healthful environment electric resource supply south dakota our energy resource plans identify portfolio requirements including potential investments resulting from a completed competitive solicitation process in south dakota our estimated capital expenditures discussed in our annual report on form 10 k

natural gas plant near aberdeen south dakota which was expected to be in service in early 2024 during the third quarter of 2021 we decided to discontinue our plans to build this project as a result of significant increases in estimated construction cost as a result of global supply chain challenges as a result of the project discontinuance we recorded a 1 2 million pre tax charge in the three months ended september 30 2021 for the write off of preliminary construction costs construction continues for a 60mw reciprocating internal combustion engine project in huron sd to be online in early 2022 with total construction costs of approximately 80 million with the acceleration of the laurel generation project and the discontinuation of the aberdeen generation project we anticipate providing an updated 5 year capital forecast at the edison electric institute financial conference early next month regulatory update we have recently filed several regulatory filings primarily in our montana jurisdiction including an april 15 2021 filing of a motion requesting to delay the implementation of our fixed cost recovery mechanism pilot in our montana jurisdiction for another year until july 2022 or beyond due to the continued uncertainties created by the covid 19 pandemic on june 29 2021 the mpsc granted our motion opponents to the delay requested reconsideration and the commission denied their request on september 15 2021 and an april 21 2021 filing requesting approval to increase the power cost and credit adjustment mechanism pccam base forecasted costs used to develop rates for the recovery of electric power costs through our pccam by approximately 17 million or potentially a greater increase to reflect current market prices and new capacity contracts on june 29 2021 the mpsc approved implementing our request for interim rates reflecting the 17 million increase subject to refund the montana consumer counsel mcc filed a motion arguing that the pccam base cannot be updated except in a general rate case and asked the mpsc to dismiss the application on october 5 2021 the mpsc voted to grant the mcc s motion to dismiss and we await the final written order we are subject to ferc s jurisdiction and regulations with respect to rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale rates the issuance of certain securities and incurrence of certain long term debt among other things the division of audits and accounting in the office of enforcement of ferc has initiated a routine audit of northwestern corporation for the period of january 1 2018 to the present to evaluate our compliance with ferc accounting and financial reporting requirements we have responded to several sets of data requests as part of the audit process an audit report has not yet been received from ferc but is expected within the next six months management is unable to predict the outcome or timing of the final resolution of the audit february cold weather event the february 2021 prolonged cold spell resulted in record winter peak demand for electricity and natural gas the broad reach of this event across the united states and other market factors resulted in an extreme price excursion for purchased power and natural gas in our south dakota and nebraska service territories natural gas costs for the month of february 2021 exceeded the total cost for all of 2020 fuel and purchased power costs in these jurisdictions are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses we ve incorporated the liquidity impacts into our overall 2021 financing plans the nebraska public service commission npsc opened a docket on march 2 2021 to investigate the effect of this cold weather event on natural gas supply in this docket we proposed recovery of our costs for february 13 2021 to february 18 2021 over a two year period which was subsequently approved by the npsc on may 11 2021 and a regulatory asset of approximately 26 0 million was recorded for these costs with a remaining balance of 25 2 million as of september 30 2021 the south dakota public utilities commission issued an order allowing recovery of natural gas costs for the same time period over a one year period effective march 2 2021 a regulatory asset of approximately 22 0 million was recorded for these costs with a remaining balance of 17 7 million as of september 30 2021 covid 19 pandemic and global economic recovery the covid 19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on people economies businesses and financial markets beginning in march 2020 the pandemic and resulting economic conditions began impacting our business operations and financial results our 2020 financial results were impacted by lower sales volumes an increase in reserves for uncollectible accounts and an increase in interest expense partly offset by lower operating general and administrative expenses we have experienced improving conditions in our service territories during 2021 that have positively impacted our business as compared to 2020 the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our financial results for 2021 and beyond depends on the evolving landscape of the pandemic and the public health responses to contain it as well as the substance and pace of the macroeconomic recovery if health conditions deteriorate or the economic recovery stalls it could have the result of lower demand for electricity and natural gas as well as reduced ability of various customers contractors suppliers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations or provide the services we seek to support our business operations these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and prospects the biden administration is also seeking to require large companies like us to have all of our employees vaccinated or undergo weekly covid testing complying with either a vaccine mandate or weekly testing requirements if there are even enough testing kits available could be difficult and costly and it is possible that some employees may choose to leave employment over a vaccine or testing requirement we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these economic conditions and issues continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations financing activity we anticipate financing our ongoing maintenance and capital programs with a combination of cash flows from operations first mortgage bonds and equity issuances in march 2021 we issued and sold 100 0 million aggregate principal amount of montana first mortgage bonds at a fixed interest rate of 1 00 maturing on march 26 2024 the net proceeds were used to repay in full our outstanding 100 0 million one year

accordance with gaap as well as other financial measures such as gross margin adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that exclude or include amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define gross margin as revenues less cost of sales as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of income management believes that gross margin revenues less cost of sales provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms as detailed below our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition gross margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow for recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our gross margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income net income and diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other

billionaire carl icahn is calling on southwest gas holdings inc to first offer shares to existing shareholders including himself if it pushes ahead with selling up to us 1 billion in equity and equity linked securities to help finance its takeover of pipeline company questar the activist investor also said in a new letter to the company s board that he intends to file with regulators wednesday to push ahead with his own plans to acquire the shares in southwest that he doesn t already own for us 75 apiece through a tender offer the purchases would be made through his icahn enterprises if southwest pursues its ill advised questar acquisition icahn argues allowing shareholders to participate in the equity raise through a rights offering is the best way to ensure their holdings aren t massively diluted we are still hopeful that we can resolve this matter amicably and in a manner that creates value for all shareholders he said in the letter a draft of which was reviewed by bloomberg news shares in southwest gas were essentially flat on monday in new york las vegas based southwest said it will assess its financing for questar in a manner that is in the best interest of all shareholders we continue to welcome the views of all of shareholders it said in an emailed statement better than war icahn said he told southwest chief executive officer john hester in their first meeting that he believes peace is always better than war after that conversation however southwest implemented a so called poison pill that acts as a deterrent to a takeover and limits the amount of shares an active investor like himself can own to 10 per cent he said he was also concerned that hester is close to issuing us 1 billion of cheap stock to friendly hands a citigroup inc research note cited by icahn in his letter states that after a meeting wednesday with southwest its management seemed open to a block investment from a larger investor either through a direct investment in the company or its construction business centuri group inc icahn said he would be open to doing either or providing all the equity financing himself at us 75 a share he also offered to backstop the equity raise and said he would be willing to consider financing it at a higher price if southwest receives a higher offer from another shareholder or third party he added that if his new shares when added to his existing position resulted in him holding more than 20 per cent of the company he would wave his voting rights for any shares above that threshold we believe that swx consummating any financing transaction on terms that are inferior to those laid out above without first attempting in good faith to negotiate with us would be unconscionable insulting to shareholders and would result in years of costly litigation and proxy fights icahn said manicures bartenders icahn disclosed a 4 9 per cent stake in southwest this month he has been critical of its leadership since then particularly the company s decision to acquire dominion energy inc s questar for us 1 97 billion and the equity it intends to issue to help finance the deal icahn has launched a proxy contest to replace the entire board and called for the sale of its construction unit he has also accused southwest executives and directors of charging for inappropriate personal expenses such as a million dollar home golf course memberships manicures and the cost of bartenders leading to a poor relationship with nevada regulators southwest has said previously that it remains committed to engaging with its shareholders on ways to maximize value and would review both icahn s tender offer and his slate of directors once they were submitted citigroup noted that two of the company s directors are about to age out of being able to serve on the board beyond the two mandated changes southwest may consider optimizing the slate to oversee the management of the evolving company it said

when it comes to dollar stores there s a lot to unpack like their tendency to pop up in food deserts and their impact on a local economy but that s not what we re talking about today because regardless of how you view these discount chains 80 of americans shop at dollar stores at least occasionally according to a june 2021 survey from consumer reports and as long as that s the case it makes sense to have a better understanding of which household items are legitimately good value at dollar stores and which ones aren t worth it recently a group of experts from consumer reports provided some tips for being a smart dollar store shopper here are some to help you get the best deals on necessities for your home courtesy of john galeotafiore associate director of product testing at consumer reports don t pass the automotive aisle though you may not think of dollar stores as the place to pick up stuff for your car it can come in handy for getting general products like windshield wiper fluid wipes for cleaning up spills and cords for plugging in electronics and while many stock motor oil galeotafiore says to check the bottle and make sure that it carries the american petroleum institute s certification mark even if it s a brand you don t recognise that mark means it meets the latest industry standards he explains the hardware section has the basics but not much else the hardware aisle of the dollar store may look extensive but galeotafiore recommends going in with realistic expectations sure you can expect to find things like measuring tapes claw hammers and screwdrivers but if you re looking for anything more specialised or for more complicated tasks he suggests going directly to the hardware store paper products in a pinch not everyone is able to go to wholesale stores to buy their toilet paper and tissues in bulk in situations like that paper products and other household items are likely going to be cheaper at dollar stores than they would be at other local establishments like convenience stores or gas stations people already seem to know that though given that a majority of people who shop at dollar stores usually buy household goods there according to the survey from consumer reports pay attention to light bulbs yes you re going to find light bulbs at dollar stores and yes they re going to be cheap but according to galeotafiore they are more likely to be incandescent bulbs than led ones and although the led bulbs themselves are usually more expensive they use less energy and last much longer so they end up being better value in the long run to save time and money galeotafiore says note the details of the bulb you re replacing so you don t end up with something that isn t quite right

graphic business wire nanobiotix euronext nano nasdaq nbtx the company a late stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer today announced first ever survival data from its priority head and neck cancer development program at the 2021 annual meeting of the american society for radiation oncology astro as specified by the astro annual meeting embargo policy information beyond what is included in the abstract such as updated or additional results is embargoed until the date and time of scientific presentation or presentation at an astro news briefing whichever occurs first however nanobiotix has become aware that astro made a late decision to release the posters at the same time as the abstracts and did not sufficiently update the embargo policy as a result the company is releasing this data in advance of its intended embargo date new data from locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma la hnscc program data show a median overall survival mos of 18 1 months and a median progression free survival of mpfs of 10 6 months in the evaluable population n 41 from the dose expansion part of its phase i multicenter open label non randomized dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating nbtxr3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy in tough to treat elderly and frail la hnscc patients ineligible for cisplatin and intolerant to cetuximab study 102 expansion in the full population all evaluable and non evaluable patients treated n 54 data showed a 14 1 month mos and a 9 4 month mpfs the data suggest that lower mos and mpfs observed in the full population versus the evaluable population in the study could be related to early death associated with high burden of comorbidity in the non evaluable population evaluability in study 102 expansion was determined based on the patient receiving at least 80 of the intended intratumoral dose of nbtxr3 at least 60 gy of radiotherapy and the required imaging to assess the target lesion at baseline and at least once post treatment response rates remained consistent with previously reported results from the dose escalation and dose expansion study showing a best observed target lesion objective response rate orr of 85 4 and a best observed target lesion complete response rate crr of 63 4 2 i have held the belief that nbtxr3 could have a real impact for patients with solid tumors since reviewing the proof of concept data from the phase ii iii in soft tissue sarcoma and throughout my participation in study 102 expansion said study principal investigator professor christophe le tourneau senior medical oncologist and head of the department of drug development and innovation d3i at institut curie this first look at survival data has added to my confidence that nbtxr3 could provide a promising new therapeutic option for the practice i look forward to leading the upcoming phase iii global registration study and to have the opportunity to evaluate the promise of this innovation in a larger patient population of the 21 evaluable patients with a best observed overall response of complete response cr with a mean follow up of 16 1 months 6 patients died for non oncologic reasons and only one died from disease progression nbtxr3 administration was feasible and well tolerated overall a total of 8 grade 3 4 nbtxr3 related adverse events aes were observed in 8 patients representing 1 3 of all observed aes of these aes related to nbtxr3 5 serious adverse events saes were observed including dysphagia sepsis soft tissue necrosis stomatitis and tumor hemorrhage of the saes one death from sepsis assessed by the investigator as possibly related to nbtxr3 radiotherapy and cancer was observed while the incidence of la hnscc has continued to rise patients in the elderly and frail la hnscc population have significant unmet needs many are not eligible to receive concurrent chemoradiation due to frailty associated with comorbidities the modified charlson comorbidity index mcci is a measure of comorbidity burden on a patient by patient basis and high mcci i e mcci 4 is correlated with higher risk of death relative to the broader population in this study 63 of all patients treated had high mcci which is two to three times the prevalence of comorbidity in the overall la hnscc population3 despite the prevalence of high mcci in study 102 expansion these preliminary data support further evaluation of nbtxr3 activated by radiotherapy as a therapeutic option that may translate to a survival benefit for elderly and frail la hnscc patients the data also suggest that the potential benefits of the therapy could improve in a population with a lower burden of comorbidity bringing innovation to the patients that need it most has always been the backbone of our development strategy for nbtxr3 said laurent levy co founder and chief executive officer of nanobiotix we started with soft tissue sarcoma a disease indication notoriously resistant to radiotherapy after proving we could provide a therapeutic benefit versus radiotherapy alone for patients with locally advanced disease and achieving european market approval we pivoted to patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer that have substantially limited treatment options the new survival data we are seeing from study 102 expansion bolster our confidence in the promise of nbtxr3 as we near the launch of our pivotal phase iii study in head and neck cancer we have designed this study with the benefit of our learnings from the phase i and look forward to the opportunity to prove that our product candidate can expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer around the world about nbtxr3 nbtxr3 is a novel potentially first in class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy the product candidate s physical mechanism of action moa is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long term anti cancer memory given the physical moa nanobiotix believes that nbtxr3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors nbtxr3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc as the primary development pathway the company sponsored phase i dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy and the launch of a phase iii global registrational study is planned in february 2020 the united states food and drug administration granted regulatory fast track designation for the investigation of nbtxr3 activated by radiation therapy with or without cetuximab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced hnscc who are not eligible for platinum based chemotherapy the same population being evaluated in the planned phase iii study nanobiotix has also prioritized an immuno oncology development program beginning with a company sponsored phase i clinical study evaluating nbtxr3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti pd 1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent metastatic hnscc and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti pd 1 therapy given the company s focus areas and balanced against the scalable potential of nbtxr3 nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways pursuant to this strategy in 2019 nanobiotix entered into a broad comprehensive clinical research collaboration with the university of texas md anderson cancer center to sponsor several phase i and phase ii studies to evaluate nbtxr3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations about nanobiotix nanobiotix is a late stage clinical

australia is set for a second consecutive bumper winter harvest with total production forecast to come in just five per cent shy of last year s near record crop according to rabobank in its just released australian winter crop 2021 22 production price and inputs forecast the specialist agribusiness bank estimates the nation will harvest 52 87 million tonnes of winter grains oilseeds and pulses this season while down five per cent on last year s crop this is still a hefty 25 per cent above the five year average canola is the stand out mover with production estimated to reach a new record of 5 16 million tonnes up 14 per cent on last year and a stellar 48 per cent above the five year average driven by increased planting and favourable growing conditions in many regions australia s wheat production is expected to come in at 31 9 million tonnes down four per cent on last year but still 35 per cent above the five year average barley production is forecast to be down 10 per cent on last year to 11 7 million tonnes though also still up on the five year average by seven per cent report co author rabobank agriculture analyst dennis voznesenski said australia s second consecutive very large winter crop comes at an opportune time for local growers with global shortages and high prices for grains and oilseeds short global supplies of grains and oilseeds will continue to support australian prices over the year ahead he said although global prices can be expected to soften as new crops in different regions around the world come into play the uncertainty that exists around seasonal conditions in grain growing areas and the process of global grain stocks re building will keep prices at least above the range of the last six to seven years the report notes favourable growing conditions in australia have seen expectations of increased amounts of high protein wheat in queensland south australia and western australia this harvest timed perfectly with a current global shortage of high protein wheat due to drought in north america other factors of note for this year s winter crop include a lower supply of malt quality barley due to a reduction in barley planting and particularly malt varieties and less grain baled for hay because of export concerns due to a largely closed chinese hay market there is also a proportion of last year s record east coast harvest 10 to 15 per cent that remains on farm mr voznesenski said this will compete with the coming crop for storage space and mean more delivery and price pressure during harvest

income for the period was 35 2 million or 0 68 per diluted share as compared with net income of 29 5 million or 0 58 per diluted share for the same period in 2020 this increase was primarily driven by higher montana transmission loads and rates and warmer summer weather partly offset by higher operating costs lower supply cost recovery an unfavorable qf liability adjustment compared with the prior period and higher income tax expense we are pleased to report strong financial results this quarter however inflationary and supply chain pressures have left their mark we made the decision to accelerate construction of the 175 megawatt facility near laurel montana at the same time we decided not to move forward with construction of a 30 40 megawatt facility near aberdeen south dakota as originally proposed alternative options for the aberdeen project will be evaluated in the 2022 integrated resource plan the 60 megawatt project near huron south dakota continues with minimal interruption and should be online by early 2022 said bob rowe chief executive officer as we have consistently warned we continue to be concerned about our customers exposure to high energy prices and

resources on may 19 2021 we filed an application with the montana public service commission mpsc for advanced approval to acquire the laurel generating station and beartooth battery agreement as new capacity resources these resources together with the powerex transaction will help address our identified capacity shortage the powerex transaction was not included in the application for advanced approval filed with the mpsc recent upheaval in the construction market and specifically timely availability of critical components and escalating labor and construction costs has necessitated the flexibility to expend capital and make commercial decisions in advance of the timeline established by the mpsc advanced approval docket accordingly we withdrew our application on september 23 2021 and intend to seek approval from the mpsc to place the laurel generating station in rate base through a future filing we currently intend to file a separate application for advanced approval of the beartooth battery agreement on october 21 2021 the montana environmental information center and the sierra club filed a lawsuit in montana state court against the montana department of environmental quality mtdeq and us alleging the environmental review of our laurel generating station project was unlawful this lawsuit could delay the laurel project if the court were to require a full environmental impact study regarding the project set aside the air quality permit granted for the laurel generating station or determine that the underlying environmental statute violates the montana

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section includes approximately 60 million for a 30 40 mw flexible natural gas plant near aberdeen south dakota which was expected to be in service in early 2024 during the third quarter of 2021 we decided to discontinue our plans to build this project as a result of significant increases in estimated construction cost as a result of global supply chain challenges as a result of the project discontinuance we recorded a 1 2 million pre tax charge in the three months ended september 30 2021 for the write off of preliminary construction costs construction continues for a 60mw reciprocating internal combustion engine project in huron sd to be online in early 2022 with total construction costs of approximately 80 million with the acceleration of the laurel generation project and the discontinuation of the aberdeen generation project we anticipate providing an updated 5 year capital forecast at the edison electric institute financial conference early next month regulatory update we have recently filed several regulatory filings primarily in our montana jurisdiction including an april 15 2021 filing of a motion requesting to delay the implementation of our fixed cost recovery mechanism pilot in our montana jurisdiction for another year until july 2022 or beyond due to the continued uncertainties created by the covid 19 pandemic on june 29 2021 the mpsc granted our motion opponents to the delay requested reconsideration and the commission denied their request on september 15 2021 and an april 21 2021 filing requesting approval to increase the power cost and credit adjustment mechanism pccam base forecasted costs used to develop rates for the recovery of electric power costs through our pccam by approximately 17 million or potentially a greater increase to reflect current market prices and new capacity contracts on june 29 2021 the mpsc approved implementing our request for interim rates reflecting the 17 million increase subject to refund the montana consumer counsel mcc filed a motion arguing that the pccam base cannot be updated except in a general rate case and asked the mpsc to dismiss the application on october 5 2021 the mpsc voted to grant the mcc s motion to dismiss and we await the final written order we are subject to ferc s jurisdiction and regulations with respect to rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale rates the issuance of certain securities and incurrence of certain long term debt among other things the division of audits and accounting in the office of enforcement of ferc has initiated a routine audit of northwestern corporation for the period of january 1 2018 to the present to evaluate our compliance with ferc accounting and financial reporting requirements we have responded to several sets of data requests as part of the audit process an audit report has not yet been received from ferc but is expected within the next six months management is unable to predict the outcome or timing of the final resolution of the audit february cold weather event the february 2021 prolonged cold spell resulted in record winter peak demand for electricity and natural gas the broad reach of this event across the united states and other market factors resulted in an extreme price excursion for purchased power and natural gas in our south dakota and nebraska service territories natural gas costs for the month of february 2021 exceeded the total cost for all of 2020 fuel and purchased power costs in these jurisdictions are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses we ve incorporated the liquidity impacts into our overall 2021 financing plans the nebraska public service commission npsc opened a docket on march 2 2021 to investigate the effect of this cold weather event on natural gas supply in this docket we proposed recovery of our costs for february 13 2021 to february 18 2021 over a two year period which was subsequently approved by the npsc on may 11 2021 and a regulatory asset of approximately 26 0 million was recorded for these costs with a remaining balance of 25 2 million as of september 30 2021 the south dakota public utilities commission issued an order allowing recovery of natural gas costs for the same time period over a one year period effective march 2 2021 a regulatory asset of approximately 22 0 million was recorded for these costs with a remaining balance of 17 7 million as of september 30 2021 covid 19 pandemic and global economic recovery the covid 19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on people economies businesses and financial markets beginning in march 2020 the pandemic and resulting economic conditions began impacting our business operations and financial results our 2020 financial results were impacted by lower sales volumes an increase in reserves for uncollectible accounts and an increase in interest expense partly offset by lower operating general and administrative expenses we have experienced improving conditions in our service territories during 2021 that have positively impacted our business as compared to 2020 the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our financial results for 2021 and beyond depends on the evolving landscape of the pandemic and the public health responses to contain it as well as the substance and pace of the macroeconomic recovery if health conditions deteriorate or the economic recovery stalls it could have the result of lower demand for electricity and natural gas as well as reduced ability of various customers contractors suppliers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations or provide the services we seek to support our business operations these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and prospects the biden administration is also seeking to require large companies like us to have all of our employees vaccinated or undergo weekly covid testing complying with either a vaccine mandate or weekly testing requirements if there are even enough testing kits available could be difficult and costly and it is possible that some employees may choose to leave employment over a vaccine or testing requirement we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these economic conditions and issues continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations financing activity we anticipate financing our ongoing maintenance and capital programs with

2002 more information is available on the company s web site at www northwesternenergy com non gaap financial measures this press release includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as other financial measures such as gross margin adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that exclude or include amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define gross margin as revenues less cost of sales as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of income management believes that gross margin revenues less cost of sales provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms as detailed below our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition gross margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow for recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our gross margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income net income and diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other companies

motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more ask a fund manager the motley fool chats with fund managers so that you can get an insight into how the professionals think in this edition joel fleming portfolio manager at yarra capital management s australian equities team and the ubs yarra microcap fund explains the risks and rewards of investing in asx microcap shares mf how would you describe your fund to a potential client jf microcap investing is all about trying to drive long term capital growth that s what we re trying to achieve for our investors we offer a diversified portfolio meaning we invest in stocks from all areas of industry and at various stages of their development it is a higher risk area of the market there s less analyst coverage and fewer professional investors focused on this area but for us it really is about taking a long term view we try to find companies today that are undiscovered that have great management teams and that have a great business plan and it s about being able to execute that plan over the next 3 to 5 years enabling that company to turn into a really meaningful business within their industry and creating great returns along the way asx microcap definitions can vary quite a bit what sort of market cap are you targeting stocks need to be below a 250 million market cap when they go into our portfolio importantly though we re not forced sellers just because a company goes into an index or reaches a particular size we re looking for those truly great businesses that continue to reinvest in themselves continue to create opportunities and grow into their market being able to go on that journey with them allows you to get the most out of these individual decisions when you ve done so much work to understand the business that s a differentiating factor in our part of the market you can really get behind some of these businesses that have a long life cycle in terms of their development is there a minimum market cap that you won t go below approximately 30 million is our lower end i draw the line there because it s important that i can offer an investor today something that i should be able to offer them when the fund is a lot bigger we are doing a lot of work around that threshold though where it s not quite the time to pull the trigger for portfolio inclusion but where we are familiarising ourselves with the individual opportunity atop the points you mentioned earlier are there other specifics you look for in asx shares that could trigger a buy signal we think it s critical to do a lot of detailed due diligence ourselves to really understand an opportunity often in smaller companies everyone is very passionate about their business and many of them can tell you a fantastic story about why it s a great investment our job though is to try and verify the investment thesis to say this looks to be a wonderful idea but is this the team to really make the most of this opportunity what are going to be the key issues they might face inflection points in a company s development and its critical milestones are key for us it can be something like the acceptance by a customer someone giving them that first important contract that s often the catalyst what type of risk management do you employ and what factors can see you exit a position the first point on risk management is that no single position is more than 5 of the portfolio that means we re managing position sizes and trimming when a business is performing really well in terms of selling in microcaps sometimes it just doesn t work with that inflection point you were looking for there are occasions when something may have changed in terms of the competitive or regulatory environment resulting in our reason for investing being invalidated at that point we will cut and run because our thesis has changed the other thing is if a business is taken over there s a lot of m a today so that can be a reason a business will exit the portfolio and sometimes a stock has hit its valuation it s important here when we ve captured a lot of value for our unitholders that we ask whether we are thinking too optimistically about the blue sky and where they might go from here so that valuation is also important in terms of when to trim or actually exit the position which sectors look promising to you over the next 12 months we like to take a longer term view but in the short term new south wales and victoria are opening up people want to get outside have experiences and do the things they haven t been able to do the spend that comes from that in terms of tourism activities eating out and all of those types of things is one area that will be quite positive savings rates are very high and a lot of fire power exists now these things have been discussed a lot but the way i look at it is a lot of businesses have been acquiring the sales and marketing for whatever they re trying to achieve so that ability to fly around again that ability for sales people to get in front of clients and have a real conversation and build up that momentum is an area where i most look forward to seeing the results particularly if you re trying to grow your business in the united states or europe it s been hard to do hard to grow those relationships the opening up of international travel and executives get out on the ground and really restart things which asx shares do you think will outperform in this scenario i like a business based in new zealand called eroad ltd asx erd it s a telematics provider when you look at the amount of data available related to driver safety compliance the ability to pay taxes within a complicated tax environment they ve got a very good product they re very strong in their core new zealand market but australia and the us are emerging markets for them and on the sales cadence and being able to get out there again i think it s a stock that looks really interesting from here then there s alliance aviation services ltd asx aqz a really well run business with 2 drivers first you ve got the mining industry a lot of these people don t work next door to where they live alliance is in a strong position in that market then there s the opportunity as people travel differently and the larger airlines are more focused on their traditional routes to have a big part to play in some of those regional operations and they re really set up to do well there are there any sectors you think will underperform over the coming 12 months if you re looking at streaming services people are likely to lose 1 or 2 of those as they can go and be out and about again there s been lots of areas like in parts of retail where a lot of consumers have spent their money and are more likely to spend in other parts of the market there are other sectors where we can find it difficult to validate the investment propostion early stage biotechs are ones we typically find where it s very challenging to add value that s also often the case with very early stage explorers in oil and gas or minerals we like to buy businesses where we think there s an opportunity for them to create real value and when we look at the risks where we can understand that in the context of the broader portfolio if the market closed tomorrow for 5 years which stock would you want to hold this is a really good question to think about i would say pacific smiles group ltd asx psq it s very hard to disrupt going to the dentist this is a growth business that has an excellent footprint and offers a service that is very difficult to substitute it has a reasonable number of graduates coming out of university and offers them a good framework so they don t have to go out and do all the hard things involved with setting up a business i m confident that pacific smiles will be significantly bigger than it is today as they roll out their footprint their model today is working really well what do you see as the biggest threat for asx investors over the next year inflation is obviously interesting and the great debate over whether it s transitory or perhaps more permanent interest rates have provided the market with a very strong tailwind at some point the outlook must level if not look to move up even though we all know it s coming at some point we re uncertain how the market will react to that when it becomes more real and what do you see as the biggest opportunity in the year ahead the best thing about microcaps is that there s always an opportunity we ve got a huge investable universe we ve got companies that are small and nimble and are looking for opportunities they re not sitting there trying to protect a legacy business instead they re saying how can i solve a problem how can i give that customer a better proposition tomorrow than what they re getting today that s what exciting with microcaps it doesn t matter what s happening on the broader macro there s always a little microcap business out there that s doing something interesting and they re not on the front page every day they don t have 26 institutional investors on their register so they re often not very well understood m a is also a key theme microcaps are a great hunting ground for m a there are lots of larger companies that are feeling quite confident and have strong balance sheets i think this will continue to be an area where we ll see a lot of activity because often it s cheaper to buy than build and we ve certainly seen a good run of it through this year direct investors can access the yarra microcaps strategy through the ubs yarra microcap fund for which yarra capital management is the delegated

endurance real estate group s recent acquisition a 91 million purchase of the 1 5 million square foot york business center was the company s largest to date in terms of square feet and dollars that s saying something for a company that fell into buying industrial buildings 20 years ago when the asset class was far from the darling of real estate investors that it is today over those two decades radnor based endurance has bought or developed a total of 18 million square feet of industrial space and sold 11 million square feet though the figure fluctuates as it periodically buys and sells the company currently owns a portfolio of 7 million square feet its focus is mainly buying value add opportunities but it has delved into other areas as more money has been focused on industrial properties ben cohen and bill white co founded endurance after working together as capital advisors at fortis inc which is now assurant group our first three deals were industrial and we became known to the brokerage community as industrial guys cohen said it was a little less institutionalized and for a long time you could still get an industrial deal completely off market and it went to three or five groups for the first 15 years the endurance s holdings were split with industrial accounting for about 75 and office 25 the company is now completely focused on industrial when we got into that world we were fortunate cohen said i d like to say we were geniuses but we were lucky too white retired a few years ago and cohen who continues to relish chasing deals serves as ceo and managing principal in a recent conversation with the philadelphia business journal he shared some thoughts on where the market stands these days and where it s headed how would you describe the industrial market it certainly seems crazy there s so much tenant demand and so much development occurring and so much capital chasing it it s never been this hot how do you compete in a market that s so competitive historically we remain focused on value add buildings but it s so competitive there have been so many new entrants in the last five years who are well capitalized and can do deals that we are spending more time on land and ground up development we re sourcing land which you can still do a little more quietly it s difficult to buy 100 acres from a farmer in central pennsylvania tie it up and bring it through the entitlement process we are pursuing land mostly zoned industrial but we re dealing with penndot dep county conservation districts it can take one year to 30 months to get that process done then what do you do with the land when we re three to six months from completing the entitlements we bring in a capital partner who is ready to do the spec development the market has moved so much that as we brought the land through the entitlements the land value has increased quite a bit we bring in partners who recognize that land value and that is where we are having success where are you doing that northeast pennsylvania central pennsylvania berks county south jersey we did it in souderton where we bought 15 acres at 209 school house road and built 76 000 square feet in olyphant we are building a 1 million square foot spec building no matter the size most all of it is spec we have a lot in the pipeline expand endurance real estate group paid 90 96 million for the york business center endurance real estate group while availability of land is an issue so is labor how are you dealing with that labor is front of mind for us and our tenants whether our tenants are going to be able to get employees is important when we are scoping out a project it s definitely a risk and as a developer you don t want to be too pioneering in a location that s another reason we love york it s a small urban area with a historically blue collar workforce you also don t want to be the sixth million square foot project in a market that has five others under development communities are starting to put the brakes on industrial development how are you dealing with that there is some nimbyism starting to occur it s more in new jersey than in pennsylvania where you have a heavy concentration of these warehouses there s pushback and it s mostly about the truck traffic hopefully we re pursuing land that is already by right or in towns that are losing rateables from retail and office and they are in the business of attracting jobs is there no end in sight to the industrial boom someone in my shoes is always asking are we in a bubble the real answer is who knows in the short term everything is driven by tenant demand and nothing has let up e commerce is the biggest driver to that at this moment there is also pent up demand there is 4 trillion that has been saved up by consumers re shoring is part of it as companies who are concerned about supply chain have decided to bring some of that out of china there is also increased inventories companies are holding more stock for that very same reason one other thing is there is a lot of industrial stock getting old a building from the 1970s doesn t work for e commerce what could derail the momentum a macroeconomic or black swan event there s nothing specific that comes to mind i m spitballing here but i think about 3 d printing some other technology that could come along or automation a warehouse that creates more cubic square feet that is operated by robots the classic is developers get greedy and build too much but lenders are little more disciplined

throbbed in twentieth century fiction since mary shelley conceived it and jules verne and h g wells were its midwives his tales speak of monsters j g ballard has shown that all science fiction must the geography of the mental landscape of modern man who externalizes his guilts and aspirations into an everyday environment i would like in this article to consider the implications of that geography as charted by the cinema what can science fiction and the movies tell us about the probable settings for our future lives cohen s film is set in new york or to be accurate just above it on the upper levels of the city the sky is a little closer its chemistry contains of course some vital truths about the price of our survival on this planet and the skyscraper society is as close as anyone can be exposure to them not so long ago say sixty years when travel by air was still suspected as a daring defiance of natural laws aptly punished by hindenburg disasters and the like there were stories in the nauts there were heights to which it was feared man was feared man was not meant to aspire and the scaling of them would bring the followers of icarus tumbling back to earth incredibly diseased and melting cased for professor quatermass and his reactionary colleagues cohen sounds the warning afresh but with a keen ironic understanding of what keeps us watching the skies the winged menace he visits upon us is a god real estate religion its purpose to celebrate humanity by the sheer height of its temples has at last managed cohen suggests to penetrate the domain of its divine spectator who duly summoned proceeds to exact tribute as a result the new yorkers of q the winged serpent find blood raining down on them as sacrificial victims are snapped by the beak and talons of the swooping deity that its home should be the chrysler building close in design it seems to the aztec motifs that might prompt a reawakened quetzalcoatl to build its nest that it should contrive to be invisible for much for its early activity it flies out of the sun explains one character helpfully and that eventually gets shot down king kong style in a hail of bullets these matters of mundane narrative while related by cohen with his customary zest are not really the meal of his metaphor his camera floats lovingly across the pinnacles of manhattan in appreciation of the city s grandeur recognizing at the same time even utopia must have its limits that the boundaries have been reached and the blood will now fall retribution always rains from on high in cohen s films as in god told me to 1977 with its army of snipers whose terrifyingly arbitrary fusillades on the city streets are inspired by divine or at least extraterrestrial directive utopia must always be bought at a price the smallest community is a camp fire glow of reassurance against the anarchic chill of the surrounding darkness a beacon that repels and draws the very forces that would extinguish it in the obscene wake of halloween 1978 the bogey man strolls the avenues of suburbia knife in hand today s alter ego on patrol to punish the pursuit of sex and other complicated pleasures his surreal presence undeterred by bullets or butchery he has left the territory of science fictions to dominate the genre of the horror film yet his lineage extends back to the frankenstein laboratory in happier less gory years when special effects were not so well equipped to transcend the boundaries of disgust these urban nightmares had a pleasing almost cosy simplicity in the 1920s sir arthur conan doyle s reincarnated dinosaur terrorized london in the lost world and prepared the way for king kong the baeest from 20 000 fathoms reptilicus and a menagerie of gargantuans contesting with godzilla the right to trample tokyo underfoot monster movies always had the same target image generously reproduced by the poster artists the creature towered over crumbling office blocks and nation landmarks in disarray while shrieking citizens scattered like vermin a sense of pest control was implicit as if the close packed buildings were an invitation to vice and plague against which the cleansing forces of nature might rise in outrage in the 50s the balance could usually be restored by human ingenuity a consoling demonstrations that it was possible to use intelligence to pull back from brink of defeat but the context of course was less the realm of fantasy than that of cold war politics and lasting reassurance was consequently elusive minor inconveniences like the deadly mantis the giant claw or kronos the power hungry monolith could be relatively quickly vanquished as can their more recent manifestations alligator jaws or the american werewolf the end of the world is less easily shrugged off the world has been ending for quite a while a century ago the certainty of the machine age s collapse prompted the scientific romances of wells and the rather less romantic pronouncements of his gloomy victorian contemporaries among them samuel butler william morris thomas carlyle and john ruskin even rudyard kipling who began by hailing technology as one of the prime justifications of colonialism by the 20s was issuing dark forecasts of its malevolent consequences wells writings combined the speculative spirit of the new aviation era with the multiple misgivings of the political times his voice only one of a chorus anticipating the invasion of england readers of pearson s magazine from april to december of 1897 found in warwick goble s illustrations for his war of the worlds a portrait of social instability that remains vivid even now the smoke of ruin drifting across windsor castle and westminster from the heat rays of the martian war machines mounted like metallic eggs on their ungainly pylons just as the railways had imposed an iron grid across the land as the price of progress so the superiority of the alien technology burned its way across england the brand mark of the future when the film of war of the worlds was made by george pal in 1953 the wellsian tripods with their intriguing resemblance to the eiffel tower were replaced by sleek crafts gliding serenely above the holocaust but the population fled in the same terror and the cities of the world collapsed in familiar firestorms and as they had been in wells only love and faith were somewhat tenuously the final hairbreadth defense the equation to put it simply is that while the city may be the highest accomplishment of modern humanity the architecture of its pride and joy is counterbalanced by an equally towering sense of guilt writing at the same time as wells m p shiel disposed of civilization by plague in order to produce one of the favorite concepts of disaster fiction the empty city the last man inevitably accompanied in due course by the last woman has a rare opportunity for adventure and indulgence in the ruins of earth in the world the flesh and the devil 1959 based rather distantly on shiel s the purple cloud 1901 harry belafonte roams a deserted new york to stock his apartment with all the art treasures he ever longed for including an elaborate model railway in the omega man 1971 charlton heston has the same splendid isolation and the same collector s instinct his retreat an appalling shrine of hi fi vulgarity ultimately invaded and desecrated by other more austere survivors of the world s latest disease the impulse behind such images whether literary or cinematic is shared by many an architect or traffic jammed commuter or for that matter many misanthropists and science fiction writers the wish to savor the accomplishments of humanity without having to contend with the dismal destructive clutter of humanity itself as if the ideal city were too fine and private a place to be sullied by occupation perfection and human behavior after all have seldom been known to achieve coexistence defying historical example the glittering mirage of utopia a camelot that might be raised to reality once more could there only be found the chivalry to warrant it can be glimpsed repeatedly in science fiction draughtsmen have been at work on the project since the renaissance the industrial revolution finally laid classical styles to rest in order for j m w turner to create such turbulent works as rain steam and speed 1844 for such visionaries as grandville and robida to design fleets of armored craft to roam under and above the seas and for illustrators like paul hardy fernand fau and fred t jane to reproduce such inventions in response to editorial demands for futurism an artist in life magazine in 1910 considering the ideal lifestyle of tomorrow s citizens showed passengers at a united air line terminal boarding a vast propeller driven craft high above new york as if the foundations of the pan am building were even then under construction another in a 1911 issue of judge drew a vertiginous citizen s eye view of narrow winged planes in perilous contiguity just above the skyscrapers when fritz lang returned from his american visit in 1924 it was with the inspiration for metropolis that film in turn prompted such a surge of conjecture about the likely design of the future that hugo gernsback was able to launch the first magazine wholly devoted to science fiction amazing stories in 1926 the same year as the film s release gernsback s publication and the many pulps that followed its example were as vital as metropolis in determining how the future city was popularly visualized lang s weighty sets although not unusual in the context of his nibelungen films and magnificent model city which conveniently dwarfed the elusive plausibility of his drama implied a vaguely orgiastic future of riotous leisure this would be bought at the cost of human toil and hard labor until such time as robots and machines would minister to every need and workers would become unnecessary although orgies were frowned upon by the readers of the magazines many of them too young to be interested anyway the motifs of metropolis the inventor s laboratory with its glass tubes and electrical miscellanies the gloriously sensual yet lethal robot and the towering fascination of the illuminated buildings and the floating traffic were matters of indelible concern with their primary colors equally unequivocal images clamoring for attention on the newsstands the covers of amazing science wonder startling fantastic marvel and the great astounding were an eloquent testament to the obsessions of the 30s the city of tomorrow engineers say will tend first to vastness gigantic buildings connected by wide suspended road ways on which traffic will speed at unheard of rates helicopter planes capable of maneuvering about between buildings and roof top airports will take the place of the ground taxi each building will be virtually a city in itself completely self sustaining receiving its supplies from great merchandise ways from below of the ground in this city smoke will be eliminating noise will be conquered and impurity will be eliminated from the air many persons will live in the healthy atmosphere of the buildings top while others will commute to far distant residential towns or country homes the text is from the back cover of the august 1939 edition amazing stories over a panorama of arcades multilevel motorways and immense office towers fashioned some overpowering like organ pipes the effect of the illustration is part metropolis part inferno an overpowering muddle of thrust in which to judge from the traffic the citizen are too concerned with the convolutions of arrival and departure to proceed with any practical business matters at all bar the fact that despite the text all the pedestrians seem to be cowering at ground level it looks like ideal winged serpent territory any arbitrary dip into pulp art will produce an equivalent perspective of architectural complexity where it doesn t involve like frank paul s superb january 1929 amazing cover the collapse of the woolworth building under pressure from a new ice age along with the ubiquitous scenes of crazed scientists these were the inspiration for universal s new gothic horror films the james whale frankenstein of 1931 with its columns of flashing energy a great improvement on the edison company s 1910 version which merely cooked the creature to life in a large oven and of course for the innumerable alien cityscapes featured in ensuing serials such as undersea kingdom the lost city and flash gordon s trip to mars in turn these wild exploits were the inspiration for star wars and for a portfolio of artists like jean giraud moebius phillippe druillet and richard corben whose ruthless and extravagant comic book art would have shaken the artists of amazing to the core druillet s odyssey to delirius for example the planet where pleasure is taxable distends to a staggering gargantuan scale the megalopolis concept rather if d w griffith s babylon set for intolerance were to be revealed as but one small panel in a hall of mirrors with the new generation of science fictions movies which properly was born with star wars but for which the inspiration and skills can be traced beck to the team of technicians and designers assembled and trained by stanley kubrick for 2001 a space odyssey 1968 the heavy metal artists and their muscular fantasies are being wedded by the filmmakers with computer graphics and with the practical industrial concepts of futurists like syd mead this gives the sort of fusion that ridley scott wanted for alien 1979 and for the macabre near future city in blade runner 1982 an integration of the mechanical with the anatomical consistent with his examination of the android theme in alien the clean crystal lines of the nostromo the deep space freight carrier requiring human attention only in emergency contrast with the organic decadence of the alien ship with its deadly clutch of eggs ideally suited to h r giger s disturbingly black arts the contrast helped create an instant horror classic and there has been a spate of similar cinematic struggles in what have became the rather customary corridors of spaceship environment in space man might theoretically be reborn and is at the end of 2001 and one might imagine that his hermetic ultra modern furnishings would be microcosmicutopias free at last from the deterioration of earthbound city life but the cinema suggests a contrary view while kubrick s hardware in 2001 was immaculate and unsullied spatial interiors from dark star 1973 onwards have reflected the wholly probable disinclination of their crews to keep them tidy the finest example of recognition for this enduring human love of shambles which no amount of utopian evolution seems likely to breed out of us can be found in solaris 1971 the gaunt andrei tarkovsky versions of stanislaw lem s novel a space station circling a mysterious oceanic planet at the far end of the universe contains a weary crew too listless and introspective to complete tasks of exploration and analysis that once seemed urgent their haunt is a mess of discarded equipment jumbled papers and anachronistic furniture when an astronaut psychologist arrives to investigate his guest suite is at first pristine in a soulless manner complete with one of those round tables that to judge from the cinema have been essential for forward thinking since the days of merlin but the room quickly degenerates standard issue chaos the film makes no conjecture to the probable decor of the far future the provisions for antigravity the consequences of living without an up or down new clothing materials fresh leisure concepts instead tarkovsky s future concerns itself like his other films with the past the center burrows with an intense gaze and the objective of solaris proves at last to be exactly the environment with him that the future will only confront him with theoretical and moral questions he has always had to tackle and which he usually fails to answer it s significant although hardly surprising that all the space films in cinema history from georges meliès to android 1982 have reflected this same nostalgia for the home planet the objective of each voyage has been wither to return to earth or to recreate it elsewhere even to preserve in space its essential landscapes as with android or silent running 1978 visit forbidden planet 1956 to rescue some stranded tourists or explore the galaxy in star trek 1979 what matters is the perspectives offered by each experience on how terrestrial life os ordered or should or should be with its great galleries of krell technology ready to self destruct at the touch of button forbidden planet demonstrates the homely truth that man must conquer himself before he can infest other worlds and star trek studies the incalculable riches of alien encounter with rather the head shaking wonder of a day excursion visitor to disneyland satisfied to get home afterwords with his snapshot and his memories in outland 1981 set far away in space and time the honeycombs of human proximity have reassuring familiarity as far away in space and time the honeycombs of human proximity have reassuring familiarity as does the story a rehash of high noon things structures in general will be great yes but they will not be monstrous men will not be reduced to servitude and uniformity they will be released to freedom and variety all the balderdash one finds in such films as fritz lang s metropolis about robot workers and ultra skyscrapers etc should be cleared out of your minds before you work on this film as a general rule you may take it that whatever lang did in metropolis is the exact contrary of what we want done here wells guidance to his team for things to come in 1936 resulted in a majestic display of tubes and towers which differed very little in the end from the lang concept and at the film s conclusion a small ship ventured into the stars with the ringing assurance that it would one day return and leave again a cyclical space shuttle commuting between man and his neighbors but never able to neglect for too long the green hills and crystal skyscrapers of earth forty years later the makers of logan s run 1976 were still resisting the traditional imagery we tried to get away says saul david producer of the film from the essentially german bauhaus design styles that were part of metropolis the strongly cubistic rectilinear kinds of structures we found that lang s picture made such an impression on the minds of the whole western world that nobody can think of portraying the future except in terms of towers connected by ramps when what people are actually thinking about today are wide open spaces and parklike areas of green ironically the city of logan s run largely constructed from the world trade center in dallas is the sort of place its inhabitants are eager to leave and the areas of green are mostly in the real world outside the city exteriors have some slight resemblance to discarded grocery containers and egg boxes but the interiors sure enough have the curving walkways giant glass panels and brooding columns of bare wall in which both lang and william cameron menzies would have recognized science fiction s habitual utopia even in tron 1982 although it s scarcely an ideal environment some of the same solid geometry is to be found well tempered with buckminster fuller within the disciplined tyranny of the computer and again as it was with fahrenheit 451 1966 this simulation of basic human pursuits is a setting to be defeated and escaped from as quickly as possible in one among many magical moments in e t 1982 the child sized alien pauses to gaze appreciatively at spielberg s favorite panorama the level electric pattern of a suburban community placid with order under the night sky spielberg savors the special symmetry of human habitation the hypnotic fascination provided by the lights and colors of progress not for nothing does his supreme evocation of the future the mother ship in close encounters of the third kind 1977 look like a fairytale land of spires and skyscrapers as it rises glowing into the sky of course we d take earth with us into space bogey men and all assuming as larry cohen would add that we are ever permitted to leave what better matrix is there utopia if we are to believe science fiction and the cinema is alive and well and living in the 20th century philip strick is chief executive of a british film distribution company and lectures and writes frequently on film and science fiction

education images getty images here s how much home prices have risen since 1950 the rise and fall of home prices can be traced historically to many factors some of these include mortgage rates inflation historical events like economic recessions and state to state or city to city migration rates to name but a few the decades between the 1950s to the 2020s saw significant home price fluctuations especially the period between the post war 1950s to the late 1980s which saw a steady rise in home prices minus a few bumps along the road the recession in the early 1990s produced a minor real estate market bubble that burst ultimately bringing a nominal dip in home prices significant price drops in the housing market didn t really materialize until the 2008 great recession and real estate crash the real estate housing market hadn t experienced something like that since the 1930s and though solid numbers for home prices weren t tracked back then home production rates dropped by 90 proving trends were on a downward trajectory in the u s home market as with any financial market price fluctuations are expected overall while sensitive to other external market forces the home

just 2 938 or 30 600 in today s dollars with world war ii raging overseas home ownership was low on the priority list both on main street and pennsylvania avenue this was no surprise given the 90 drop in production of new homes just a decade before the start of the great depression the robust real estate market of the 1950s fell into place with high demand for homes the shortage that demand created the surging economy and the migration to the suburbs amid the boom of post war purchasing u s president dwight d eisenhower passed the federal aid highway act of 1956 connecting the country like never before this paved the way for suburban sprawl altering the real estate market and opening new possibilities for places to live especially as many americans were starting families families purchased cars in record numbers and federally sponsored highways drove people out of cities and into the suburbs where post war subdivisions like levittown popped up at the end of the war the return of 15 million gis was just the thing to rev up the long suffering real estate market government backed loans helped 2 4 million war veterans to purchase homes by 1952 while this contributed to major home buying and economic mobility for many white veterans of world war ii this was not the case for many black veterans black families were still feeling the ramifications of redlining districts a practice

general prosperity in the united states many factors contributed to the rise in homeownership and home price increases including a healthy price to income ratio which is how much income the price of a house should cost according to city lab that number is now 2 6 years of income in the 1960s the price to income ratio was 2 which meant that purchasing a house required two years of household income the average household income had also risen to 6 691 by the end of the 1950s up 57 9 from the beginning of that decade another contributing factor to rising homeownership and home prices were changes in mortgage financing led by the federal housing administration fha which like the popular gi bill in the years following war war ii allowed many americans to affordably buy homes homeownership edged up past 60 in 1960 mortgage rates also remained low in 1960 fha mortgages were 4 6 va backed mortgages were 4 5 and the average mortgage rate was 5 1 the economy was also flourishing in the 1960s with factors such as intense workforce growth and government assistance to remedy poverty through food stamps and medicare the fair housing act of 1968 also became law during this decade making redlining

the roof overspending on the vietnam war also hurt the u s economy as did the 1973 74 stock market crash all these factors led to inflation which rose during the decade to some of the highest rates in u s history the streak of a strong economy during the prior two decades had finally ended along with inflation and rates home prices also increased while the recession of 1973 75 may not have dampened home prices it did impact the housing market according to the joint center for housing studies of harvard university home sales and housing starts fell leading up to the recession in the early 1970s

contributed to a widening wealth gap in the country making it more difficult for average americans to purchase homes the recessions in the 1980s also impacted black americans the hardest as they had unemployment rates as much as 2 77 times that of white unemployment the manufacturing sector which disproportionately employed black americans shrank the most during the 80s normally such high unemployment rates would negatively impact housing prices though this was not the case during the earliest years of the decade inflation also continued to rise which caused home mortgage interest rates to skyrocket double digit inflation caused double digit mortgage interest rates according to freddie mac data in 1981 the annual average mortgage interest rate was 16 63 the highest in recorded

and led to a slowdown by 2007 and the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry this was followed by rising mortgage rates and record foreclosures on dec 26 2007 the new york times reported that home prices had fallen for the 10th straight month and noted that based on economist robert shiller s calculations the decline in home prices is greater than at any time since 1941 when the housing market

has allowed many people to move virtually anywhere while many major cities have seen a price drop and a lower demand for homes suburban and rural areas have seen the opposite this may be due to

president donald trump s decision in december to recognise morocco s annexation of western sahara in return for morocco s decision to establish diplomatic relations with israel has turned up the heat on a conflict that has been simmering for four decades on twitter mr trump announced that morocco recognized the united states in 1777 it is thus fitting we recognize their sovereignty over the western sahara but the annexation is not accepted by most countries nor by the polisario front which fought morocco for control of the territory from 1975 to 1991 polisario which still controls a third of western sahara is recognised by the united nations as the legitimate representative of the indigenous sahrawi people so who should control western sahara once known as spanish sahara the area was the last vestige of spain s colonial empire when spanish troops withdrew in 1975 it became a battlefield with morocco mauritania and polisario laying claim to the area rich in lucrative phosphate deposits and fish stocks although mauritania long ago gave up on its claim withdrawing from the territory in 1979 these economic interests remain an important part of what drives the conflict morocco asserts a historical right to control the region dating back to before the spanish arrived but the sahrawi people insist that they have largely governed themselves for hundreds of years roaming the desert as nomads with ties to no kingdom or state besides their own tribal allegiances neither the 16 years of fighting nor the last 30 years of ceasefire and talks between morocco and polisario has resolved anything the un tried to help the former colony make a smooth transition from spanish rule several resolutions passed in the 1960s and 1970s emphasised that all powers should be transferred to the people being decolonised in accordance with their freely expressed will and desire this meant consulting the sahrawis in a referendum did they want to join one of their neighbours morocco and mauritania or seek independence but the referendum hit an immediate snag when morocco asked the international court of justice icj to consider its claim over the territory the judges made sure to temper expectations emphasising that they were giving a non binding opinion and not declaring a winner over the territory first the court found that western sahara was not a terra nullius nobody s land at the time of spain s colonisation and belonged to someone second strong historical ties connected morocco to the tribes living in western sahara but did this mean it could annex the territory hundreds of years later morocco claimed as much and the court s decision continues to form the basis of its claim today

proposed alternative options for the aberdeen project will be evaluated in the 2022 integrated resource plan the 60 megawatt project near huron south dakota continues with minimal interruption and should be online by early 2022 said bob rowe chief executive officer as we have consistently warned we continue to be concerned about our customers exposure to high energy prices and scarcity due to high prices the cost of market power purchases for our montana customers in july alone was nearly six times what we spent in the same month last year rowe continues we are glad to have the laurel

2020 for up to 280 mws of peaking and flexible capacity to be available for commercial operation in late 2023 or early 2024 the january 2020 request for proposal rfp further we expect to issue additional all source competitive solicitation requests during 2022 initial bids for the january 2020 rfp were received in july 2020 a third party rfp administrator evaluated the bids with the

will be constructed in yellowstone county montana and powerex transaction a 5 year power purchase agreement for 100 mws of capacity and energy products originating predominately from hydroelectric resources on may 19 2021 we filed an application with the montana public service commission mpsc for advanced approval to acquire the laurel generating station and beartooth battery agreement as new capacity resources these resources together with the powerex transaction will help address our identified capacity shortage the powerex transaction was not included in the application for advanced approval filed with the mpsc recent upheaval in the construction market and specifically timely availability of critical components and escalating labor and construction costs has necessitated the flexibility to expend capital and make commercial decisions in advance of the timeline established by the mpsc advanced approval docket accordingly we withdrew our application on september 23 2021 and intend to seek approval from the mpsc to place the laurel generating station in rate base through a future filing we currently intend to file a separate application for advanced approval of the beartooth battery agreement on october 21 2021 the montana environmental information center and the sierra club filed a lawsuit in montana state court against the montana department of environmental quality mtdeq and us alleging the environmental review of our laurel generating station project was unlawful this lawsuit could delay the laurel project if the court were to require a full environmental impact study regarding the project set aside the air quality permit granted for the laurel generating station or determine that the underlying environmental statute violates the montana constitutional guarantee of a clean and healthful environment electric resource supply south dakota our energy resource plans identify portfolio requirements including potential investments resulting from a completed competitive solicitation process in south dakota our estimated capital expenditures discussed in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2020 within the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section includes approximately 60 million for a 30 40 mw flexible natural gas plant near aberdeen south dakota which was expected to be in service in early 2024 during the third quarter of 2021 we decided to discontinue our plans to build this project as a result of significant increases in estimated construction cost as a result of global supply chain challenges as a result of the project discontinuance we recorded a 1 2 million pre tax charge in the three months ended september 30 2021 for the write off of preliminary construction costs construction continues for a 60mw reciprocating internal combustion engine project in huron sd to be online in early 2022 with total construction costs of approximately 80 million with the acceleration of the laurel generation project and the discontinuation of the aberdeen generation project we anticipate providing an updated 5 year capital forecast at the edison electric institute financial conference early next month regulatory update we have recently filed several regulatory filings primarily in our montana jurisdiction including an april 15 2021 filing of a motion requesting to delay the implementation of our fixed cost recovery mechanism pilot in our montana jurisdiction for another year until july 2022 or beyond due to the continued uncertainties created by the covid 19 pandemic on june 29 2021 the mpsc granted our motion opponents to the delay requested reconsideration and the commission denied their request on september 15 2021 and an april 21 2021 filing requesting approval to increase the power cost and credit adjustment mechanism pccam base forecasted costs used to develop rates for the recovery of electric power costs through our pccam by approximately 17 million or potentially a greater increase to reflect current market prices and new capacity contracts on june 29 2021 the mpsc approved implementing our request for interim rates reflecting the 17 million increase subject to refund the montana consumer counsel mcc filed a motion arguing that the pccam base cannot be updated except in a general rate case and asked the mpsc to dismiss the application on october 5 2021 the mpsc voted to grant the mcc s motion to dismiss and we await the final written order we are subject to ferc s jurisdiction and regulations with respect to rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale rates the issuance of certain securities and incurrence of certain long term debt among other things the division of audits and accounting in the office of enforcement of ferc has initiated a routine audit of northwestern corporation for the period of january 1 2018 to the present to evaluate our compliance with ferc accounting and financial reporting requirements we have responded to several sets of data requests as part of the audit process an audit report has not yet been received from ferc but is expected within the next six months management is unable to predict the outcome or timing of the final resolution of the audit february cold weather event the february 2021 prolonged cold spell resulted in record winter peak demand for electricity and natural gas the broad reach of this event across the united states and other market factors resulted in an extreme price excursion for purchased power and natural gas in our south dakota and nebraska service territories natural gas costs for the month of february 2021 exceeded the total cost for all of 2020 fuel and purchased power costs in these jurisdictions are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses we ve incorporated the liquidity impacts into our overall 2021 financing plans the nebraska public service commission npsc opened a docket on march 2 2021 to investigate the effect of this cold weather event on natural gas supply in this docket we proposed recovery of our costs for february 13 2021 to february 18 2021 over a two year period which was subsequently approved by the npsc on may 11 2021 and a regulatory asset of approximately 26 0 million was recorded for these costs with a remaining balance of 25 2 million as of september 30 2021 the south dakota public utilities commission issued an order allowing recovery of natural gas costs for the same time period over a one year period effective march 2 2021 a regulatory asset of approximately 22 0 million was recorded for these costs with a remaining balance of 17 7 million as of september 30 2021 covid 19 pandemic and global economic recovery the covid 19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on people economies businesses and financial markets beginning in march 2020 the pandemic and resulting economic conditions began impacting our business operations and financial results our 2020 financial results were impacted by lower sales volumes an increase in reserves for uncollectible accounts and an increase in interest expense partly offset by lower operating general and administrative expenses we have experienced improving conditions in our service territories during 2021 that have positively impacted our business as compared to 2020 the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our financial results for 2021 and beyond depends on the evolving landscape of the pandemic and the public health responses to contain it as well as the substance and pace of the macroeconomic recovery if health conditions deteriorate or the economic recovery stalls it could have the result of lower demand for electricity and natural gas as well as reduced ability of various customers contractors suppliers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations or provide the services we seek to support our business operations these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and prospects the biden administration is also seeking to require large companies like us to have all of our employees vaccinated or undergo weekly covid testing complying with either a vaccine mandate or weekly testing requirements if there are even enough testing kits available could be difficult and costly and it is possible that some employees may choose to leave employment over a vaccine or testing requirement we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these economic conditions and issues continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations financing activity we anticipate financing our ongoing maintenance and capital programs with a combination of cash flows from operations first mortgage bonds and equity issuances in march 2021 we issued and sold 100 0 million aggregate principal amount of montana first mortgage bonds at a fixed interest rate of 1 00 maturing on march 26 2024 the net proceeds were used to repay in full our outstanding 100 0 million one year term loan that was due april 2 2021 in april 2021 we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 200 0 million through an atm program including an equity forward sales component during the three months ended september 30 2021 we issued 1 040 085 shares of our common stock at an average price of 63 13 for net proceeds of 64 8

2002 more information is available on the company s web site at www northwesternenergy com non gaap financial measures this press release includes financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as other financial measures such as gross margin adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that exclude or include amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define gross margin as revenues less cost of sales as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of income management believes that gross margin revenues less cost of sales provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms as detailed below our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition gross margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow for recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our gross margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income net income and diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled measures special note regarding forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private

cracks are emerging in the global solar industry threatening to flatten its growth trajectory just as the world needs clean power more than ever the sector is being slammed by a barrage of obstacles with rising materials costs forced labor accusations and a worsening trade war all hitting at once as a result panel prices are rising for the first time in years and some manufacturers have asked buyers to delay purchases if they can and although annual installations are still ticking higher wall street warns the pace of expansion may slow sharply if those hurdles continue unchecked the shocks to the system in the last two to three months are more or less unprecedented said jenny chase an analyst with bloombergnef we need to get to net zero as soon as possible and to do that we just need so much solar and wind we re not on track we need to ramp all this stuff up dramatically these setbacks may only be temporary with delays in installations expected to be largely resolved by the end of 2022 when new solar factories help ease supply chain issues but any snag in the sector s rollout will have lasting effects with the emissions from the fossil fuels burned instead trapping heat in the atmosphere for decades solar provided just 3 3 of the world s electricity in 2020 bloombergnef estimates that to be on target for net zero by 2050 the world needs to add 455 gigawatts of solar every year through 2030 last year was a record and it only added 144 gigawatts the recent stumbles are hitting right before the united nations cop26 climate talks begin later this month viewed by many as a crucial and last ditch effort to curb global warming it was easy to be optimistic about solar coming into the year joe biden s ascendance to the presidency china s 2060 net zero pledge and europe s green deal meant that for the first time all three dominant economies supported an energy transition at the same time and thanks to decades of painstaking work by researchers and companies solar can now produce energy cheaper than fossil fuels in most of the world even the technology s achilles heel the sun doesn t always shine was on the way to being solved by improvements in batteries demand has mostly held up its end of the bargain but the supply chain hasn t been able to match it largely to blame is polysilicon an ultra conductive material that s refined in factories mostly in china using caustic chemicals and copious amounts of mostly coal derived energy and with demand for panel production so robust there isn t enough of it to go around as early as january boci research ltd analyst tony fei warned that polysilicon factories could only make enough of the material for 170 gigawatts of panels far less than some of the most bullish estimates were calling for his call proved prescient and prices of polysilicon quadrupled from mid 2020 to mid 2021 now a power crunch spurred by a shortage of coal has cut supplies of the metal used to make polysilicon sending prices even higher rising steel aluminum and freight costs are also adding up and solar panel prices are on track for their first annual price rise since 2013 those hurdles are starting to show up in analysts forecasts guggenheim securities llc just removed its buy rating on four solar stocks citing rising risks to 2022 revenue it says aren t yet reflected in consensus estimates earlier this month daiwa capital markets lowered its forecast for 2021 installations by 15 gigawatts more than enough clean energy to power every home in new jersey with that capacity delayed until next year morgan stanley and citigroup have both cautioned about near term panel demand in china the world s biggest solar market while the u s will grow its pace of installations just 3 2 next year after a 58 jump in 2021 says bloombergnef we think that input costs are starting to impact 2022 project timing guggenheim analysts joseph osha and hilary cauley wrote in a research note amid rising costs projects that looked marginal when contracts were signed now look unviable polysilicon is also at the center of a second controversy nearly half the world s supply is made in xinjiang a region in western china facing allegations of forced labor and human rights abuses against the ethnic uyghur muslim population there that hit the solar world in june when the biden administration blocked imports of materials made by hoshine silicon industry co which supplies feedstock material to several polysilicon makers u s customs agents soon began issuing withhold release orders wro to detain china linked solar panels at the border and the issue hasn t been resolved in the months since there s lots of uncertainty in the industry because they do not know how strict the wro enforcement will be or currently is said kelsey goss research analyst at wood mackenzie who specializes in global solar supply chain and technology shortly after the first detainments a second trade fissure opened between china and the u s when a group of unnamed solar companies appealed to the biden administration to extend obama era anti dumping tariffs on chinese solar panels to those made by chinese owned firms in thailand malaysia and vietnam where the u s gets nearly 80 of its panels the u s department of commerce has yet to decide whether it will even investigate the appeal but just the threat of the case has caused some companies to stop sending panels to the u s according to the solar energy industries association trade group this had an immediate chilling effect on the market said george hershman president of swinerton renewable energy manufacturers started to hold orders immediately china s five biggest panel makers which account for around half the world s supply last month asked customers in an open letter to delay purchases to avoid supply chain carnage now some u s solar construction companies have started sending workers home because there are no panels available according to roth capital partners of course it s not all doom and gloom with solar even with the price hikes solar panels are still cheaper now than they were in october 2018 and installations keep inching higher new polysilicon factories and an eventual end to china s power crunch promise to bring prices back down by 2023 at the latest and even amid all the hubbub solar companies continued to improve their technology and manufacturing efficiency this year promising continued cost improvements in the future not to mention that solar s biggest competitor fossil fuels are mired in their own supply issues that have sent coal and natural gas prices to record levels that s scant relief though for installers like india s gautam das trying to add solar capacity today das 47 who left his job as head of treasury products at citibank india to start solar developer oorjan cleantech in 2016 is projecting revenue to grow five fold this year but he s faced a hiccup recently when the price of modules in india jumped by about 20 the company took hits to its profit on some projects and shared the increased cost with customers on others for some developments he said there was no choice but to delay installation and hope prices fall in a few months which is bad news for both the customers and overall emissions as a country and as an entrepreneur i believe more solar is better and faster is better he said but a 20 jump in a month that s a big uncertainty and a big hindrance to solar adoption with assistance from brian eckhouse
people are created by god to be male or female period oklahoma governor is slammed by state s first ever nonbinary lawmaker after vowing to fight ruling that allows third gender category on birth certificate this year oklahoma offered a nonbinary option on official state birth certificate governor kevin stitt a republican has vowed to undo newly enacted policy nonbinary people do not identify as male or a female but use they of them first ever nonbinary lawmaker in state legislature blasted governor stitt mauree turner is a democrat who represents oklahoma city in state legislature they accused stitt other republicans of adamantly opposing existence oklahoma one of 15 states that offers third gender option on birth certificate an oklahoma state lawmaker has blasted the republican governor for vowing to fight a decision by his administration s health department to allow for a nonbinary option on the official birth certificate mauree turner a democrat who represents oklahoma city in the state legislature is the first ever lawmaker in the sooner state to identify as nonbinary people who are nonbinary do not identify with traditional male or female gender assignments instead the preferred pronoun is they or them if you have to work with people who adamantly oppose your existence right to the point to where we can t work together you can t talk to me you can t talk to me like i m a human being you don t see me that damages anyone s working relationship turner told kokh tv governor kevin stitt and other republican leaders expressed outrage on thursday after learning the state department of health issued a birth certificate this year with a nonbinary gender designation mauree turner a democrat who represents oklahoma city in the state legislature is the first ever lawmaker in the sooner state to identify as nonbinary governor kevin stitt and other republican leaders expressed outrage on thursday after learning the state department of health issued a birth certificate this year with a nonbinary gender designation oklahoma is one of 15 states in the united states to offer a third gender option on the state s official birth certificate the image above is a stock photo of an old birth certificate from oklahoma the agency issued the birth certificate in may to oregon resident kit lorelied who was born in oklahoma identifies as nonbinary and uses they them pronouns lorelied sued after the oklahoma state department of health initially refused the request the department represented by the office of the attorney general reached a settlement in may in which it agreed to add nonbinary as an option on birth certificates stitt condemned the settlement on thursday i believe that people are created by god to be male or female period stitt said in a statement there is no such thing as non binary sex and i wholeheartedly condemn the purported osdh court settlement that was entered into by rogue activists who acted without receiving proper approval or oversight us states that issue nonbinary birth certificates americans who do not identify as either a male or a female have the option of choosing a third gender category often in the form of the letter x on birth certificates issued by the following states california colorado connecticut maine massachusetts michigan nevada new jersey new mexico new york oklahoma oregon rhode island utah washington washington district of columbia advertisement a spokeswoman for stitt did not immediately respond to a message seeking to clarify who the governor alleged was a rogue activist oklahoma is one of 15 states in the union in addition to the district of columbia that offers its citizens a third gender category on official birth certificates the other states that do so are california colorado connecticut maine massachusetts michigan nevada new jersey new mexico new york oklahoma oregon rhode island utah washington state and washington dc earlier this year two transgender people sued over a new montana law that makes it difficult for transgender people to change the sex on their birth certificates turner hit back at stitt accusing the governor of stoking fear among the lgbtq community in the state if we are continuously saying like you re not real you have to suppress that part of you what is that going to do to our community turner said what s that going to do to our kids the state legislature s top democrat also blasted stitt this morning the governor used his pulpit to attack oklahomans period house minority leader emily virgin said in a statement a national study estimated that 52 percent of transgender and non binary young people in the united states seriously contemplated suicide last year the governor s suggestion that non binary people don t qualify as oklahomans is abhorrent and completely unbecoming of a governor moreover it is dangerous the agreement to add the nonbinary option to the birth certificate was reached by lorelied s attorney the department of health and the office of the attorney general seventeen states and the district of columbia currently recognize nonbinary gender status and permit such designation on identifying documents according to lorelied s lawsuit oklahoma s health commissioner dr lance frye said in a statement that the settlement was reached under the administration of former attorney general mike hunter and that the agency was working with stitt and new attorney general john o connor on how to proceed should a challenge to the previous agreement be made we will proceed accordingly frye said lorelied s attorney christopher brecht said his client was very happy with the settlement and that he was surprised at the outrage from gop leaders i certainly don t understand the vehement objection to something like this he said i don t understand how this impacts binary individuals so the swift opposition is surprising to me brecht said his client simply wanted a birth certificate that reflected who they are from my perspective having the very first thing that identifies you to the world to have that not identify you accurately i can t think of anything more degrading he said statements from house speaker charles mccall and senate president pro tempore greg treat said the settlement amounted to unauthorized overreach by executive agencies advertisement state senator micheal bergstrom a republican from adair has filed a bill for the upcoming session that would require male and female to be the only options on birth certificates

because i believe in the division of labor i rarely use hand tools today in the 80s and 90s i had two 4 x 8 pegboards on my garage wall full of tools along with my large craftsman toolbox i had the right tool for every job around the car house and yard i worked on the plumbing electricity built rooms and flooring my current friends might not believe it but i was quite handy back then it was almost a bit of a fetish now i know others can wield them more efficiently and i m pleased to let them do so my tools of choice today are my computers ipad and phone i am much more productive with my current tools than trying to fix a light switch the right tool in the right hands can do miracles however it gets more complicated when you want to work on the markets and the economy hammers work because nails don t unpredictably reshape themselves the economy does fiscal and monetary authorities must rely on tools that don t work consistently and may not work at all as we ll discuss today this is a big part of our current dilemma we d all like to think it has an easy explanation and a quick solution readers tell me all the time john the problem is really ______ unfortunately it s not one problem we face a swirling mess of different problems interacting in ways we don t fully understand we do have some clues though it now looks more and more like august september marked some kind of turning point economic data has weakened considerably since then you know what i think of economic models but they have a kind of objectivity the numbers do what they do it s probably important that the atlanta fed s third quarter gdpnow estimate crumbled from 6 1 as of august 23 to 0 5 on october 18 that s a whale of a change in less than two months source atlanta fed note the chart also shows a consensus of private forecasts dropping at the same time though not quite as dramatically clearly something changed in the last 60 90 days here are some possible factors in no particular order increasing supply chain snarls jumping energy prices covid 19 delta variant case surge evergrande and china housing crackdown a hasty us afghanistan withdrawal end of enhanced us unemployment benefits difficulties for pending infrastructure bills oh yes the return of 5 plus inflation which deducts from nominal gdp to get real gdp we can t pin it on any one of these they all had some influence along with others not listed adding up to the lower growth estimates and let s note lower growth isn t the end of the world if q3 real gdp growth is 0 5 it won t be what we hoped but it won t be recession either the economy is performing well in many ways plenty of jobs are available new businesses are being launched companies are profitable third quarter earnings season has started off with a bang and stock prices are strong we could do much worse but we could also do better and the missed opportunities are frustrating today s letter will be the first of at least two parts next week i ll describe where i think this is heading and how we still have a chance to save the recovery if certain people institutions make the right choices but first i want to establish three important points they are foundational to my outlook here they are summarized in one sentence we are facing demand driven inflation as a consequence of misguided monetary policy and misdirected fiscal stimulus that may sound simple and obvious but this one short sentence has a lot to unpack we ll start below demand is booming last week i wrote about the growing logistical sandpiles problem it shows no sign of improvement that s not good but i think this situation is also a clue to our deeper problems the ports and railroads are clogged because the economy is demanding more goods and this demand is driving inflation pressure my friend jim bianco explained what is happening in a magnificent twitter thread you should read i ll excerpt his key points and charts below the los angeles and long beach ports collectively unload just under one million containers a month for the last year they have been running at near a record pace in other words they are running as fast as they can the problem is they are at their limit source jim bianco there are also problems getting these containers off the dock unfortunately there is a trucking shortage which has led to soaring trucking rates chart below demanding more trucks at 3 am to get these unloaded containers off the dock is going to be a taller order source jim bianco this is leading to a backlog of ships anchored off la and since these containers are taking longer to unload shippers now have to factor in this dead time anchored off shore this is a disincentive to ship so the number of empty containers are piling up in the ports source jim bianco source jim bianco this is leading to a recent fall in container rates no one is in a hurry to ship these containers back to china for reuse if they are going to just sit anchored off la for many days then one has to struggle to find a truck to haul it away after illustrating the problem jim explained the cause simply demand is booming below is personal consumption since 09 its trendline and residuals actual trend consumption is off the charts at 662b trend again we want a record amount of stuff and the supply chain cannot handle it source jim bianco interestingly paul krugman highlighted some of the same problems but he notes a different distinction consumers have shifted their buying from services experiences to materials and specifically durable goods source the new york times this makes sense as the government sent trillions of dollars of hot money directly to consumers and or businesses restaurants hotels and airlines were generally off the market vacations were crimped so people bought stuff thus those ships off the shores of california contain extra goods that both manufacturers and shippers hadn t planned for jim thinks prospects for near term relief are nil and it will generate more inflation many assume increasing the throughput of the supply chain to meet overstimulated demand over the short term is doable but if the problem is the supply chain is at capacity now expanding will be hard impossible over the next several months jm and if you are a business do you increase your capacity for what will likely be a short term demand increase so to bring everything into balance prices will rise until enough demand is destroyed to bring everything into line with the limits of the supply chain we might be seeing this happening as q3 growth expectations are crumbling as prices are soaring source jim bianco source jim bianco john here again let me add a couple of notes first as noted above the consumption growth jim describes is partly a consumption shift thanks to covid americans have reduced spending on services restaurants concerts hotels airlines etc and spent more on goods it s pretty clear in the inflation data source tony sagami in barely more than a year we reversed a shift that unfolded over decades of course it s not going smoothly second it would be nice to know more specifically what is in all these containers i suspect a big part of it emanates from housing construction growth building materials are bulky and consume a lot of shipping capacity relative to their value new homes once occupied also spark many other purchases furniture lawnmowers garden hoses etc if i m right on that then a break in the housing boom might have a swift effect on the supply chain problems but right now there is no sign of such in part because the policies driving it aren t changing which brings us to my next big point running it hot traditionally the federal reserve prevents the economy from overheating by taking away the punchbowl as the old saying goes that skill set seems to have atrophied from disuse understandably so too we have seen nothing you could reasonably call overheating since the 1990s surging first half 2021 growth simply recovered the prior year s decline more or less and now seems to be ending so the current generation of fed leaders and staff has spent years looking for ways to fill the punchbowl they have long talked of letting the economy run hot tolerating higher inflation for some extended period that would balance out years of lower inflation if that s your perspective then the idea this post covid period would bring only transitory inflation was likely disappointing look at jim bianco s chart above and you ll see it has been many years since core cpi stayed above 2 5 for very long and it s often been well below these last few months while sharply higher are still nowhere near restoring long term normal inflation in my view even 2 inflation is too much some officials at least claim to be concerned about current levels but as an institution the fed doesn t seem to think the party is out of hand they are certainly doing nothing to stop it yet the supply chain inflation bianco describes is partly a result of the fed s actions since early 2020 their initial dramatic moves were appropriate we were in an unprecedented situation that could have destabilized the banking system that risk passed pretty quickly leaving a garden variety recession they could have addressed without the drama yet their crisis programs and policies are still in place today why i see two reasons first they re using new tools like loan guarantees because the old tools don t work anymore debt loads both public and private are so gigantic that injecting more money no longer has the stimulative effect it once did lacy hunt says declining velocity is key to this they can create liquidity but they can t force banks to lend or businesses and consumers to borrow here s lacy in the most recent hoisington quarterly emphasis mine as velocity declines each dollar of money produces less gdp the drop in velocity to lower levels indicates that monetary policy becomes increasingly asymmetric in its capabilities while tightening operations are effective fed actions to support the economy are largely counterproductive even when they are novel in scope and massive in size benefits can accrue but their impact on economic growth has proved to be extremely minimal the fed is able to increase money supply growth but the ongoing decline in velocity means that the new liquidity is trapped in the financial markets rather than advancing the standard of living by moving into the real economy in other words the fed can still take away the punchbowl but is unable to refill it they don t want to take it away because they have this fantasy it will eventually work so they are keeping short term rates at zero and buying 120 billion in bonds every month along with assorted other programs you can see what it s done to their balance sheet source reuters that 120 billion monthly bond buy goes 80 billion to treasury securities and 40 billion to mortgage backed securities this is a giant rate subsidy to the federal government s borrowing as well as home buyers no surprise both have been adding leverage and as noted the latter group is probably aggravating the supply chain problem all this monetary stimulus had some effect of course but the latest growth forecasts suggest it is already dissipating the fed did so much so fast it produced a self limiting recovery in which supply chain inflation caps potential growth like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here that s not good but we have another culprit bipartisan failure in march 2020 with covid 19 spreading in the us no one really knew what to expect just as the fed was right to aggressively protect the financial system the federal government acted correctly to help the millions who lost jobs and income but details matter and time is showing the stimulus programs were poorly designed and often counterproductive let s start with the core problem they got the goal wrong the target shouldn t have been to stimulate the entire economy but to maintain the status quo for affected individuals at the time we wrongly thought a few weeks of inactivity would suffice the goal should have been to replace the lost income and only the lost income for the people who actually lost it but as a practical matter that was apparently too hard so instead we pushed them into an unemployment insurance system unprepared for the task and added a flat 300 weekly supplement that was more than some people needed and not enough for others then we also sent checks to almost everyone excluding the highest income groups whether they needed them or not then we did it again in late 2020 and again in 2021 note this was a bipartisan policy failure the first two covid relief bills totaling over 3 trillion passed a democratic house and republican senate president trump signed both president biden and a democratic house and senate added 1 9 trillion more everyone s fingerprints are on this but whoever you blame this money had a giant effect on consumer spending not all of it was bad if the government is going to kill people s jobs it can at least help them buy groceries the problem is that large amounts went not to basic needs but to discretionary luxuries some of which are on those ships the ports can t unload fast enough easy money i have been trying to explain for years the subtle difference between qe quantitative easing and outright money printing mmt essentially the fed does not buy government debt directly from the government they go into the open market and buy it from people institutions that originally bought that paper at treasury s auctions typically the money the fed uses to buy that debt goes back on the fed s balance sheet as excess bank reserves you can zoom in on the chart below and see what looks like a flat line up until about 2009 is actually composed of very tiny bumps a small amount of excess reserves was normal then they started qe in 2009 and the amounts exploded they began slowly tapering down in 2018 until the amounts jumped again from the covid qe again in theory banks could lend this money that is not happening it is ending up in margin accounts and other products directly or indirectly boosting the stock market that easy money policy coupled with extremely low interest rates is boosting home prices exacerbating wealth and income disparity source fred low interest rates are of limited help to first time homebuyers when the average price goes from 380 000 to 420 000 in a little over a year this is what happens when government in this case the federal reserve meddles in the market albeit with good intentions now if you already own a house that s rising in value you are not upset but if you are trying to buy one the fed is making it harder on you it s a corollary to financial repression like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here an intended consequence as many as 25 of homes are now being bought by yield seeking funds that will rent them when bonds no longer even keep up with inflation investors look for other ways to get yield and residential real estate offers not just yield but depreciation that would not be possible or even necessary if treasuries were 2½ source fred so where is the inflation coming from if it is not directly from qe it is coming from the 6 trillion in high powered fed money plus fiscal stimulus spending that money did not end up on the federal reserve balance sheet it went directly into consumers and some businesses the stimulus programs are the real helicopter money that ben bernanke mentioned almost 20 years ago for the record i agree with lacy hunt we will eventually go back to a slow growth disinflationary environment i think real gdp will likely average 1 for the rest of this decade because of the debt burden but in the meantime until the stimulus and supply chain issues work out until we figure out how to entice potential employees back to work we re going to have to deal with uncomfortably high inflation this from grant williams recent things that make you go hmmm not only that but recent comments by fed officials suggest the fed is trying to gently convince their adoring public that inflation may actually turn out to be a little stronger than they forecast for a little longer than they forecast sigh as you can tell this is a vast problem with many moving parts it has other elements i haven t mentioned today too like for instance low interest rates and quantitative easing can t solve supply chain issues microchip shortages or changes in the labor market together the federal government and the federal reserve have put us all in a jam with no good alternatives yet we do have options they aren t great but would let us avoid the worst i ll describe them for you next week new york and dallas i had planned to be in new york next week but circumstances changed i will be in nyc beginning november 7 for a packed week of meetings and for my friend david bahnsen s launch party of his new book there is no free lunch it is going to be a

follow me on twitter as much for the links i provide as well as my own commentary halloween in my neighborhood which has lots of kids is interesting this is a golf community so the parents and kids go

same period in the prior year analysis of consolidated financial results for the third quarter ended 30 september 20211 net interest income for the quarter was 315m an increase of 71m or 29 compared with the same period in the prior year this was a result of improved margins due to reduced volumes of interest bearing liabilities and growth in lending partly offset by a reduction in lower yielding financial investments net interest income for the year to date was 903m an increase of 92m or 11 this increase was driven by the same factors as described in the quarter partly offset by margin compression in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year due to central bank rate cuts in 2020 net fee income for the quarter was 197m an increase of 25m or 15 compared with the same period in the prior year this was mainly a result of an increase in credit facility fees from higher volumes of bankers acceptances in commercial banking higher investment funds under management in wealth and personal banking and higher advisory fees in global banking and markets increased card activity in both wealth and personal banking and commercial banking also had an impact this was partly offset by an increase in related fee expense net fee income for the year to date was 589m an increase of 61m or 12 for the year to date the increases noted in the quarter were coupled with higher activity in our online brokerage business in wealth and personal banking net income from financial instruments held for trading for the quarter was 26m a decrease of 3m or 10 compared with the same period in the prior year the decrease was mainly driven by unfavourable movement in credit and funding fair value adjustments and lower net interest income on trading activities due to the lower interest environment these decreases were partly offset by higher trading activities net income from financial instruments held for trading was 84m for the year to date a decrease of 18m or 18 the decrease was driven by lower net interest income due to the lower interest rate environment and decreased rates trading activities this was partly offset by increases mainly driven by reduced market volatility and tightening credit spreads other items of income for the quarter were 22m a decrease of 5m or 19 compared with the same period in the prior year the decrease was driven by lower gains on the disposal of financial investments from re balancing the bank s liquid asset portfolio other items of income for the year to date were 60m a decrease of 19m or 24 driven by lower gains as described in the quarter as well as the prior year s gain on the extinguishment of repurchased subordinated debentures change in expected credit losses for the third quarter of 2021 resulted in a charge of 3m compared to a release of 2m for the same period in the prior year the charge for the quarter was driven by two non performing energy loans partly offset by a release in performing loans as the forward looking macro economic variables continued to improve the third quarter release in 2020 was primarily driven by improvement in forward looking macro economic variables in performing loans partly offset by impairment charges from non performing loans in the energy transportation and construction sectors change in expected credit losses for the year to date was a release of 53m compared to a charge of 328m for the same period in the prior year the release for the year to date was driven by improvement in the forward looking macro economic variables related to performing loans partly offset by impairment charges from two non performing energy loans the year to date charges in 2020 reflected elevated provisions on performing loans due to the impact of the pandemic coupled with impairments from non performing loans due to the decline in oil prices in the first half of 2020 total operating expenses for the quarter were 323m an increase of 6m or 1 9 compared with the same period in the prior year total operating expenses for the year to date were 964m an increase of 16m or 1 7 the increase for the quarter was mainly due to costs associated with strategic investments to grow our business simplify our processes and provide digital services to meet customer demand the increase for the year to date was mainly due to costs associated with preparing for hybrid working arrangements impairment of certain software assets and costs associated with our strategic investments this was partly offset by reduced discretionary costs in response to the current economic environment income tax expense the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 27 2 which is higher than the statutory tax rate of 26 5 due to an increase in tax liabilities the effective tax rate for the third

an increased charge in expected credit losses partly offset by an increase in operating income for the year to date the increase in profit before income tax was mainly due to the decreased charge in expected credit losses on performing loans as forward looking macro economic guidance improved along with lower operating expenses due to prudent cost management partly offset by lower operating

on sunday the strike by over 10 000 john deere workers entered its 10th day workers at the agricultural and construction equipment giant s facilities in iowa illinois kansas georgia and colorado rejected a tentative agreement backed by the uaw by a more than 90 percent margin on october 10 launching their first strike in 35 years three days later the six year uaw deere deal would have kept wages far below inflation while removing pensions for new workers workers strike outside of a john deere plant wednesday oct 20 2021 in ankeny iowa ap photo charlie neibergall with deere operating over 100 facilities in 30 countries workers are up against a powerful and experienced corporation which sprawls across the globe however the very expansion and integration of deere s operations around the world over the last 65 years has linked workers up in an international web of production which if successfully leveraged would be a source of immense strength according to an investor relations fact sheet deere now has 42 100 employees outside the us and canada most of whom are involved in equipment operations and constitute a majority of its nearly 70 000 strong global workforce john deere s growth into a global corporation while the original john deere a repairman and tool manufacturer founded the company in 1837 the transnational corporate behemoth that is deere today began taking shape in the 20th century although it had opened facilities in canada earlier deere first began expanding its productive operations internationally in earnest in the mid 1950s in 1956 it bought shares of a tractor company in mannheim germany where it has a deere plant today and purchased land in monterrey mexico where it would go on to establish multiple operations not long after it would expand into argentina spain france and south africa it would also move into heavy equipment manufacturing building equipment for construction and tractors as well as personal gardening equipment the period of the 1990s and 2000s would see deere open plants in russia india and china while engaging in an acquisition spree of other companies including an increasing number of autonomous technology firms in more recent years deere s growth of profits outside of the us and canada since at least 2011 john deere s sales and profits from equipment operations in the us and canada have steadily declined while those outside the us and canada have increased the proportion of deere s net sales from equipment operations outside the us and canada has grown from approximately 28 percent in 2001 to 42 percent in 2020 in 2011 deere s us and canada equipment operating profits were 3 23 billion in 2020 it was 2 194 billion a decline of 67 percent the opposite was the case however for operating profits for equipment operations outside the us and canada in 2011 deere s equipment operating profits outside of the us and canada were 967 million in 2020 they were 1 36 billion this has been accompanied by the increase of deere s equipment net sales in asia africa australia new zealand and middle east from 2 7 billion in 2011 to 3 59 billion in 2020 deere s growth outside of north america is in part due to emerging markets in asia in particular the growth of sales is being spurred by the adoption of industrial farming practices which has also coincided with a colossal migration of peasants and rural toilers to the urban centers vastly increasing the size of the working class in countries such as china and india according to the website globenewswire com the asia pacific agriculture equipment market is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5 2 percent between 2019 2025 due to a transition from conventional methods of farming to mechanized farm practices the role of finance capital deere s domination of the global market for agricultural machinery a basic necessity required by nearly all countries for the production of food and other goods makes it an incredibly lucrative source of profits for the financial elite the latest financial results published in august saw deere bring in profits of over 1 6 billion for the third quarter of its fiscal year alone deere forecasted that its net income for fiscal 2021 would be between 5 7 and 5 9 billion which would be nearly 70 percent higher than its previous annual record of 3 5 billion in 2013 around 70 percent of deere s stock is controlled by institutions with another 10 percent owned by private equity and venture capital funds according to the investment website simply wall st cascade investment llc an investment vehicle owned by centibillionaire bill gates controls approximately 10 percent of deere s shares combined with the vanguard group inc blackrock inc jpmorgan chase and wellington management group llp these large investment firms own close to 30 percent of deere deere s stock price and its shareholders have massively benefited from the cheap money policies of the federal reserve which has maintained interest rates close to zero and continues to purchase 120 billion worth of bonds every month since the bottom of the market in march 2020 deere s stock price has more than tripled rising from 111 to 340 with a market capitalization now exceeding 100 billion deere s board of directors includes some of america s significant representatives of the corporate and political elite such as alan heuberger a senior investment manager at bmgi bill and melinda gates investments the private family investment fund of the billionaire couple dmitri l stockton former top executive of general electric and ge asset management inc tami a erwin executive vice president at verizon gregory r page retired ceo and chairman of agribusiness giant cargill charles o chad holliday jr retired ceo and chairman of chemical company dupont and michael o johanns a republican retired us senator from nebraska and former us secretary of agriculture while wages for deere workers have eroded for years and health care benefits and pensions have been steadily stripped away the wealth of deere s directors executives and shareholders has ballooned according to deere s definitive proxy statements filed with the securities and exchange commission sec the average director compensation has risen from roughly 200 000 in 2010 to 310 000 in 2020 an increase of 55 percent of course this reported income is likely only a small portion of the money accruing to deere s executive board meanwhile deere s current chairman and ceo john c may received a total compensation of 15 588 384 in 2020 a rise of 160 percent compared to his pay the previous year and 220 times the median deere employee pay of 70 743 the john deere strike and the need for an international strategy the strike by deere workers in the united states has international consequences for the company two of its plants in iowa produce all types of parts for deere s products across the world but the strike has put a wrench in the company s production of parts putting pressure on its margins parts sales are of growing importance to deere s bottom line from 2011 to 2020 net parts sales rose from 4 5 billion to 6 8 billion the volume of parts sales also increased in this period in 2011 parts constituted 15 percent of total equipment sales in 2020 they consisted of 22 percent the strike threatens a shortage of parts required to repair farm equipment in the united states as harvest season is still under way this means a potential decline of agricultural exports which amount to billions of dollars to china and other countries as crops cannot be harvested and are left to rot this places striking john deere workers in the united states in a powerful position however they nevertheless confront a massive and cutthroat corporation which is operating with a global strategy and determined to break their strike more than deere s own profits are on the line immense pressure is being brought to bear on the company by both wall street and the political establishment who wish to prevent at all costs any section of the working class breaking out of the decades long low wage regime the ruling class fears that one clear victory by workers will spark a social upheaval throughout the us thus deere is seeking to utilize all the tools at its disposal state repression and court injunctions strikebreakers and most of all counting on its partners in the uaw to sabotage workers struggle but anger within the working class is already at a boiling point with the walkout at deere part of the largest strike wave in decades the overwhelming no vote by deere workers is a manifestation of a fightback by workers against the uaw s and deere s years of clawing away at wages benefits and rights the rebellion by deere workers has led to the formation of the john deere workers rank and file committee initiated by workers independently of the uaw the international character of john deere requires workers adopt their own international strategy to fight it where deere workers in other countries have learned of the strike in the us the immediate response has been one of solidarity in mannheim germany deere workers last week voiced their support for the strike in the us recognizing they were fighting against similar issues in mannheim workers have been subjected to repeated rounds of layoffs with the company increasingly utilizing contract and temporary workers with virtually no job protections deere workers have already taken the first steps in establishing the john deere workers rank and file committee which has appealed to deere workers in other countries to join their fight rank and file committees must now be expanded to every deere factory and warehouse in the united states and across the world linking up with autoworkers volvo workers dana parts workers caterpillar and case workers and beyond taking up a global strategy to overturn the decades of corporate attacks

cracks are emerging in the global solar industry threatening to flatten its growth trajectory just as the world needs clean power more than ever the sector is being slammed by a barrage of obstacles with rising materials costs forced labor accusations and a worsening trade war all hitting at once as a result panel prices are rising for the first time in years and some manufacturers have asked buyers to delay purchases if they can and although annual installations are still ticking higher wall street warns the pace of expansion may slow sharply if those hurdles continue unchecked the shocks to the system in the last two to three months are more or less unprecedented said jenny chase an analyst with bloombergnef we need to get to net zero as soon as possible and to do that we just need so much solar and wind we re not on track we need to ramp all this stuff up dramatically these setbacks may only be temporary with delays in installations expected to be largely resolved by the end of 2022 when new solar factories help ease supply chain issues but any snag in the sector s rollout will have lasting effects with the emissions from the fossil fuels burned instead trapping heat in the atmosphere for decades solar provided just 3 3 of the world s electricity in 2020 bloombergnef estimates that to be on target for net zero by 2050 the world needs to add 455 gigawatts of solar every year through 2030 last year was a record and it only added 144 gigawatts the recent stumbles are hitting right before the united nations cop26 climate talks begin later this month viewed by many as a crucial and last ditch effort to curb global warming it was easy to be optimistic about solar coming into the year joe biden s ascendance to the presidency china s 2060 net zero pledge and europe s green deal meant that for the first time all three dominant economies supported an energy transition at the same time and thanks to decades of painstaking work by researchers and companies solar can now produce energy cheaper than fossil fuels in most of the world even the technology s achilles heel the sun doesn t always shine was on the way to being solved by improvements in batteries demand has mostly held up its end of the bargain but the supply chain hasn t been able to match it largely to blame is polysilicon an ultra conductive material that s refined in factories mostly in china using caustic chemicals and copious amounts of mostly coal derived energy and with demand for panel production so robust there isn t enough of it to go around as early as january boci research ltd analyst tony fei warned that polysilicon factories could only make enough of the material for 170 gigawatts of panels far less than some of the most bullish estimates were calling for his call proved prescient and prices of polysilicon quadrupled from mid 2020 to mid 2021 now a power crunch spurred by a shortage of coal has cut supplies of the metal used to make polysilicon sending prices even higher rising steel aluminum and freight costs are also adding up and solar panel prices are on track for their first annual price rise since 2013 those hurdles are starting to show up in analysts forecasts guggenheim securities llc just removed its buy rating on four solar stocks citing rising risks to 2022 revenue it says aren t yet reflected in consensus estimates earlier this month daiwa capital markets lowered its forecast for 2021 installations by 15 gigawatts more than enough clean energy to power every home in new jersey with that capacity delayed until next year morgan stanley and citigroup have both cautioned about near term panel demand in china the world s biggest solar market while the u s will grow its pace of installations just 3 2 next year after a 58 jump in 2021 says bloombergnef we think that input costs are starting to impact 2022 project timing guggenheim analysts joseph osha and hilary cauley wrote in a research note amid rising costs projects that looked marginal when contracts were signed now look unviable polysilicon is also at the center of a second controversy nearly half the world s supply is made in xinjiang a region in western china facing allegations of forced labor and human rights abuses against the ethnic uyghur muslim population there that hit the solar world in june when the biden administration blocked imports of materials made by hoshine silicon industry co which supplies feedstock material to several polysilicon makers u s customs agents soon began issuing withhold release orders wro to detain china linked solar panels at the border and the issue hasn t been resolved in the months since there s lots of uncertainty in the industry because they do not know how strict the wro enforcement will be or currently is said kelsey goss research analyst at wood mackenzie who specializes in global solar supply chain and technology shortly after the first detainments a second trade fissure opened between china and the u s when a group of unnamed solar companies appealed to the biden administration to extend obama era anti dumping tariffs on chinese solar panels to those made by chinese owned firms in thailand malaysia and vietnam where the u s gets nearly 80 of its panels the u s department of commerce has yet to decide whether it will even investigate the appeal but just the threat of the case has caused some companies to stop sending panels to the u s according to the solar energy industries association trade group this had an immediate chilling effect on the market said george hershman president of swinerton renewable energy manufacturers started to hold orders immediately china s five biggest panel makers which account for around half the world s supply last month asked customers in an open letter to delay purchases to avoid supply chain carnage now some u s solar construction companies have started sending workers home because there are no panels available according to roth capital partners of course it s not all doom and gloom with solar even with the price hikes solar panels are still cheaper now than they were in october 2018 and installations keep inching higher new polysilicon factories and an eventual end to china s power crunch promise to bring prices back down by 2023 at the latest and even amid all the hubbub solar companies continued to improve their technology and manufacturing efficiency this year promising continued cost improvements in the future not to mention that solar s biggest competitor fossil fuels are mired in their own supply issues that have sent coal and natural gas prices to record levels that s scant relief though for installers like india s gautam das trying to add solar capacity today das 47 who left his job as head of treasury products at citibank india to start solar developer oorjan cleantech in 2016 is projecting revenue to grow five fold this year but he s faced a hiccup recently when the price of modules in india jumped by about 20 the company took hits to its profit on some projects and shared the increased cost with customers on others for some developments he said there was no choice but to delay installation and hope prices fall in a few months which is bad news for both the customers and overall emissions as a country and as an entrepreneur i believe more solar is better and faster is better he said but a 20 jump in a month that s a big uncertainty and a big hindrance to solar adoption with assistance from brian eckhouse
the christmas season is two months away but if you plan to get all of your gifts on time experts say you should start shopping now this is largely in response to supply chain issues around the world at port milwaukee we won t see the backlog of container ships that s happening in california as port milwaukee does not handle containers but with so much of the nation s goods entering the u s through california the advice from supply chain experts is simple just don t wait from wage demands and vaccine mandates to labor shortages and shipping delays supply chain challenges are already impacting commerce beyond the holiday shopping season this year is definitely different said anna land associate professor of supply chain at uw whitewater sign up today get daily headlines breaking news emails from fox6 news it s why land says if you re able to do so try gift shopping a little early this year instead of waiting for black friday cyber monday or even later go ahead and start taking a look now because you might already see that items are already low in stock now well before christmas said land the national retail federation estimates 49 of holiday shoppers will start buying gifts before november 2021 up from 42 in 2020 land says another reason to shop early could be an expected jump in shipping costs due to container delays and not enough truck drivers to then transport those goods off shore retailers are trying to do everything they can to keep the prices down early on but we might expect shipping prices to continue to rise and they re going to likely pass on those costs to the consumer said land in fact major retailers have already begun offering their holiday sales to encourage early shopping in an all in effort to keep the shelves stocked this season manufacturers are rethinking the traditional just in time production and lean inventory because we re realizing the effects of that now said land land says if you re interested in a certain product try contacting the business to see what their shipping expectations are of course a trip to a physical store could alleviate that issue too featured article
hat do you get when you cross black friday deals with a continuing pandemic supply chain disruptions and inflation answer a very messy version of the biggest discount day of the year which happens annually on the day after thanksgiving this year that s nov 26 here are five predictions from retail experts about black friday 2021 plus how you can navigate the upcoming sales 1 supply chains will be stretched supply chain complications due to the pandemic have caused delays or shortages of items as varied as toys furniture and books companies may have to pivot their black friday selling strategies as a result retailers might focus on specific items rather than trying to have a huge range of everything says mathew isaac professor of marketing at seattle university as stores focus on getting the most in demand items on their shelves don t expect them to carry as many sizes styles or variations of everything else he adds this outcome could be a big change from the 50 page black friday advertisements we ve seen from big box retailers in the past 2 online sales will outpace in store sales black friday has been trending toward an online shopping day rather than an in person event that shift will only continue this year people are definitely going to be interested in black friday and excited about it but the bulk of the activity is going to be online says donna hoffman professor of marketing at the george washington school of business in washington d c that s my prediction shopping from home allows consumers to avoid crowds and stay safe during the pandemic it s also conducive to bargain hunting and price comparison offering a low stress way to browse multiple stores at the same time in pursuit of the best price i think this year compared to last year there s even more of a focus on budget hoffman adds those who do set foot in stores won t necessarily do so because they found a better deal there instead hoffman anticipates shoppers will go to stores if they re unable to find what they wanted in stock online but hoffman predicts that small businesses will attract in person shoppers particularly if that business has a sustainable mission 3 shoppers will get more sleep that shift to online shopping could have another side effect more sleep because of covid 19 stores no longer packed shoppers in during the wee hours of black friday last year sheri lambert assistant professor of marketing at temple university in philadelphia said by email many stores abandoned their late night thanksgiving hours last year and major retailers have already announced plans to stay closed this thanksgiving day as well after the changes that took hold last year lambert doesn t foresee the mad rush of in person shopping returning anytime soon so shoppers can sit back and make purchases from their couch or bed instead of having to camp out on the sidewalk in front of their local target or best buy 4 holiday shopping will be a marathon black friday sale events will start early and last for a long time according to lambert this marathon approach is similar to what happened last year when deals were offered throughout the entire month of november but unlike black friday events before the pandemic spread out savings opportunities don t mean shoppers should wait to shop in anticipation of better deals to come lambert said retailers are starting to communicate to consumers that they should start buying for the holiday season now in light of global shipping bottlenecks my number one tip shop now lambert said order that special gift for that special someone today and even then anticipate and expect the worst but hope for the best you might not be guaranteed to receive your purchases before christmas 5 persuasion will persist finally it wouldn t be black friday without a little bit of pressure remember retailers want you to buy that shiny new whatever it might be even if you don t necessarily need it isaac says retailers make a substantial percentage of their yearly revenues during this 75 to 90 day period so they re going to do everything they can to try to get you to shop as long as they have the product if you choose to shop during this year s unique version of black friday traditional shopping advice will still apply stay alert to persuasion tactics like good deals that reel you in and tempt you to act on other not so good deals aim to stick to a physical or mental list of things you actually need and make a budget before you buy a single thing this column was provided to the associated press by the personal finance website nerdwallet courtney jespersen is a writer at nerdwallet email courtneynerdwallet com twitter courtneynerd related link nerdwallet shopping guide how to get the best deals online
there are three reliable ways to get the average economist mad at you one is to make a derogatory comment about free trade another is to extol the benefits of raising the minimum wage the third is to say something nice about rent control the modern anti rent control crusade goes back to the mid 1940s just after a rent freeze was imposed on new york city apartments to deal with runaway price inflation during world war ii in 1946 renowned economists milton friedman and george stigler of the university of chicago published a paper they called they argued that controlling rents allowed landlords to neglect their units and resort to devious means to force their tenants out enabling rent increases friedman and stigler had a reasonable point to make about a rigid new york style rent ceiling but it didn t invalidate the idea of restricting property owners to modest annual increases in times of intense housing inflation nevertheless the friedman stigler doctrine quickly emerged as gospel among economists and especially among landlords who saw that it suited their profit making interests just fine eventually 37 states passed legislation prohibiting any form of rent regulation a poll in 1990 conducted by thereported that 93 percent of economists thought rent control was a serious mistake it s become almost a textbook cliché in any intro econ class you learn about why rent control is a bad idea in the words of j w mason an economics professor at the john jay college of criminal justice in new york who has devoted much of his career to challenging the conventional rent control wisdom but the anti rent control fortress may be showing a few cracks at a time when rent inflation is rampant again in affluent parts of the country americans now pay out an average of 37 percent of their monthly income on housing states and cities are looking at serious regulatory experiments oregon passed a state law in 2019 that provided for a limit on annual rent increases for apartments more than 15 years old the law also imposes tougher standards on eviction and holds that renovation of a unit is not an acceptable standard for tenant removal next month voters in minneapolis and st paul will decide whether to drop rent control restrictions the referendum in st paul is part of a campaign to cap annual increases at 3 percent on most units in the city in illinois a law that would repeal a 27 year old rent control ban is under consideration in the legislature altogether about 200 communities in the united states have some form of rent regulation in place most of them are in california new jersey and new york the original rent control law promulgated in new york city which froze rents at their existing levels was indeed the meataxe that friedman and stigler warned would depress new construction and it probably did but over the years it evolved into a stabilization program of modest allowable annual increases which in most recent years have averaged about 3 5 percent it came to apply only to older units and whenever most of these acquired a new tenant they switched from control to stabilization as of 2017 there were still about 20 000 apartments in new york under strict rent control but nearly a million in the stabilization program in 2019 the law was revised in a pro tenant direction denying landlords the right to jack up rents by 20 percent when an apartment acquired a new resident even a relatively strict law like the one in new york constitutes a strong argument against the idea that rent regulation retards new construction mason has written persuasively that it s hard to believe that builders are thinking twice about putting up new buildings because of rent stabilization when it hasn t applied to new buildings in nearly 40 years over whether rent regulation is a long term solution to urban housing inflation many of them revolve around the rent stabilization program enacted in cambridge mass in 1970 it was a tough law it imposed a strict monetary cap on increased rents for all the units in the city and restricted the removal of any unit from rental stock the provisions stayed in place for nearly a quarter century then were repealed in a statewide referendum in 1994 cambridge residents voted overwhelmingly to keep the law but it went down statewide by a 51 49 count since the cambridge law fell a succession of studies has sought to determine what the impact of that and other rent regulation regimes actually was the conclusions are not clear cut most of them have found no significant decline in new construction and have documented clear short term benefits for the tenants living under regulation although they detected an increase in conversion of apartments to condominiums slightly shrinking the number of units in the affordable category perhaps the most comprehensive study published in the in 2014 reported that the market value and rental costs of buildings rose 45 percent in cambridge after they were decontrolled for a total increase in property values of 2 billion in short the study s authors wrote the policy imposed 2 billion in costs to local property owners but only 300 million of that cost was transferred to renters in rent controlled apartments that might suggest that the burdens of rent regulation can be an acceptable price for the society to pay san francisco has lived under a rent regulation regime since 1979 it enacted tough limits outright ceilings on rents but it exempted new construction and buildings with five or fewer units although the five unit exemption was repealed in 1994 a study conducted in 2018 by three stanford university economists found that rent regulated buildings in san francisco were 8 percent more likely to convert to condominiums than unregulated buildings and that there had been a reduction of 25 percent in the number of renters living under regulation it also concluded that residents of the newly created condos had incomes 18 percent higher than their predecessors in short the study suggested that rent control was bringing more gentrification to san francisco adding to its continually rising costs of housing but given the sluggish condo market of the past few years condo conversion is not the threat to regulated apartments that it may have been earlier in this decade the condo market nationwide clearly failed to keep pace with rental prices in 2020 condos may be coming back a bit this year but the contention that landlords will flock to condo conversion to escape the strictures of rent regulation seems a bit out of date and even with some 60 percent of san francisco s apartments under some form of regulation the rents remain startlingly high the average rent on a one bedroom unit in the city earlier this year was more than 2 800 that can be treated as evidence that rent regulation isn t working very well or it can be seen as evidence that things would be much worse without it and that this is no time to take it away for how to deal with galloping rent inflation one would be for local governments to simply subsidize the rent payments of tenants with low incomes another would be to provide the tenants with a new rental tax credit both of those would come out of the public treasury and would impose on it a significant fiscal burden they would also likely prove less attractive to voters than taking a chunk out of landlords substantial profits the voters would have a point but the most compelling case for rent regulation goes beyond the research and the statistics it is that continuity and stability are vital elements of any neighborhood s social health they are weapons against the alienation and loneliness that prevail in any community in which nothing not personal relationships nor physical familiarity ever seems permanent j w mason put it eloquently a couple of years ago i don t see security of tenure for renters as charity for the needy he wrote but as a basic feature of a civilized country i can t say it better than that most economists don t get this and never will because they can t slap a number on it you may remember the old joke about the two economics professors one a fresh faced novice and the other a tenured veteran the novice comes up with a promising new idea the older man sneers at him that may be all right in practice he says but it will never work in theory ok it s a joke but it s also a reminder not to take economists too seriously when they start talking about things like the regulation of rent
some of the world s biggest companies are betting consumers will keep paying more for products from coffee to toilet paper corporate giants including procter gamble co nestlé sa and verizon communications inc say they plan to continue raising prices or pushing customers to buy more expensive products into 2022 to offset fast growing costs amid a global supply chain crisis gillette razors nestlé coffee and chipotle burritos are among the products that could get more expensive in coming months price increases so far have paid off for makers of household staples as shoppers particularly in the u s and western europe have remained loyal to big name brands now companies are counting on customers to lift sales and offset higher costs that have stressed their bottom lines even as broader inflationary pressures mount and some analysts question whether shoppers will start to seek cheaper alternatives we have not seen any material reaction from consumers p g finance chief andre schulten said last week referring to a string of price increases that went into effect in september so that makes us feel good about our relative position yellen says americans haven t experienced current inflation rate in a long time many consumers accumulated savings amid the pandemic and are benefiting from higher wages leaving them with extra cash as the highly contagious delta variant of the

which will go into effect over the next few months and told investors to expect profitability to accelerate as the year progresses nestlé the world s largest packaged food company raised its full year guidance for the second straight quarter as consumers continued to drink more and better coffee at home even as pandemic restrictions ease chipotle mexican grill inc said price increases haven t turned people off its burritos higher menu prices helped net income more than double in the most recent quarter compared with a year before despite higher labor and commodity costs chipotle could combat inflation with more menu price increases at t inc and verizon the nation s top cellphone carriers both told investors that their revenue growth would pick up this year partly by persuading users to trade up to premium plans bundled with streaming media subscriptions or other perks like low cost iphones analysts questioned whether nestlé s confidence in demand for pricey coffee is overblown others wondered if p g s market share gains will erode or reverse as more of its price increases kick in and as consumers become increasingly pinched by inflation both companies reiterated their confidence nestlé said its coffee category is its biggest contributor to growth with its nescafé nespresso and starbucks brands all growing p g said investments the company has made over the years into higher quality products with new features such as new razorblades and handles and softer toilet paper will keep consumers paying higher prices even if household budgets tighten u s inflation accelerated in september the consumer price index which measures what consumers pay for goods and services rose by 5 4 from a year earlier matching its highest rate in over a decade the labor department said many economists expect this stretch of higher inflation to linger as some of the stimulus fades and people start paying their rents pricing is going to be more of an issue said nik modi an analyst with rbc capital markets inflation will undermine us economy growth over time thomas hoenig mr modi said big companies with well known brands will more likely succeed in raising prices than budget or smaller brands in any given category because they are better able to keep products in stock and shoppers often see well known names as a safer bet i don t see what else we can do besides just paying it said lawrence tam 43 years old of houston he said he became alarmed by an increase in meat prices the cost of bacon has doubled recently at his local grocery store but mr tam who runs a ketogenic diet group said that while he has begun seeking out discounted meat he and his wife aren t likely to make major changes on other household items we re seeing price increases that are quite shocking yet consumers have absorbed these prices without a dip in demand said ben reich chief executive of datasembly which amasses granular pricing data on a range of consumer goods price increases at u s grocers rose 1 18 on average in september compared with a year ago nearly three times the average increase at the start of 2021 according to the firm which this week plans to launch a

kimberly clark corp put their increases into effect procter gamble combats inflation with price hikes in most categories a misfire on pricing can be costly in 2019 clorox co raised prices on glad trash bags retailers pushed back and stocked rival offerings denting the company s sales and giving an advantage to glad s chief rival reynolds consumer products inc s hefty brand which added capacity to meet growing demand companies weigh several factors when deciding price a key determinant whether rivals are likely to follow suit company leaders say the fact that costs are rising across the board for labor shipping and raw materials is giving them confidence that they won t be undercut by competitors technology and artificial intelligence is enabling retailers to set pricing in a more targeted manner for instance they know which shoppers buy only on sale and so might offer those people discounts shoppers who tend to buy at full price won t get the discount a price increase by a manufacturer might not be immediately evident to consumers get fox business on the go by clicking here often companies might increase prices by shrinking package sizes or paring back deals rather than make a straightforward increase on a given item retailers don t always pass along increases to consumers the biggest u s grocers say they have been insulating consumers from price increases but that is starting to change kroger co and albertsons cos both said they would begin passing more costs along to shoppers to protect their own profitability we ve been very comfortable with our ability to pass on the increases that we ve seen at this point kroger finance chief gary millerchip said in a recent call with analysts and we would expect that to continue to be the case

cest t he trial did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival the prespecified subgroup of patients treated with eryaspase and an irinotecan based chemotherapy demonstrated a n interesting trend of survival benefit which merits further investigation patients treated with eryaspase demonstrated superior disease control compared to patients treated with chemotherapy only other secondary endpoints showed nominal improvement the safety profile of eryaspase was consistent with earlier clinical trials results and safety reviews e rytech will now focus on its late stage program in hypersensitive all and confirms its inten tion to submit a bla before the end of the year erytech will review strategic and partnering alternatives including for the further development and commercialization of eryaspase cambridge ma u s and lyon france october 25 2021 erytech pharma nasdaq euronext eryp a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies by encapsulating therapeutic drug substances inside red blood cells today announced top line results from its phase 3 trybeca 1 clinical trial evaluating eryaspase as second line treatment in 512 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival os in the trybeca 1 trial eryaspase demonstrated an improvement in the primary endpoint of os compared to chemotherapy alone with a hazard ratio hr of 0 92 95 confidence interval ci 0 76 1 11 in the intent to treat population and the difference was not statistically significant p value 0 375 the median os for patients treated with eryaspase plus chemotherapy was 7 5 months 95 ci 6 5 8 3 compared to 6 7 months 95 ci 5 4 7 5 for chemotherapy alone interestingly while the patients treated with gemcitabine plus nabpaclitaxel did not experience a survival benefit from the addition of eryaspase patients treated with eryaspase and an irinotecan based chemotherapy regimen showed nominal survival benefit with a hr of 0 77 95 ci 5 7 1 05 over those treated with chemotherapy alone this prespecified subgroup had a median os of 8 0 months in the eryaspase treated arm versus 5 7 months in the control arm per protocol population key secondary endpoints of the trial including progression free survival disease control rate and objective response rate showed benefit in favor of eryaspase the safety profile of eryaspase observed in the trybeca 1 trial was consistent with earlier observations and previous safety reviews by the trial s independent data monitoring committee idmc further analysis of the data will be performed and full results will be presented at an upcoming medical conference erytech will now focus on its late stage program in acute lymphoblastic leukemia all and pursue a path to approval in hypersensitive all based on positive results of nopho sponsored phase 2 trial the company reiterates its intention to submit a bla before the end of the year while the results are disappointing we congratulate the company for a very well managed trial in this difficult disease with a median survival of 7 5 months erytech has created a new reference standard for clinical evaluation in second line pancreatic cancer said prof pascal hammel md phd gastroenterologist oncologist at beaujon hospital in paris and co principal investigator of the trybeca 1 trial i agree with prof hammel and want to add that the results in the subgroup of fluoropyrimidine based treatments are with a median survival of 8 months really remarkable and merit further investigation especially since this was also the better subgroup in the phase 2b trial said prof manuel hidalgo m d ph d weill cornell medicine newyork presbyterian hospital and co principal investigator of the study pancreatic cancer is a very challenging heterogeneous disease and the results of the trybeca 1 phase 3 trial have now also encountered this significant hurdle said dr iman el hariry chief medical officer of erytech it is very disappointing that the clinical benefit eryaspase demonstrated in the phase 2 trial was not confirmed however the study has addressed important questions in the management of pancreatic cancer patients i want to thank the patients their families and healthcare providers our vendors as well as our colleagues at erytech who overcame many obstacles including the covid 19 pandemic to execute this important trial targeting the altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism of cancer cells well established in all remains an important field of development also for the field of solid tumors the erytech team along with its clinical advisors will review the full data analyses including the secondary and exploratory endpoints and provide a more detailed update on additional subgroup analysis after these are completed these results are highly disappointing not only for the erytech team but also for patients and healthcare providers as there continues to be a major unmet medical need in pancreatic cancer added gil beyen ceo of erytech we continue to believe in the potential of cancer metabolism and our erycaps platform to treat aggressive forms of cancer and will while evaluating the potential to continue the development in pancreatic cancer now continue to focus on seeking approval of eryaspase for all patients who developed hypersensitivity to pegylated asparaginase this is also an important medical need and a potentially attractive market opportunity for eryaspase we confirm our previously announced intention to submit a bla for this indication by year end 2021 we will evaluate our strategic and partnering options in the coming weeks and will provide updated guidance on our global corporate strategy later in the year trybeca 1 top

by jarrett renshaw reuters u s democrats are expected to unveil a tax plan on monday that would seek to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from the country s roughly 700 billionaires to help pay for expanding the social safety net and tackling climate change democrats were forced to shift to the unorthodox plan in the face of opposition from one of their own senators kyrsten sinema to raising the corporate tax rate and the top personal income tax rate to pay for the hefty spending plan which is a pillar of democratic president joe biden s domestic agenda the party is putting together the final details of the plan which is likely to come in at between 1 5 trillion and 2 trillion the progressive wing of the party had wanted a much bigger plan but opposition from sinema and fellow democratic senator joe manchin required the white house to make concessions and cut the overall cost democrats have argued for higher income and corporate tax rates for years saying wealthy americans and companies should pay more to fund new social benefits but their struggle to enact such measures underscores the challenges the party faces currently rich americans do not have to pay taxes on their accumulations of wealth such as real estate stocks and artwork because they are taxed only when an asset is sold under the billionaire income tax proposal the federal government would require billionaires to pay taxes on the increased value of assets such as stocks on an annual basis regardless of whether they sell those assets they could also take deductions for any annual loss in value of those assets the plan has the backing of the white house u s treasury secretary janet yellen on sunday rejected calling the measure a wealth tax it s not a wealth tax but a tax on unrealized capital gains of exceptionally wealthy individuals yellen said during an interview on cnn critics of the plan say it will force billionaires to retreat from the stock market where valuating assets is easier and into more opaque markets such as real estate and art house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi said on sunday the plan has plenty of appeal but that it may only bring in 200 billion to 250 billion requiring fellow democrats to rely on other revenue raisers to fully pay for their plan the billionaires tax has an appeal but it doesn t produce that much money she told cnn pelosi said lawmakers have an array of other options to fund the spending bill even without the corporate tax rate hike including better tax enforcement and international tax harmonization biden administration officials have said they are confident congress will approve legislation to implement a global corporate minimum tax agreed to by 136 countries reporting by jarrett renshaw editing by peter cooney
bloomberg mining industry veteran malcolm norris says he s struck upon a gold copper resource in northern ecuador that may make the world s resources giants sit up and take notice norris has seen a surge in interest from institutional investors in the el palmar project since his exploration company sunstone metals ltd disclosed a significant discovery to the australian stock exchange on oct 7 that s reflected in the share price which has risen almost threefold from its closing level on oct 6 the opportunity to deliver a large discovery is there it just requires more drilling from us norris said in a phone interview from the company s base in brisbane i would expect that if we make the discovery that we think we ve got then it will be of interest to quite a few of the majors global miners are on the hunt to meet surging demand for metals such as copper and nickel which are expected to drive the world s transition to clean energy in a sign of the importance of locking in resources bhp group is in talks about buying into a copper project in the democratic republic of the congo marking a dramatic departure from the world s biggest mining company s policy of shunning risky jurisdictions sunstone s find is located close to the cascabel copper gold prospect being developed by solgold plc which includes bhp and gold major newcrest mining ltd among its major stakeholders norris was managing director of solgold when it made the cascabel discovery and his confidence in el palmar stems from it being part of the same geological belt norris will be aware of the risks in operating in developing nations he led a team at intrepid mines which unearthed the giant tujuh bukit copper gold deposit in indonesia only to see intrepid lose control of its 80 stake in the project in 2012 to a local company still norris sought to dispel any perception of ecuador as politically unstable saying such a view was outdated president guillermo lasso who came to power in may is a former banker who supports mining ecuador needs to grow its economy and he can see that the mining industry can significantly improve gdp norris said mining operations can face strong local opposition in the south american nation and sunstone is looking to avoid that by providing jobs and supply contracts to people and businesses near the project located 60 kilometers 37 miles north of the capital quito the government has said it wants four new metals mines including cascabel to begin production by 2025 el palmar will take a little longer but norris said further drilling would give a clearer picture on the scale of the resource by mid 2022 meanwhile if sunstone can prove that the project holds commercial quantities of both gold and copper it can increase the attraction to would be developers he added 2021 bloomberg l p
a gmc sierra 1500 pickup on the assembly line at the general motors fort wayne assembly plant in roanoke indiana the shortage of semiconductors has led to a shutdown of production of the popular truck ryan hake general motors tns gmc is on track to hit record sales of its sierra heavy duty and light duty pickups this year despite continued thin inventory amid a global shortage of semiconductor chips the scarcity of chips which are used in a variety of vehicle parts has crippled auto industry production but general motors has managed to keep its truck plants running for the most part throughout the crisis we ve done very well we believe we can still have an all time sales record on the sierra duncan aldred global vice president of buick gmc told reporters tuesday when we get chips we generally put them in sierra and yukons and we ve managed quite well through that chip shortage this year we expect an improvement next year by year end gm expects to restart its oshawa assembly plant in ontario where it will assemble sierra and chevrolet silverado pickups gm currently builds the vehicles in three other plants in north america but aldred warned that gmc dealers will still operate on a deliver to order basis for pickups because demand will outpace supply for a while despite the chip challenges aldred said as of tuesday more than half of gmc dealers have signed up to install electric vehicle chargers and pay for other equipment needed to sell the 2022 gmc hummer ev pickup that is on schedule to arrive to market by year end speed selling sierras at sellers buick gmc in farmington mich owner sam slaughter said his store is selling sierra pickups at the fastest pace he s seen in recent history we re selling every one we get and most of them are presold because people want to tag whatever sierra they can get slaughter told the detroit free press most of them are at4 denali and elevation the higher end trims the 2021 sierra at4 light duty pickup starts at 54 700 the denali at 55 800 and the elevation at 43 100 in the third quarter gmc s sales of light duty and heavy duty sierra pickups combined were down 22 to 52 774 compared with the year ago quarter but for the nine months ending in september total sierra sales were up almost 10 at 191 186 compared with the year ago period for the full year 2020 gmc sold 253 016 total sierra pickups a 9 gain over 2019 according to gm the next biggest seller in gmc s line is the yukon which had a 24 sales gain in the third quarter to 17 428 through september yukon sales are up a whopping 55 to 59 743 vehicle for all customers the chip shortage is in part a result of the covid 19 pandemic when demand rose for personal electronics which require the chips chip makers prioritized production to that industry over the less profitable chips that go into car parts gm and its cross town rivals ford motor co and stellantis each have had to pause production or build vehicles just short of the chips parts and then wait for the parts to arrive before completing the vehicles consulting firm alixpartners in southfield mich has forecast that automakers will lose production of 7 7 million vehicles this year and it will cost the global auto industry 210 billion in revenues most dealership lots are barren of new cars customers face long waits and higher prices still aldred said gmc will not cut production of lower trim models which are less profitable to streamline production i think we re through that phase if you re on a plan to deliver an all time sales year aldred said a core part of our mission is to provide a vehicle for all customers hand to mouth aldred said he foresees chip availability improving next year helping boost production of a variety of trim levels gm builds its light duty sierra and silverado pickups at fort wayne assembly in indiana and silao assembly plant in mexico it builds the heavy duty versions at flint assembly by year end gm will fire up oshawa assembly but aldred declined to provide how much more volume gmc will get from oshawa i won t put a number on it but an extra plant capacity for heavy duty and light duty trucks is a huge benefit for both gmc and chevy aldred said we re basically operating on no physical inventory of the heavy duty and light duty sierra right now and operating on a deliver to order model but even with the additional capacity we won t be able to build stock on the ground for dealers that s because demand for pickups will outpace production slaughter said customers have been patient but he has likely lost some business to a rival dealer who had a vehicle in stock that he did not then again he s probably won business from others for that same reason he said i don t know when we ll see more volume said slaughter who also owns sellers subaru in macomb township mich at subaru and gmc we re literally hand to mouth every month selling everything we can hummer ready early tuesday morning a crew was busy installing more charging stations at sellers buick gmc store which already has two chargers the dealership will have five chargers in total along with a special lift for its service bay next month it s all in preparation to sell the 2022 hummer ev and 2023 hummer ev suv when they arrive in two years we have about half a dozen of the first edition hummers coming in but no firm dates slaughter said we re told sometime in the next two to three months gm did a preorder so they are already sold we have orders in for the non first edition the regular hummer and a bunch of orders for the suv coming in 2023 aldred said more than half of gmc s u s dealerships have signed up to sell hummer evs like slaughter they are in the process of upgrading their facilities to do so gmc has assigned upgrades in phases based on the production ramp up of the hummer being built at factory zero in detroit and hamtramck some dealers won t get their hummer until sometime next year for example so no need for the dealer to spend the money to be ready for it now aldred said everyone s absolutely on track and every dealer will be ready before they receive their hummer 2020 gmc sierra 2500 hd denali

before there was a wwe network a brand split monthly ppvs and a nxt the wwe then called wwf used to have weekly shows that would air on network television in various timeslots depending on the market here in philadelphia it was wwf superstars on saturday mornings and wwf wrestling challenge on sunday mornings then depending on if you had the old school satellite dishes you could pick up a shows from west philadelphia on a channel once called prism and madison square garden shows on a feed that was called msg these shows would often have top talents going against the classic jobber and sometimes there would be a feature match which would be like a main event between two mid carders or a top guy against one of the tough jobbers and those tough jobbers are who we re going to focus on here in this article why because even though they were jobbers some of them do have very memorable moments and stand out more than just your regular ham and egger so who are these tough jobbers frankie williams now frankie williams was your typical whipping boy he was usually a face jobber meaning he would go in there and take abuse from the likes of mr wonderful paul orndorff and the magnificent morocco he was one of the not so tough jobbers but i needed to add him here because he was involved in what i consider to be a definite top 5 all time piper s pit segments i ll never forget it after a verbal berating by piper as only he could frankie williams decided to stand up for himself i might not win every match but i m always in that ring piper responded with oh yeah and proceeded to beat him unmercifully all over the set poor frankie jose louis rivera i m sure if you really look at him he was probably very talented he was in decent shape meaning he didn t look like the stock boy at the local supermarket like some jobbers did he didn t have a designation meaning he would go against faces and heels he never stood much of a chance but he at least got to start the matches off with an arm drag and a hip toss or two and an arm bar before taking his beating he never really did anything memorable that i can see but he was a weekly fixture on just about every show that took place in philadelphia george wells this guy was my favorite tough jobber growing up he was one of very few jobbers that would start off with some moves take his beating and actually make a brief comeback he was also often in tag team matches against top tag teams he would be paired with a total tomato can jobber he would start the match control things until he tagged in his supermarket stock boy partner and then that partner would take serious abuse and wells would usually never make it back into the match one of the biggest standouts was his match with jake the snake at wrestlemania 2 it was a competitive match but he suffered a defeat after a vintage jake the snake ddt after the match roberts put damien on him and the snake wrapped around wells neck and he sold the choking very well with foam coming out of his mouth great stuff unpredictable johnny rodz he wasn t always a jobber for a short time he had matches with some of the top stars of the 80s in some of the top venues around the country after his short stint doing battle with the likes of hulk hogan bob backlund and ivan putski he went into full jobber he was a heel jobber so he battled the faces often using dirty tactics to gain an advantage before eventually succumbing to the top star s series of moves for the win and the cheers the brooklyn brawler probably the most popular of all the jobbers steve lombardi was your typical squash jobber early in his career before being upgraded to tough jobber he would even pick up a few wins along the way when facing other jobbers of a lesser stature he also formed an alliance with our next jobber at one point to form a jobber tag team eventually in a storyline involving bobby heenan and the red rooster steve lombardi showed up as the brooklyn brawler the man that everyone knows today he then became a low mid carder but it was short lived and he eventually slipped back down into jobber status where he would remain for the rest of his career the most notable moment comes from my own memory when he did battle with shawn michaels who just returned as was a big time baby face michaels hit him with sweet chin music on the outside of the ring and stood outside and counted to ten with ref for a double count out barry horowitz probably very close to the brooklyn brawler in notoriety as far as jobbers go he was another heel jobber that would put on somewhat competitive matches in his time he often wrestled in both singles and tag team matches he was most well known for patting himself on the back as a taunt in the mid nineties right before the jobber era as we knew it before came to an end he found success when on a televised show he pulled off the upset win over skip of the bodydonnas complete with good ol jr s call of horowitz wins horowitz wins it led to somewhat of a promotion for barry he got entrance music and a tiny babyface push even though he lost often to the top guys following his winning feud over skip but by this point the standard jobbers like the ones mentioned above were few and far between iron mike sharpe nothing is better than a jobber with some distinguishing characteristics barry horowitz patted himself on the back brookyn brawler has his dirty yankee shirt that was full of holes iron mike is another one of these unique jobbers that stood out from the other tomato cans like joe baker or tommy reynolds i just made them up his arm brace that he insisted was used as protection from an injury and his constant yells throughout the match make him a unique heel jobber that was very entertaining to watch he was originally brought in as main player but it didn t last long and he was a jobber ever since he did pick up a win in 88 over boris zhukov in the first round of a king of the ring tournament he left in 95 right around the time the standard jobbers were being phased out leaping lanny poffo the brother of macho man randy savage leaping lanny poffo was probably the most unique of all jobbers he was actually a bit of a step above jobbers because he would beat other jobbers he was a solid babyface character for most of his wwf career he would recite poems taunting his opponents he was also unique in that he would get a good amount of offense for a jobber and would nearly pick up victories in the process his finisher was a moonsault before the moonsault was something you saw regularly he did turn heel at one point and became the genius his poems would rip the crowd and the face opponents his claim to fame is a countout victory over wwf champ hulk hogan thanks to interference from mr perfect they then stole the belt and destroyed it s d jones s d special delivery jones is probably the ultimate tough jobber much like leaping lanny poffo s d would get considerable offense in and nearly pick up victories over some of the top heels in the company he was also involved in some very memorable moments of the 80 s such as being andre the giant s partner when ken patera and big john studd knocked andre out and cut his hair he was also in a match at the very first wrestlemania where he lost to king kong bundy in 9 seconds a record that wasn t broken until the rock defeated eric rowan in 6 seconds at last year s wrestlemania s d jones was definitely top of the line when it came to jobbers he even had a doll in the original ljn collection i know there are probably some others i missed out on and i know nwa wcw had their own set of tough jobbers like the armstrongs and such but i wanted to limit this to 80s and early 90s wwf it was actually quite fun and insightful does everyone remember the guys on my list do you have any ideas of people i missed out on thanks for reading everyone this will be my last article until the new year so have a safe and happy holiday
