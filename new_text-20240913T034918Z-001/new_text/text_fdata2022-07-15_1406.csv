that lower demand will push interest rates down when the employment rate improves demand for mortgages will likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and interest rates tend to follow federal reserve system the fed as it s commonly called is

there have been at least 214 mass shootings in the united states so far this year the most recent being the killings during a july 4 gathering in highland park ill this year we have also been both riveted and horrified by the massacre of 21 people 19 of them children in uvalde texas a crazed racist killed 10 black people and wounded at least three others when he shot up a tops grocery store in buffalo n y in 2022 there have been more shootings than days the shootings have become commonplace the biden administration and concerned legislators have done what they can to restrict gun ownership given our nation s gun culture and our combatively divided senate there is a new gun safety law and some survivors of mass shootings joined him at the white house to celebrate the legislation yet even after congress passed the law we learned that the new law would not have prevented the highland park shootings as the 18 year old man who did the shootings legally purchased the assault weapon he used the families of victims are tired of people offering thoughts and prayers they want action the safer communities act passed on a bipartisan basis lastmonth isastepintheright direction but it doesn t go far enough we need to use economic tools or inject economics into the conversation about gun safety those of us who are disgusted by mass shootings and the violence that plagues our inner cities may have some weapons at our disposal to punish those who participate in and encourage our gun culture those of us with stock portfolios must insist that our money managers avoid stocks like smith and wesson swbi which produced more than 1 5 million guns in 2020 if more people who say they hate gun violence stopped investing in gun manufacturing companies perhaps these companies would rethink their manufacturing marketing and lobbying gun ownership has been cleverly marketed with companies using buzzwords like safety to encourage gun purchases those who are survivors of gun violence and their families should sue the gun manufacturers who produce the deadly weapons that make massacres possible earlier this year remington rgm agreed to pay the families of the 2012 sandy hook shooting where 20 children and six educators were killed it took a decade between the shootings and the lawsuit settlement so the families must be commended for their persistence the families of victims in uvalde buffalo and highland park should consider pursuing similar lawsuits to punish those companies that flood deadly weapons into the public those who facilitate the gun possession of young shooters shouldalsobesued inthe highland park case the shooter s father bobby crimo said he d done nothing wrong in signing his son s gun permit application from all indications his son bobby crimo jr was troubled he d once threatened to kill his family sparking a police investigation and yet his dad signs for a gun permit sue him if those who mindlessly sign gun permits understand that there are financial consequences to their actions they might think again some will say that mr crimo and some of the other shooters were adults i say if you facilitated the gun purchase you have to pay for it we also can use our tax or surcharge system to restrict the distribution of ammunition comedian chris rock had it right when he said in 2009 you don t need no gun control you know what you need we need some bullet control i think all bullets should cost 5 000 5 000 per bullet you know why cause if a bullet cost 5 000 there would be no more innocent bystanders every time somebody got shot we d say he must have done something he s got 50 000 worth of bullets in his behind even if you get shot by a stray bullet you wouldn t have to go to no doctor to get it taken out whoever shot you would take their bullet back like i believe you got my property chris rock might have been joking but i m not we use our tax system to encourage or discourage specific behavior or to cover the costs of such behavior we use gas taxes to maintain roads we impose cigarette and alcohol taxes to discourage consumption why not tax bullets or mandate a surcharge to discourage their use if we want to slow or stop gun violence economic tools might well be the answer the writer is an economist author and dean of the college of ethnic studies at cal state
a government advisory panel is urging the health ministry to allow the online sales of authorized covid 19 antigen test kits in japan much like in the united states and in some european countries the government s council for the promotion of regulatory reform on may 27 compiled a list of recommendations to ease sales regulations for antigen test kits that have received regulatory approval for use in japan in the proposals the council asked the ministry to decide by the end of september whether to lift its ban on selling the test kits online the ministry initially limited authorized antigen test kit sales to medical institutions barring the public from buying them even at pharmacies as a result many unauthorized kits for research use began circulating online in september the ministry made an exception to its policy to allow pharmacies to sell authorized antigen test kits through pharmacists in response to requests from the regulatory reform council for easier access to the test kits however allowing pharmacies to sell antigen test kits is far from enough taro kono who was the administrative reform minister at the time said after the health ministry s policy change it s been a while since the pandemic hit japan yet the ministry still hasn t implemented necessary regulatory reform he said unlike time consuming and expensive polymerase chain reaction pcr tests antigen test kits are much easier to use and produce results in about 15 minutes the kits also allow users to check for the novel coronavirus even at home antigen test kits are less accurate than the pcr method but they are considered an effective means to keep the spread of the virus in check amid a further easing of restrictions on social and economic activities such kits are offered online in many parts of the united states and europe and they are available for free in some regions the test kits are not readily available yet to anyone in japan who wants them however the ministry decided to continue discussing whether to allow people to buy authorized antigen test kits online or at pharmacies regardless of the presence of pharmacists it has yet to reach a conclusion however at the regulatory reform council s meeting in november a ministry official insisted pharmacists explain in person to antigen test kit buyers that they should see a doctor if they test positive continue taking anti virus measures even if they test negative and make sure they understand how to use the kits the official cited concerns that asymptomatic covid 19 patients could transmit the virus to others after getting false negative results from antigen test kits which are less accurate in detecting such infections karen makishima the current administrative reform minister expressed strong opposition to the ministry s policy however saying she cannot see the need to require pharmacists to give in person instructions to those buying the kits if instructions are needed why not attach a qr code to each test kit and ask all members of the public to watch a video via the code to learn how to use the kits makishima said the ministry is also concerned that a further easing of sales regulations could cause a test kit shortage such concerns were not shared with manufacturers surveyed by the regulatory reform council s secretariat however if more test kits are sold we will be able to anticipate stable demand regardless of changes in infection trends said one respondent that allows us to stock up on materials and retain the factory personnel needed to manufacture the kits the respondent said the maker currently terminates temporary worker contracts at its factories manufacturing the kits once a wave of infections subsides still the ministry is reluctant to abolish sales regulations to give easier access to the test kits fearing that could make even those with symptoms choose not to see a doctor to confirm the results of their antigen tests a senior ministry official said the issue is sensitive because it concerns the basis of the medical practitioners law which stipulates that only doctors can diagnose diseases some regulatory reform council members suspect the ministry wants to avoid drawing opposition from the japan medical association which has many practitioners as its members antigen tests are also being used to diagnose cases of the flu and many other diseases the ministry is probably worried that a further easing of the regulations on selling covid 19 antigen test kits could spark debate on similar deregulations of testing for other illnesses said a government source this article was written by akiyoshi abe and kai ichino
hear the entire interview at bogleheads live my name is john luskin i m your host our guest today is barry ritholtz today i ll rotate between asking very questions that i got beforehand from the forum at bogleheads org and taking live audience question from the folks here today let s start by talking about the bogleheads a community of investors who believe in keeping it simple following a small number of tried and true investing principles you can learn more at the john c bogle center for financial literacy at boglecenter net on today s show with barry ritholtz an american author blogger newspaper columnist market analyst and chief investment officer at rwm and the host of bloomberg s masters in business podcast hey john thanks so much for having me i ve been looking forward to this what should bogle heads know about the cognitive and behavioral side of investing what should bogle heads know well well let s go back to first principles and talk about some of the things that john bogle recognized so early he very much realized how much of investing is just completely out of your control what the fed does who the president is what congress does what s going on in the economy whether the market decides to go down 20 for the first half of the year you can t control any of those things but what you can control is your own behavior how do you respond to inputs how do you respond to stimulus which could be thrilling exciting terrifying or nauseating you are you greedy when the market s going higher do you panic when the market s going low lower does your limbic system control you or do you control it those are going to have a much bigger impact on your long term success as an investor then whether or not you re picking this stock or that or even this index fund or that you could have the best set of holdings in the world but if at the first sign of trouble you get panicked out of the markets it s not going to do you any good and i feel sort of silly saying this to the bogleheads because if any group of investors has understood this internalized it and walked the walk it s you guys we have all the data from vanguard about how their investors behaved in 2020 and in 08 09 people who follow the teachings of jack bogle very clearly have their behavioral side under control and david you are live to ask your question thank you very much i truly admire your podcast i ve listened to for for years it s spectacular so thank you so much for doing that and you know given your expertise and your experience in the network you ve developed over the years in terms of interviewing you asset managers you know people like jackbogle i m wondering where you think this industry is going to go over the next 10 years and i ll tell you what kind of got me thinking about this more deeply was a book called the bogle effect where it kind of paints a picture that the mutual ownership structure that vanguard uses it s just very very difficult to replicate thank you sure very fair question although a lot of it is speculation on my part the book the bogle effect is by a friend of mine eric balchunas who i have him coming on the podcast i think next month the book was really a lot of fun so the industry has been going through all these really fascinating changes and a lot of these changes have been a long time coming there just overwhelming trends that have been developing momentum for forever and sometimes it s the old joke from hemingway how did you go bankrupt gradually at first and then all at once indexing is one of those things that it just gradually gradually gradually was slowly gaining ground and then boom after oh 08 09 it just exploded my pet theory is that given all the scandals in the early two thousands the analyst scandal the ipo scandal the accounting scandals people just finally said why are we playing this game let s just you know take our ball and go home and and by ball i mean money and home i mean vanguard that s how indexing went from this sort of interesting academically supported niche to now half of the mutual funds and half of the etfs more than half are managed via passive indexes which by the way is a very misleading misleading datapoint because when you look at mutual funds and etfs they re actually a fraction of all the assets that are managed out there the vast majority of assets and let s just hold aside commodities and real estate but the vast majority of stocks and bonds are still managed actively it s just the mutual funds and etfs where we see the passive approach really winning you re starting to see more and more institutions move at least a portion of their portfolio in that direction i think that s going to continue the thing that s really fascinating is some of the pushback to low cost passive indexing as an approach i did a couple of columns with bloomberg where i got to mock the people who called indexing socialist marxist unamerican a threat to the economy a threat to the stability of the stock market just every nonsensical thing you could come up with my favorite bit of nonsense was the white paper by a bunch of law professors who used the airline industry to prove that look it s an antitrust violation having all this indexing going on talk about cherry picking data why use airlines a notoriously small frequently bankrupt often consolidated industry to show indexing as a problem how about the giant technology space why don t you use that is it because prices have been coming down for all of their products it s more competitive how about finance same thing how about the manufacturing industry same thing and so you you go through all these hired guns either retained or motivated by a higher cost active managers to take a swing at indexing my concern is that you start to see the relentless parade of slings and arrows eventually start to have an effect hey barry great to speak to you i ve been a huge fan i listen to all the podcasts my question to you is at what point does passive indexing become counter productive it is such a great value add for the average mom and pop investor at what point do you say everybody passively investing is not a good idea or do you reach that point great great question i ll give you a two part answer the first is over at mit andrew lo actually looked at this question to find out at what point does the lack of analysts community research stock picking effort stock selection affect price discovery and his conclusion was well over 90 once passive indexing gets over 90 we can see a decrease in price discovery and market efficiency so that s his guess and his guess is much better than my guess the second part is something i would borrow from george soros the idea of reflexivity one of the fascinating things about markets and one of the reasons it s so impossible to do any sort of long term forecasting is that every print every price every day we get market numbers and that affects subsequent reactions of other participants in the market so so here we are it s half of mutual funds and etfs or something like 12 or 15 of all equities but whatever it is think about how the dynamic around stock selection is going to change once 50 60 70 of the stock buyers are just blind index purchasers one would think then the stock pickers or maybe even market timers had an edge that they could gain over the broad index when there are fewer and fewer people competing in the stock picking world and more and more people just throwing money at the index one would imagine that that would create an environment where stock pickers do better that concept of there s less competition as more and more people are buying passive the theory is that there ll be more opportunities there ll be more inefficiencies and they ll be easier to identify and then what happens all of a sudden for a couple of years active managers are outperforming net of fees hey maybe some money slides back from passive towards active and maybe that s what stops the march upwards of ownership by passive indexing but that s just a guess it s impossible to project anything in a straight line because each day each month each year the changes that take place within the market structure affect what subsequent market actors do so i m trying to guess two and three steps away okay so is it at 70 maybe it s easier to pick stocks hey maybe these active guys put together a run of a couple of years maybe they outperform enough that it attracts money back to active from passive but really that s just me spit balling hey maybe andrew lo of mit is right that it s 90 i suspect that that changes the dynamic of stock selection it s not like we are going to 100 no one is going to do that again i think human nature is such that there s always going to be a bunch of people who think how hard could it be to beat the market i think i could do this on your podcast you always have new interesting investment ideas each week assuming you agree with buying holding how do you consume investment information without causing damage to your portfolio i call masters in business the most fun i have each week and i m fortunate to draw from an amazing pool of people but its less about the specific investing idea and more about the thought process the how this person developed their philosophy and methodology than whether they re buying this stock or that mutual fund or this option when you have someone like professor scott galloway of nyu stern who s built a number of companies successfully the way he looks at data the way he looks at opportunity and entrepreneurship that s what i want to pull out from him not should i be long facebook or not or richard thaler and danny kahneman these are people who can teach you about your own thinking process two nobel laureates behavioral psychologists and thaler is an economist also and so it s less about give me a fish and more about teach me how to think about the process of fishing i find the guests much less intriguing for their stock recommendation in fact part of the idea for how the podcast came about i m flying back to new york from vancouver i have to change planes in i think it was chicago and while i m waiting for my plane i m in the lounge one of the financial channels is on tv and a well known hedge fund manager is on and the interviewer s just asking him the worst questions what s your favorite stock where s the dow going to be in a year when s the fed going to raise rates and every question the answer would have been stale by the time the guy walked out of the studio and as i m watching and i m thinking no don t ask for a fish find out how he fishes you know who were his mentors how did he develop his philosophy his methodology what books does this person read what mistakes did they make what advice would they give somebody going into the field today what do they know today they wish they knew 30 years ago and that was the approach that ultimately led to the podcast just frustration with how bad a lot of television interviews were so to me it s never about here s my best idea and here s why you should buy it it s always let me tell you how i go about thinking about managing risk in my portfolio how do i allocate assets how do i look at the world that s what matters it s the process not the outcome how would you suggest your children or grandchildren invest money for long term investments another great question um so i m going to say something that i know a lot of people are going to disagree with but you asked me to be honest so i m going to give you the honest truth when you re 20 years old probably till the time you re 40 you should be a hundred percent equity 0 bonds when you re 36 years old you don t really need bonds i would also say the bulk of that should be a portfolio of low cost passive global indexes just look at the past 20 years globally em outperformed the u s so don t suffer from home country bias so you want a global portfolio and you want to rebalance it every year and if you want to take some percentage 10 20 30 and make an active bet with it hey this technology thing seems to be working out let s put 10 of our index into the nasdaq qqqs or i think india is a growth nation let s put 5 into that and i like small cap value and there s another 10 i m just making up these things off the top of my head but if you go 80 20 passive active or something like that i think you re fine up until the time you re 40ish by the time you hit 40 and maybe for the decade after that i would be very comfortable adding some venture capital funds to that assuming you have access to the top quartile of vcs if you are overladen with technology on the equity side well then you probably don t need that but if you re at a point where you re making enough money and you could throw a percentage into some venture i think the potential upside is worth the illiquidity and the cost i don t really think you need to add bonds until you re 50 years old if you want to add some reits and real estate trust or farmlands or maybe even some private equity at 50 go ahead and again i m talking a couple of percent around the edge it should never be the bulk of your portfolio it should always be no more than 5 10 15 at most again if you re in the top decile private equity funds they re fantastic you know all of the things that jack bogle hated he was talking broadly private equity s expensive venture capital is expensive hedge funds are expensive and underperforming however if you can get some access to the top decile of these i know a bunch of bogleheads eyes are spinning in their heads but if at 50 years old you have a nice nest egg put aside and you want to pull a little bit of your investing into some of these alternatives go ahead again it s scratching that itch i m okay with that but the caveat is you have to watch your fees i know vanguard is talking about private equity for a 401k s think about how the world has changed over the past 40 years that is actually a project that s being worked on i m okay with a 50 year old who has a substantial amount of money put away peeling a little bit off and if it scratches that itch and it gives them some potential upside fine but the core investment for the bulk of your life is going to be long term globally diversified passive index you know you really don t need bonds in your twenties and thirties arguably not even in your forties but if it helps you sleep at night okay bonds especially with current prices are not a screaming buy and haven t been for some time that s how i would advise anyone who was in their teens or twenties or even thirties to be looking out over the course of the next you know 75 years keep in mind if you re 15 to 25 years old today the odds of you making into your nineties or beyond are much much higher than they were 50 years ago

how bad does joe biden s economy have to be in order to find it hopeful that workers are losing even more ground to inflation between yesterday s cpi report of inflation roaring at 9 1 and today s ppi report putting it at 11 3 the only sure bet is that the federal reserve will have to put its foot down onto the economy harder than a terry gilliam cartoon in monty python s title sequence advertisement it s so sure that the stock markets dropped like a rock in early trading as analysts now think the fed may hike interest rates even more than first suggested the report was a major league disappointment said fed governor christopher waller in remarks prepared for delivery thursday at a conference in victor idaho with the cpi data in hand i support another 75 basis point increase at the fed s july 26 27 meeting mr waller said but he said that depends on incoming data including reports due friday morning on retail sales and consumers inflation expectations and on housing activity later this month if that data come in materially stronger than expected it would make me lean towards a larger hike at the july meeting to the extent it shows demand is not slowing down fast enough to get inflation down he said the 0 75 increase last month was the largest single increase by the fed in 28 years it hasn t ever issued a 1 0 rate increase since making the fed rate the primary monetary supply tool in their arsenal shortly before that time although paul volcker certainly used it that way in the late 1970s now however the futures markets are expecting that move after the cpi report the wsj reported yesterday after wednesday s inflation report investors in interest rate futures markets and some analysts judged that the central bank would approve a one percentage point rate increase at its meeting in two weeks the probability of a one point increase rose to around 79 on wednesday up from around 12 before the report according to cme group advertisement i d bet that the probability is closer to 90 after both the cpi and ppi reports showed no impact at all from the june rate hike it s clear that the fed has to act more forcefully and that means an abrupt intervention that will act immediately to tamp down demand and investment that will almost certainly trigger a recession of some sort if it s effective at all which means increasing unemployment and consumer shocks at least for a short period that brings us to politico s hopeful sign that the fed won t have to act quite so precipitously workers wages are failing even more to keep pace with price increases not just in relative terms to the inflation rate but in actual nominal value wage gains for american workers are beginning to slow threatening one of the few positive trends for the economy since the pandemic but that could be good news for the nation s labor force average wages this year are up more than 5 percent from a year ago the fastest pace since ronald reagan s presidency but that has caused concern at the fed that the trend might accelerate and feed back into price increases which have already been eating away at those impressive gains the steady decrease in the speed at which wages are rising could allay those fears in a memo to reporters white house national economic council director brian deese and council of economic advisers chair cecilia rouse noted that average hourly earnings grew at a 4 2 percent annualized rate in the three months ending in june down from 4 8 percent the previous quarter and 6 1 percent in the last quarter of 2021 the picture for wages when adjusted for inflation is terrible right now said jason furman former chief economist for president barack obama and a professor at harvard university that s because people are getting raises much more slowly than prices are rising but the slowdown in wage increases might mean the fed needs to raise less aggressively so it can do a better job of preserving jobs furman said advertisement are we to breathe a sigh of relief because workers have fallen even further behind on inflation washington post economic analyst heather long yesterday pointed out that workers have lost 3 6 of their buying power over the past year thanks to inflation countering the larger gains that politico and the white house note in this report workers are experiencing the biggest decline in years in inflation adjusted pay wages are up 5 1 in past year inflation is up 9 1 the labor department calculates that workers had a 3 6 inflation adjusted decline in pay in the past year that s seasonally adjusted pic twitter com ym0cd7shbn heather long byheatherlong july 13 2022 if wage growth is slowing down we re avoiding a wage price spiral but workers are losing even more buying power every month than before not only does that sound a bit like tossing workers under the bus it actually makes the inflation problem even more acute for the fed and for the white house politically anyway workers by which we can mean voters are not going to endure that corrosion of buying power over the long haul it s bad enough that the 2008 bailout and the fed s easy money since then has mainly benefited wall street rather than main street main street isn t going to like holding the bag for those policies one single bit that s the issue that now faces jerome powell he s given some recent indications that the fed needs to consider a broader inflation metric than just core cpi which excludes food and energy the two ways consumers experience inflation the most the fed will need to act quickly and more sharply to make sure consumers don t lose confidence in the economy and that means they need to stop the erosion of buying power as soon as possible advertisement get ready for powell s big foot in other words and don t assume that accelerated erosion of that buying power will delay it

malte mueller via getty images equity is a big part of a total rewards package nowadays but to make the most informed job decisions you have to know the lingo here are some key terms and questions to understand if you like millions of americans work for a startup or in the tech industry you have likely been offered a grant of options or restricted stock units rsus when you got your job offer kyle holm is the vice president of total rewards advisory at sequoia consulting group which works with clients on designing their compensation programs he said in technology and life sciences industries offering a grant of options is a very common scenario advertisement for a new hire it s probably a 90 practice he said equity is a huge component of the overall total rewards package at a company these days but what exactly are those stock benefits even worth for companies that are already public and selling shares of stock to the public it s easier to understand their value but for a company that has not yet undertaken an initial public offering ipo figuring out the value of stock benefits is more art than science said gianna driver chief human resources officer at exabeam advertisement you do have to take a little bit of a leap of faith she said public companies you know what that value is because that s what it s being bought and sold at right now on the open market with a non public company it s hypothetical technically on paper today it s worth nothing when you receive equity instead of cash there s more risk but there s also more upside daniel lee director of financial planning at brightplan advertisement for early startups that cannot afford to pay new hires competitively high salaries it s common to offer new employees stock benefits in lieu of more cash in a best case scenario the company does really well its value goes up and its share price skyrockets you make a generous profit when you choose to sell your stake because your strike price or the set price at which you can purchase the stock is lower than the market value of what your stock options are worth in the long run getting equity in a company can be higher risk but it s also higher reward too when you receive equity instead of cash there s more risk but there s also more upside said daniel lee director of financial planning at brightplan and a personal finance instructor at university of california berkeley extension who teaches students about stock compensation when i ve worked with some of the instant millionaires that have come out of ipos that s 99 9 a result of their equity not their cash compensation advertisement but how can you tell what s a good deal or a red flag when a recruiter or hiring manager is pitching you about their company s stock benefits here are some critical questions to ask yourself and hiring managers before accepting a compensation package with stock options 1 are these rsus or stock options first it s important to understand what kind of stock benefits you have one big difference is whether you are being offered stock options or restricted stock units rsus if you are joining a company after it s gone public you are likely getting rsus which are the most common type of equity award one 2018 survey of 150 publicly traded technology companies found that 99 of the companies were giving time based rsus to employees a stock option is the option to buy your company s stock at a certain set price in the future conversely you don t have to spend any of your own money to get an rsu your company sets you up on a vesting schedule predetermined intervals at which your rsus become available to you and assigns a fair market value once your rsus vest that s why rsus are seen as less risky than private company options once your rsus vest they are yours to keep whereas with a stock option you have to buy the option lee said advertisement they are almost always going to be worth something lee said with rsus it s the same thing as getting a bonus at the end of a year but instead of giving you cash they are going to give you shares of the company and they typically vest over four years so you get a quarter after one year and then you might get one portion of it every quarter he explained 2 is the raise or salary offer below your market value you don t want to sacrifice too much of your salary for stock benefits ask yourself can i live without this money said ramona ortega founder of my money my future who is working to bring financial education to underserved communities you don t want to be taking stock options if you are not getting a base salary that s going to cover your necessary expenses ortega said she said you should always try to get the market rate of your salary unless you are independently wealthy or if you really believe in the company and are willing to take on the risk the worst case scenario is you just take way too much risk lee said he outlined an example where a person takes on debt to cover their cost of living because their cash salary is not enough to cover basic necessities like rent in this situation you are just hoping and praying that all these stock options you ve been getting will be worth billions of dollars but most companies don t ipo statistically your options are not going to be worth anything advertisement holm said it s important for employees to understand the long odds of getting liquidity with stock options it really is a long shot it doesn t matter which company it is that you will actually see liquidity maybe 1 of companies actually go public if that especially in the current environment we re just not seeing a wide open ipo window he said most employees are probably going to be looking at the cash being more appealing especially with the equity markets where they are at 3 how long do you plan to stay at this company reflecting on whether you see a future with this company is key to deciding if an employer s stock benefits are worth it in the long run both stock options and rsus usually vest over several years often there is what s known as a one year cliff waiting period where you are required to stay at the company for at least a year before you receive the benefits advertisement let s say i was hiring you ortega outlined as an example you re going to get 200 000 options over four years but you re not going to get the first drop of those until a year later you have to stay with the company for a year before you even get any of it that s the cliff you typically have to exercise your options within 90 days of leaving the company as you are weighing the timeframe you also want to consider whether you could raise enough money in time to buy those options before they expire if you quit or get laid off ortega said and even if the equity rewards are amazing you won t be staying around long enough to enjoy them if you re driven out by a toxic work environment there s a saying in hr that people don t leave jobs they leave managers driver said yeah you can throw money at people you can throw equity at people and that s all great and wonderful but at the end of the day the job does needs to be one that is fulfilling to the employee that matters a lot advertisement 4 what is the stock worth today and what do employees and investors think it will be worth in the future once you get a job offer with stock benefits you have the right to ask more questions about it if it s a private company you should ask to see its 409a evaluation which is an independent appraisal of the organization s stock that determines fair market value by analyzing financial statements assets and cash flows that s the latest value of each share of their company lee said noting that every time the company raises money they get a new evaluation if they re saying they are going to give you 10 000 options you don t know what that is worth unless you know what the price of the shares are lee estimates that more than half of employers would give you that 409a evaluation if you asked and if they don t want to disclose you should consider that a red flag advertisement where do you see the stock going before it ipos is another good question to ask hiring managers lee recommended at least you ll understand what the founder or the company s mindset is as to where they would like to see the stock go he said they might say shares are worth five dollars today but we re targeting the shares to be forty dollars by the time we ipo ask how many outstanding shares there are to find out the number of shares investors employees and executives currently own this can determine how big of a slice of the pie that you have holm said you can give me a number of shares but without the context of how many shares are outstanding i don t really know what it means he said of course you can do your own online research to figure out the state of your company s industry too look at what kind of equity packages people with similar jobs and titles are getting on angellist you can also go to blind a forum where professionals can anonymously share their compensation packages to compare what your peers are getting but as with most review sites where it s hard to verify claims you should take what they are saying with a grain of salt advertisement it s incumbent upon candidates to do their homework and diligence to really understand ok what sort of media and news coverage is coming out gianna driver chief human resources officer at exabeam driver recommends that job candidates look at similar companies that have gone public in the last six months or year it s incumbent upon candidates to do their homework and diligence to really understand ok what sort of media and news coverage is coming out she said is this space that this potential company is playing in is it a secure space is it going to be growing or is it legacy and going to be made redundant over time what are the multiples of the other companies do i believe in this management team many companies have great products but they don t have the right leadership to execute on that know that once you are working within the company you will gain a better sense of the true value of the organization for better or worse ortega said advertisement if they are out there raising money and saying they have the coolest new gadget and are bringing in users and you know from the inside that it s a shitshow at that point it s just a matter of well i don t know if i really believe this she said

only give you an idea of current average rates the rate you actually receive can vary based on a number of factors why do mortgage rates fluctuate here are some of the most common reasons why mortgage rates move frequently employment patterns the employment rate is an indicator of demand for mortgages when more people are unemployed fewer people will be looking to get a mortgage and buy a home and that lower demand will push interest rates down when the employment rate improves demand for mortgages will likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and interest rates tend to follow federal reserve system the fed as it s commonly called is the united states central bank but it doesn t actually set mortgage rates rather multiple things the fed does influence mortgage rates for example while mortgage rates don t mirror the fed funds rate

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services washington inflation s relentless surge didn t merely persist in june it accelerated for the 12 months ending in june the government s consumer price index rocketed 9 1 the fastest year over year jump since 1981 and that was nothing next to what energy prices did fueled by heavy demand and by russia s invasion of ukraine energy costs shot up nearly 42 in the past 12 months the largest such jump since 1980 even if you toss out food and energy prices which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price spike so called core inflation soared 5 9 over the past year consumers have endured the pain in everyday routines unleaded gasoline is up 61 in the past year men s suits jackets and coats 25 airline tickets 34 eggs 33 breakfast sausage 14 under chair jerome powell the federal reserve never anticipated inflation this severe or persistent yet after having been merely an afterthought for decades high inflation reasserted itself with ferocious speed as shortages of labor and supplies ran up against a propulsive rise in demand for goods and services across the economy in february 2021 the consumer price index was running just 1 7 above its level a year earlier from there it accelerated past 2 in march past 4 in april and 5 in may by december consumer prices hit the 7 year over year barrier and on and on it went 7 5 in january 7 9 in february and the increases have topped 8 every month since march the united states has endured worse inflation before but not in many decades the post world war ii inflation peak reached nearly 20 in 1947 a result of the lifting of wartime price curbs supply shortages and pent up consumer demand the inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s peaked at 14 8 in march 1980 before the fed exorcized high prices with aggressive rate hikes that caused brutal back to back recessions in 1980 and 1981 1982 for months powell and some others characterized high inflation as merely a transitory phenomenon while the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession faster than anyone had anticipated no longer now most economists expect inflation to remain painfully elevated well after this year with demand outstripping supplies in numerous areas of the economy so the fed has radically changed course by imposing a succession of large rate hikes the central bank is making a high risk bet that it can slow the economy enough to rein in inflation without weakening it so much as to trigger a recession the overall economy looks healthy for now with a robust job market and extremely low unemployment but many economists warn that the fed s steady credit tightening will likely cause a downturn what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs economic output plunged at a record shattering 31 annual rate in 2020 s april june quarter everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a severe recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed rates among other things by spring of last year the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants bars shops airports and entertainment venues suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others assigned a greater blame to supply shortages and some argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets is high inflation affecting just the united states not by a long shot prices are rising just about everywhere in the world in part a consequence of russia s invasion of ukraine which has elevated energy and food prices and in part because of the supply chain bottlenecks that have driven u s prices up eurostat the statistical service of the european union says it expects year over year inflation to hit 8 6 last month from a year earlier in the 19 countries that share the euro currency and up from an annual increase of 8 1 in may the international monetary fund has forecast that consumer prices in the world s advanced economies will jump 5 7 this year the most since 1984 the imf foresees 8 7 inflation in poorer emerging market and developing countries the highest such rate since 2008 how long will it last no one knows for sure elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services a recovering job market employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and a healthy average of 457 000 a month so far this year means that americans as a whole can afford to keep spending the fed foresees inflation staying above its 2 annual target into 2024 but relief from higher prices might be coming oil prices have been tumbling on fears of an economic downturn jammed up supply chains are showing some signs of improvement at least in industries like transportation commodity prices have begun to fall pay increases have slowed and surveys show that americans expectations for inflation over the long run have eased a trend that often points to more moderate price increases over time what s more the fed s pivot toward an aggressively anti inflationary policy could eventually reduce consumer demand inflation itself is eroding purchasing power and might force some consumers to shave spending at the same time new covid variants could cloud the outlook either by causing outbreaks that force factories and ports to close and further disrupt supply chains or by keeping more people home and reducing demand for goods how are higher prices affecting consumers the strong job market is boosting workers pay though not enough to offset higher prices the labor department says that after accounting for higher consumer prices hourly earnings for private sector employees fell 3 6 last month from a year earlier the 15th straight drop

fish passage in the connecticut river has had a rough year as changing environmental conditions continue to impact their numbers and migration according to biologists for the u s fish and wildlife service it s disappointing said kenneth sprankle project leader at the connecticut river fish and wildlife conservation office of the u s fish and wildlife service we d like to have more fish certainly it s not unique to the connecticut river fish passage is the ability of fish or other aquatic species to move between and within waterways during various life stages to reproduce feed and contribute to their ecosystems according to the u s fish and wildlife service as of the june 27 report which sprankle recently presented to members of the connecticut river atlantic salmon commission crasc roughly 190 000 american shad passed through the holyoke fish lift and 23 000 passed through the gatehouse ladder in turners falls as of june 1 for reference sprankle said the federal agency has a goal of 700 000 in holyoke and 400 000 at turners falls fish species under restoration in the connecticut river basin include american shad blueback herring sea lamprey american eel and alewife sprankle said the population goal for american shad for example would be 1 7 million adults back at the river mouth that allows us to have targets at each of the dams he said fish passage season can be greatly affected by water temperature and river discharge conditions sprankle explained climate change has also impacted several fish populations namely the atlantic salmon article continues after yesterday s most read articles we re doing all these things and what s frustrating and difficult is nothing stays the same he said for example with climate change as we gather data the very data we re gathering becomes outdated in a relatively short period of time in addition to changes to the landscape as a result of clearing land and erosion structures such as dams and culverts which have cropped up along waterways over the last several decades have also impacted fish access to habitats for spawning and nursery as a result goals for fish passage numbers have been adjusted to reflect what conservationists consider to be more realistic than what was agreed upon in the 1960s when state agencies began working together to restore migratory fish in the connecticut river responding to criticisms from the community that the turbine at the firstlight hydro generating co s northfield mountain pumped storage station which is in the midst of the license renewal process with federal energy regulatory commission ferc has played a significant role in the diminishing fish population sprankle said the fish passage systems in place were built in the 1980s and based on designs from the west coast that were scaled down when that happened it really changed some of the dynamics of how the water flows through those fishways he said we re going to be able to get that changed he added that the challenge on the connecticut river is that re licensing schedules aren t on the same timelines the u s fish and wildlife service he said has fish passageway engineering criteria that will need to be met we have recommendations on things like water velocities the size of the buckets that move the fish how much water needs to be available so fish can find fishways entrances he said this has all been developed through trial and error the power companies the engineers they hire will utilize that and we make it contingent that they are meeting that criteria sprankle said when considering fish counts for a particular year he also looks to the stock structure or in other words the age of the fish as an important marker for success often the fish counts one year can be explained by a poor or successful spawning in the years prior that shows stock resilience he said if you have fish that are coming back they ll come back again and spawn again reporter mary byrne can be reached at mbyrne recorder com or 413 930 4429 twitter maryebyrne

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services washington inflation s relentless surge didn t merely persist in june it accelerated for the 12 months ending in june the government s consumer price index rocketed 9 1 the fastest year over year jump since 1981 and that was nothing next to what energy prices did fueled by heavy demand and by russia s invasion of ukraine energy costs shot up nearly 42 in the past 12 months the largest such jump since 1980 even if you toss out food and energy prices which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price spike so called core inflation soared 5 9 over the past year consumers have endured the pain in everyday routines unleaded gasoline is up 61 in the past year men s suits jackets and coats 25 airline tickets 34 eggs 33 breakfast sausage 14 under chair jerome powell the federal reserve never anticipated inflation this severe or persistent yet after having been merely an afterthought for decades high inflation reasserted itself with ferocious speed as shortages of labor and supplies ran up against a propulsive rise in demand for goods and services across the economy in february 2021 the consumer price index was running just 1 7 above its level a year earlier from there it accelerated past 2 in march past 4 in april and 5 in may by december consumer prices hit the 7 year over year barrier and on and on it went 7 5 in january 7 9 in february and the increases have topped 8 every month since march the united states has endured worse inflation before but not in many decades the post world war ii inflation peak reached nearly 20 in 1947 a result of the lifting of wartime price curbs supply shortages and pent up consumer demand the inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s peaked at 14 8 in march 1980 before the fed exorcized high prices with aggressive rate hikes that caused brutal back to back recessions in 1980 and 1981 1982 for months powell and some others characterized high inflation as merely a transitory phenomenon while the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession faster than anyone had anticipated no longer now most economists expect inflation to remain painfully elevated well after this year with demand outstripping supplies in numerous areas of the economy so the fed has radically changed course by imposing a succession of large rate hikes the central bank is making a high risk bet that it can slow the economy enough to rein in inflation without weakening it so much as to trigger a recession the overall economy looks healthy for now with a robust job market and extremely low unemployment but many economists warn that the fed s steady credit tightening will likely cause a downturn what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs economic output plunged at a record shattering 31 annual rate in 2020 s april june quarter everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a severe recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed rates among other things by spring of last year the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants bars shops airports and entertainment venues suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others assigned a greater blame to supply shortages and some argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets is high inflation affecting just the united states not by a long shot prices are rising just about everywhere in the world in part a consequence of russia s invasion of ukraine which has elevated energy and food prices and in part because of the supply chain bottlenecks that have driven u s prices up eurostat the statistical service of the european union says it expects year over year inflation to hit 8 6 last month from a year earlier in the 19 countries that share the euro currency and up from an annual increase of 8 1 in may the international monetary fund has forecast that consumer prices in the world s advanced economies will jump 5 7 this year the most since 1984 the imf foresees 8 7 inflation in poorer emerging market and developing countries the highest such rate since 2008 how long will it last no one knows for sure elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services a recovering job market employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and a healthy average of 457 000 a month so far this year means that americans as a whole can afford to keep spending the fed foresees inflation staying above its 2 annual target into 2024 but relief from higher prices might be coming oil prices have been tumbling on fears of an economic downturn jammed up supply chains are showing some signs of improvement at least in industries like transportation commodity prices have begun to fall pay increases have slowed and surveys show that americans expectations for inflation over the long run have eased a trend that often points to more moderate price increases over time what s more the fed s pivot toward an aggressively anti inflationary policy could eventually reduce consumer demand inflation itself is eroding purchasing power and might force some consumers to shave spending at the same time new covid variants could cloud the outlook either by causing outbreaks that force factories and ports to close and further disrupt supply chains or by keeping more people home and reducing demand for goods how are higher prices affecting consumers the strong job market is boosting workers pay though not enough to offset higher prices the labor department says that after accounting for higher consumer prices hourly earnings for private sector employees fell 3 6 last month from a year earlier the 15th straight drop

the fate of the one beale development now hangs in the balance the memphis city council decided thursday that it wants city taxpayers to backstop 100 of the debt that will be issued for the one beale development the debt which is bonds would be used to help construct the grand hyatt a 350 room hotel that will serve the renasant convention center but memphis mayor jim strickland said thursday that he would withhold his approval on the city backing the bonds throwing into limbo when the debt would actually be issued so the city council passed the resolution after more than two hours of debate with the understanding that chance carlisle the project s developer and the strickland administration would continue to negotiate the parties huddled throughout the meeting and may come up with another deal that involves something other than a 100 backstop the move from the city council thursday followed days of tension and an unusual clash between strickland s administration which tried to delay consideration of the bond backstop and the developer chance carlisle who had appeared to secure the votes for the backstop tuesday downtown memphis housing is in demand how many more units can the market absorb sneak peek take a look inside world s first caption by hyatt hotel in downtown memphis i too am sitting in your shoes if this should fall short chance carlisle said thursday i am highly motivated for this hotel to be successful following a contentious meeting tuesday the vote was delayed until thursday to allow the city s financial advisors to analyze the deal those financial advisors pfm told the city council this week that it needed to analyze the deal further before committing the city s full faith and credit the city administration said thursday that strickland who still must sign off on the bond guaranty following the council s passage would withhold his signature until memphis knows what the debt guarantee would do to the city s bond rating and met further with tennessee state comptroller jason mumpower the bonds will cost 178 million including interest over 30 years the city of memphis taxpayer is now liable for all that debt in the unlikely event of a default the bonds once sold are expected to contribute about 16 million to reserve funds lowering the city s downside risk to about 162 million the vote went as such yes j ford canale frank colvett cheyenne johnson worth morgan patrice robinson jeff warren and jamita swearengen no martavius jones abstained edmund ford sr chance carlisle s brother chase carlisle is a member of the city council he did not attend thursday s meeting and did not vote on the project city administration voices concern it s our responsi to look out for the financial best interests of the city as a whole doug mcgowen the city s chief operating officer told the city council thursday strickland sent the city council an email at 3 29 p m thursday that voiced his concerns i am certainly willing to continue the conversations and review of this important project and the city s role currently there is too much risk and too much uncertainty for city taxpayers to move forward at this time strickland wrote he also enclosed a letter from the city s financial advisor pfm that urged the city to study the hotel market and consider what backstopping the debt would do the city s credit rating and the ability for memphis to finance other capital projects we understand the city to have a number of capital projects in the planning stage use of the non ad valorem revenue pledge for debt is limited any application of this pledge will reduce available capacity for future projects pfm wrote the entire letter from pfm can be seen here how the project plans to pay off bonds the one beale development with its three planned or completed hotels is part of a tourism development zone otherwise known as a tdz that tdz allows the hotel to charge a 5 special tax on its rooms it also allows it to capture most of the local sales tax revenue generated on the site 2 25 out of 2 75 the restaurants on site also generate sales tax that is captured that money is what will first pay off the bonds for the project the bonds will be issued by the center city revenue finance corporation an affiliate board of the downtown memphis commission it would only be after those revenue sources fell short that the city taxpayer would be footing the bill to make up the debt service over the past year one beale has already generated about 1 million in revenue that would pay down the debt with more restaurants expected to open soon further revenue is expected to accrue before the grand hyatt opens grand hyatt part of long term investment in convention center the reason for all of the hullabaloo thursday is the city s long term investment to the convention business the city spent more than 200 million on renovations to the renasant convention center and received several consultant studies that said such an investment also required a new convention center hotel for years the city negotiated with loews hotels but that deal fell through this year that prompted the city to agree to backstop 50 of one beale s debt this spring however volatility in the bond market made that 50 backstop not enough to make the bonds investment grade according to the developer and the city the future of the convention center came into play thursday evening what would be our next step to ensure the convention center survives johnson asked mcgowen our convention center does not rise and fall on one particular hotel mcgowen said i don t want to diminish its importance but i don t want to overblow our convention center is rebounding will it realize its fullest potential it may not samuel hardiman covers memphis city government and

have been confirmed the daily figure has risen to over 500 cases on a seven day rolling average europe continues to remain the epicenter of the global outbreak seventy four non endemic countries and territories outside the central african region where monkeypox has existed for decades have reported such cases including eight on the african continent spain has the highest case count with 2 447 monkeypox infections germany and the uk are neck and neck with 1 790 and 1 789 cases respectively case counts in france and italy continue to climb and russia was the latest country across the eurasian landmass that reported its first confirmed case north america followed by latin america are other regions where monkeypox cases are soaring the united states has reported 1 049 monkeypox infections with approximately 76 cases per day on a moving average compared to last week cases are up nearly 40 percent california new york illinois and the district of columbia have the highest infection rates in new york city and san francisco the public health departments have said that their stock of monkeypox vaccines made from the attenuated strain of the vaccinia virus is exhausted with 484 monkeypox infections canada has seen a 60 percent jump in cases since july 4 quebec has seen the lion s share of cases with 284 ontario and british columbia are also seeing a growing number of infections brazil reported its first case back on june 8 low single digit daily infection numbers were being confirmed until the end of june when a sudden spike in cases was observed the highest single day count was on july 6 with 36 confirmed cases in all the country now has tallied 227 cases additionally almost every country neighboring brazil has also seen such cases reported to their respective public health departments mexico has also seen a sudden surge in cases recently the director general for the world health organization who dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus affirmed at last tuesday s press briefing that the emergency committee for monkeypox would reconvene to examine the recent trends in infections and response by countries in deploying countermeasures against the virus on june 24 the emergency committee in what amounted to be a split decision favored not declaring the outbreak a pandemic and allowing more time to accrue while the who gathered further evidence on trends in cases and newly affected geographic regions they noted that reconvening the committee would depend on several criteria including case and death rates spread outside affected lgbt communities changes in the virulence of the virus and the establishment of the virus in animal populations they insisted that the who and national public health institutions work with the high risk communities where cases remain predominately among men who have sex with men and workers at clubs and spas where such sexual activities occur the emergency committee also recommended that health institutes work with vaccine developers and consult experts in the field to raise awareness about the disease and initiate the infrastructure for tracing testing and treating infected and close contacts this 2003 electron microscope image made available by the centers for disease control and prevention shows mature oval shaped monkeypox virions left and spherical immature virions right obtained from a sample of human skin associated with the 2003 prairie dog outbreak professor yaneer bar yam president of the new england complex systems institute and co founder of the world health network whn has been rightly critical of the who for its delay in declaring the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern the whn had preemptively declared monkeypox a pandemic on june 22 ahead of the initial emergency committee meeting to bring pressure on the global health organization bar yam who had in late january 2020 raised concerns about the who s slowness in alerting the world of the threat posed by the rapidly growing global transmission of covid 19 said recently during an online webinar to discuss the monkeypox pandemic the reason to declare monkeypox a pandemic is to alert everyone to take action to prevent more cases from happening that is the essential motivation if you tell everyone everything is ok then everyone will go about their usual business he added the countries where cases are occurring are limiting the testing and interventions with a focus on men who have sex with men and that community and known exposures as we know from other pandemics there is an undercounting and lack of clarity of what transmission is taking place and we have a challenge of knowing the true magnitude guest speaker dr kavita patel a family medicine physician in washington d c and former obama administration director of policy for the white house office of intergovernmental affairs and public engagement spoke about the lack of familiarity among physicians and health institutes about monkeypox infections unless a patient raises concerns directly about a rash and monkeypox most won t entertain the diagnosis she said there are so many gaps in education now both in health care and at the community level she added there was a significant need to implement testing and vaccine clinics immediately dr patel also told listeners that with labcorp signing on there are now five us commercial laboratories aegis science labcorp mayo clinic laboratories quest diagnostic and sonic healthcare that can run pcr tests for monkeypox yet she noted us capacity is about 60 000 tests per week which are not enough also the testing and turnaround on these specimens can be laborious and may take up to three days further delaying the diagnosis and enabling the continued spread of the virus dr patel added this has been what we have needed quickly to keep it contained and use a ring vaccination strategy a post prophylaxis strategy if we had better more widely available testing we would have had a better ability now in new york city d c and san francisco we have run out of jynneos we are turning to the smallpox vaccine but it is very difficult to use because of its terrible side effects the manufacturer of the monkeypox vaccine is presently undergoing system modifications at its plants and production of the vaccines will be limited for the next several quarters modeling the monkeypox virus cases leads to estimates that the uk could expect 60 000 cases per day by the end of 2022 and conceivably a half million cases or more by the end of september epidemiologist dr eric feigl ding a co founder of the whn warned that though the number of cases remains small it is growing at about 40 to 50 percent per week or 10 fold growth over six weeks he said case counts are increasing from 300 to 400 daily cases a week on seven day averages the us broke the 1 000 barrier and cases are accelerating he criticized the cdc s arbitrary and mechanical risk categorization that labeled intermediate risk as anyone in close contact with an infected person for more than six hours without a mask the panel urged listeners to understand that all transmission routes were viable and to be aware that smallpox which is in the same family of viruses as monkeypox can be passed on through airborne transmission bar yam added masking is a good idea but there is no guidance for it masks are important and these need to be acknowledged there seem to be competing factions at the cdc on what they recommend the confusion is dangerous and clear guidance is required the whn sponsored panel strongly urged everyone to mask and noted that the cdc had previously endorsed their use for monkeypox in concluding his initial remarks feigl ding warned that as cases of monkeypox in communities accelerated with schools set to open this fall the likelihood of these infections spreading among children was a major problem as the virus is most dangerous to the youngest they also have never previously received the smallpox vaccine meaning they are immunologically naïve to the virus and lack any previous protection bar yam explained the evidence for disease severity in children comes from clinical experience in africa where the virus is endemic in population based studies on monkeypox pediatric patients made the bulk of those admitted to hospitals and icus he also warned that the consequences of monkeypox infection in immunocompromised patients and pregnant women could be catastrophic the panelists also raised the following caveats about the jynneos vaccine though it is safe in the immunocompromised it hasn t been evaluated in pregnant or breastfeeding women and is also not authorized in those under 18 the most vulnerable population on a question from the audience about health systems becoming vectors of transmission for the monkeypox virus dr patel said she was very concerned about this issue considering the lack of awareness at most health institutions on the signs and symptoms of monkeypox and the slow turnaround in test results she said this was a genuine possibility hospitals should take precautions against airborne transmission of monkeypox dr patel said if patients test negative for covid health care providers will let routine procedures slide she urged that those on the frontline of health care settings should receive the monkeypox vaccines to protect them and their patients bar yam summarized a who declaration of a pandemic would be significant but there remains a vacuum of leadership he reflected i sat at a recent who meeting they didn t go into using masks or travel testing though they did say it isn t just sexual transmission and anyone can get infected they did not convey the message of urgency the need to identify cases quickly was not well communicated there is a desire to maintain calm however this is interpreted as the sense that there is no urgency to solve this problem we must first communicate the urgency

gladstone n d sometimes in life it takes a certain fire to light the wick and get rolling on a dream for tasha ricker of gladstone that fire came in the form of a global pandemic this month ricker is celebrating the two year anniversary of her company s founding the little town soy candle company ricker is originally from alaska and moved to the western edge in 2015 to work in the oil industry then met her husband josh in killdeer when the pandemic shutdowns began in 2020 she was laid off from her job that summer and was looking for something to occupy her time her candle business ignited as a hobby with a great deal of support from candle seeking friends and the flame spread from there she said pride of dakota has been immensely helpful in her success we ve gotten our products all over the state and a lot of our referrals have come from pride of dakota she said it s definitely been nice having a little bit of a mentor and i mean we bounce ideas off each other advertisement pride of dakota is a cooperative established by north dakota s agriculture commissioner kent jones in 1985 it enables businesses of all types and sizes with products made in the state to market them as such it also helps that she s had a good mentor who s been in the business for a decade my mother in law actually owns her own candle company in olympia washington this was initially her idea she was like i could teach you some things so i did learn a lot of tips and tricks from her ricker said since establishing the operation she said supply chain issues have been a major obstacle with the whole covid pandemic going on you know stuff being shut down coming from overseas and freight charges it was just insane to find jars she said once they came back in stock we stocked up on them but now we ve noticed it s fragrance oils and wicks it s just like one thing after another that you have a hard time finding so anytime something is available you have to buy it in mass quantities after this read more business news she elaborated that she spends a significant portion of her work day online it s a struggle i would say i spend about half my time not even making candles instead i m on the laptop searching for supplies and finding the best shipping deals because shipping is just outrageous now so i d say that s the most challenging part of the business she said yet the reward of providing a product people love makes it all worth it she said explaining that using soy wax elongates the life of a candle advertisement soy wax has been known to have a cleaner more consistent burn the more consistent burn allows your candle to burn at the right temperature versus like a paraffin wax they can burn hot so that s going to eat up your candle a lot faster she said then soy is obviously better for the environment to little town soy candle company offers a vast selection might be an understatement contributed tasha ricker according to the new york times another environmental benefit is that soy wax produces less soot than paraffin this also makes soy less likely to cause irritation for those with allergies or asthma ricker added that paraffin is a byproduct of petroleum while soy use supports local and midwestern farmers our soy actually comes from iowa she said explaining how the wax making process works it comes in bead form like little pellets we buy those by the 45 pound bag on a pallet it s ready to melt when we get it so we just dump it in our melter melt it to the right temperature add in all our fragrances and then pour it by hand little town offers a wide variety of products including custom candles for information visit littletownsoycandleco com or the little town soy candle co facebook page ricker can be reached at info littletownsoycandle com

data gathered under the program will also be held for seven years so the tax office can cross reference records do i have to pay tax on cryptocurrency yes if you sell an asset including your cryptocurrency you will need to calculate either your capital gain or capital loss and then record those details in your tax return and as the ato warned in may it will be paying particular attention to what investors do with their cryptocurrency this tax season through our data collection processes we know that many aussies are buying selling or exchanging digital coins and assets so it s important people understand what this means for their tax obligations loh says but many cryptocurrency investors this year will be lodging losses after recent interest rate increases and economic instability crypto markets in particular have taken a hit after reaching record highs of nearly 3 trillion in november 2021 prior to dipping below 1 trillion koinly crypto tax expert danny talwar says how is cryptocurrency taxed the ato will tax cryptocurrency assets such as coins and non fungible tokens as capital gains tax cgt assets however investors who stake cryptocurrency or who lock their existing tokens to help validate transactions on the blockchain and in exchange receive additional tokens will have those rewards taxed as ordinary income this tax is calculated based on the value of the staked tokens once converted into australian dollars when they were received advertisement the federal government has also confirmed that cryptocurrency is not regarded as a foreign currency for tax purposes despite el salvador s decision to allow bitcoin to be used as legal tender assistant treasurer stephen jones says the central american country s decision has the potential to create uncertainty and the decision against treating cryptocurrency as foreign currency is designed to curb that risk broadly cryptocurrency is taxed at the same rate as your income before the 50 per cent cgt discount is applied to investments held for at least a year can i use cryptocurrency losses to offset tax yes and no if you ve sold your cryptocurrency assets for less than you bought them for you have a so called capital loss you can use this to offset other capital gains that is investment gains you ve made by selling investments for more than you purchased them but you have to have actually made the loss many people regard certain cryptocurrency transactions as paper gains or losses but actually the ato regards them as very real h r block head of tax communications mark chapman says say i buy some bitcoins and then exchange them for a different cryptocurrency that gives rise to a capital gains tax event at the date of exchange even though the taxpayer might argue the gain or loss is not actually realised into australian dollars this is a common mistake that crypto investors make you can easily find yourself with a cgt liability and no actual cash to pay it advertisement and adds the ato s loh there are restrictions around how tax offsets can be applied crypto is a popular type of asset and we expect to see more capital gains or capital losses reported in tax returns this year remember you can t offset your crypto losses against your salary and wages he says the ato has also issued a warning against asset wash sales given the market downturn this usually involves selling assets at a loss just before the end of the financial year to realise a loss before buying back the same or substantially similar assets soon after the ato considers this a form of tax avoidance and warns it will be monitoring investors for this action how do i work out what my capital gains or losses are first you will need to convert the value of your cryptocurrency assets into australian dollars the ato suggests investors use the exchange rates provided by digital currency exchanges at the time of the transaction to do this then investors can work out the cgt using the ato s online calculator and record keeping tool generally your cgt will be calculated as your total capital gains less any capital losses and less any entitlement to any cgt discounts on your gains does it make a difference if i m an investor or a trader it s a bit confusing but yes advertisement generally speaking most people will fall under the investor category and have the cgt rules applied to them if they re an investor it means they re holding cryptocurrency as wait for it an investment they re hoping it will grow in value to give them capital gains these investors will be taxed under cgt rules but if you re transacting large amounts of cryptocurrency with a goal of maximising profits rather than having a buy and hold approach to cryptocurrency then you re likely to be considered a trader that means the proceeds of your trades will be taxed under trading stock rules rather than cgt rules with the proceeds assessed as income what information do i need to fill in my tax return as a crypto investor you ll want to have the dates of your transactions and the value of the cryptocurrency in australian dollars at the time of transaction you ll also have to detail the purpose of the transaction and the details of the other transacting party receipts exchange records digital wallet records and keys will come in handy here we ve heard that trying to keep track of crypto asset taxes in a spreadsheet is virtually impossible so investors might want to consider digital record keeping solutions and speak to a registered tax agent to make sure they re getting things right cpa

expects the war in ukraine to push inflation in the euro zone to a record high of 7 6 in 2022 the eu s executive arm also cuts its euro zone growth forecasts for 2022 from 2 7 to 2 6 and for 2023 from 2 3 to 1 4 lithuania to keep kaliningrad trade restrictions for now lithuania will maintain trade restrictions on the russian exclave of kaliningrad until it can establish new rules to let sanctioned russian goods transit through its territory prime minister ingrida simonyte said on thursday the russian territory wedged between lithuania and poland had been cut off from moscow after lithuania began enforcing european union sanctions on rail freight however the eu executive said on wednesday that russian goods should be allowed to transit through eu territory to reach kaliningrad amid rising tensions between moscow and vilnius switzerland issues war crimes warning to firms trading stolen ukrainian resources swiss persecutors are currently conducting a criminal investigation into commodities firms allegedly trading in stolen raw materials from ukraine commercializing looted raw materials could constitute a war crime swiss attorney general stefan blättler wrote in a column for the national newspaper le temps although he said investigations were underway he did not provide specific details the issue has come to light after allegations that invading russian forces pillaged grain and coal reserves the kremlin has denied such claims ukraine claims airstrike on russian checkpoints near kherson ukrainian forces have continued to strike russian positions around the port city of kherson according to official reports ukraine launched an attack on two military checkpoints in the russian held town of nova kakhovka on thursday serhiy bratchuk a spokesperson for the odesa regional administration said the airstrike killed 13 occupiers the account has not yet been independently verified it follows a tuesday attack on nova kakhovka in which ukrainian forces claim to have killed 52 people and the russian installed authorities area reported at least seven fatalities russia risks losing momentum uk intelligence a british intelligence assessment claimed russian forces have achieved no significant territorial advances in the donbas over the past 72 hours and run the risk of losing momentum this is a change from when russia captured the frontline city of lysychansk a week ago the ageing vehicles weapons and soviet era tactics used by russian forces do not lend themselves to quickly regaining or building momentum unless used in overwhelming mass which russia is currently unable to bring to bear the uk defense ministry said in its daily briefing additionally the ministry said that despite four way talks in istanbul on grain exports and successful prisoner exchanges the prospect of a peace negotiation remains slim german energy regulator heating bills to triple germany s energy regulator has estimated that monthly heating bills could triple next year due to a decrease in russian gas imports for those now receiving their heating bill the payments are already doubling and that is before taking into account the ukraine war federal network agency chief klaus müller told germany s rnd news outlet müller said higher procurement costs could be met with subsidies for gas companies or by passing the cost on to consumers while offering state assistance to those unable to pay the increased prices germany is heavily reliant on imported russian gas supplies of which have dropped since russia invaded ukraine müller said that private households would be protected during an energy crisis under german and european law even in the worst case scenario germany will continue to get gas from norway and from terminals in belgium and holland and soon directly from terminals on the german coast he stressed lithuania says it will allow russian goods to transit toward kaliningrad lithuania s foreign ministry has confirmed that it will allow sanctioned russian goods to transit through its territory to the russian exclave kaliningrad following the release of new guidelines by the european commission kaliningrad which is bordered by poland and lithuania has had some freight transport from mainland russia cut off since june 17 due to sanctions moscow said that this amounted to an illegal blockade under the new guidelines released by the european commission on wednesday lithuania will only be allowed to block rail shipments of certain goods that have dual civilian and military use this decision which removes restrictions on a certain range of products transported by rail is a demonstration of realism and common sense reuters cited a russian foreign ministry spokesperson as saying although we still have questions about the contents of this document kaliningrad regional governor anton alikhanov said in a telegram post that the new guidelines are only the first step needed we will continue to work towards the complete removal of restrictions alikhanov said ukraine lobbies us for longer range missiles kyiv is pushing for washington to supply it with longer range missiles ukrainian lawmaker fedir venyslavsky said currently the ukrainian army has missiles with a range of 70 kilometers 43 miles for the himars rocket launchers recently supplied by washington missiles for the himars launchers can have ranges of up to 500 kilometers the tochka u missiles currently used by ukraine for longer range strikes have a range of up to 120 kilometers but are less precise than those used for himars rocket launchers the crimean bridge which connects russia to annexed crimea is some 260 kilometers from the frontline the bridge could fall into the range of a ukrainian strike if kyiv were supplied with longer range missiles kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov described ukraine s rumored plans to target the crimean bridge as terror he added that the bridge was sufficiently protected against potential strikes the us has long declined to provide kyiv with longer range missiles due to fears that ukraine could use them to launch strikes on russian territory and further escalate the conflict ukraine proposes navigation algorithm for grain exports head of the office of ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy andriy yermak said kyiv had proposed the formation of a basic navigation algorithm that would allow grain exports through the black sea yermak made the comments following a meeting between ukrainian russian and turkish military delegations and un officials in istanbul black sea security is a priority in the issue of resuming of ukrainian agricultural export that is why ukraine has proposed to form a basic navigation algorithm for the black sea according to yermak the proposal will

all questions overview i market conditions 2021 was a busy year for the emea loan markets as the threat of the covid 19 pandemic began to recede allowing businesses to restart transactions that had paused as a result of the pandemic or take advantage of opportunities that had emerged alongside more general refinancing activity the increase in event driven financings was more muted than expected in the first half of the year with refinancings dominating however towards the end of the year m a activity picked up good liquidity and generally favourable conditions for borrowers coupled with an increase of overseas and private equity investment were the main drivers for the increase in activity the direct lending markets also saw significant levels of activity with private credit funds moving out of the midmarket to target larger transactions over 1 billion either alone or as part of a club as a result of a record year for fundraising key themes in 2021 remained the transition from libor to risk free rates rfrs a process that is now largely complete for most libor tenors and currencies although some work remains to be done in relation to some currencies in particular us dollar transactions see further section ii i environment social and governance esg transactions also continued to dominate in 2021 with corporate refinancings in particular focusing on the inclusion of esg mechanics however esg considerations are becoming more common in the leveraged and event driven markets as well esg loan debt may be structured as a sustainability linked loan which links the pricing of a facility to esg objectives without directing the use of proceeds to those objectives or a green or social loan which restricts the use of proceeds to particular green or social objectives sustainability linked loans are the most commonly seen throughout all markets ii market participants and documentary developments a mixture of participants remain active in the english law loan market traditional banks continue to play an important and active role in the loan market and remain dominant in investment grade lending in other sectors particularly in the leveraged real estate and infrastructure finance markets alternative credit providers such as direct lending funds and institutional investors collateralised loan obligations clos finance and insurance companies hedge high yield and distressed funds and loan mutual funds are more prominent most english law syndicated loan transactions use the loan market association lma recommended forms as a starting point for negotiations in addition to various types of facility agreements and ancillary documentation for the investment grade market the investment grade agreements and leveraged lending the leveraged finance documentation the lma collection comprises multiple templates for more specialist products including real estate finance developing markets lending and pre export finance the lma has updated the majority of its documentation to reflect the transition from libor to rfrs the lma does not maintain template terms for green or environmental social and governance esg linked loans but has published a variety of principles and guidance for both green social and sustainability linked loans and is very active in the development of the standardisation of the market esg linked lending is anticipated to remain an important area of focus over the coming year these topics and related documentation are discussed in section ii legal and regulatory developments managing the steady flow of legal and regulatory changes remains an ongoing challenge for loan market participants some of the topics outlined below have been a feature of loan documentation discussions for some time in some cases sufficient consensus has emerged to enable them to be addressed in the lma templates leaving only points of detail to be negotiated where there remain diverging views the contractual treatment must be agreed on a transaction by transaction basis i transition from libor from 1 january 2022 publication of 24 libor settings ceased going forward only six synthetic sterling and yen libor settings are available for the duration of 2022 and five us dollar libor settings are available until mid 2023 however these remaining settings are intended for legacy use only all new loans should now reference the appropriate rfr from day one including all new us dollar loans and for sterling and most other libor currencies the lma s templates for rfr lending are now widely used in the market with documentation available for both investment grade and leveraged transactions while the transition has been successful so far there is still some work to be done concerning some currencies most notably us dollar transactions where there a range of options still available and market consensus has yet to emerge it is also worth noting that the transition to rfrs from non libor benchmarks is now gaining momentum with the canadian dollar offered rate cdor likely to be the next rate to transition ii sustainable finance sustainable impact investing is an important driver for many financial institutions which over the past few years has fuelled an increase in esg linked lending sustainable or esg loans look to align terms to the borrower s performance against an agreed set of esg related performance targets for example the margin on an esg facility may adjust depending on whether those targets are met upwards or downwards an independent opinion provider is typically engaged by the borrower to verify whether those targets have been satisfied this is to be contrasted with green or social lending which focuses on the use of proceeds with a requirement that they are used to invest in green or social projects within pre agreed parameters verification is also required for green and social loans to assess the merits of the particular project for which the funding is intended to assist the development and standardisation of the sustainable lending market the lma in conjunction with the asia pacific loan market association aplma and the loans settlement and trading association lsta has produced the following documents the green loan principles glp published in 2018 comprising voluntary recommended guidelines that seek to promote consistency and integrity in the development of the green loan market by clarifying the criteria for which a loan may be categorised as green to aid consistency with the green bond market the glp build on and refer to the green bond principles published by the international capital markets association icma the sustainability linked loan principles sllp published in 2019 which provide a framework for lending to incentivise the borrower s achievement of predetermined sustainability performance targets spts similarly to the glps the sllps are intended to promote consistency within the sustainability linked market covering topics such as setting the spts as well as reporting and review of the borrower s performance against those spts and most recently in 2021 the social loan principles the slp were published which provide a framework for market standards and guidance for social loans where the proceeds of the loan are used for predetermined social projects building on the social bond principles published by the icma the slps cover topics such as the use of proceeds and process of evaluation and selection of social projects together with guidance on the monitoring and reporting on the project and proceeds of the loan alongside each set of principles the lma has also published guidance notes to aid interpretation of the principles in the market covering matters such as for example guidance for company advisers in relation to esg disclosure in leveraged transactions most recently at the start of 2022 the lma has published guidance on the external review and verification process the lma continues to take a very active role in the development of the market providing regular updates to the principles and guidance to reflect developing market practice sustainability linked financing in particular continued to grow in the uk throughout 2021 both in the context of investment grade corporate working capital facilities and increasingly in the leveraged loan market including some event driven financings as mentioned above sustainability linked loans contain esg related spts typically referred to as key performance indicators kpis selected by the borrower kpis may relate to for example reductions in emissions or diversity targets within the borrower group depending on whether or not the kpi targets are achieved by the borrower the margin will adjust upwards or downwards in addition the lenders will usually expect ongoing information on the borrower s performance in relation to the kpis during the life of the loan this reporting can be provided either by the borrower or by an external opinion provider appointed by the borrower to smooth the process one or more of the lenders may act as a sustainability coordinator to assist with negotiating the kpis and liaising with the borrower on behalf of the lenders on esg related matters the sustainability coordinator will not however assume any fiduciary duties to the rest of the syndicate negotiations generally focus on the setting of the kpis together with the nature and extent of the reporting and verification of the borrower s performance iii pension schemes act 2021 defined benefit db pension liabilities have received renewed focus in corporate and financing transactions since the enactment of the pensions schemes act 2021 psa the psa is intended to strengthen the powers of the uk pensions regulator to intervene in corporate activities that threaten db pension scheme benefits and recoveries referred to as the moral hazard regime the moral hazard regime was introduced by the pensions act 2004 which granted powers to the pensions regulator to protect the position of db pension schemes by requiring employers to provide additional support to schemes in certain circumstances these powers allow the pensions regulator to issue contribution notices cns and financial support directions fsds to either the scheme employer or a person associated or connected 2 with the scheme employer fsds are more general in nature and permit the uk pensions regulator to require employers to provide additional financial support for the pension scheme s obligations where the regulator believes it is reasonable to do so cns focus on specific actions or failures to act that have negatively affected the db pension scheme to issue a cn under the pensions act 2004 the pensions regulator has to be of the reasonable opinion that one of two tests have been met 1 the target of the cn must have been a party to or knowingly assisted in a deliberate act or failure to act the main purpose of which was to prevent recovery of a db pension scheme debt or 2 the target s act or failure to act has detrimentally affected in a material way the likelihood of accrued db pension scheme benefits being received defences are available if in summary the target of the cn can show that it considered the db pension scheme and took reasonable steps to mitigate the effect of the act a voluntary clearance procedure is also available whereby the uk pensions regulator can confirm that it would not be reasonable to issue a cn or fsd in addition the pensions act 2004 introduced a series of notifiable events intended as an early warning system for the pensions regulator of the occurrence of events relating to either the db pension scheme or the scheme employer which may impact on the db pension scheme as a creditor examples include a breach by the employer of financing covenants and certain changes of control with non compliance potentially triggering fines or being considered as a ground for issuance of a cn or both if an event occurs it must be notified in writing to the uk pensions regulator as soon as reasonably practicable in relation to the above the psa introduces the following key changes new grounds for issuing cns two new tests have been introduced to allow the uk pensions regulator to issue cns the employer insolvency test and the employer resources test both these new tests look to the strength of the db pension scheme employer rather than the scheme itself focusing on the effect the proposed act will have on the employer s resources or on the employer s hypothetical insolvency in the context of the potential recovery by the db pension scheme as a creditor these new tests expand the circumstances in which cns can be issued and are likely to be easier for the uk pensions regulator to enforce new criminal and civil offences one of the more controversial elements of the psa is the criminal offences it introduces two new criminal offences now apply to help enforce the moral hazard regime both of which can apply to any person including individuals such as directors regardless of whether that person has any connection to or association with the db pension scheme or its employer 1 conduct that results in avoidance of employer debt to a db pension scheme where the person intended that this is the outcome and 2 conduct that detrimentally affects in a material way the likelihood of accrued db pension scheme benefits being received where the person knew or ought to have known that this would be outcome defences are available if the person had a reasonable excuse for their actions the uk pensions regulator has published guidance on how it plans to exercise its new powers and what will constitute a reasonable excuse conviction under these offences can result in up to seven years imprisonment or unlimited fines or both it is worth noting that there are no specific exceptions to these offences for lenders or financing transactions where there is a db pension scheme within the group and new notifiable events there are two new categories of notifiable event introduced by the psa 1 the sale of a material proportion of the business or assets of a scheme employer in respect of which a decision in principle has been reached and 2 the granting of security on indebtedness which has priority over the db pension scheme if a notifiable event occurs the trustees or managers or the employer of the scheme are obliged to notify the uk pensions regulator as soon as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of the notifiable event the psa introduces an additional notification requirement requiring a notice and statement to be given to the uk pensions regulator that sets out the implications for the scheme in relation to certain employer corporate events and how any risks to the db pension scheme are to be mitigated this is intended to give the uk pensions regulator and db pension scheme trustees greater involvement at an earlier stage a new financial penalty for breach of these obligations of up 1million is introduced along with expansion of the existing criminal liabilities since the 2004 act has been in force db scheme issues have routinely formed part of the due diligence and credit risk assessment for financing transactions together with liaising with the scheme trustees where appropriate to determine the extent of any additional support required to mitigate the impact of the transaction on the scheme while due diligence plays a key role in assessing the existence of any actual or potential db scheme liabilities contractual protections by way of representations or undertakings regarding the existence of and liabilities associated with a db scheme together with undertakings relating to compliance with the db scheme obligations and provision of information to the lenders are also often seen for some transactions receipt of a cn or fsd may trigger an event of default or obtaining clearance from the pensions regulator may be a condition precedent the changes introduced by the psa are likely to result in an increased focus on the above provisions and the structuring of financing arrangements those involved in restructuring transactions are likely to pay particularly close attention to the psa s new provisions early engagement with pension trustees and detailed preparation and professional advice will all be required to minimise the risk of potential liability iv national security and investment act 2021 the national security and investment act 2021 nsia came into force in january 2022 the nsia allows the government to intervene in business transactions in specified sectors including acquisitions and the grant of security which might reasonably raise national security concerns acquisitions in these sensitive sectors designated in the nsia require clearance from the uk government to proceed which will need to be factored into the offer timetable transactions outside those designated sectors may also be affected there is also a voluntary clearance procedure that may be followed in cases where there is concern that the transaction could be called in by the uk government pursuant to the terms of the psa after the event where a transaction falls within the scope of the nsia obtaining clearance will need to be factored into the proposed timetable lenders may request specific contractual protections such as making clearance a condition precedent to funding tax considerations i uk withholding tax payments of interest by a uk borrower or uk branch of a foreign borrower or that otherwise have a uk source and that are made on a loan that is capable of being outstanding for more than one year are subject to uk withholding tax currently at a rate of 20 per cent unless an exemption applies the uk tax regime provides for lenders to receive interest payments free of uk withholding tax if they are uk banks or uk branches of overseas banks that bring that interest into account for uk corporation tax purposes uk tax paying companies or partnerships or uk building societies lenders that are tax resident outside the united kingdom may also receive interest payments free of withholding tax if they qualify under a double tax treaty with the united kingdom treaty lenders in lma terminology as well as satisfying the conditions in the applicable treaty directions must be obtained from her majesty s revenue and customs hmrc stating that the borrower can pay interest without deducting tax the introduction in september 2010 of hmrc s double taxation treaty passport scheme dttps has where applicable improved the time frames within which such directions can be obtained but there remains a greater risk of withholding tax arising in the case of treaty lenders than in the case of uk lenders unless the borrower is a strong credit and has been able to limit its gross up obligation such that it does not apply if clearance is not obtained the scope of the dttps has since been extended such that for loans entered into on or after 6 april 2017 the parties no longer need to be corporates assuming the relevant conditions are satisfied it can now be used if the uk borrower is an individual a partnership or a charity or if a treaty lender is a sovereign wealth fund pension fund partnership or other tax transparent entity provided in the last case that the beneficial owners of the interest are entitled to the same treaty benefits under the same treaty the treatment of uk withholding tax risk in loan documentation is well settled and reflected in the lma s english law templates in summary the borrower is obliged to gross up the amount payable to the lenders should the borrower be required to deduct tax from such payments provided the recipient lender was a qualifying lender on the date of the agreement the effect is to limit the circumstances in which the borrower might become obliged to deduct tax and gross up any payment to a lender to a change in law that results in a day 1 qualifying lender ceasing to be exempt from uk withholding tax ii stamp and documentary taxes no uk stamp or documentary taxes generally apply to loan security or loan trading documentation where a security trustee structure is used assuming the loan is not considered to have equity like characteristics iii fatca the conclusion of intergovernmental agreements igas between the united states and a number of countries including the united kingdom and most of europe has had the effect of largely eliminating the risk of fatca withholding for financial institutions within the scope of those agreements in 2012 the lma produced a series of riders for use with its facility documentation to allocate the risk of fatca compliance and any tax deductions as agreed which have since been updated a number of times rider 3 which entitles all parties to withhold as required but imposes no gross up or indemnity obligation on the borrower has become the standard way of dealing with fatca risk in loan documentation in europe regardless of whether the borrower group includes a us entity or has us source income since 2014 the rider 3 wording has been incorporated into the investment grade agreements and certain other of the lma s templates together with information sharing provisions designed to facilitate compliance with fatca as well as other exchange of information regimes such as the oecd s common reporting standards crs initiative the contractual treatment of fatca risk still requires discussion in transactions involving lenders in non iga jurisdictions where there remains some variation in the agreed positions credit support and subordination i securitytypes of security interests secured lending transactions typically involve a combination of security interests security can be taken over all asset classes and the choice of security interest depends on the nature of the asset and its importance in the context of the security package under english law there are four types of consensual security pledge contractual lien mortgage and charge pledges and contractual liens a pledge is created through transfer of possession where the pledgee has the power to sell the secured assets and to use the proceeds of sale to discharge the secured obligation by contrast under a contractual lien the lienee merely has a passive right of retention until the secured obligation has been performed the distinction between a pledge and a contractual lien is however of very limited practical importance in most corporate financing transactions the reason for this is twofold and stems from a pledge and a contractual lien being possessory security interests first it is not possible to create a pledge or lien over future property or land or over intangible assets that do not fall within a very limited category of documentary intangibles such as bearer bonds second although many companies are willing to provide security as part of the price of obtaining finance they will often wish to retain the ability to use and deal with the secured assets which will not be possible where the secured creditor has possession of the assets in question mortgages mortgages involve the transfer of title to the asset in question to the lender by way of security with a right to the transfer back of the mortgaged property when the secured obligation has been satisfied a mortgage is legal or equitable depending on whether legal or equitable title is transferred 3 the form of transfer will depend on the nature of the asset in question and so for example mortgages over a chose in action e g claims or receivables involve the assignment of rights by way of security the steps required to transfer legal title to an asset and to create security by way of legal mortgage add a layer of complexity that may not be required at the outset of the transaction see further below in general only freehold property significant items of tangible movable property aircraft and ships are the subjects of legal mortgages in relation to other types of assets equitable security is created and the secured creditor relies on contractual further assurance clauses and a security power of attorney to facilitate the transfer of legal title upon the security becoming enforceable charges a charge involves an agreement by the chargor that certain of its property be charged as security for an obligation it entails no transfer of title or possession to the chargee in practice there is little to distinguish a charge from an equitable mortgage as enforcement rights such as a power to take possession sell the secured assets and appoint a receiver are routinely included in documents creating charges 4 the more significant distinction is between fixed and floating charges broadly a fixed charge attaches to a specific asset and restricts the chargor from dealing with e g disposing of that asset a floating charge generally attaches to a class of assets and the chargor is permitted to deal with those assets in the ordinary course of business without the consent of the chargee pending an event that causes the charge to crystallise a typical floating charge will comprise the entirety of the borrower s assets whether existing or future and whether tangible or intangible the main consequence of the characterisation of a charge relates to the ranking of payments on insolvency for example expenses of both liquidations and administrations are paid out of floating charge assets these costs and expenses can be considerable and may well exhaust the floating charge assets a floating charge also ranks behind certain claims of certain preferential creditors broadly certain rights of employees and certain amounts owing to her majesty s revenue and customs and in respect of charges created on or after 15 september 2003 the prescribed part a ring fenced fund is also paid out of floating charge assets to unsecured creditors in priority to the floating chargee unlike expenses the priority of employees dismissed promptly following the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the amount of the ring fenced fund are generally reasonably finite the latter being currently capped at 800 000 and can be roughly calculated in advance by secured lenders the other key difference between fixed and floating charges is that the holder of a floating charge that constitutes a qualifying floating charge broadly a floating charge relating to the whole or substantially the whole of a company s property enjoys very privileged appointment rights in an administration it may appoint an administrator either in court or out of court at any time when the charge is enforceable and is allowed to substitute its own preferred candidate in the place of an administrator proposed to be appointed by any other person these consequences have acted as a strong incentive to lenders to draft charge documents known as debentures which purportedly create fixed security over as many of the chargor s assets as possible combined with a sweeper floating charge over all of the assets of the chargor however when characterising a charge as fixed or floating the courts will have regard to the commercial substance of the relationship between the parties the label attached by the parties themselves will be largely irrelevant and if it is inconsistent with the rights and obligations that the parties have in fact granted one another the security will be recharacterised common methods of taking security the typical method of taking security over specific assets and any perfection steps5 depend on the nature of the asset for example real estate title is transferred to the mortgagee in writing alongside the title deeds if a legal mortgage is to be created an equitable mortgagee will also generally request delivery of the title deeds registered shares a legal mortgagee of shares must be registered as the legal owner which may have adverse tax and accounting consequences for the lenders security is therefore often taken by way of equitable mortgage or fixed charge to facilitate enforcement the certificates for the shares are usually deposited with the chargee together with signed but undated forms of transfer the articles of association are amended if necessary to ensure there are no restrictions on transfer in the event of enforcement intellectual property rights a legal mortgage or assignment of rights to intellectual property by way of security necessitates an exclusive licence back to the assignor to enable it to continue to use the rights including a provision for reassignment on discharge of the security it is therefore more common for such rights to be the subject of a charge the appropriate method of taking security over claims and receivables such as book debts bank accounts and cash varies the key question is whether it is practical to create fixed security if the intention is to create a fixed charge the security document will need to contain adequate restrictions on the chargor s ability to deal with both the asset and its proceeds and those restrictions must be complied with in practice this generally means that the proceeds of charged receivables must be paid into a blocked account this may be achievable in relation to certain specific sums e g the proceeds of a disposal that are to be used to prepay the loans however companies will need access to at least some of their bank accounts so fixed security will not be achievable in all cases formalities and registration formal requirements for english law security are minimal for a variety of reasons however it is generally accepted that security documents should be executed as deeds subject to limited exceptions 6 security interests created by english companies must be registered at companies house within 21 days of creation whether over assets in the united kingdom or abroad and whether created under an english law security document if this is not done the security will be void as against a liquidator administrator or creditor of the company and the secured liabilities will become immediately repayable in addition certain types of assets e g real property ships aircraft and certain intellectual property rights may also be registered generally for priority purposes on specialist registers registrations at companies house and at the land and other specialist asset registries attract nominal fees particular challenges there are no specific categories of asset over which security cannot be granted or over which it is too difficult to create security under english law however third party consent may be required to create some types of security over certain leased items including leasehold real estate and other contractual rights and receivables which may be challenging to obtain the limits of the distinction between fixed and floating charges can be uncertain in particular in its application to cash and receivables and it is not possible to create a legal mortgage of future assets however it is possible to create equitable security equitable mortgage or charge over future assets the terms of the security document may require the chargor to take steps to convert the equitable security into a legal mortgage upon acquisition of the relevant asset the grant of security is also subject to the legal limitations outlined in section v ii guarantees and other forms of credit support guarantees must be documented in writing and are usually executed as deeds to prevent the guarantor from raising any questions about the existence or adequacy of consideration guarantees are the most common form of credit support in both secured and unsecured english law financings the legal limitations outlined in section v apply equally to the provision of guarantees iii priorities and subordinationpriorities the general rule under english law is that as between competing security interests the first in time normally prevails however this is subject in some cases to registration and other exceptions the rules of priority are complex but might very broadly be summarised as follows where registration at a specialist registry is required the priority of competing interests is generally determined by the order of registration registration at companies house does not directly affect priority this registration may however constitute notice to third parties of the existence of the charge which may affect the ranking of subsequent security the priority of successive assignments of a debt or other chose in action is governed by a common law rule under which an assignee who takes an assignment without notice of an earlier assignment and is the first to give notice of assignment to the debtor obtains priority over the earlier assignee a legal interest acquired for value and without notice actual or constructive of a prior equitable interest will normally rank ahead of the prior equitable interest special rules apply to floating charges the grant of a subsequent fixed charge or mortgage takes priority over a floating charge unless at the time the subsequent security is created the floating charge places restrictions on the creation of further encumbrances in the form of a negative pledge which is customarily included in english law financing documents and the subsequent holder has notice of the restriction for this reason a note of the negative pledge is included in the particulars of the charge that are registered at companies house the intention being that anyone who searches the register will thereby acquire actual notice of the restriction registration at companies house may also constitute constructive notice ranking and subordination subordination in banking transactions is typically effected by the use of structural subordination where ranking is determined by which company in the group is a debtor either as a borrower or guarantor to the junior and senior creditors and contractual subordination where creditors contractually agree to the ranking as among themselves contractual subordination is generally achieved through the use of an intercreditor or subordination agreement contractual subordination is often coupled with a turnover trust as a fallback to maximise the recoveries of the senior creditors in an insolvency of the debtor under a basic trust subordination arrangement the junior creditor agrees that any money it receives from the debtor in insolvency e g in the event of mandatory insolvency set off or other mandatory distribution contrary to the intercreditor agreement will be held on trust for the senior creditors to the extent of the senior debt if effective this has the advantage of giving the senior creditors a proprietary claim against the junior creditor and means the senior creditors will not be exposed to credit risk on the junior creditor it is generally agreed that as a matter of english law contractual subordination should be enforceable as between the contracting parties in jurisdictions where trusts are not recognised there is a risk that a junior creditor trustee will be treated as sole owner of the turnover property there is also a limited risk that in the event of an insolvency the turnover trust provisions may be recharacterised as a security interest which would be void for lack of registration there is case law support for the proposition that a turnover trust provision will not be recharacterised as a charge if it is limited to the amounts required to pay the senior creditor in full and it is therefore generally thought that this risk can be mitigated with careful drafting legal reservations and opinions practice i limitations on validity and enforceability of guarantees and security the key issues when considering the validity and enforceability of guarantees and security are capacity and corporate benefit financial assistance rules and the clawback risks that may arise in insolvency these issues which are discussed below are frequently of theoretical concern only and are usually able to be dealt with as a practical matter in a typical transaction ii capacity and corporate benefit to grant valid guarantees and security the grantor must have the requisite capacity and there must be adequate corporate benefit the corporate benefit analysis must be done on a company by company basis and any benefit received by other members of the group may not be relevant unless for example there is an element of reliance and financial interdependence between the companies as well as carefully minuting the perceived benefits if there is any doubt the security provider or guarantor may seek the approval of its shareholders for a company that is solvent at the time of granting the guarantee or security a unanimous shareholder resolution will act to ratify a transaction that might otherwise fall outside the scope of the directors powers and is usually required by secured creditors as a condition precedent to funding in relation to upstream or cross stream guarantees and security iii financial assistance the companies act 2006 restricts the provision of financial assistance including security and guarantees as follows if the target is an english public company neither the target nor any of its subsidiaries public or private may 1 provide financial assistance for the purpose of the acquisition of the shares of the target or of reducing or discharging a liability incurred therefor or 2 if the target is a private holding company no english public subsidiaries of the target may provide financial assistance for this purpose a number of exceptions apply but they are often not relevant in the context of secured lending in practice if security and guarantees are required from the target group following the acquisition the relevant public companies in the target group will be re registered as private companies before the financial assistance is given iv clawback risks under english insolvency laws the court has wide powers to set aside certain transactions guarantees and security provided by an english company or any foreign company subject to english insolvency proceedings may be at risk of being challenged by the insolvency officer if given within a certain period prior to commencement of liquidation or administration and if certain other conditions are satisfied in the case of a guarantee the most likely ground for challenge is that it represents a transaction at an undervalue7 or amounts to a preference 8 in the case of security the most likely grounds for challenge are that the transaction constitutes either a preference or a voidable floating charge 9 the vulnerability periods differ depending on the ground for challenge and are six months for preferences two years if the counterparty is a connected person two years for transactions at an undervalue and one year for a voidable floating charge claim two years if the counterparty is a connected person v preferences for a transaction to be vulnerable as a preference not only must it have been entered into within the specified period but the company must have been influenced by a desire to produce a preferential effect and must have been insolvent as defined by statute at the time of the transaction or become so as a result of entering into it vi transactions at an undervalue for a transaction to be vulnerable under section 238 of the ia it must have been a transaction at an undervalue within the meaning of section 238 4 of the ia and entered into within the vulnerable period further the company must have been insolvent as defined by statute at the time of the transaction or have become so as a result of entering into it in practice this ground for challenge is of relatively limited concern in most secured loan transactions because of the good faith defence that is available this defence applies if it can be shown that the transaction was entered into by the company in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company vii avoidance of certain floating charges under section 245 of the ia a floating charge may be set aside except to the extent of the value given to the company at the same time as or after the creation of the charge if the parties are not connected it is a defence if the company was solvent within the statutory definition when the charge was created and did not become insolvent as a result of the transaction transactions including security arrangements may be vulnerable to challenge on other grounds including that they offend the common law anti deprivation principle which invalidates as a matter of public policy any agreement providing for assets belonging to a company to be removed from its estate on insolvency viii legal opinions practice the practice of delivering legal opinions and the content of those opinions is well established in the english law loan market as a condition precedent to funding lenders require opinions on the capacity and authority of each borrower and guarantor and on the enforceability of the facility documentation including any security documents the general expectation in loan transactions is that counsel to the creditors will deliver any legal opinions this is usually the case in domestic transactions in some circumstances however the borrower s counsel will be called on to provide an opinion syndicated loan opinions are typically addressed to the agent and the lenders forming part of the primary syndicate sometimes where primary syndication takes place after the signing date e g in the case of an underwritten acquisition facility lenders who join the syndicate within a short period of the date of the agreement e g three months will be permitted to rely on the opinion market practice has for some time been to permit the opinion to be disclosed to but not relied on by those who buy participations in the loan or exposure to participations in the loan on the secondary market no further reliance on or disclosure of the opinion is generally permitted without the opinion giver s consent loan trading english law syndicated loan participations are regularly traded most commonly by way of transfer by novation assignment or sub participation novation is the simplest and most common method and involves an outright sale of the participation all of the seller s rights and obligations in relation to the loan are cancelled and discharged and are assumed by the buyer if a facility is secured in favour of the lender directly the security will be released on the novation of the lender s participation to a new lender security for syndicated facilities is however usually created in favour of a security trustee who is appointed as trustee for the lenders from time to time use of a security trustee structure permits lenders to trade their participations without disturbing the effectiveness and priority of the security an assignment of rights to drawn loan participations coupled with an assumption of equivalent obligations is sometimes used as a hybrid method if transfer by novation would disturb security or guarantee arrangements for example in relation to certain foreign law governed arrangements the lma s facility agreement templates contain a framework to permit trading by novation or assignment subject to borrower consent unless the transfer is to another lender or an affiliate of an existing lender or if an event of default is continuing in addition it is common for pre approved lists of permitted transferees referred to as white lists to be agreed the lma templates do not restrict sub participation or other trading methods such as trust or derivatives arrangements that do not involve a change to the lender of record under the facility agreement some borrowers negotiate those restrictions but in most cases these trades can be effected without borrower consent these methods of risk transfer should not disturb any security or guarantees provided in favour of the lender of record or a security trustee acting on its behalf most recently the lma has published revised versions of its standard terms and conditions trade confirmations and forms of participation agreement for secondary market trades to reflect the transition in the primary market from libor to rfrs see further section ii i other issues there are currently no other issues of note outlook and conclusions the increase in activity seen at the end of the 2021 had been expected to continue in 2022 buoyed by good liquidity in the markets and relatively benign borrowing conditions however the invasion of ukraine by russia has cast significant doubt on this with the fallout as the world deals its ramifications likely to bring continued volatility to all markets and so it is difficult to predict with any certainty what the implications for financing transactions will be in terms of legal and regulatory issues while the transition from libor is nearing an end the market will continue to focus on reaching a consensus in relation to us dollar transactions and the transition of non libor currencies the growth in esg lending is expected to continue across the investment grade and leveraged markets for both working capital and event driven financings

fastest year over year jump since 1981 and that was nothing next to what energy prices did fueled by heavy demand and by russia s invasion of ukraine energy costs shot up nearly 42 in the past 12 months the largest such jump since 1980 even if you toss out food and energy prices which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price spike so called core inflation soared 5 9 over the past year consumers have endured the pain in everyday routines unleaded gasoline is up 61 in the past year men s suits jackets and coats 25 airline tickets 34 eggs 33 breakfast sausage 14 under chair jerome powell the federal reserve never anticipated inflation this severe or persistent yet after having been merely an afterthought for decades high inflation reasserted itself with ferocious speed as shortages of labor and supplies ran up against a propulsive rise in demand for goods and services across the economy in february 2021 the consumer price index was running just 1 7 above its level a year earlier from there it accelerated past 2 in march past 4 in april and 5 in may by december consumer prices hit the 7 year over year barrier and on and on it went 7 5 in january 7 9 in february and the increases have topped 8 every month since march the united states has endured worse inflation before but not in many decades the post world war ii inflation peak reached nearly 20 in 1947 a result of the lifting of wartime price curbs supply shortages and pent up consumer demand the inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s peaked at 14 8 in march 1980 before the fed exorcized high prices with aggressive rate hikes that caused brutal back to back recessions in 1980 and 1981 1982 for months powell and some others characterized high inflation as merely a transitory phenomenon while the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession faster than anyone had anticipated no longer now most economists expect inflation to remain painfully elevated well after this year with demand outstripping supplies in numerous areas of the economy so the fed has radically changed course by imposing a succession of large rate hikes the central bank is making a high risk bet that it can slow the economy enough to rein in inflation without weakening it so much as to trigger a recession the overall economy looks healthy for now with a robust job market and extremely low unemployment but many economists warn that the fed s steady credit tightening will likely cause a downturn what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs economic output plunged at a record shattering 31 annual rate in 2020 s april june quarter everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a severe recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed rates among other things by spring of last year the rollout of vaccines had emboldened consumers to return to restaurants bars shops airports and entertainment venues suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others assigned a greater blame to supply shortages and some argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets is high inflation affecting just the united states not by a long shot prices are rising just about everywhere in the world in part a consequence of russia s invasion of ukraine which has elevated energy and food prices and in part because of the supply chain bottlenecks that have driven u s prices up eurostat the statistical service of the european union says it expects year over year inflation to hit 8 6 last month from a year earlier in the 19 countries that share the euro currency and up from an annual increase of 8 1 in may the international monetary fund has forecast that consumer prices in the world s advanced economies will jump 5 7 this year the most since 1984 the imf foresees 8 7 inflation in poorer emerging market and developing countries the highest such rate since 2008 how long will it last no one knows for sure elevated consumer price inflation could endure as long as companies struggle to keep up with consumers demand for goods and services a recovering job market employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and a healthy average of 457 000 a month so far this year means that americans as a whole can afford to keep spending the fed foresees inflation staying above its 2 annual target into 2024 but relief from higher prices might be coming oil prices have been tumbling on fears of an economic downturn jammed up supply chains are showing some signs of improvement at least in industries like transportation commodity prices have begun to fall pay increases have slowed and surveys show that americans expectations for inflation over the long run have eased a trend that often points to more moderate price increases over time what s more the fed s pivot toward an aggressively anti inflationary policy could eventually reduce consumer demand inflation itself is eroding purchasing power and might force some consumers to shave spending at the same time new covid variants could cloud the outlook either by causing outbreaks that force factories and ports to close and further disrupt supply chains or by keeping more people home and reducing demand for goods how are higher prices affecting consumers the strong job market is boosting workers pay though not enough to offset higher prices the labor department says that after accounting for higher consumer prices hourly earnings for private sector employees fell 3 6 last month from a year earlier the 15th straight drop
land values are rising fast in many regions around the world due to low supply high demand rising commodity prices and an increased focus on food production the uk is no exception to this and this may encourage investors to look further afield for new ventures or to expand existing businesses at a lower cost however purchasing in different countries can pose various risks and seeking professional advice is a must farmers weekly asked agents brown co and knight frank what the market was like for farmland around the world and what notable agricultural properties are currently on the market see also find out average farmland prices where you live high prices to remain adam oliver partner at brown co says land prices have been firming around the globe for some time and the current russia ukraine conflict has simply added fuel to the fire we have seen an average 21 increase in land values over the last 18 months across the us poland romania uruguay and australia in our opinion the mix of supply side challenges 40 year inflation highs plus the prospects of agriculture being part of the carbon solution rather than part of the problem mean this upward trajectory is not going away any time soon said mr oliver will matthews head of farms and estates at knight frank is not expecting the land market to soften in the short term and suggests that with less land becoming available more environmental investors looking to buy and food security back on the agenda values are likely to go in only one direction there is such a shortage of stock at the moment and everything that is trading currently is trading well he said there is still a lot of pressure on the market from farmers with rollover money from development tax driven investors and lots of big landowners looking to get bigger then when you throw into the mix rewilders and those looking at environmental enhancement the land market has never been hotter there are reports of land in some regions of belgium trading at about 30 000 acre 25 900 according to mr matthews eurostat data shows that average land value in belgium in 2014 was 15 600 acre 13 300 united states in the us corn belt 20 000 is the new 10 000 according to brown co land prices in the midwest had stood at about 10 000 acre 8 300 for the past few years but land has been sold throughout spring 2022 for about 20 000 acre 16 500 mr oliver says the factors driving land values in the us are similar to elsewhere but are slightly exaggerated in the midwest commodity prices have effectively doubled driving competition for land and pushing up rents interest rates are increasing from historically low levels which means buyers are wanting to lock in long term low rates now before they rise further inflation is currently at a 40 year high and buyers often cite strong land performance in times of high inflation as one of the driving factors for entering the market as a result there has been a 38 increase in land prices since 2020 according to brown co data uruguay the expansion of the port in the capital montevideo is increasing opportunities for international trade within south america in recent years the land market in uruguay has softened due to poor commodity prices and investors from argentina seeking to exit according to brown co however land prices have risen 11 during the past year in the south of the country for double cropping land to more than 2 500 acre australia during 2021 land prices in australia increased on average by 20 low interest rates strong prices for commodities and favourable seasonal conditions are all helping to

2021 to 957 acre in the northern territory land values fell by 19 to just 115 acre however this figure is slightly skewed by recent sales of large cattle stations while smaller properties still

the biden administration is warning pharmacies not to discriminate against women who may seek reproductive health prescriptions including some that might be involved in ending a pregnancy the department of health and human services said wednesday that pharmacies receiving federal money from programs such as medicare and medicaid could not discriminate in how they supply medications or advise patients on prescriptions the agency noted that discrimination against people based on their pregnancy or related conditions would be a form of sex discrimination the announcement comes as the administration seeks to ensure reproductive health services for women following last month s supreme court decision that ended a constitutional right to abortion on monday the administration told hospitals that they must provide abortion services if the mother s life is at risk the government said federal law on emergency treatment guidelines preempts state laws in jurisdictions that now ban the procedure without any exceptions now all states provide an exception for the life of the mother president joe biden also has signed an executive order to try to protect some access to the procedure still he also has acknowledged that his administration is limited in what it can do he noted earlier this month that an act of congress would be required to restore nationwide access to abortion services and he has urged americans angered by the supreme court s ruling to vote in november wednesday s actions like those outlined monday do not reflect the new policy they aim to remind care providers of their existing obligations under federal law we are committed to ensuring that everyone can access health care free of discrimination health and human services secretary xavier becerra said in a statement this includes access to prescription medications for reproductive health and other types of care the department s guidance to pharmacies outlined several hypothetical examples of potential discrimination they include a pharmacy that refuses to fill a prescription of mifepristone followed by misoprostol to help manage complications from a miscarriage after a pregnancy loss that combination of drugs also is commonly used in medication abortions a pharmacy that refuses to fill a prescription of misoprostol prescribed to help deal with severe stomach ulcer complications may be discriminating based on disability hhs said the agency noted that the pharmacy also might be discriminating if it refuses to stock the drug based on its alternate use hhs also cited as another example of potential discrimination a pharmacy that refuses to fill a prescription for methotrexate to halt an ectopic pregnancy which grows outside the womb and is not viable the federal agency said people who believe their rights have been violated should visit an online portal for the office for civil rights to file a complaint newsy is the nation s only free 24 7 national news network you can find newsy using your tv s digital antenna or stream for free see all the ways you can watch newsy here

while the world s big private business pours billions of dollars in producing automatic machines and assuring their optimal functioning barley no money has been invested in the hundreds of millions human workers who are left shockingly unprotected treated like cheap robots or even worse for example of all domestic workers worldwide overwhelmingly women up to 94 lack access to the full range of protections covering medical care sickness unemployment old age employment injury family maternity invalidity and survivors benefits this means that only 6 of their total number estimated at over 75 millions worldwide have access to comprehensive social protection in its mid june 2022 report making the right to social security a reality for domestic workers the international labour organization ilo also informs that about half of all domestic workers have no coverage at all with the remaining half legally covered by at least one benefit the extension of effective coverage has lagged significantly behind that of legal coverage ilo explains only one in five domestic workers are actually covered in practice because the vast majority are employed informally despite their vital contribution to society supporting households with their most personal and care needs most of the world s 75 6 million domestic workers face multiple barriers to enjoying legal coverage and effective access to social security the report explains they are often excluded from national social security legislation as 76 2 of domestic workers 57 7 million people are women such social protection gaps leave them particularly vulnerable most of them do not have access to social insurance schemes benefits related to unemployment or employment injury also according to the world s main labour body the report also highlights major differences between regions in europe and central asia 57 3 of domestic workers are legally covered for all benefits a little more than 10 of domestic workers are legally covered for all benefits in the americas almost none are fully covered in the arab states asia and the pacific and africa regions that include countries where significant numbers of domestic workers are employed the covid 19 pandemic has made glaringly apparent the social protection coverage gaps experienced by domestic workers they were among the worst hit during the pandemic with many losing their jobs and livelihoods many of those who kept their jobs were often exposed to the disease without sufficient protective equipment however domestic workers could rarely rely on adequate health protection sickness or unemployment benefits further exposing their vulnerabilities tragically the unprotected tens of millions domestic workers are not the only case of human rights abuse for example asia remains the garment factory of the world yet the sector faces an array of challenges many of which have been accelerated by the covid 19 pandemic according to a 24 june new ilo report employment wages and productivity in the asian garment sector taking stock of recent trends the study highlights how the industry still accounts for 55 of global textiles and clothing exports and employs some 60 million workers the situation has been exacerbated by the impact of covid 19 a biological hazard as any micro organism cell or other organic material that may be of plant animal or human origin including any which have been genetically modified and which can cause harm to human health explains the international labour organzation this may include but is not limited to bacteria viruses parasites fungi prions dna materials bodily fluids and other microorganisms and their associated allergens and toxins both infectious and non infectious biological hazards can be a significant health threat in numerous sectors and workplaces worldwide for example communicable diseases alone are estimated to have caused 310 000 work related deaths worldwide in 2021 120 000 of which were due to covid 19 to deal with this alarming issue experts from governments and employers and workers organisations meeting at the international labour organisation geneva 20 to 24 june adopted guidelines for handling biological hazards in the working environment they provide specific advice aligned with international labour standards on preventing and controlling work related injuries diseases and deaths related to exposure to biological hazards in the working environment this includes questions related to the responsibilities and rights of competent authorities employers occupational health services and workers workplace risk management workers health surveillance and preparedness and response to emergencies social protection for rural workers remains a dream according to a report launched in geneva on 7 july 2022 by the bureau for workers activities actrav part of the un s international labour organization this is of particular concern for those in precarious work conditions including informal casual temporary and subcontracted workers and day labourers who form the large majority of workers on agricultural plantations laid out in the study decent work deficits among rural workers based on 16 case studies covering 15 countries in africa asia central asia europe and latin america the report shows that deficits in working conditions are found in every sector and in relation to every substantive element covered by the framework of the ilo s decent work indicators it reveals that child and forced labour as well as debt bondage remain a reality for many worldwide up to 95 of children engaged in hazardous work are employed in agriculture notably in the cocoa palm oil and tobacco sectors and forced labour is linked to the many ways workers are dependent on employers meanwhile about 80 of the world s poor live in rural areas many of whom face severe decent work deficits including inadequate safety low pay lack of stability and security and excessive working hours with women and young workers hit the hardest and women are disproportionately represented in the most precarious positions having to accept low paying low skilled jobs suffer huge gender pay gaps and are more prone to workplace harassment and abuse compared to male workers the report reveals the report also describes chemical exposure as posing serious health and other risks to agricultural workers particularly to children and pregnant and lactating women most rural workers operate in the informal economy which includes a large proportion of women working as unpaid care workers who have no access to maternity leave and other essential protections add to all the above that over 60 of world workers are not recognised not registered not protected in fact the un reports that more than 60 of the world s adult labour force or about 2 billion workers work in the informal economy they are not recognised registered regulated or protected under labour legislation and social protection the consequences can be severe for individuals families as well as economies maybe because they are humans inter press service

after clinching deal with imf pakistan plans to generate around 10bn in loans file photo islamabad after striking a staff level agreement with the imf pakistan has made plans to generate approximately 9 to 10 billion in loans from other multilateral creditors including the world bank asian development bank and islamic development bank through programme and project lending during the current fiscal year the revival of the imf program will pave the way for provision of a letter of comfort loc from the fund and the revival of program policy lending from the wb adb and idb the imf s executive board is expected to meet after the second week of august 2022 for considering the combined approval of the 7th and 8th reviews and the release of 1 17 billion tranche under the extended fund facility eff however the revival of the imf program hinges upon price increases only and the fund failed to mention any desired structural reforms for removing bottlenecks of the economy that ultimately resulted in the surfacing of twin deficits known as the budget deficit and the current account deficit the imf literally ignored the rising inflation in its statement on the occasion of striking staff level agreement with pakistani authorities giving strength to the perception that washington based lender is totally indifferent to miseries being faced by inflation stricken middle income salaried and pensioners the flow of circular debt touching rs850 billion has raised many eyebrows because there is total electricity billing of rs1 600 billion out of which piling up of circular debt of rs850 billion caused shocks and alarm bells among the policymakers the imf statement also confirmed that the government had allocated rs68 billion to rs72 for provision of sasta petrol and sasta diesel which is a peanut amount in the aftermath of escalating inflationary pressures when contacted about plans for the imf s executive board meeting minister for finance miftah ismail on thursday said that it would be held after second week of august 2022 for approving pakistan s request for release of 1 17 billion tranche to another query regarding resumption of program loans from other multilateral creditors miftah ismail replied that pakistan was expecting 9 billion as budgetary project loans and there would be a separate amount from the imf as well so in totality there are indications that islamabad will muster up dollar loans of approximately 10 billion from multilateral creditors during the current fiscal year 2022 23 a statement issued by the imf on thursday morning stated that an international monetary fund imf team led by nathan porter has finalized discussions for the combined seventh and eight reviews of pakistan s economic program supported by an imf extended fund facility eff at the conclusion of the discussions porter stated the imf team has reached a staff level agreement sla with the pakistan authorities for the conclusion of the combined seventh and eight reviews of the eff supported program the agreement is subject to approval by the imf s executive board subject to board approval about 1 177 million sdr 894 million will become available bringing total disbursements under the program to about 4 2 billion additionally in order to support program implementation and meet the higher financing needs in fy23 as well as catalyze additional financing the imf board will consider an extension of the eff until end june 2023 and an augmentation of access by sdr720 million that will bring the total access under the eff to about us 7 billion pakistan is at a challenging economic juncture a difficult external environment combined with procyclical domestic policies fuelled domestic demand to unsustainable levels the resultant economic overheating led to large fiscal and external deficits in fy22 contributed to rising inflation and eroded reserve buffers to stabilise the economy and bring policy actions in line with the imf supported program while protecting the vulnerable policy priorities include steadfast implementation of the fy2023 budget the budget aims to reduce the government s large borrowing needs by targeting an underlying primary surplus of 0 4 percent of gdp underpinned by current spending restraint and broad revenue mobilisation efforts focused particularly on higher income taxpayers development spending will be protected and fiscal space will be created for expanding social support schemes the provinces have agreed to support the federal government s efforts to reach the fiscal targets and memoranda of understanding have been signed by each provincial government to this effect catch up in power sector reforms on the back of weak implementation of the previously agreed plan the power sector circular debt cd flow is expected to grow significantly to about prs850 billion in fy22 overshooting program targets threatening the power sector s viability and leading to frequent power outages the authorities are committed to resuming reforms including critically the timely adjustment of power tariff including for the delayed annual rebasing and quarterly adjustments to improve the situation in the power sector and limit loadshedding proactive monetary policy to guide inflation to more moderate levels headline inflation exceeded 20 percent in june hurting particularly the most vulnerable in this regard the recent monetary policy increase was necessary and appropriate and monetary policy will need to be geared towards ensuring that inflation is brought steadily down to the medium term objective of 5 7 percent importantly to enhance monetary policy transmission the rates of the two major refinancing schemes efs and ltff which have over recent months been raised by 700 bps and 500 bps respectively will continue to be linked to the policy rate greater exchange rate flexibility will help cushion activity and rebuild reserves to more prudent levels reducing poverty and strengthen social safety during fy22 the unconditional cash transfer uct kafalat scheme reached nearly 8 million households with a permanent increase in the stipend to prs14 000 per family while a one off cash transfer of prs2 000 sasta fuel sasta diesel sfsd was granted to about 8 6 million families to alleviate the impact of rampant inflation for fy23 the authorities have allocated prs364 billion to bisp up from prs 250 in fy22 to be able to bring 9 million families into the bisp safety net and further extend the sfsd scheme to additional non bisp lower middle class beneficiaries strengthen governance to improve governance and mitigate corruption the authorities are establishing a robust electronic asset declaration system and plan to undertake a comprehensive review of the anticorruption institutions including the national accountability bureau to enhance their effectiveness in investigating and prosecuting corruption cases steadfast implementation of the outlined policies underpinning the sla for the combined seventh and eighth reviews will help create the conditions for sustainable and more inclusive growth the authorities should nonetheless stand ready to take any additional measures necessary to meet program objectives given the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets the imf team thanks the pakistani authorities private sector and development partners for fruitful discussions and cooperation during the discussions when contacted dr khaqan najeeb former adviser ministry of finance said it was indeed comforting to see that pakistan and the imf have reached a staff level agreement this paves the way for the completion of the 7th and the 8th review it should alleviate fears of a near term challenging scenario and unlock funding from other multilateral lenders and friendly countries all this should help build pakistan s foreign exchange reserves that have fallen below 10 billion one hopes that this will calm the fx and euro bonds market which have been quite uneasy for the past few months he explained it would be wise to think of the next few months as breathing space with realization of the severity of challenges both on the domestic and global front the energy sector would be the most challenging the circular debt of rs850 billion reached in fy22 in the power sector is far above what one would have hoped and seriously threatens financial viability of the power sector at a time of global energy shortages much beyond pricing adjustments are needed to create sustainability including reforms of discos a new tariff strengthening the policy and regulatory environment besides negotiation with ipps he concluded

editor s note monthly ticket is a cnn travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world in july we re hitting the trails to explore the world s greatest hikes cnn hiking is often derided by adrenaline addicts as somehow lesser than more hardcore mountain experiences like climbing or skiing but as these challenging trails show putting one foot in front of the other isn t always the easy option to undertake these famous hikes you ll need more than just a hefty dose of gumption these routes are dangerous and for experienced hikers only that means those with the right gear the ability to get themselves out of tricky situations and a willingness to plan for the worst and pack accordingly whether you want to try out a vertiginous english lake district classic or tackle the most dangerous hike in the world in rural china this list has got you covered striding edge lake district england the lake district s famously changeable weather can make even the most bucolic of strolls a challenge but striding edge a sharp arête leading to the summit of helvellyn the third highest peak in lake district national park stands apart in this corner of england hikers can choose to follow the paths that run along the side of the ridge but for those keen on thrills the ridge itself is where it s at on a clear day the views are sensational stretching all the way to scotland this is not for novices or the faint of heart walkers will need to be prepared to scramble have decent climbing skills for the final push to the top and know how to properly navigate if the clouds roll in ice and snow make it lethal in winter so preparation and a willingness to turn back are a must the maze canyonlands utah united states the national park service cuts right to the chase when it comes to the maze it calls hiking here very challenging warning of slick rocks and steep drops it s the most remote part of canyonlands with visitors needing to negotiate long drives on dirt roads before setting out into the deep gullies where rockfalls and flash floods are not uncommon and water from the area s few springs is hard to come by packing enough fluid for a multi day trip is a must park rangers demand all visitors share their itineraries and stay in touch as often as practicable those that do come will be treated to landscapes that feel utterly timeless and will be unlikely to encounter other people on their adventures either huashan china on this trail hikers must follow planks of wood bolted into the rock face maciej bledowski istock editorial getty images this epic trail to the south peak of huashan one of china s five great mountains is often billed as the most dangerous hike in the world and for good reason to reach the summit which stands at 7 070 feet hikers need to scale uneven steps and a series of ladders before hooking themselves onto a chain using a harness and carabiners to traverse its renowned plank walk this is as basic as it sounds planks of wood bolted into the rock face which you follow both up and down the mountain while many tourists come in just sneakers and t shirts this is not a place to arrive unprepared proper hiking boots plenty of food and water and a decent level of fitness are essential giro del sorapiss italy the dolomites are home to a series of stomach churning via ferrata literally ways of iron paths of metal rungs hammered into the rock during world war i when italian and austrian troops fought fierce battles across the region s limestone peaks today hikers looking for the thrill of climbing without the fear of long falls flock here during the spring and summer months the giro del sorapiss offers the biggest challenge of them all starting from rifugio vandelli before heading high into the mountains along sheer rock faces and taking in three separate via ferrata hikers will need harnesses for clipping into the lines as well as a helmet and ideally a guide who can provide the requisite equipment and show the way drakensberg grand traverse south africa and lesotho multi day hikes offer intrepid walkers the chance to test their skills to the limit with changing weather and the need to carry ample supplies creating a real challenge the drakensberg grand traverse certainly represents one an epic 230 kilometer 143 miles journey that can take up to two weeks to complete it kicks off with a climb up a set of chain ladders to the drakensberg escarpment before heading over the border with lesotho and eventually heading back into south africa this long distance monster can be attempted alone but hikers should be aware that the trail itself is more of a concept than a visible path meaning anyone planning to head here will need all of the kzn wildlife drakensberg hiking maps a gps and enough food and water to last for the entire trip spring or fall visits are recommended avoiding the lush hard to walk on grass of summer and the bitter days of winter cascade saddle new zealand the reward endless vistas of snow capped peaks ondrej adobe stock in the heart of mount aspiring national park on new zealand s south island cascade saddle offers some of the finest mountain views in the world but having seen a number of deaths earlier this century due to slippery rocks and treacherous conditions the country s conservation department is keen to emphasize that this is a route only for people with navigation and high level backcountry skills and experience warning those who do come to be prepared to turn back if things get hairy completed over two days with the option to camp or bunk up in mountain huts along the way the route includes wild scrambles rocky outcrops and hikes over ankle cracking tussocky grass the reward is endless vistas of snow capped peaks including the stunning mount aspiring also known by its maori name of tititea kalalau trail hawaii a 22 mile out and back along the na pali coast of kauai the kalalau trail isn t just hawaii s most dangerous hike it s one of the most lethal in the entire united states the jungle trail cleaves to the coastline with the pacific raging below you ll need a permit to go beyond hanakapiai beach to hanakoa valley in order to camp either in the valley or at kalalau beach while it sounds idyllic the trio of stream crossings here can be brutal in the wake of heavy rain when the water swells to extremely high levels throw in a vertiginous path along crawler s ledge and it s a recipe for disaster for the inexperienced only those with proper outdoor smarts need apply huayna picchu peru anyone who has seen a picture of peru s wildly popular machu picchu will have caught a glimpse of huayna picchu it s the towering peak which sits behind the incas famous lost city seen in countless instagram posts and on postcards sent home from south america getting to the top however requires scaling the unsubtly titled stairs of death a section of 500 year old steps with sheer drops down to the valley below throw in ladder sections that leave even the most hardened hikers feeling queasy and this is a route that isn t to be underestimated while plenty come unprepared hiking boots and the help of a local guide are highly advisable it may seem daunting but the view of the citadel below is worth the three hour effort kokoda track papua new guinea the kokoda track takes up to two weeks to complete andrew peacock stone rf getty images at 96 kilometers around 60 miles the kokoda track charts a route from just outside of the papuan capital of port moresby to the village of kokoda crossing the owen stanley range this is isolated terrain with a trek taking up to two weeks to complete thanks to afternoon deluges raging torrents and conditions that can become treacherously slippery thanks to ankle deep mud and tree roots growing slippery in the tropical heat following the death of 13 australians heading to the track in a light aircraft in 2009 authorities have moved to make access to the path safer permits are required and all visitors must walk with a licensed operator in a bid to help local communities benefit from tourism to prepare for the sweaty days and bitter nights in this remote corner of the world organizers recommend training for up to a year when trekking this verdant and wild route it pays to remember it was the scene of vicious battles between japanese and allied australian and papuan forces during world war ii daikiretto traverse japan japan s northern alps serve up arguably the best and certainly the most challenging hiking in the country and the daikiretto traverse is unquestionably the route to try for hikers looking for a proper adventure one that s as close as they ll get to a technical climb without the need for ropes the traverse itself covers less than two miles but can take hours to complete and is best undertaken as part of a longer guided trek through this beautiful range the path over the traverse makes use of chains and ladders following a knife edge ridge with drops of over a hundred meters on either side a high level of fitness and a head for heights are musts a helmet and gloves will make passage easier and it should be noted that attempting it alone especially in winter is ill advised mount washington new hampshire united states mount washington is known for being home to the world s worst weather at least according to the mount washington observatory in january 2004 temperatures at the summit plunged to a bitter 47º f 44º c while it also set a record for the fastest wind recorded on land a barely believable 231 mph 372 kph in 1934 only surpassed in 1996 on barrow island australia all that s to say that hiking here requires serious preparation conditions can flip at any minute meaning you ll need to pack winter gear even in the height of summer the ascent is no joke with hikers needing to be in great shape to achieve it yes it s possible to drive or take the iconic cog train to the summit but anyone who s well prepared and keen on a challenge should pull on their boots fill their backpacks and do so on foot

the candidates fighting to replace boris johnson as conservative party leader and britain s prime minister reflect the country s rich diversity the england hating new york times put it earlier this week through gritted teeth with six having recent ancestors hailing from outside europe it might seem initially curious that it s the conservatives who are so ethnically diverse in british politics the realignment over brexit caused identity to replace economics as the crunch issue so that the gap between labour and tory voters on the issues of immigration and diversity has significantly grown even if immigration s salience has declined and remains low yet despite this the british right has become in some ways more diverse than the left at least at the top among the candidates to be prime minister were the last three chancellors of the exchequer sajid javid rishi sunak and nadhim zahawi all of asian or middle eastern descent javid previously ran the home office in 2019 handing over that great office of state to priti patel diversity in government is historically less common in democracies than it is in empires where minorities were often found in the court of byzantium moorish spain or ottoman turkey in zahawi s native iraq saddam hussein s foreign secretary was a christian but that was precisely because tariq aziz could never take his place yet zahawi as a muslim could have become ruler of britain he might still get another bite judging by the turnover of tory pms democracies have historically been far more homogenous in composition and where they are multicultural voters tend to align along semi ethnic lines although rarely in a clear cut way in the united states polarisation exists on the dimensions of density marital status religion and education but as the us has become more diverse the percentage of whites voting republican has crept up in 2016 it became significant enough to elect a populist who appealed to white fears of lost status yet it wasn t that straightforward and trump s vote share among minorities slightly increased in 2020 that s partly because alignment over identity doesn t entail whites vs the rest of the world in a way that both white nationalists and progressives imagine but a more complicated overlap that pushes many minorities to the right or at least away from the left just as democracy and liberalism are not always ideal bedfellows neither are multiculturalism and liberalism a sign of things to come was labour s loss of harrow council in may the one shining light of hope for the tories in london and seen as a symptom of indian disaffection with the people s party most popular robin ashenden the sacking of frank skinner is a loss to british comedy pinner in harrow is one of the most pleasant places in greater london a lovely english suburb populated by upper middle class asians a gujarati richard curtis film and gujaratis are examples of what amy chua described as market dominant minorities in her book world on fire with gujarati names consistently turning up on rich lists and the alumni of top schools and universities market dominant minorities in chua s analysis are ethnic groups involved in trade who come to enjoy disproportionate wealth and often dominance in areas like education and property and as a result historically suffer persecution members of market dominant minorities often feel a great deal of loyalty to imperial rule because when imperial forces withdraw the majority turn on them young farrokh bulsara s family had a portrait of the queen in their hounslow home because once the british left zanzibar they were soon forced out by the african majority in austro hungary jews were extremely loyal to the habsburg rulers who for centuries had given them protection when the habsburgs were pushed out their world soon fell apart in the former british colonies of east africa asians were recruited to build railways and run the administration eventually forming a typical market dominant minority when the british exited post colonial leaders began to beat the nationalist drum and soon the asians property was stolen and many were expelled idi amin literally had a dream in which god told him to expel the asians and decided that dreams can come true of the 15 asian tory mps elected at the last election five are of ugandan or kenyan origin including priti patel rishi sunak and suella braverman the latter considered the torchbearer of the right in this week s contest patel is of gujarati descent and some years back it was estimated that a patel was one hundred times more likely than a smith to be a millionaire the modern day equivalent of a drop of huguenot blood being worth a thousand pounds the home secretary s background has often invited some fairly bizarre and unfair criticism one being that her own family wouldn t have been able to arrive here using her criteria many of my ancestors arrived on longships and i m pretty sure they would fail the home office interview yet looking at the history of the empire and of post colonial rule it doesn t seem strange that a patel might not desire demographic anarchy in her home neither is it strange that many non whites might not be particularly attracted to the mood music of labour which is influenced by american ideas of equity equity means equality of outcomes which underneath the platitudes boils down to the avaricious zero sum idea that we are poor because they are rich it is the undercurrent behind every vicious outbreak of communal violence against minorities who are seen as unfairly gaining an advantage by profiting from trade white britons who have no family or historical experience of being a minority might find fanonism a belief in violent anti colonial revolution romantic and rebellious but the reality is usually grim just as democracy and liberalism are not always ideal bedfellows neither are multiculturalism and liberalism and labour as the party of multiculturalism has lost a part of its soul to its electoral calculations it is why british jews voted conservative in overwhelming numbers at the last two elections part of a trend that predates corbyn although accelerated by him the overwhelming push has been labour s increasing dependency on muslim voters in a number of constituencies which has meant recruiting activists and even candidates with virulently anti israeli and anti semitic views they are on the left because they are opposed to imperialism and they are the sort of anti imperialists every minority dreads elsewhere in the british empire independence for nigeria led to an unsuccessful push for independence by the igbo a group sometimes called the jews of west africa an analogy many take pride in failed by britain biafra lost the war and large numbers of igbo emigrated to the united states while nigeria s other main market dominant minority the yoruba were much more likely to head to the former colonial power yoruba speakers today have among the highest average gsce results of any ethnic group in england so although african caribbean voters heavily lean towards labour and the windrush tradition forms a core part of modern labour identity it is not surprisingly that the first british black prime minister may be a yoruba woman in the form of kemi badenoch as the conservatives increasingly become the party of market dominant minorities contrary to the fanonist view held by progressives badenoch has in the past said i don t care about colonialism because know what we were doing before colonialism got there they came in and just made a different bunch of winners and losers there was never any concept of rights so people who lost out were old elites not everyday people a blooming good offer subscribe to the spectator this spring and get 3 months for just 3 claim offer that is something a white conservative mp might struggle to articulate and it is noticeable that today the black and asian tory candidates are very much on the right of the party with braverman pledging to withdraw from the european convention on human rights so that immigration can be better controlled in contrast penny mordaunt supported gender self identification and wrote a book which condemned white privilege as the roman empire collapsed it was often the sons and grandsons of germanic kings who cared most about its ideals and its survival perhaps better understanding what the alternative was those of old roman stock had just stopped believing in rome so it is today with the strongest torchbearers of toryism now of immigrant descent the ones who truly care about its ideals and survival
car registrations are a key leading indicator they provide a preview of how the economy will perform in future in the aftermath of the 2008 2009 financial crisis world car sales turned into a steadily climbing one way street from just over 60 million units in 2009 the global number of passenger vehicles sold grew to around 92 million by 2017 according to the international energy agency iea this figure remained unchanged in 2018 however and declined slightly in 2019 to 88 million in 2020 global car sales collapsed to 73 million says the iea covid 19 along with the resultant government restrictions caused a speedy and savage recession it was a very painful period for the world s car manufacturers as normality gradually returned in mid 2021 with fear receding and lockdowns easing world registrations recovered well for last year as a whole they were up by roughly 5 according to data from statista despite various supply chain problems indeed the sales rebound was so strong it outstripped car manufacturing capacity which was curbed by a global semiconductor shortage subscribe to moneyweek subscribe to moneyweek today and get your first six magazine issues absolutely free

are crucial to infotainment systems and creature comforts as well as many of the advanced driver assistance aids that have become mandatory for five star safety scores notes joshua dowling of drive as we examine later inadequate supplies of chips created a damaging car supply crunch as manufacturers couldn t meet their production targets let alone booming demand the shortage of new vehicles saw the prices of second hand cars soar to crazy levels in the us the bureau of labour statistics reported that the consumer price index for both used cars and trucks rose by 41 from january 2021 to january 2022 the average cost of a used american car climbed by about 50 according to data from car pricing site black book another slowdown however global car sales have since broken down once again from january to may 2022 total registrations of new passenger cars in the eu were 13 7 lower than in the same period the previous year sales decreased in italy by 24 3 in france by 16 9 in spain by 11 5 and in germany by 9 3 according to the european automobile manufacturers association in parallel june 2022 sales volumes in the us were down by 13 5 from their level of 12 months ago notes thomas feltmate senior economist at td economics the us has experienced similar difficulties to europe again the registration decline suggests that a recession could be around the corner even if the present problems still appear to be caused by supply chain constraints rather than declining interest from consumers granted car sales in china now the world s largest car market rose by almost 23 in june from a year earlier as production recovered in lockdown hit shanghai to meet pent up demand but government cash incentives stimulated purchases notes the wall street journal so the data can t be taken at face value and a more realistic assessment of china s car sales can only be made when those incentives expire the british position meanwhile has been particularly grim june 2022 new car sales plummeted by a dire 24 3 compared with the same month in 2021 just 140 958 new cars left showrooms according to official figures that made last month the worst june for car sales since 1996 again british car showrooms have experienced similar problems to europe and the us while demand has held up so far the semiconductor shortage has continued to bite and inflation concerns have overshadowed the market supply chain crises what is really concerning however is how carmakers problems are now stacking up partly in ways that weren t immediately obvious when russia began its invasion of ukraine take neon gas it s vital to the lasers that are used in manufacturing semiconductors prior to russia s military activities ukraine purified neon that was a by product of russian steel manufacturing and exported it says automotive news indeed ukraine probably supplied between 50 and 70 of the world s neon gas now the russian government has reportedly restricted the export of noble gases including neon says global times in response to the eu s fifth sanctions round so not only have russian neon exports been curbed ukraine s gas purification capacity has also been compromised by the war this is causing ongoing restrictions in semiconductor output while chip makers will eventually secure new neon sources the process will take time in other words the semiconductor supply chain shortage is set to worsen before it improves another factor creating supply chain disruption has been china s zero tolerance approach to curbing covid 19 bottlenecks at chinese ports are taking a long time to resolve labour negotiations at us ports are causing further problems and global consumer confidence has been hit by the ukraine conflict while retail price inflation has started to soar the latter has two main effects it raises new car prices and it hits buyers pockets so far carmakers have managed to make up for lost volume by charging higher prices though it s unclear how much higher they can go says bloomberg meanwhile the rising cost of living is eroding consumers real inflation adjusted incomes in other words they have less cash to splash on new vehicles having cut its forecast for western european passenger car sales in each of the past four months industry analyst lmc automotive now expects annual deliveries to dip by 6 this year to less than ten million units that s a massive downgrade from its forecast in january when lmc was expecting nearly 9 growth global vehicle sales will shrink by 5 in 2022 germany s centre for automotive research car told neil winton in forbes the global car market will have thus fallen below the level of the first corona year 2020 and will reach its lowest level in ten years says car director ferdinand dudenhoeffer the one bright spot yet there is one bright spot amid the gloom sales of zero carbon battery electric vehicles bevs are booming though this doesn t apply to hybrids which have internal combustion engines as well as electric motors whose sales are struggling in the us bev sales increased by 60 year on year to 158 689 in the first quarter of 2022 according to car registration data from experian reaching a new record market share of 4 6 among the top ten all electric cars in the us four were tesla models and three were from hyundai according to trade magazine insideevs including the korean carmaker s ioniq 5 the only other cars in the top ten were the ford mustang mach e the nissan leaf and the volkswagen id 4 pictured right hyundai sold 15 414 units including 8 450 cars under the kia badge one third owned by hyundai and 6 964 vehicles under its own name the company s total sales in the period were twice those of ford uk bev registrations in june 2022 were 22 737 up 15 year on year says sales company heycar this means there are now an estimated 477 000 electric cars on the road in britain their market share has reached 16 1 up from 10 7 in 2021 so the future for all electric cars is looking even more promising than before says the iea despite strains along global supply chains sales kept rising strongly into 2022 it notes with two million electric cars sold worldwide in the first quarter up by three quarters from the same period a year earlier certainly soaring prices of key materials for making batteries essential for all electric cars are a concern russia provides 20 of global battery grade nickel so there are supply worries following it sinvasion of ukraine meanwhile china has a stranglehold over lithium ion battery manufacture it has 70 of the production capacity for cathodes and 85 for anodes again both vital components other impediments such as the uk cutting its electric car grant scheme a year earlier than expected may appear but the iea also notes that a growing number of countries have ambitious vehicle electrification targets for the coming decades and many carmakers have plans to electrify their fleets that go beyond policy targets move over gasoline powered cars say lisa martine jenkins in protocol more electric vehicles are set to take the road and adoption might be even faster than previous analyses have forecast just one year ago the consultancy bcg projected that battery electric vehicles would make up 11 of global new light vehicle sales in 2025 and 45 in 2035 now the group s latest analysis found that battery powered evs will amount to 20 of global sales by 2025 and 59 in 2035 they are projected to be the most popular type of light vehicle sold by 2028 three years earlier than they found in 2021 the best electric car makers to buy history shows that car manufacturing is not a particularly appealing area for investors researching and developing new vehicles is very expensive this means that vehicle makers are very capital intensive and can suffer significant balance sheet strains what s more the business can be highly cyclical vehicle makers may find that their very expensive product launches coincide with recessions that crush sales just when these car companies need a strong tailwind looking for suitable investments in the sector therefore can prove difficult chinese electric vehicle maker byd has a stratospheric valuation meanwhile tesla is the clear choice from the above list of popular all electric cars in the us but despite dropping by 40 from their november 2021 peak the shares still look very expensive tesla has a current market capitalisation of 760bn yet it only delivered just over a quarter of a million vehicles in this year s second quarter japanese giant toyota by contrast has a market value of 214bn and sold 514 100 vehicles in the us alone over the same three month period despite having to recall more than 2 000 all electric suvs over problems that could cause the wheels or axles to fall off even as far out as 2024 tesla stands on a forecast price earnings p e ratio of a whopping 39 according to the average of analysts estimates compiled by marketwatch and this assumes a near 75 jump in earnings over the next two years which seems doubtful as the us economy teeters on the brink of recession hyundai lse hyud is the next most popular maker of all electric cars in the us even though bevs currently account for just 5 of total sales in sharp contrast to tesla however hyundai s shares still look very cheap you can buy into the company via its gdr global depository receipt each represents half an ordinary share net debt is high at 90 of shareholders funds however the shares stand on a forward p e of a mere 4 2 according to analysts forecasts compiled by barron s and yield 6 2 while carmakers tend to sell on below average p es by all measures hyundai is on a very low valuation after declining by more than a third over the past eight years this stock looks like one to tuck away meanwhile despite all electric vehicle sales accounting for only 5 2 of total 2022 first quarter turnover german carmaker volkswagen frankfurt vow is optimistic about the prospects for bevs while semiconductors still represent a supply bottleneck this is likely to change soon vw ceo herbert diess told cnbc we will see an alleviation through the next weeks we are ramping up production five assembly plants are coming into production now so delivery times for evs should shorten as the year progresses the outlook is very good we have very good order intake in asia continues deiss there s high demand in europe and also in the us by 2030 vw says that it is aiming to derive at least 70 of its european revenue from electric cars in china and north america the company s goal is to generate at least 50 of turnover from bevs down by 45 from their april 2021 highs vw shares currently sell on a prospective p e of just 5 5 according to the average of analysts estimates compiled by marketwatch further the historic dividend yield is 5 5 admittedly net debt is higher than equity and there s a risk that the pay out to shareholders may be trimmed this year but vw is a cheap share
