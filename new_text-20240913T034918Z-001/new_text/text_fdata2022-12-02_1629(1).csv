nearly 2 1 the s p 500 added 1 1 and the dow ticked up by 0 2 friday s close marked the first time the three major indexes notched back to back weekly gains since october stocks dipped after labor

expectations jumping 0 6 compared with the prior month and 5 1 against the same month a year ago the unemployment rate held steady at 3 7 the market quelled much of those losses as the trading day went on market observers attributed the move to investors being increasingly able to shake off concerning individual economic indicators following remarks on wednesday from fed chair jerome powell that appeared to confirm slowing rate hikes starting as early as december just one strong labor data point is not going to be enough after powell s speech said anna han vice president at wells fargo securities he s confirming that we are seeing the trend that we are having an impact on inflation so i think that sort of soothes the market and takes pressure off it was the final monthly employment

hsbc chief says friday s job data showed the labor market remained strong despite interest rate hikes but that does not mean those hikes are not having the intended effects elsewhere according to jose rasco chief investment officer for wealth management and private banking at hsbc rasco said friday s data is yet another indicator that inflation within services is not cooling as the central bank has hoped with average hourly wages up above expectations however he said the fed can look elsewhere despite its apparent focus on labor as a key indicator of the state of current inflation rasco said he believes there is enough disinflation elsewhere to show the effectiveness of prior interest rate hikes he pointed to slides in demands for goods the question is has the fed seen enough disinflation in other markets to warrant a slowing in the pace of fed rate hikes he said we would argue yes alex harring dow turns green as final hour of trading kicks off the dow was propelled into positive territory after steadily marching off an early low over the course of the trading session the dow was up about 30 points around 3 05 p m which amounts to a gain of just under 0 1 that s a nearly 400

hour the three major indexes have remained down but off day lows with just over one hour left in the trading week the dow was down 31 points a fraction of the more than 355 points lost earlier in the

and added jobs the fed will still likely need to move to a rate hike of 50 basis points at the december meeting according to bryce doty senior vice president and senior portfolio manager at sit investment associates he said the data may initially spook investors because it could point to the economy not contracting enough but doty said fed chair jerome powell and the rest of the central bank understand that congress has a role to play in encouraging work as strength in wages can be tied to the labor shortage with this in mind doty still expects the fed to move from a 75 basis point rate hike to a 50 point rate hike and the current drop in the stock market on the back of the data could be the right time to increase exposure he said the surprisingly high increase in hourly earnings may initially spook investors bracing for the fed to react with another aggressively rate increase he said however powell acknowledged that congress would likely need to do something to encourage more people to work and that the fed is still going to only raise rates by 0 50 december 14th consequently we think it makes sense to buy the dip today alex harring nasdaq on pace for best week of major

declared today by dividend and income fund stock symbol dnif net asset value symbol xdnix the fund payable december 28 2022 to shareholders of record as of december 15 2022 ex dividend date december 14 2022 under u s tax rules applicable to the fund the amount and character of distributable income for each tax year can be finally determined only as of the end of the fund s tax year however under section 19 of the investment company act of 1940 as amended 1940 act and related rules the fund may be required to indicate to shareholders the source of certain distributions to shareholders the information provided herein does not represent information for tax reporting purposes earnings and profits on a tax basis may differ this notice discloses information on the sources of the distribution as required by section 19 a of the 1940 act as of december 1 2022 and based on the fund s results and estimates for the current quarter the current distribution of 0 25 per share would include approximately 9 9 and 82 from net investment income capital gains and return of capital respectively shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the fund s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the fund s distribution policy distributions may be paid from net investment income net realized capital gains or return of capital or a combination thereof to the extent that the fund has estimated that it has distributed more than such income and gains the distribution may be a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when money invested in the fund is paid back to shareholders a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income additionally a return of capital is not taxable rather it reduces the tax basis of the shareholder s fund shares thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing potential loss on the shareholder s subsequent sale of those shares the amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19 a notice are only estimates based on book earnings are likely to change over time and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund s investment experience during the entirety of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations the fund intends to send shareholders a form 1099 div for the calendar year that will instruct how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes this quarterly distribution reflects the fund s current distribution policy to provide shareholders with a relatively stable cash flow per share there is no guarantee that the fund s current distribution policy will reduce or eliminate the fund s market price discount to its net asset value nav per share if any and the fund s trustees have no fiduciary duty to take action or to consider taking any action to narrow any such discount the distribution policy may be amended suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice about the fund the fund is a closed end fund with the primary investment objective of seeking high current income capital appreciation is a secondary objective the fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing under normal circumstances at least 50 of its total assets in income generating equity securities from time to time shares of the fund may trade at a premium to nav or a discount to nav during such periods when the fund s nav per share is above the market price there may be an opportunity for investors to purchase shares of the fund at a discount to their underlying value the fund s premium or discount to nav may vary over time and shares of the fund may subsequently be worth more or less than their original cost shares of closed end funds frequently trade at a discount from their nav this characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the fund s nav has decreased in the past and may decrease in the future as a result of its investment activities and other events neither the investment manager nor the fund can predict whether shares of the fund will trade at below or above nav the risk of holding shares of the fund that might trade at a discount is more pronounced for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period of time after acquiring them because for those investors realization of a gain or loss on their investments is likely to be more dependent upon the existence of a premium or discount than upon portfolio performance the shares of the fund are designed primarily for long term investors and should not be considered a vehicle for trading purposes the nav of the fund s shares typically will fluctuate with price changes of the fund s portfolio securities and these fluctuations are likely to be greater in the case of a fund which uses leverage as the fund may from time to time in the event that shares of the fund trade at a premium to nav there is no assurance that any such premium will be sustained for any period of time and will not decrease or that the shares of the fund will not trade at a discount to nav thereafter the market price for the fund is based on supply and demand which fluctuates daily based on many factors such as economic conditions and global events investor sentiment and security specific factors there is no assurance that the fund s investment objectives will be attained past performance is no guarantee of future

washington the u s senate on thursday voted to codify an agreement the white house brokered between rail unions and freight companies in order to avoid a catastrophic rail strike but fell short of enough votes to include paid sick leave for workers the senate backed the rail deal on an 80 15 vote and rejected the house passed sick leave proposal 52 43 despite pleas from independent sen bernie sanders of vermont sixty votes were required for passage both of virginia s democratic senators tim kaine and mark warner supported the sick leave proposal as well as the rail deal in a joint statement the senators said they were disappointed with the sick leave bill failure the workers who keep our trains and economy running are invaluable they need and deserve paid sick leave warner and kaine wrote especially after covid the notion of seven days of paid sick leave for full time workers is basic common sense the bill imposing the agreement now goes to president joe biden s desk senators also rejected 25 70 a proposal by alaska republican dan sullivan and arkansas republican tom cotton to extend the cooling off period for talks to continue sanders called out railroad companies for refusing to give their workers paid sick leave and penalizing those who do take time off calling the practices barbaric he voted against codifying the september agreement i gotta say that they are maybe the worst case of corporate greed that i have seen sanders said of the freight rail carriers these guys are making record breaking profits giving their ceos huge compensation packages but democrats said the looming rail strike had the potential to upend u s shipping and commerce just before the holidays and biden on monday called for congress to impose the agreement the senate cannot leave until we get the job done senate majority leader chuck schumer democrat of new york said ahead of the votes thursday working together we have spared this country a christmas catastrophe in our grocery stores in our workplaces and in our communities biden said after the senate vote i know that many in congress shared my reluctance to override the union ratification procedures he continued but in this case the consequences of a shutdown were just too great for working families all across the country and the agreement will raise workers wages by 24 increase health care benefits and preserve two person crews i have long been a supporter of paid sick leave for workers in all industries not just the rail industry and my fight for that critical benefit continues buttigieg and walsh to the hill with the cooling off period ending soon giving the unions the authority to strike starting dec 9 biden sent u s transportation secretary pete buttigieg and u s labor secretary marty walsh to capitol hill to brief senate democrats on the railroad labor deal ahead of the vote congress has the authority to intervene under the railway labor act which governs disputes between railway carriers and labor unions the senate republicans who joined a majority of democrats in backing paid sick leave included sens ted cruz of texas josh hawley of missouri john kennedy of louisiana mike braun of indiana marco rubio of florida and lindsey graham of south carolina democratic sen raphael warnock who is currently on the campaign trail in advance of the georgia runoff election did not vote sen chris murphy democrat of connecticut did not vote because he tested positive for covid 19 thursday morning and is currently isolating senators said they had to act we need to figure out a way to get this working sen bob casey a pennsylvania democrat said adding that it would be devastating to workers and the economy if the strike were to occur sen joe manchin iii expressed concern about congress setting a precedent by intervening in a rail strike but ultimately said he would vote for the agreement following the briefing he attended with walsh and buttigieg he said he felt the deal was fair it s still the best proposal out there and it s what we should be voting for manchin a west virginia democrat said manchin voted against giving workers seven days of paid sick leave the scramble for congress to pass a rail deal came after the president directed congress to adopt the agreement between rail workers and operators that the white house helped facilitate in september which was based on recommendations from an emergency board that biden established in july biden calling himself a proud pro labor president said that while he was supportive of the unions he could not let the dispute create an economic disaster september deal in september four of the 12 rail unions voted against endorsing the deal voicing their opposition to a lack of paid sick leave all 12 unions representing 115 000 freight rail workers need to agree on a contract and if one doesn t agree workers represented by the others don t cross the picket line the house on wednesday voted to pass the agreement and separately added seven days of paid sick leave though workers wanted more railroad workers are not currently guaranteed a single paid sick day rail companies refused to agree to paid sick leave the agreement the white house helped facilitate would give workers a 24 raise over five years from 2020 to 2024 one additional personal day and some protection from the rail carriers punitive attendance policies so that workers can take time off for medical needs without fear of discipline the white house suggested to the unions that they withdraw their request for paid sick leave the association of american railroads which is the trade group that represents the railroad companies urged the senate to pass the september agreement and reject sanders push to include paid sick leave the senate must now act quickly to implement the historic deals reached at the bargaining table and already ratified by eight of twelve unions aar ceo ian jefferies said in a statement unless congress wants to become the de facto endgame for future negotiations any effort to put its thumb on the bargaining scale to artificially advantage either party or otherwise obstruct a swift resolution would be wholly irresponsible and risk a timely outcome to avoid significant economic harm but sen elizabeth warren democrat of massachusetts criticized freight owners and their use of precision scheduled railroading a method of streamlining rail operations this is an industry that has been wildly profitable warren said they ve doubled their profits during the pandemic they ve done 125 billion in stock buybacks and they ve cut the workforce by 30 and the way they have been so profitable is by doing something they call precision scheduling which means in fact every single worker has to be available roughly 365 days that leaves no room for people to get sick for people to get injured afl cio president liz shuler said in a statement that the agreement from the white house fell short and urged congress to do the right thing by passing paid sick days for rail workers to be clear rail companies could do the right thing today and grant workers paid sick leave she said but they ve refused putting profits over people that s how we got here this story has been updated to add a statement from warner and kaine

the securities and exchange commission has pushed back the implementation of its amendments to rule 15c2 11 which will add certain necessary disclosures in connection with quotations made by broker dealers to 2025 as the market scrambles to nail down how exactly this applied to all facets of fixed income markets the rule was originally adopted in 1971 and was intended to apply to all securities including fixed income but has certain exceptions for treasuries and since 1976 municipal securities the rule doesn t apply to munis but will apply to nonprofit corporations who issue both municipal securities through state or local conduits and corporate bonds issued directly their conduit issuance is thus not subject to the rule but their direct issuance would be michael decker senior vice president of research and public policy at the bond dealers of america notes that there is a lot of confusion as to how rule 15c2 11 applies to fixed income markets and the added two year window will help narrow that down the amended rule went into effect on sept 16 2020 its first amendment effort in nearly thirty years and enhances disclosure and investor protection in the over the counter market by ensuring that broker dealers in their role as professional gatekeepers to this market do not publish quotations for an issuers security when current information is not publicly available subject to certain exceptions the commission said on dec 16 2021 the sec issued a no action letter stating that staff would not recommend enforcement until january 2023 this updated no action letter now moves that deadline two years to jan 4 2025 in response to indications from industry representatives that they need additional time to complete the operational and systems changes necessary to comply with the amended rule for fixed income securities the division will not recommend enforcement action to the commission under the amended rule for brokers or dealers that publish or submit quotations including continuous quotations in a quotation medium for fixed income securities if the broker or dealer has determined that the fixed income security or its issuer meets one of the criteria in appendix a or that there is current and publicly available information consistent with rule 15c2 11 b about the issuer the sec said groups representing broker dealers welcomed the move and looks forward to engaging in more discussion with the commission today s release is definitely welcome there remains a lot of confusion about how the rule applies to fixed income quotations and the additional two years will give firms time to sort it all out said michael decker senior vice president for research and public policy at the bond dealers of america we are pleased the sec has recognized the potential harm that applying the public disclosure requirements of rule 15c2 11 to the 144a market would have caused to companies and investors said kenneth bentsen president and chief executive officer of the securities industry financial markets association the 144a market is currently relied upon by thousands of corporate and asset backed securities issuers to raise capital and fund consumer lending and previous staff guidance from the sec would have compromised the ability of many issuers to access this market beginning in january 2023 we note that the relief is not permanent bentsen said we continue to believe that if the sec wishes to apply this rule which was designed for equity markets to the fixed income markets it should do so through a public and deliberative proceeding via commission rulemaking with an opportunity for public comment and a comprehensive cost benefit analysis

rasco said friday s data is yet another indicator that inflation within services is not cooling as the central bank has hoped with average hourly wages up above expectations however he said the fed can look elsewhere despite its apparent focus on labor as a key indicator of the state of current inflation rasco said he believes there is enough disinflation elsewhere to show the effectiveness of

manager says to buy the dip following jobs data despite stronger than expected data around hourly wages and added jobs the fed will still likely need to move to a rate hike of 50 basis points at the december meeting according to bryce doty senior vice president and senior portfolio manager at sit investment associates he said the data may initially spook investors because it could point to the economy not contracting enough but doty said fed chair jerome powell and the rest of the central bank understand that congress has a role to play in encouraging work as strength in wages can be tied to the labor shortage with this in mind doty still expects the fed to move from a 75 basis point rate hike to a 50 point rate hike and the current drop in the stock market on the back of the data could be the right time to increase exposure he said the surprisingly high increase in hourly earnings may initially spook investors bracing for the fed to react with another aggressively rate increase he said however powell acknowledged that congress would likely need to do something to encourage more people to work and that the fed is still going to only raise rates by 0 50 december 14th

last month outperforming a comparable ust index by 182 basis points olsan said taxable supply fell 79 year over year to 1 7 billion in november a sizable bite has been taken out of the sector due to

trades were more than double the volume in november 2021 municipal bond trade count is up 63 year to date versus the same period last year likely fueled by individual investor demand as customer purchases and inter dealer trades rose more than customer sales this november was the seventh month out of the last eight with over one million trades reported to the msrb this compares to only eight months in the last 15 years with more than one million trades december begins with lower yields light supply supply shortages and uncertainty over the levels of absolute yields are among the chief concerns facing municipal investors as december got under way on thursday according to tom kozlik managing director and head of municipal research and analytics at hilltop securities market participants are continuing to right size their expectations on the supply side in the near term and for the rest of the year kozlik said thursday he noted that it wasn t too long ago at the start of september 2021 that analysts were calling for a record or at least a near record amount of issuance for 2022 however a record amount of issuance has been an unrealistic expectation since march kozlik said and even though federal reserve board chairman jerome powell confirmed wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start as early as next month investors are still somewhat queasy over rates according to kozlik uncertainty still remains about the levels of absolute rates even though the fed chair is trying to manage this he said overall kozlik doesn t expect much in the way of big changes between now and the end of 2022 issuance activity will remain very challenged he said i am expecting primary market municipal supply to be the lowest in december than we have seen in years at the same time he said institutional investors may try to put money to work before year end but might be at a loss for paper it seems like there is still not going to be relief from outflows so that may be hard kozlik said concerns about the general direction of the u s economy fall out from crypto activity and regional housing market shifts are all among the themes likely adding to the weight already on municipal investors shoulders at year end according to kozlik through year end investors will be looking for any new or different policy changes from the federal reserve and any new guidance on inflation from the economy investors will continue to prepare for the worst and hope for the best kozlik said aaa scales refinitiv mmd s scale was bumped four to 10

trading data shows that seven preeminent market makers engaged in market manipulation via spoofing to drive down northwest biotherapeutics stock prices as the company worked to raise funds to bring breakthrough cancer treatments to market new york ny accesswire december 1 2022 today northwest biotherapeutics otcqb nwbo filed a lawsuit against some of the largest and most influential market makers in the world including citadel securities llc canaccord genuity llc g1 execution services llc a subsidiary of susquehanna international group gts securities llc virtu americas llc including knight securities instinet llc and score priority corp alleging repeated manipulation of the company s stock over five years northwest biotherapeutics a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of dcvax personalized cancer vaccines is alleging that these market makers have been engaging in a deceptive market manipulation tactic known as spoofing which involves placing huge quantities of sell orders to fool the market into devaluing the company s stock so the market makers can buy at a lower price the market makers then immediately cancel the sell orders so they can reap profits in this case to the dismay of current and future cancer patients as well as at the expense of northwest biotherapeutics and its investors this alleged illegal trading behavior has made it significantly more difficult for the company to raise the funds necessary to bring their cancer treatment to market where the company believes it has the potential to extend the lives of thousands of patients it s already underhanded to engage in market manipulation but to do so at the expense of cancer patients some of whom have no other treatments to place their hopes on is unconscionable said laura posner partner at cohen milstein sellers toll pllc we re looking forward to holding these market makers responsible for the harm they have caused and bringing critical and necessary transparency to these markets based on the detailed data presented in the complaint one of the most egregious examples of this behavior occurred on may 10 2022 at the very moment the topline breakthrough results of the phase 3 clinical trial of dcvax l to treat glioblastoma the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer were being announced at the prestigious new york academy of sciences medical conference despite the presentation of significant positive data the company alleges that during and after the announcement the defendants engaged in extensive spates of spoofing forcing the company s stock price down in a market free from manipulation the market response should have been strongly positive not dramatically negative in response to the positive news instead the result was a 1 6 billion loss in market cap with the share price dropping from the 2 05 high on may 9 to a low of 36 4 cents on may 10 2022 a staggering decline of 82 earlier this month northwest biotherapeutics announced the results of this innovative clinical trial for dcvax l in the prestigious jama oncology journal in a peer reviewed article authored by over 70 brain surgeons and oncologists the trial results showed that the vaccine was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful life extension for the first time in many years in both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma with the potential to more than double 5 year survival and with almost no serious adverse event side effects the company believes that this breakthrough vaccine technology may also pave the way for treatments in patients suffering from multiple types of solid tumor cancers the spoofing episodes against the company are alleged to have taken place repeatedly over a nearly five year stretch sometimes multiple times a day northwest biotherapeutics alleges that it sold over 49 million shares at manipulated and devalued prices as a result of the market makers actions the company believes that the market makers directly impacted the price of northwest biotherapeutics shares in the market by repeatedly and brazenly manipulating the market through their spoofing causing northwest biotherapeutics to suffer significant losses as it sold millions of shares at artificially depressed prices and was slowed in bringing its encouraging drugs to market northwest

washington the u s senate on thursday voted to codify an agreement the white house brokered between rail unions and freight companies in order to avoid a catastrophic rail strike but fell short of enough votes to include paid sick leave for workers the senate backed the rail deal on an 80 15 vote and rejected the house passed sick leave proposal 52 43 despite pleas from independent sen bernie sanders of vermont sixty votes were required for passage the bill imposing the agreement now goes to president joe biden s desk senators also rejected 25 70 a proposal by alaska republican dan sullivan and arkansas republican tom cotton to extend the cooling off period for talks to continue sanders called out railroad companies for refusing to give their workers paid sick leave and penalizing those who do take time off calling the practices barbaric he voted against codifying the september agreement i gotta say that they are maybe the worst case of corporate greed that i have seen sanders said of the freight rail carriers these guys are making record breaking profits giving their ceos huge compensation packages but democrats said the looming rail strike had the potential to upend u s shipping and commerce just before the holidays and biden on monday called for congress to impose the agreement the senate cannot leave until we get the job done senate majority leader chuck schumer democrat of new york said ahead of the votes thursday working together we have spared this country a christmas catastrophe in our grocery stores in our workplaces and in our communities biden said after the senate vote i know that many in congress shared my reluctance to override the union ratification procedures but in this case the consequences of a shutdown were just too great for working families all across the country and the agreement will raise workers wages by 24 increase health care benefits and preserve two person crews i have long been a supporter of paid sick leave for workers in all industries not just the rail industry and my fight for that critical benefit continues buttigieg and walsh to the hill with the cooling off period ending soon giving the unions the authority to strike starting dec 9 biden sent u s transportation secretary pete buttigieg and u s labor secretary marty walsh to capitol hill to brief senate democrats on the railroad labor deal ahead of the vote congress has the authority to intervene under the railway labor act which governs disputes between railway carriers and labor unions the senate republicans who joined a majority of democrats in backing paid sick leave included sens ted cruz of texas josh hawley of missouri john kennedy of louisiana mike braun of indiana marco rubio of florida and lindsey graham of south carolina democratic sen raphael warnock who is currently on the campaign trail in advance of the georgia runoff election did not vote sen chris murphy democrat of connecticut did not vote because he tested positive for covid 19 thursday morning and is currently isolating senators said they had to act we need to figure out a way to get this working sen bob casey a pennsylvania democrat said adding that it would be devastating to workers and the economy if the strike were to occur sen joe manchin iii expressed concern about congress setting a precedent by intervening in a rail strike but ultimately said he would vote for the agreement following the briefing he attended with walsh and buttigieg he said he felt the deal was fair it s still the best proposal out there and it s what we should be voting for manchin a west virginia democrat said manchin voted against giving workers seven days of paid sick leave the scramble for congress to pass a rail deal came after the president directed congress to adopt the agreement between rail workers and operators that the white house helped facilitate in september which was based on recommendations from an emergency board that biden established in july biden calling himself a proud pro labor president said while that he was supportive of the unions he could not let the dispute create an economic disaster september deal in september four of the 12 rail unions voted against endorsing the deal voicing their opposition to a lack of paid sick leave all 12 unions representing 115 000 freight rail workers need to agree on a contract and if one doesn t agree workers represented by the others don t cross the picket line the house on wednesday voted to pass the agreement and separately added seven days of paid sick leave though workers wanted more railroad workers are not currently guaranteed a single paid sick day rail companies refused to agree to paid sick leave the house strategy could have averted a possible rail strike that would potentially cost the u s economy more than 2 billion per day while also sympathizing with union members request for sick leave the agreement the white house helped facilitate would give workers a 24 raise over five years from 2020 to 2024 one additional personal day and some protection from the rail carriers punitive attendance policies so that workers can take time off for medical needs without fear of discipline the white house suggested to the unions that they withdrawal their request for paid sick leave the association of american railroads which is the trade group that represents the railroad companies urged the senate to pass the september agreement and reject sanders push to include paid sick leave the senate must now act quickly to implement the historic deals reached at the bargaining table and already ratified by eight of twelve unions aar ceo ian jefferies said in a statement unless congress wants to become the de facto endgame for future negotiations any effort to put its thumb on the bargaining scale to artificially advantage either party or otherwise obstruct a swift resolution would be wholly irresponsible and risk a timely outcome to avoid significant economic harm but sen elizabeth warren democrat of massachusetts criticized freight owners and called out the use of precision scheduled railroading psr is a method of running a railroad to streamline rail operations this is an industry that has been wildly profitable warren said they ve doubled their profits during the pandemic they ve done 125 billion in stock buybacks and they ve cut the workforce by 30 and the way they have been so profitable is by doing something they call precision scheduling which means in fact every single worker has to be available roughly 365 days that leaves no room for people to get sick for people to get injured afl cio president liz shuler said in a statement that the agreement from the white house fell short and urged congress to do the right thing by passing paid sick days for rail workers to be clear rail companies could do the right thing today and grant workers paid sick leave she said but they ve refused putting profits over people that s how we got here
the florida treasury will divest up to 2 billion of assets that are currently under management by blackrock because of its stance on environmental social and governance issues florida s chief financial officer jimmy patronis said thursday the state treasury will have florida s custody bank freeze about 1 43 billion worth of long term securities and remove blackrock as the manager of about 600 million of short term overnight investments patronis said in a statement as larry fink stated to ceos ccess to capital is not a right it is a privilege as florida s cfo i agree wholeheartedly so we ll be taking larry up on his offer there s no lack of companies who will invest on our behalf so the florida treasury will be taking its business elsewhere said florida cfo jimmy patronis blackrock ceo larry fink is on a campaign to change the world patronis said in a letter to ceos he pushed stakeholder capitalism which he believes can alter society to meet this end the asset management company has leaned heavily into environmental social and governance standards known as esg to help police who should and who should not gain access to capital patronis said i think it s undemocratic of major asset managers to use their power to influence societal outcomes he said suggesting those who want to change the world should run for office or donate to the causes they champion using our cash however to fund blackrock s social engineering project isn t something florida ever signed up for ed sweeney a blackrock spokesperson told bloomberg news the firm was surprised by the decision since the company has delivered strong returns for florida the last five years neither the cfo nor his staff have raised any performance concerns sweeney said in a statement we are disturbed by the emerging trend of political initiatives like this that sacrifice access to high quality investments and thereby jeopardize returns which will ultimately hurt florida s citizens fiduciaries should always value performance over politics patronis said however esg has got nothing to do with maximizing returns and is the opposite of what an asset manager is paid to do he said that as florida s chief financial officer it is his responsibility to get the best returns possible for taxpayers the more effective we are in investing dollars to generate a return the more effective we ll be in funding priorities like schools hospitals and roads he said as major banking institutions and economists predict a recession in the coming year and as the fed increases interest rates to combat the inflation crisis i need partners within the financial services industry who are as committed to the bottom line as we are and i don t trust blackrock s ability to deliver patronis said the florida department of financial services manages roughly 60 billion of taxpayer money blackrock managed 1 43 billion of florida s long duration portfolio which includes investments such as corporate obligations asset backed securities and municipal bonds unlike the state s externally managed portfolios by 12 different asset managers blackrock exclusively managed treasury s 600 million short term investment fund a cash sweep vehicle treasury uses to help long intermediate and short duration managers in managing their cash on a daily basis florida gov ron desantis has put for proposals that would prohibit fund managers at the state board of administration from considering esg factors when investing the state s money bloomberg news in july gov ron desantis unveiled administrative actions and legislative proposals aimed at fighting the esg movement saying esg threatens the vitality of the american economy and economic freedom by targeting disfavored individuals and industries to advance what it calls a woke ideological agenda desantis is proposing legislation for the 2023 session the proposal will prohibit fund managers at the state board of administration from considering esg factors when investing the state s money and require them to only consider maximizing returns on investment on behalf of florida s retirees the legislation would also amend the state s deceptive and unfair trade practices statute to prohibit discriminatory practices by large financial institutions based on esg social credit score metrics florida is not alone in fighting against the expansion of esg influence in january west virginia treasurer riley moore said the state board of treasury investments which manages roughly 8 billion of operating funds would no longer use a blackrock investment fund as part of its banking transactions riley said the decision was based on blackrock s urging of companies to embrace net zero investment strategies which would hurt the state s coal oil and natural gas industries and damage its manufacturing base and job market in july moore placed five companies on a state mandated list of restricted financial institutions which he has deemed engage in a boycott of energy companies the five financial firms which are now ineligible for state banking contracts are blackrock inc goldman sachs group inc j p morgan chase co morgan stanley and wells fargo co the kentucky bankers association has challenged the legal authority of state attorney general daniel cameron to demand detailed information from six large banks as part of an investigation into their efforts to address climate change in a recent lawsuit the group accused the attorney general of overstepping statutory limitations by compelling the banks to produce documents communications and information related to their environmental lending practices new york city comptroller brad lander sent a letter to fink in september voicing concern that blackrock s investment actions didn t match up with its esg policy commitments blackrock is the largest asset manager in the world and manages about 43 billion for three of the five new york city pension funds lander is fiduciary for the city s pension funds three of these funds the new york city employees retirement system the teachers retirement system of the city of new york and the new york city board of education retirement system are

by sir ronald sanders throughout the world people and their governments and central banks are worrying about inflation or the rate of increase in the cost of living in many countries this concern about the cost of living has become a prime consideration in general elections because electorates want competent governments in whose hands they commit their expectations two questions arise what is responsible for the cost of living and can governments in small developing countries such as those in the caribbean take actions that would address the issue satisfactorily in the mid term elections in the united states of america us last month inflation roughly translated as the economy was an issue that surfaced in early campaigning although it waned toward the end the main concern in the us was the high cost of oil that followed russia s invasion of ukraine and the consequent efforts in europe and north america to boycott russian oil or at least to minimize dependence on it the refusal of the big oil producing countries to increase their output to compensate for shortages created by the isolation of russia increased oil prices globally in turn this caused the biden administration in the us to release oil supplies from its strategic stock reducing gasoline and diesel prices because of biden s action by the time the mid term elections were held the value of this issue in political terms dropped to 38 percent amongst the electorate however the oil issue persisted in europe which had developed a dependence on russian oil and gas europe will barely manage to keep prices down this winter only because european nations will utilize russian supplies that they had stockpiled prior to the russian war on ukraine both for the us and europe heating and its attendant costs to consumers will be a problem this winter but next year will be worse if the isolation of russian oil and gas from the world market continues stocks will be depleted if not exhausted causing prices to soar all this could cause serious social unrest in europe there have already been protests in greece belgium germany france spain austria and the czech republic the latter of which has seen household energy bills surge tenfold the world is also still experiencing the residual impact of the covid 19 pandemic that severely disrupted supply chains for food medicines and commodities for construction and agriculture costs of construction materials increased by as much as 90 percent since the start of the pandemic the caribbean community caricom countries particularly the six smaller nations that comprise the organization of eastern caribbean states oecs have little control over the cost of living being experienced in their respective countries as the governor of the eastern caribbean central bank eccb timothy antoine put it in july we import inflation principally from the us and also from europe our major trading partners in the specific case of the bahamas largely because of geographic proximity it conducts 85 percent of its trade with the us importing almost 3 billion in goods in 2021 and giving the us a balance of trade surplus of 2 5 billion therefore the bahamas is very vulnerable to the impact of inflation in the us as small states with limited capacity for the production of goods caribbean countries import from the us and europe bringing to their shores the high costs in those countries belize guyana and suriname have some capacity to dull the impact of importing agricultural products because they are less reliant on such imports due to their relatively larger agricultural sectors but even these three states still confront both the shortages and high prices for agricultural inputs such as urea and ammonia in a sentence the current rise in the cost of living is not due to policies of caribbean governments it is caused by external factors beyond the control of governments to be fair all caribbean governments to one extent or another have taken steps to cushion the effects of inflation on their populations especially the poor and vulnerable many governments have introduced measures to subsidise the prices of basic foods in the case of antigua and barbuda and saint lucia for instance the governments subsidise the costs of oil and gas furthermore in antigua and barbuda the government has written off arrears owed for electricity water and property taxes as further measures to ease the impact of imported inflation on the population a major consequence of these actions is that government revenues are diminishing and their ability to service the demands of every sector of their society is considerably strained as is presently happening in antigua and barbuda and in guyana caribbean governments will also have to increase wages and salaries including the minimum wage so that the general population can cope with increased prices overall this will lead to higher per capita incomes resulting in disqualification by international financial institutions from access to low cost borrowing precisely when caribbean countries need it most in antigua and barbuda the government and the private sector managed to agree on an increased minimum wage recognizing that cost of living increases had to be met to maintain social and economic stability the big question that remains for the region is when will the global economic disruption caused by russia s invasion of ukraine and consequent retaliation by the us canada and the european union end right now it looks set to drag on into next year caribbean countries therefore should be working feverishly to implement the many plans which they have agreed to increase trade in goods and services among themselves to establish joint ventures for manufacturing and agricultural production and for air and sea transportation they also have to enhance the caribbean development bank and consider new ways of investing caribbean savings and profits by investing them within the region rather than abroad in other words the caribbean has to become more self sufficient and less vulnerable to external factors

factories reporting weakening demand still economists remain cautiously optimistic that an anticipated recession next year would be short and mild the consumer is alive and well said christopher rupkey chief economist at fwdbonds in new york right now even if consumers do not buy anything more in november and december real consumer spending is running well above normal and in no way shape or form looks like a recession consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of us economic activity jumped 0 8 percent after an unrevised 0 6 percent increase in september the commerce department said october s gain was in line with economists expectations inflation adjusted consumer spending rose 0 5 percent the most since january economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter are as high as a 2 8 percent annualised rate the economy grew at a 2 9 percent pace in the third quarter spending on goods increased 1 4 percent driven by purchases of motor vehicles furniture and

the disposal of households after accounting for inflation increased 0 4 percent but consumers also tapped into their savings to fund their purchases the savings rate dropped to 2 3 percent the lowest since july 2005 from 2 4 percent in september dwindling savings raise doubts on the sustainability of the current pace of spending each month that consumers forfeit saving for the future in order to

the federal reserve s top regulator indicated that higher bank capital requirements and a revamped stress test regime could be in the works fed vice chair for supervision michael barr in a speech delivered at an american enterprise institute event thursday afternoon detailed the objectives of his holistic review of the central bank s capital framework barr took no firm stance on how the fed s various standards might change but he said the current calibration appears to be insufficient federal reserve vice chair for supervision michael barr laid out his vision for a revamped bank capital framework that is more docile and resistant to more variable threats in a speech at the american enterprise institute thursday ting shen bloomberg there is a body of empirical and theoretical research on optimal capital which attempts to determine the level of capital that equalizes the marginal benefits of capital with the marginal costs barr said while the estimates vary widely and are highly contingent on the assumptions made the current u s requirements are toward the low end of the range described in most of the research literature since his initial confirmation hearing in front of the senate banking committee in may barr has advocated an all encompassing review of all the fed s various capital requirements to better understand how they work independently in conjunction with one another and with other regulatory standards barr said thursday that such reviews should be done periodically to ensure bank oversight keeps pace with industry advancements and is positioned to meet future challenges throughout his prepared remarks barr emphasized that he would approach the review with an open mind and not to base conclusions on preconceived notions we are approaching the task with humility he said not the illusion that there is an immutable capital framework to be discovered but rather with the awareness that revisions we conceive of today will reflect our current understanding and will inevitably require updating as our understanding evolves fed s bowman regulations shouldn t push banks out of traditional activities still barr made the argument that strong capital requirements support banks he also said the regulatory framework created by the dodd frank act which he helped implement as assistant secretary of the treasury for financial institutions during the obama administration helped the u s economy grow he also pushed back against some of the arguments made by banks and their advocates in favor of less stringent capital rules specifically he rejected the narrative that bank resilience during the covid 19 pandemic proves that capital standards are already sufficiently high barr said the rapid response by the president and congress to bolster the economy with fiscal support and the fed s monetary intervention all meant the capital requirements were never actually put to the test furthermore i d observe that the recent experience of the pandemic suggests that large unexpected shocks can occur with little notice he said our inability to predict such events would argue for a higher overall capital level than one based solely on historical experience during a question and answer session following his speech barr went further to say that it would be irresponsible to have a regulatory system that relied on banks being bailed out by taxpayers in instances of extreme economic distress we really want to think about capital as having the banks in this case internalize the costs that might happen if they were to get into trouble and that would not include planning on having government support whether directly or indirectly to the bank he said it s quite important that we not assume the taxpayer steps in that we assume rather the opposite that banks are able to stand on their own bottom and continue to support the economy while all facets of bank regulation are on the table during the current review barr flagged stress tests as one area that could see significant changes he argued against having static tests that evaluate banks on similar scenarios year after year but rather adjusting them to test against a wider variety of disruptions stress tests are not meant to be predictions about the future humility suggests caution in that regard but they should be stressful barr said poking and prodding at the system so we can attempt to uncover hidden risks that could become manifest under certain scenarios this is particularly important in today s complex and interconnected financial system in which problems can spread and lead to unexpected losses barr did not provide a timeline for the completion of the review but noted that he hoped to have a significant update early in the new year during the speech his third since being installed as the fed s chief regulatory official in july barr highlighted the financial stability risks presented by unregulated nonbanks we need to worry a lot about nonbank risks to financial stability barr said during the global financial crisis many nonbank financial firms had woefully inadequate capital and liquidity engaged in high risk activities and were faced with devastating runs that crushed the financial system and caused enormous harm to households and businesses insurance companies government sponsored enterprises money market funds hedge funds and other investment vehicles present a similar if not greater risk to today s economy barr said nonbank financial institutions account for 60 of credit in the u s economy he said up from 30 in 1980 barr acknowledged that stiffer capital standards for banks have fueled the growth of nonbanks which often have little to no capital requirements but said that should not be used to justify softening bank capital rules interest rate risk treasury liquidity top fed s supervisory priorities for 2023 we should monitor the migration of activities from banks to the nonbank sector carefully but we shouldn t lower bank capital requirements in a race to the bottom he said in times of stress banks serve as central sources of strength to the economy and they need capital to do so this stance seems to contradict a policy argument made by another fed board member just hours before during an event hosted by the investment bank kbw on thursday morning fed gov michelle bowman advocated for a regulatory regime that made it easier for banks to re enter businesses that they have been squeezed out of in recent years in my mind it s important that we work to specifically further the ability for banks to participate in those traditional activities that they have been very successful in providing services in and not unintentionally or intentionally push those services outside the regulated banking sector bowman said during the question and answer portion of the aei event barr elaborated on his views saying he favors applying more regulation to nonbanks to minimize risks he said this could be done in some instances under provisions of dodd frank that allow for entities to be deemed financial market utilities or nonbank systemically important financial institutions to bring them within the regulatory perimeter in this regard barr and bowman seem to be more in alignment on thursday bowman said she supported applying stricter regulations to banklike activities occurring outside the banking sector if it s the same product the same risk we have to have the same regulation she said

capital markets participants are feeling rather better about themselves than a few weeks ago some promising signs in the battle against inflation are providing light at the end of the tunnel and on wednesday fed chair jerome powell got investors excited by saying that rate increases could begin to get smaller as of this month doing deals has become easier in several battered markets including leveraged finance and equity capital markets in em even colombia which had been looking at issuing ever since january but kept finding excuses not to finally made its 2022 bow on monday much of this optimism is based around the apparent market consensus that the fed funds rate will peak at around 5 talking to dcm bankers about their hopes and fears for 2023 there s a broadly held view that the fed will hit its terminal rate in the first quarter investors can start getting excited about a pivot in monetary policy and we ll be able to look forward to far easier issuance conditions from the second quarter onwards but bond markets should not count on this first of all 5 would still not be a particularly high terminal rate compared to the previous occasions inflation was as high as it is today as jim reid head of global fundamental credit strategy at deutsche bank pointed out this week markets are pricing in a less aggressive cycle than 1973 which proved to be nowhere near sufficient to control inflation and led to two far more aggressive cycles in 1976 and 1980 moreover there continue to be several unpredictable potential pitfalls the russia ukraine conflict china s continuing covid zero policy and a winter with high energy prices just to name a few this time last year very few if any forecasters saw the magnitude of 2022 s inflation and rate increases coming so why are markets smiling so serenely based on today s forecasts many bankers spell out their thinking explicitly 2023 will be better because it can hardly be worse than 2022 this might be true especially for certain corners of the bond market such em where the fall in volumes has been precipitous the slowest year since 2008 in the case of latin america but it is hard to avoid the feeling that many in the market are being sucked into a complacent groupthink because they do not want to contemplate the possibility that there could be more demons in the macroeconomic closet you can t blame market participants for being tired of doom and gloom but they must be careful basing their optimism on wishful thinking for bond issuers this is of particular importance they cannot assume that better times are around the corner even if the reasons to be cheerful are valid and prove to be correct 2023 will still be a year in which pragmatism should reign funding should be done as early as possible and no one should get too clever trying to time the market

in 2024 a minimum of 4 000 would be set aside for each eligible child to access when they re 18 to 35 years old the program would cost about 150 million annually according to state estimates with the first investment coming from the general fund the principal fund used to support the operation of the state momentum around the policy idea picked up steam in the wake of black lives matter protests in 2020 after the murder of george floyd as lawmakers turned to the baby bonds model as a way of addressing longstanding racial and economic inequities connecticut and washington d c have created similar programs that would set aside money for low income newborns other states such as new jersey and massachusetts are exploring creating similar programs as well about 30 percent of washington households of color lack the sufficient net worth to subsist at the poverty level for three months without income compared with about 18 percent of white households according to a 2018 report by prosperity now a nonprofit focused on serving low income communities households of color in the state are also 1 5 times more likely than white households to have zero or negative net worth according to the report income is what helps people get by but wealth is what helps them build for their future researchers from prosperity now and strategy consultants from camber collective wrote in a wealth inequities study commissioned by washington future fund committee washington state treasurer mike pellicciotti described the washington future fund as a long term plan to reduce poverty he noted that for well off families it s not unusual for a parent to start setting aside savings for their newborn or for a grandparent to buy stocks on behalf of their new grandchild but creating that kind of nest egg isn t always possible for low income families already struggling to get by pellicciotti said particularly families in rural parts of washington or families of color literally within days of birth inequities are entrenched he said this type of wealth gap was not created in a few years and will obviously take many years to remedy but this is an important step to moving things forward and creating opportunities for over half of washington s newborns pellicciotti said when recipients come of age and can prove financial need they can tap into their accounts for specific tools of wealth creation that are consistently identified as disrupting poverty pellicciotti said funds can be used to pay for higher education or trade school to buy a home or to start a small business the return on investments could be as high as roughly 24 000 if a recipient tapped into the account at age 25 or about 50 000 if they accessed the fund at age 35 according to state estimates roughly half of all births in washington are covered under apple health the state s medicaid program or about 40 000 children in a given year about 57 percent are children of color rural counties see a much higher percentage of children born under the state s medicaid system pellicciotti said in yakima ferry and adams counties more than 3 in 4 births are funded by apple health according to state health records pellicciotti said he feels confident the washington future fund will be approved next year emphasizing the proposal has support from both sides of the aisle sen yasmin trudeau d tacoma noted the proposal has also attracted supporters from a range of business groups such as the real estate industry attributing the program s broader appeal to a number of factors the sponsor of the initial state senate proposal trudeau said the fund will gives more buying power to marginalized residents allowing them to invest those dollars back into the local and state economy meaning more home sales more educated workers more spending at neighborhood shops the program would also reduce the number of people on long term government welfare services trudeau said and dramatically improve the lives of residents living in rural and conservative parts of the state the wealth gap has hit a crisis point and action needs to be taken now to change the trajectory of people s lives said rep monica stonier d vancouver who sponsored the house version of the bill last session she anticipates reintroducing the washington future fund proposal next year following the committee s recommendations if approved the fund would take effect for eligible children starting in 2024 what other way do you see disrupting generational poverty she said

kkp research the research arm of kiatnakin phatra bank in bangkok is predicting the thai economy to enter recession in the opening quarter of 2023 with the kingdom facing a challenge to find foreign tourists and generate the same level of exports seen in 2022 this will be coming at a time when inflation is predicted to remain elevated at a significantly higher level than the bank of thailand s target rate of 3 and loan interest rates are rising the economic malaise facing the world has seen the international monetary fund imf in september this year urging central banks to stress test their banking systems for a possible deterioration in real estate values in the short term thailand faces an economic recession in the middle of 2023 with growth only rebounding in the third quarter of the year to come in at 2 8 below this year s gdp growth projections according to an economic forecast released this week from a research house associated with a leading thai bank the news comes as a number of former ministers in recent months have urged the government to prepare for challenging times ahead with the international monetary fund imf in september urging all central banks to stress test lending institutions for a possible deterioration in real estate values thailand s exports fell by 4 4 in october while a key foreign tourism industry leader in phuket is warning that thailand s famed resort island is losing ground among high spending european and scandinavian regular visitors to bali in indonesia with the country this year only expected to achieve just over 25 of the visitor volume seen in 2019 and just over 20 of the revenue generated from foreign tourism despite inflation and a three year time lag the thai baht hit a six month high against the dollar on thursday after comments from the chairman of the federal reserve jerome powell that interest rate hikes may be tamped down with signs of easing inflation in the united states the news sent the us stock exchange climbing with news also filtering in that us gdp in the third quarter of 2022 was 2 9 well ahead of expectations the movement on the thai baht saw it trade in the 34 8o to 35 10 range breaking through the 35 price barrier for the first time and significantly reversing the course of this year s rapid appreciation of the dollar against the thai currency which saw it only at the end of october trade at 38 30 to the dollar outlook has turned darker in recent weeks for the thai economy with 2023 now presenting itself as a key challenge for a government with limited options ironically the surge in sentiment towards the baht and its trajectory is coming as thailand s economic outlook over the last few weeks has begun to darken appreciably with even growth for this year being paired down as well as projections for 2023 even as ms patricia mongkhonvanit at the public debt management office pdmo at the ministry of finance was highlighting the maintenance of thailand s bbb rating from the fitch rating agency because of the country s robust external financial position there is a whole range of chickens coming to roost linked with a country s chronic economic problems such as economic inequality caused by a lack of deep rooted economic development and high private sector debt thailand s tax revenue for the third quarter of 2022 reversed course and instead of coming in ahead of expectations was 5 less than projected while the kingdom s public debt was only 60 4 of gdp at the end of the period the fall in the tax take raises questions about the wider economy and also the ability of the government to engage in further economic stimulus measures in the year ahead one last hurrah of fiscal stimulus as electricity prices rise amid higher interest rates lower exports and constrained foreign tourism spending there will be one last hurrah of stimulus priming of the economy in the opening months of 2023 but it is coming amid signals from minister of finance arkhom termpittayapaisith that the government must next year tighten the purse strings the stimulus initiative itself is been seen as a way of countering planned hikes in electricity charges across thailand following an 18 hike in the last quarter from 4 4 baht a unit to over 5 a drop in exports in october of 4 4 from last year brought an abrupt end to 19 months of continued export growth for the country s economy exports which account for no less than 64 of the kingdom s gdp are critical to gdp growth prospects and nearly all commentators now agree that this will be challenged in 2023 even as the government predicts modest growth of 1 1 this week kkp research the research arm of kiatnakin phatra bank in bangkok reduced the kingdom s projected growth rate in 2023 to only 2 8 lower than this year and predicted that exports will decline by 1 1 the research house also reduced the number of projected foreign tourists in 2023 to 19 2 million in contrast to the 28 3 million being forecast by thailand s central economic planners over the last few weeks the final figure for 2022 is expected to be 11 million visitors approximately thailand to find itself in recession next year indeed the small bank is predicting that thailand will find itself in recession in 2023 from the first quarter of the year to the third quarter this is based on reduced world demand for exports across the board from a troubled chinese economy to reduced demand in the united states europe the united kingdom and japan this week s higher than expected gdp figures in the united states may be a sign that america thailand s largest export market may perform better than expected in the year ahead a small light of hope one of the key assessments made by kkp research is that thailand has benefited from a world stock up programme in electronic inventories driven by pent up demand coming after the pandemic now with stock levels at a high sluggish demand worldwide will feed into lower export demand from thai manufacturers surprisingly high economic growth data in the third quarter of 2022 driven by a 15 7 hike in private consumption not primarily by foreign tourism it is a similar and perhaps even more serious story with foreign tourism which helped drive gdp growth in thailand in the third quarter of the year of 4 5 a figure that surprised many analysts as the main component of the growth was not foreign tourism but a spike in private consumption the three month period saw the number of higher spending western tourists fall off pro rata and the number of foreign tourists from asian countries such as malaysia india myanmar vietnam and laos makes up the bulk of the numbers this represents a significant change for the industry which has yet to be determined as either permanent or transitory given the dislocation caused to international flight connections and the overall travel industry in the short term however the signs are worrying for thailand with some indication that sentiment towards the kingdom has deteriorated as well as impediments caused by airfare rises and other factors low spending short haul travellers from asia visit thailand while scandinavian regulars switch from phuket to bali indonesia according to industry boss in that period thailand saw 3 6 million foreign tourist arrivals the majority from asia who spent 4 5 billion or 1 250 a head or 44 000 each well below the average spend three years ago in 2019 the figures for private consumption growth was 15 7 in gross figures or a net 9 when inflation is provided for in the quarter already in phuket the phuket tourist association is warning the government and tourist promotion agency that thailand is losing ground as a holiday destination for higher spending european and scandinavian tourists with mr bhummikitti ruktaengam the chairman of the association telling reporters that phuket has lost many regular visitors to bali in indonesia this year the tourism industry leader called for a more practical and integrated tourism promotion policy from the government and expressed his concern for 2023 which will be an election year in thailand which may create political uncertainty and unease which is a factor in the decision making of foreign tourists with the country s reputation for political instability turning off high spending foreign visitors tourism chief calls on thai airways to pay more attention to phuket by providing more direct flights to the holiday island from europe and scandinavia however mr bhummikitti also strongly called for thai airways to provide more direct flights to phuket from continental european points of origin and those in scandinavia to address the key issue of flight connectivity and cost which has cost thailand dearly in 2022 he said that the countries that have already recovered to achieve figures well over pre pandemic levels all had strong national airline carriers who assisted in the process he said that thai airways provided only a very limited service to phuket while other international airlines were increasing flights to the holiday island tourism authority of thailand tat the thai tourism promotion agency has already acknowledged potential problems concerning tourism numbers for 2023 it says that the industry will be facing a challenge after march 2023 when the country s high season comes to an end as the era of pent up holiday demand from countries worldwide after the pandemic will also have ceased inflation in 2023 to remain at inflated levels with the continued threat of geopolitical shocks higher interest rates and reduced upside on foreign earnings kkp research also predicted that inflation in 2023 will remain at elevated levels higher than the 3 officially predicted and expressed concern about the future course of oil prices amid a highly unstable geopolitical environment the research house however predicted that thailand will see a small current account surplus in 2023 which will be a reversal of three quarters of significant deficits caused by a weaker baht and higher oil costs in 2022 at the same time the risk of external developments and shocks remains high it pointed out in short the kingdom s economic drivers in 2022 including private consumption spending exports and foreign tourism will all be challenged amid heightened inflation particularly driven by the higher electricity costs due to kick in early 2023 the country will also be facing increasing loan interest rates with the monetary policy committee of the bank of thailand this week increasing the key policy rate to 1 25 a hike of 25 basis points kkp research expects that this will rise in 2023 and reach 2 25 in the third quarter of the year minister of finance arkhom termpittayapaisith held talks this week with both the imf and world bank on addressing economic inequality which has risen key economic observers have noted that with falling government tax revenue higher private borrowing reduced export earnings and the high level of thai private sector debt combined with rising interest rates the room next year to manoeuvre by the government will be extremely limited at a time when the risk of further geopolitical shocks given the ongoing and evolving war in ukraine economic and political turmoil in china and malaise with the world economy are high on thursday minister of finance arkhom termpittayapaisith confirmed that he had held talks with both the world bank and the international monetary fund as part of a g20 international initiative to tackle widening economic inequality worldwide he said the meeting focused on repairing the damage caused by the covid 19 pandemic which had hit the poor and vulnerable particularly hard in thailand in september the international monetary fund imf in a circular to all central banks worldwide urged them to stress test their banking networks to ensure that all institutions had adequate capital buffers in place to deal with a deterioration in real estate prices international monetary fund imf warns all central banks to prepare for a hit to real estate values going forward and to stress test bank buffers the circular instructed central banks to ensure banking sector resilience stress testing large declines in commercial real estate prices should be conducted to inform decisions regarding the adequacy of capital buffers for commercial real estate exposures thailand s central bank has long since carried out such tests and the country s external finances and banking system are known to be strong however next

but an amendment to ensure paid sick leave for railroad workers failed to pass the us senate s 60 vote threshold the united states senate has passed a bill forcing railroad unions to accept a deal that would increase wages to avoid a nationwide strike that was anticipated to have devastating economic effects the legislation was approved on thursday by a vote of 80 to 15 and it now heads to president joe biden s desk for his signature railroad workers were expected to begin their strike on december 9 if a deal was not reached the deal is based on a previous tentative agreement hashed out in september with the help of the biden administration that includes higher pay but no paid sick leave shortly before the vote the senate rejected a separate amendment that would have given railroad workers seven days of paid sick leave per year a key demand with a vote of 52 to 43 the amendment received majority support with six republican legislators joining democrats to vote yes but that tally fell short of the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster during thursday s proceedings pro labour groups have criticised congress s intervention as an attack on the rights of workers to collectively bargain and a concession to railroad companies that have refused to budge on the issue of sick leave the administration has defended the move by pointing to the cost a railroad strike would have on the economy at a time of high inflation a strike could roil the us supply chain and affect up to 30 percent of the country s shipments by weight in a speech on thursday biden warned this could result in 750 000 jobs lost and a recession several unions had already approved the tentative agreement which the biden administration helped broker and hailed as a big win in september i negotiated a contract no one else could negotiate biden said at thursday s news briefing with french president emmanuel macron what was negotiated was so much better than anything they ever had the deal offered railroad workers a 24 percent pay increase and a 5 000 bonus over five years and comes at a time when railroad companies have slashed their workforce by more than 30 percent over the last six years during the same period railroad companies engaged in stock buybacks and seen their profits rise all 12 unions involved in the negotiations needed to approve the contract to avoid a strike the majority did so but members of the nation s largest railroad union cited unmet quality of life issues including demanding schedules among their reasons for rejecting it the us has seen increased labour activity in recent years as workers push for greater compensation and better working conditions here s my message to republican senators who claim to be supporters of the working class put up or shut up pic twitter com ladoultlg9 bernie sanders berniesanders december 1 2022 congress can resolve disputes between railroads and unions as part of its power to regulate commerce some legislators such as vermont senator bernie sanders pushed to include paid sick leave in thursday s legislation if you are a supporter of the working class how are you going to vote against a proposal which provides paid sick leave to workers who have none right now sanders said in an interview pushing for the rejected sick leave amendment earlier this week

andreypopov istock via getty images high probability in the financial services sector of catching a winner investors are drawn to u s listed financial services companies because these stocks should benefit from the u s federal reserve s rate hiking policy but uncertainty about the economy and other factors kept them out of the sector for a while this has created pent up demand for u s listed financial services stocks potentially leading to a surge in equity market valuations as bearish sentiment in the u s stock market abates market valuations of financial services stocks have also fallen over the past year as investors have had little interest in u s listed stocks and other riskier assets as a result of the above there could be many investment opportunities among financial services stocks today and one of them is encore capital group inc nasdaq ecpg this stock has amazing upside potential that may not be reflected in the current market valuation because of the nature of encore capital group inc s business the federal reserve s next decision on the interest rate which is quite a hot topic in the financial press these days and the impact of its transmission on the economy will be the catalyst for this company encore capital group inc in the financial services sector headquartered in san diego california encore capital group is an international specialty finance company that is encore capital group collects consumer debt and provides related services that span a wide range of financial assets encore capital group purchases portfolios of consumer receivables from major banks around the world as well as from credit unions and utility companies encore capital group helps consumers pay off their debts the company offers these troubled consumers a guide to financial recovery helping them transition from a bad borrower state to a consumer with healthy economic conditions the context of record inflation it s been about a year since the u s federal reserve began raising interest rates on federal deposits and sending signals of recession to the economy in an attempt to ease high inflation which stood at 7 7 in october current high inflation a level not seen in 40 years coupled with expensive utility bills fueled by speculation in commodity markets following russia s aggression against ukraine are bringing household finances to their knees this limits not only their purchasing power but also their creditworthiness to repay the debt they took on to finance consumption it s difficult to quantify the risk but based on the factors just mentioned the likelihood of a u s consumer defaulting is certainly higher today than it was a few months ago fueling demand for debt collection services this becomes an exceptional opportunity for encore capital group inc which specializes in debt collection solutions as a result the third quarter of 2022 whose performance was still hampered by the fallout from lower defaults from consumers purchased in recent quarters is showing signs of a strong recovery as the company encounters increasingly favorable momentum in the collections industry while collections and revenues respectively declined 19 yoy to 458 3 million and 25 yoy to 307 8 million in the third quarter of 2022 the value of the portfolio of defaulted receivables increased 38 to 232 7 million purchases of defaulted receivables in the third quarter of 2022 with the global portfolio hitting its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2019 were driven by strong 73 year on year growth in the u s in europe on the back of a weaker british pound and euro currencies purchases fell by 15 it must be said that without the effect of the stronger u s dollar compared to the european currencies the value of the european portfolio would have remained at approximately the previous year s level the prospect of higher yields on u s loans has fueled market demand for u s dollars causing the american currency to appreciate against other currencies however it shouldn t be long before the british pound and euro rebound against the u s dollar positively impacting the non u s portion of the portfolio which accounts for 24 of encore capital group s total portfolio purchases this is because the u s fed is expected to slow down the pace at which it has been raising interest rates on wednesday november 30 u s fed board chairman jerome powell speaking at the brookings institution said the hawkish stance of higher interest rates could be toned down at the next meeting in december this is because policymakers are beginning to anticipate the approach to cautious consumption levels which once reached should help bring inflation growth back to its normal rate of 2 per year the context of rising interest rates at its last meeting in november 2022 the u s fed raised interest rates for the sixth time this year sending borrowing costs to a new 14 year high pressured by the rising cost of money combined with record inflation an impressive amount of consumer credit could potentially house many more defaulting consumers than in the past fueling demand for encore capital group as an indication of the current consumer debt burden credit card debt in the united states piled up to a whopping 0 93 trillion in the third quarter of 2022 this level is much higher compared to 0 89 trillion in the prior quarter of 2022 and doubled the record 0 93 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2019 also the current level of u s credit cards with debt balance is well above the 20 year average of 0 76 trillion more hawkish from the us fed for the good of encore capital group the rapid increase in the prices of goods and services is still a long way from the federal reserve s twin goals of price stability and healthy employment levels thus rates will continue to be hiked also it seems that the final rate that will result from the hawkish stance has been revised upwards from â 4 6 in the september forecasts currently the interest rate range is 3 75 to 4 for interest on federal funds in terms of the stock market the shares of banks should benefit as the spread between interest rates on loans and deposits widens but the market will also welcome encore capital group s application of a higher discount rate when purchasing defaulted consumer debt therefore encore capital group s profitability and financial health are on track to improve due to the acquisition of cheaper defaulted consumer receivables and the other factors described above shareholders should thus see progressive improvement in the following two financial indicators the before tax roic which declined slightly year over year by 10 basis points to 15 1 and the leverage ratio which rose 0 3 times year on year to 2 1 times in the third quarter of 2022 the bearish sentiment in the financial services sector combined with the bright prospects for encore capital group make the stock look cheap as shown in the chart below banks and other financial services firms are down more than 4 over the past year according to the performance of the financial select sector spdr fund xlf a proxy index for the financial services sector source seeking alpha the financial services stocks were hit by the same bearish sentiment that gripped the stock market across sectors driven by headwinds from the war in ukraine that sparked the energy crisis as well as other geopolitical tensions around the world additionally during the energy crisis shares of multinational energy companies soared as their profits were boosted by the astounding rise in fossil fuel and electricity prices diverting investorsâ interest from almost everything else including financial stocks the above chart also shows a 13 61 fall in encore capital group inc â s stock price this year likely allowing the stock to trade cheaply compared to the rosy outlook encore capital group shares are trading at 50 56 as of this writing giving it a market cap of 1 16 billion and a 52 week range of 44 06 to 72 73 source seeking alpha shares are in the lower half of the 52 week range and well below the long term trend of the 200 day simple moving average line of 57 24 also the stock has a p e non gaap of 4 45 versus the sector median of 10 45 and a price sales of 0 79 versus the sector median of 2 91 as a result market valuations of this stock are lower than they have been in the recent past and compared to most of its peers on wall street the stock has a buy median rating made up of 2 strong buys 1 buy and 2 hold ratings source seeking alpha analysts have also issued price targets averaging 62 25 per share reflecting growth of 23 01 since this writing source seeking alpha there is a risk that an investment in the encore capital group will not bring the expected return as the environment is very competitive however if the economy soon slides into a negative cycle of a significant slowdown or a worse recession conditions will be such as encouraging the accumulation of defaulted consumer receivables therefore a downside scenario for these price levels is possible as nothing can be ruled out but this risk is small conclusion rapidly rising inflation which has yet to be addressed combined with tighter monetary policy poses the risk of a significant economic slowdown and worse a recession this economic cycle will affect consumers but this segment of society has already built up huge debts on its credit cards raising fears of more consumer credit defaults than anticipated a few months ago the debt collection solutions industry is highly competitive but there are still great opportunities for encore capital group inc

date for any debate on the debt ceiling advertisement advertisement a growing number of house democrats said they would prefer the house proactively move ahead of 2023 on the debt ceiling to prevent republicans from leveraging the debt limit to negotiate gop policy priorities and potentially trigger a shock to the economy a standoff over the debt ceiling damaged the u s credit rating and financial markets in 2011 during the obama administration when republicans controlled the house the limit is the maximum amount the united states is allowed to borrow to pay its debts if the amount of government debt hits that limit and doesn t lift the ceiling the u s would be unable to pay what it owes and could default leading republicans in the house and senate keep saying they want to hold the

debt ceiling in the lame duck session is a non starter period any legislation on the debt limit has to include real structural reforms that cut spending balance the budget and defund federal tyranny

re running out of daylight to do it burgess said so that seems like a pretty big ask to get that done as well and gop rep dan bishop of north carolina slammed democrats as wanting to keep spending

photo credit hxdyl shutterstock the last few years have starkly shown how interconnected the world has become the covid 19 virus spread across borders and regions with ease disrupting communities and economies across the globe one of covid s biggest ripple effects was the impact on global supply chains suppliers worldwide operated through much of 2020 and 2021 at lower capacity due to the virus s effects since then supply and demand have been imbalanced demand for durable goods surged at a time when suppliers suffered bottlenecks and now demand has fallen as many suppliers have caught up issues with shipping warehousing and logistics led to disruptions and delays that reached a peak in late 2021 and early 2022 for u s businesses and consumers disruptions in the global supply chain trickle down to domestic supply chains as well as globalization has taken root in recent decades the u s has lost manufacturing capacity when it became harder to secure goods from elsewhere in the world as a result of the pandemic businesses and consumers found that american made alternatives were not easy to find either according to data from the u s census bureau nearly half of all businesses in the u s reported domestic supply chain issues entering 2022 this figure represented significant growth even from earlier periods of the pandemic for much of late 2020 and early 2021 the share of businesses reporting domestic supply chain issues hovered around 30 more businesses began to face problems over the summer of 2021 and by fall of 2021 around 45 of businesses were confronting issues with domestic suppliers while businesses of all types have run into delays with suppliers some industries have been hit harder than others information based and service based businesses generally experienced fewer disruptions with the finance and insurance industry reporting the least at 7 5 in contrast the fields that were most likely to face issues with domestic supplier delays were those who depend heavily on physical goods and materials manufacturing led all categories with 70 5 of businesses experiencing supplier delays while retail trade construction and accommodation and food services each had more than 60 of businesses report delays challenges in the domestic supply chain can bring major economic disruptions from the sheer volume of goods shipped within the u s freight businesses move trillions of dollars in goods each year nearly 90 of which is transported by commercial trucks for businesses that rely on shipments of parts or materials to create their own products supply chain delays can make it difficult to provide goods to their own customers for consumers breakdowns in the supply chain mean having a harder time finding goods or paying a premium to purchase them several of the categories that have faced the most disruption due to supply chain issues are those that make up the highest share of shipped goods the total annual value of motorized and other vehicles including parts shipped in the u s is more than 1 2 trillion with electronic and other electrical equipment registering at 1 1 trillion difficulties securing parts like semiconductor chips have affected both of these categories making products harder to buy and more expensive for consumers within the u s certain locations are responsible for a higher volume of goods being shipped many

showcase elite fillies and mares to the global audience which defines the tattersalls december sale photo www tattersalls com sale topper alcohol free in the ring during sceptre session of the tattersalls december mares sale he continued the response from breeders and consignors to the new initiative was overwhelmingly positive and this was widely recognized as an exceptional catalog but we could not have predicted the extraordinary atmosphere which enveloped park paddocks throughout a sale which has seen the record books completely rewritten turnover average and median have all soared past the previous record levels and to see the packed sale ring as the succession of outstanding fillies and mares took to the stage will live long in the memories of all those present the huge number of overseas buyers here at park paddocks for the duration of the december sale reflects the incredible support we have received from the vendors who entrusted us with such an illustrious cast of race fillies and broodmares every one of the 11 fillies and mares who sold for one million guineas or more was special and the 5 4 million guineas 6 781 077 sale of the gorgeous alcohol free was not only the highest auction price in the world this year for a filly in training but also a wonderful reward for her owner jeff smith her trainer andrew balding and all associated with one of the great race fillies of recent years on overall trade mahony said while the individual highlights will leave lasting memories we must express our deep gratitude to all who have made 2022 such an extraordinary year at tattersalls sale after sale has attracted buyers from all over the world in overwhelming numbers and we are enormously grateful for the support we receive from purchasers and vendors alike all of

tara a laclair special to the oklahoman with the economy seemingly heading for a recession whether short shallow deep or long it is only natural for investors to be concerned about their investment portfolios and volatile market conditions there have been a host of events throughout 2022 that have been driving market reaction from the federal reserve s interest rate hikes to mid term elections not to mention political unrest around the globe whether it is inflation numbers consumer price index figures retail sales figures housing sales unemployment figures or energy costs there is a lot of information available to make investors nervous and nervous investors lead to volatile markets a sudden decline in the value of stocks may cause some investors to liquidate their holdings immediately locking in losses after incurring such a loss the investor may be hesitant to reinvest making it even more difficult to recover those losses and grow their money during a recession before liquidating your investments stop and consider why you want to sell your positions have your goals changed has your risk tolerance changed or are current market events and the continuing uncertainty simply making you uncomfortable if your circumstances have changed then it might be the right time to sit down with your financial professional and review your portfolio and your strategy but if your objectives have not changed and you are investing for the long term take a step back and try to avoid any knee jerk reactions to current market events while this may still be a good time to review individual investments if you have a well diversified and asset allocated portfolio you are likely already well positioned for a recovery when economic circumstances change during a recession some investments are more likely to be impacted than others knowing which investments to avoid may be just as important as knowing which ones to keep for example companies that are highly leveraged cyclical or heavily reliant upon discretionary consumer spending think luxury items dining out furniture and tourism are likely to suffer declines additionally in our current rising interest rate environment companies that are more reliant on borrowing for their sales such as home builders developers mortgage brokers or generally anything connected to construction are also likely to decline this might also include technology companies or growth companies where there is a need to finance new manufacturing facilities or enhanced technology for example a project that would have pursued at 2 interest rates may simply not be viable at 4 a recession does not have to mean you should hold off on investing altogether if you are investing for retirement or for the longer term in general look for companies that are well managed have strong balance sheets low debt ratios and good cash flow these companies are more likely to weather the storm than those that are reliant on financing or consumer spending they may also be a relative bargain during a declining market there are also industries that are typically more recession resistant than others such as utilities discount retailers consumer staples and health care before liquidating your investments remember that every recession comes to an end the economy rebounds and investments recover even in the face of uncertainty it is important to avoid panicking and remember that ups and downs are a regular part of investing if you are nervous or your investment losses are keeping you up at night talk to your financial professional evaluate individual investments to see if they still fit your long term goals but avoid acting on impulse or making rash decisions stay focused on your long term goals tara a laclair is an attorney with crowe dunlevy crowedunlevy com and a co chair of the securities litigation enforcement compliance practice group
