how major sectors fared in 2018 ibrahim apekhade yusuf and charles okonji in this report attempt a post mortem of major commanding heights of the economy in the outgoing year vis à vis their performances impacts and or otherwise in real terms to say the last 12 months have been momentous for the country is certainly stating the obvious from telecoms to manufacturing agriculture fiscal policy services to the formal and informal sectors the nation s economic managers sure had a lot of issues to ponder about in terms of regulation policy initiatives challenges and lessons learnt according to public opinion poll released by noipolls nigerians believe that the country has not fared well mostly in the areas of job creation 89 per cent infrastructural development 65 percent and the economy 63 percent on a brighter note 69 percent of nigerians believe that the country has fared well in the area of agriculture in 2018 job creation as a burning issue comes as no surprise considering the rising rate of unemployment in nigeria according to a national bureau of statistics nbs unemployment rates rose from 16 2 percent in 2016 to 18 8 per cent in 2017 data from trade economics revealed that gdp from agriculture in nigeria increased to n5 2 million in the third quarter of 2018 from n3 7 million in the second quarter of 2018 thus gdp from agriculture averaged n3 8 million from 2010 until 2018 reaching an all time high of n5 2 million in the third quarter of 2018 the devil in the details in its assessment of the first quarter 2018 the nigeria bureau of statistics nbs indicated that the country s economic growth slowed to 1 95 percent in first quarter of 2018 from 2 11 percent recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 it said real gdp value as at end march 2018 stands at n16 106 trillion as against the nominal gdp figure of n28 464 trillion according to the imf world economic outlook report released in july 2018 indicates that the nigerian economy was projected to grow by 2 1 per cent in 2018 and 2 3 per cent in 2019 however due to unfavourable developments in the economy this growth rate was downgraded to 1 9 per cent for 2018 this was specifically due to reductions in oil production and contractions in the agricultural sector a consequence of the so called farmers herders clashes among others according to the imf report another sign of a poorly performing economy was the state of the nigerian equities market with investors losing over n700 billion as at september 2018 with political uncertainty playing a role in the downward trend of the market thus the continual caution exercised by foreign portfolio investors in the market led to significant sell offs which also impacted negatively on the foreign reserves this scary nature of the continual fall in many stock prices has affected the desire by many to invest in the market these are clear signs of a troubled economy according to the imf world economic outlook report released in july 2018 indicates that the nigerian economy was projected to grow by 2 1 per cent in 2018 and 2 3 per cent in 2019 however due to unfavourable developments in the economy this growth rate has been downgraded to 1 9 per cent for 2018 this is specifically due to reductions in oil production and contractions in the agricultural sector a consequence of the so called farmers herders clashes among others according to the imf report the economy is said to be performing poorly in the past three months the nation s external reserves have been on a steady decline despite rising crude oil prices internationally the reserves have fallen from 47 8 billion to 43 97 billion indicating a seven month low this is a clear case of capital reversal as confirmed by the central bank of nigeria cbn due partly to developments in the united states where the benchmark interest rate has been increased for the third time this year with this development international capital from developing and emerging markets has been flowing in the direction of the united states of america lull in capital market last year also saw a run on the stock market with investors losing over n700 billion as at september 2018 with political uncertainty playing a role in the downward trend of the market banking the banking sub sector also witnessed some changes of some sorts in the third quarter of 2018 september to be precise skye bank plc was taken over by polaris bank limited due to financial distress financial in the takeover a fresh n786 billion soft and long term financing at single digit interest rate was injected to keep the rejuvenated operations ongoing while the initial n350 billion injected by the apex bank would be withdrawn at a joint press briefing by the apex bank and nigerian deposit insurance corporation ndic the regulators were unanimous in affirming the continued operations of customers accounts under polaris bank justifying the move the cbn governor mr godwin emefiele said the result of examinations and forensic audit of the bank revealed that skye bank required urgent recapitalisation and can no longer continue to live on borrowed times with indefinite liquidity support from the cbn but the shareholders of the bank have been unable to recapitalise it in a related development access bank acquired diamond bank the transaction rightly tagged deal of the year came as a huge relief also to the central bank of nigeria cbn which could have been called upon so soon after it liquidated skye bank to intervene the same way with diamond bank only that this time may be without the corresponding bail out because the regulator had hinted that such funds required to bail out any financial entity about n180 billion in the case of polaris bank was no longer available the cbn demonstrated its understanding in two ways first it sustained diamond bank s operation by granting it approval to operate as a national bank following its application for it with the approval and the change to national bank status it enabled the bank to maintain a lower minimum capital requirement of 10 per cent as against the 15 per cent required for international banks second according to the boards of access bank plc and diamond bank plc they have received no objection from the central bank of nigeria cbn regarding a potential merger between the two banks which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019 ease of doing business despite many hiccups the nation scored some good point in the area of ease of doing business as it moved up the ladder in 24 places last year according to the senior special assistant to the president on industry trade and investment secretary to the presidential enabling business environment council dr jumoke oduwole who spoke recently in lagos during the lagos chamber of commerce and industry international investment conference with the theme promoting industrialisation for economic recovery and sustainable growth empahsised that there is a lot going for the country in the sme space oduwole who was represented by an official of the council mr soji akinyele disclosed that the action plan targeted the sme sector of the economy with 11 initiatives the first action plan contained eight initiatives for the sector oduwole pointed out that the first phase of the national action plan was responsible for moving nigeria 24 places up the ladder of the world bank ease of doing business ranking resignation of kemi adeosun perhaps one of the sore points of year 2018 was the resignation of mrs kemi adeosun as finance minister under controversial circumstances she was alleged to have forged her national youth corps service exemption certificate she was eventually replaced by the minister of state budget and national planning mrs zainab ahmed telecoms the telecoms sector also witnessed what could be best described as a dramatic turn of events mtn nigeria which was billed to enlist at the stock market had to pull the brakes following allegations by the attorney of general of the federation abubakar malami that the telco owed the federal government 2billion in tax debt which it had been repatriating abroad in the last few years the matter was a subject of lingering litigation but reason prevailed as the two parties agreed to an out of court settlement in a related development the stalemate which greeted the planned sale of 9mobile was also put to rest in the last quarter of 2018 following the takeover of the telco by teleology nigeria limited which announced the constitution of a new board of directors for the embattled operator experts verdict citing the gross domestic product gdp statistic released by the national bureau of statistics nbs in the last quarter of 2018 the director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci muda yusuf said the economy grew by 1 81 year on year in the third quarter of 2018 this figure he stressed indicated an expansion in the economy for q3 2018 compared to the 1 17 gdp growth rate of the corresponding quarter in the previous year there is also an improvement in the quarter on quarter gdp growth rates from 1 50 in q2 2018 on the other hand the year on year nominal growth rate was 13 58 the real gdp value for q3 2018 stood at n18 1 trillion whereas its nominal value was n33 trillion reflecting the effect of inflation in nigeria this performance was however lower than the international monetary fund imf and economic recovery and growth plan ergp growth forecasts of 3 5 2 1 and 4 1 respectively for 2018 the exchange rate he stressed was relatively stable in 2018 in different segments of the fx market for instance at the parallel market the naira hovered within the band of n361 n363 the interbank foreign exchange market moved around n305 75 n306 and at the i e fx window the naira traded within the tight band of n360 95 n363 32 higher oil prices and stable local production levels of crude oil are the two key critical factors that helped to restore calm in the forex market the local forex market is already responding to recent sharp fall in oil prices for instance the local currency has dropped to n373 in the parallel market from n363 it traded for a better part of 2018 after 18 consecutive months of decline inflation rate began to rise in august 2018 with headline inflation of 11 26 in october 2018 compared to 15 13 in january 2018 and 18 7 in january 2017 following the bottoming out of high base effect in august 2018 the country is likely to see headline inflation trending up in the early part of 2019 the 2018 world bank ease of doing business report ranked nigeria 146 out of 190 countries the report showed that the country took a step backwards from the 145th position it ranked in 2017 the ranking takes to account trading regulations property rights contract enforcement investment laws and availability of credit this ranking did not reflect efforts of the present administration through the presidential ease of doing business council pebec and series of presidential executive orders targeted at improving the business environment in the view of the director general of the nigerian association of chambers of commerce industry mines and agriculture naccima ambassador ayoola olukanni 2018 was a tough year but there are small mercies summarily 2018 is a mixed bag for us we worn in some areas and we lost in some areas so let us learn lessons from the areas we lost and build on it for 2019 in terms of increasing the space of opportunities for the private sector he said like naccima the president manufacturers association of nigeria mansur ahmed said the manufacturing sector didn t fare any better according to him the manufacturing output in the year 2018 was not encouraging there is the need to sustain investment and to push the sector forward to avoid what happened in 2018 repeating itself expatiating he said in 2018 the manufacturing sector grew by 3 and later went down to 1 5 which indicates the tragic fall in the overall manufacturing suffered loss in capacity utilisation it recorded 54 in 2018 as against 57 in 2017 again if you look at the budget there is a significant reduction in the allocation to agriculture where as in 2018 the allocation was over n89 billion and in 2019 it came down to about n80 billion this is not good for the growth of the sector
the high yielding renewable energy company has a few things it must accomplish to win back investors this year check out the latest pattern energy earnings call transcript last year was a tough one for most stocks as the market sold off over worries about a slowing global economy however it was an even rougher one for pattern energy pegi whose stock tumbled 13 4 more than double the loss of the s p 500 that s because some cracks started forming in the high yielding renewable energy company s foundation which caused investors to become concerned about its ability to grow that leaves pattern energy with a few things on its to do list for 2019 here are three it needs to accomplish to ease investors concerns and win back their support no 1 continue shoring up the balance sheet pattern energy has grown at a fast pace over the past few years by issuing new debt and equity to fund acquisitions however all that borrowing has pushed the company s leverage ratio to a concerning level which forced the company to take action in recent months to improve its financial profile the company did that by selling a couple of non core assets which not only bolstered its balance sheet but also gave it the cash to reinvest in some higher returning opportunities while pattern made solid progress on its asset recycling plan last year it needs to make even more in 2019 ideally the company should continue selling select assets until it has reduced its leverage ratio below its target of less than 3 times corporate debt to earnings that would enhance its financial flexibility so that it can pursue new growth opportunities that could emerge in the future no 2 improve dividend coverage pattern energy had been an excellent dividend growth stock considering it increased its payout in each of its first 15 quarters as a public company however the company pressed pause on dividend growth last year because its payout ratio was around 100 of its cash flow which left it with no room for error the company s aim is to get its payout ratio down to a more comfortable level of 80 of its cash flow it can do that by continuing the progress of its capital recycling plan for example the company sold its k2 wind power facility in canada for 166 million valuing it at 15 times cash flow and used 23 million of that money to invest in stillwater wind in montana buying in at about 10 times cash flow if the company can continue to sell assets for a much higher value than it buys them then it could quickly reduce leverage as well as its dividend payout level no 3 formalize a sustainable long term growth strategy pattern energy noted that with access to capital it has a large enough pipeline of acquisition opportunities to grow cash flow per share at more than an 8 annual pace with upside into the double digits depending on how much outside financing it can obtain however with its share price slumping 13 last year it s becoming too expensive to issue equity to fund growth meanwhile with its elevated debt level it can t use more debt to finance growth either as a result the company needs to target a more sustainable expansion plan that doesn t require outside capital with the company aiming to improve its dividend coverage ratio to 80 it will have more retained cash to fund expansion add that capital to an improving balance sheet and pattern energy should eventually be in the position if self funding growth what it needs to do is provide investors with a better idea of how much it can expand both cash flow and its dividend without having to rely on outside funding once it achieves its targeted leverage and payout ratio by doing so it would give investors more confidence in its ability to deliver sustainable growth even if capital market conditions deteriorate which was the case last year lots to watch in the new year as attractive as pattern energy s 8 4 yielding dividend might be after last year s sell off there are still questions about its long term sustainability because of the company s high payout ratio and elevated debt levels however if the company can address those concerns by completing its to do list it would become a much more attractive stock for income seeking investors in the meantime investors should put it on their watch list so that they can keep an eye on its progress

income said the bank in a statement as well transportation constraints and rising production have combined to push up oil inventories in the west and exert even more downward pressure on canadian benchmark prices while price differentials have narrowed in recent weeks following announced mandatory production cuts in alberta investment in canada s oil sector is projected to weaken further article content this is good news and bad news the bad is a weaker oil sector the good news is the sector is affecting the national economy which should make the rest of canada roc take notice of what is causing the sector to be weaker which is a lack of pipelines these developments are occurring in the context of a canadian economy that has been performing well overall said the bank meanwhile consumption spending and housing investment have been weaker than expected as housing markets adjust to municipal and provincial measures changes to mortgage guidelines and higher interest rates

advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content craig alexander deloitte canada s chief economist told several hundred housing executives at a bild calgary region dinner last week that he expected the bank s decision this came as no surprise because financial markets had priced out any rate hike in january in the wake of the tumble in oil and in light of the volatility of the stock market in december said alexander the bank of canada said it still believes that they will ultimately need to move interest rates back to what they consider to be neutral i would argue that the neutral for canada is actually the bottom of that range most forecasters were forecasting the bank of canada would take the overnight rate up to two and a half percent in 2019 and i don t think they re going to get there i think ultimately by the time we get towards the end of this year i think they re going to realize the economy isn t as strong and i think we re going to get a half of a point increase in interest rates this year and i think there s a growing case that they remain on hold a small increase or keeping the rate on hold is good news for prospective home buyers because rising rates make the mortgage stress test more severe advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content alexander expects the national economy to level out we are going to see businesses outside the energy patch investing more because capacity utilization is running at very high levels he said i think we are going to see exports benefitting from a weak canadian dollar but fundamentally the exports and investment can t pick up the slack in the moderation in housing and consumer spending and that s why economic growth drops down to less than two percent last fall alexander had high expectations for the alberta economy as december unfolded i got less enthused he said my forecast for alberta was for growth of 2 3 percent basically neck and neck with b c for the fastest rate of economic growth but now alberta is below the middle of the pack of provinces in terms of growth alexander updated his forecast because of oil the drop in oil prices and oil production curtailment knocks alberta s economic growth rate down from 2 3 percent to about 1 3 percent he said the production curtailment has had the desired impact in narrowing the spread between west texas intermediate wti crude and western canada select wcs prices however what we re talking about is real gross domestic product gross domestic product is the value of all the goods and services we produce the real gdp strips off prices if you put in place an oil production curtailment you reduce the production in order to lose the crisis when you boost the prices but you cut the production you lower your real gdp because it doesn t capture price affects so ultimately the curtailment combined with lower oil prices will constrain investment in the energy patch that is going to lead to weaker economic growth advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content and an effect on housing the real estate market is directly a function of how the economy is doing and so i think we are going to see a weaker pace of construction but well above what we had in 2015 2016 said alexander i think prices have already started to dip but one thing that limits the impact of prices is what will be happening to listings as listings drop it will constrain new

if you recently left an employer you may have to decide whether or how your 401 k should come along with you a 401 k rollover can help you consolidate your retirement savings into fewer accounts open up additional investment options and even save you money in certain circumstances you ll usually face the decision of what to do with your 401 k when you leave a job but you might even have an old 401 k that you ve forgotten about hanging around from a previous employer it s never too late to examine your holdings and decide whether to roll your assets into your current employer s 401 k or an ira or choose another option instead a 401 k rollover is when you transfer the account balance in your old 401 k to a new or existing 401 k or individual retirement account ira how to roll over your 401 k rolling over your 401 k typically involves just a few basic steps however there are a lot of different ways to approach the process so it s best to first clearly understand your priorities and any special circumstances and considerations that might apply to you 1 decide where you want your money to go you have a few destination options to choose from when you roll over a 401 k use a rollover ira the most commonly used is a rollover ira this is simply a traditional ira except it houses funds rolled over from another retirement account like a 401 k investors typically roll over funds into like accounts a traditional 401 k into a traditional ira and a roth 401 k into a roth ira you may also roll over funds from a traditional account into a roth account but you ll owe taxes at your current income tax rate on the amount converted if you expect a year of low income perhaps from an extended gap between jobs then this conversion may be advantageous transfer to a new 401 k the other option is to roll over funds from an old 401 k into your new employer s 401 k plan this keeps all of your retirement investments consolidated so that they re easier to manage for high income earners another reason to transfer to a new 401 k may be to keep the backdoor roth ira option available by sidestepping legally the ira aggregation rule as long as the fees are reasonable for the current 401 k plan this isn t a bad option 2 open a new account or use an existing one you may need to open a new 401 k or establish an ira before initiating a rollover after all you need an account to roll your funds into if you already have a 401 k or ira account that you want to use then you don t need to open a new account however if you prefer to keep your rollover funds separate from an existing account then opening a new account is still an option opening an ira is a simple and straightforward process with most online brokers it can be done entirely online with just a few forms and clicks 3 contact your old 401 k plan administrator to begin the rollover process to transfer funds from your old 401 k you ll need to get in touch with your former employer s plan administrator and indicate that you want to roll over your account there are two ways for administrators to transfer your funds to your rollover destination direct and indirect rollover direct rollover a direct rollover is the easiest way to roll over your 401 k if this is available to you it s the best option to avoid any pitfalls that could result in taxes and penalties with a direct rollover you provide the administrator of the prior 401 k plan with the information for the receiving account for your funds and they usually transfer the funds to the new 401 k account directly sometimes you might receive a check made out to your new ira or 401 k plan and it s your responsibility to forward the check to the appropriate party if you have any questions about where to send the check you can contact your new 401 k plan administrator or your ira brokerage for clarification indirect rollover the other option is an indirect rollover instead of transferring funds directly from your old 401 k to your rollover destination the plan administrator sends the funds to you you are then responsible for depositing the funds in the amount of your old 401 k into your rollover account the major downside with indirect rollovers is that 401 k plan administrators are required to withhold 20 of the taxable funds for the irs you ll get the amount back on your tax return if you complete the rollover but in the meantime you are short by 20 for your new 401 k

restaurants are a mixed bag right now shares of better burger chain shake shack shak 0 56 made a round trip ending almost nowhere in 2018 after putting up a 60 mid year rally shares reversed course and ended the year with a 5 gain however that paltry return still handily beat the overall market s loss of 6 as measured by the s p 500 index in spite of the burger joint s outperformance over the last year as it expanded across the country and overseas investors should exercise caution before jumping on the bandwagon more sales lower averages through the first three quarters of 2018 shake shack put up 335 million in revenue good for a 28 year over year increase though the bottom line is of secondary importance to the still small and mostly regional chain most locations are in the northeast u s it s worth noting that earnings per share increased 22 over the same time period to 0 56 however most of that sales and profit growth is due to the company s aggressive expansion as many as 34 new shacks were opened domestically in 2018 with an additional net 14 to 16 franchised most of which are located internationally that s a better than 30 increase over 2017 and management sees another 36 to 40 domestic locations and 16 to 18 franchised ones opening during the new year that rapid pace of openings and diners warm reception of the brand is impressive but sales at existing stores have been relatively flat going on two years now same shack sales a combination of foot traffic per location and average guest ticket size is expected to be 0 to 1 higher than in 2017 according to research group tdn2k overall restaurant industry comparable sales have been in the same range all year paired with on average lower foot traffic that implies shake shack and its peers are hiding declining guest counts with higher menu pricing metric q1 2018 q2 2018 q3 2018 october 2018 november 2018 industry comparable store sales 0 1 0 9 1 2 0 8 1 1 industry foot traffic 2 7 2 1 30 2 2 1 8 shake shack shak 0 56 same shack sales 1 7 1 1 0 7 n a n a long term sustainability shake shack and other better burger chains are part of the problem america is eating out more than ever before and in an attempt to scoop up market share new locations are popping up faster than the dining out trend can keep up hamburger joints are among some of the most aggressive when it comes to expansion at the end of the day over expansion and resulting declines in traffic mean lower profits per average location shack level profit margins are down to 26 4 on the year compared with 27 2 a year ago through the first nine months of 2018 shake shack s adjusted ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization profit margin was 17 7 down from 18 9 during 2017 thus even though shake shack is growing in size and its existing stores are maturing its profit margins are getting smaller if all was going well the opposite should be occurring that makes this burger chain s stock a bet on whether it can grow its total number of locations faster than its competition at least until it can find a way to break out of the restaurant industry average given that shake shack has few tailwinds other than consumers spending lots of money eating out there are other restaurant stocks out there worth owning instead check out the latest shake shack earnings call transcript
it s a wild ride the u s stock market certainly did its best imitation of a roller coaster last month despite two all time record up days it dived far more than it soared falling 9 percent last month the worst december since the depression year 1931 however it could have been much worse without the 1 086 point rally dec 26 the highest point rise ever its 5 percent jump that day was the best percentage gain in almost 10 years and the next day it set another record for the best comeback ever the dow had plunged 611 points by mid afternoon dec 27 before an incredible 871 point surge pushed it up 260 for the day yet before the belated santa claus rally the market lost 8 percent from 2 p m wednesday dec 19 when the fed reported on its december meeting until it closed early at 1 p m on dec 24 the negative reaction focused in on the fed s stated intention to raise interest rates twice in the coming year the 653 dow decline on christmas eve day was by far its worst day before christmas plunge ever previously the fed had indicated it would raise rates three times but many forecasters were calling for only one or even no increase given that inflation is well contained at the 2 percent level and worldwide and u s economic growth is slowing both japan and germany the world s third and fourth largest economies reported slightly negative growth for the third quarter perhaps putting primary blame on the fed is unfair given that the market sold off 5 percent in october the worst month since 2011 after the s p 500 peaked sept 20 when it was up 11 percent for 2018 certainly the continuing trade war with china and slowing profit growth as the effects of the big corporate tax cut wears off contributed to that selloff a november poll found that ceo expectations about business conditions 12 months out was the lowest recorded since 2016 alright hungerford please tell us how much the market lost last quarter and for all of 2018 fourth quarter numbers were dismal the worst three months since 2008 the dow dropped 11 3 percent the s p 500 was off 13 5 percent and the tech heavy nasdaq declined 17 3 percent at their closing lows dec 24 the dow was down 18 6 percent from its oct 3 high and the s p had fallen 19 8 percent from its sept 20 peak both barely avoiding the 20 percent number that would indicate a bear market and the end of our nearly 10 year old longest ever bull market however the nasdaq and the small cap russell 2000 were mauled by the bear losing 23 percent and 27 percent respectively from their record highs for all of last year the numbers aren t as discouraging as the debacle last quarter the dow lost 3 5 percent the s p fell 4 4 percent the nasdaq declined 2 8 percent and the russell 2000 gave back 11 percent overseas diversification made portfolios even worse because international stocks suffered a 13 8 percent loss in 2017 what a difference between last year and 2017 when the s p 500 rose every month the first time ever to return 22 percent with dividends reinvested of course stock market results for the last two years are irrelevant to the question so many are asking will stocks continue to fall as we head toward a possible recession by the end of this year while a majority of economic forecasters are predicting a recession two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth for 2020 very few think our strong economy will stop growing this year unemployment is the lowest since 1969 christmas sales were up 5 percent the best in six years consumer confidence is still far above average and new car sales are close to record highs however predicted gdp growth for 2019 is dropping the atlanta fed forecast 3 percent growth for this year in october but lowered its 2019 outlook to only 2 4 percent last month gdp grew 3 4 percent for 2018 s third quarter and 4 2 percent for the second quarter corporate profit growth is expected to post a 14 percent gain for last quarter but only about 5 percent for this quarter still i agree with one wall street expert who said last month although corporate profits are moderating they are still respectable and are not indicative of a looming recession despite the slower growth predictions for this year many stock market prognosticators are amazingly bullish the average prediction from a usa today survey dec 21 of chief economists at 19 wall street firms is that the s p will end 2019 at 3 029 that s a terrific 21 percent gain above the 2018 final 2 507 number remember stock market predictions are usually worthless almost no one predicted the 22 percent return for 2017 or the 4 percent decline last year i believe a 20 percent jump this year is possible but only if we settle our trade dispute with china chinese stocks are down 30 percent this year and world economic growth stops its decline europe is problematic given scant progress toward either a brexit agreement or solving italy s debt crisis here in the u s passage of a bi partisan infrastructure program would be helpful one reason for the bullish sentiment is the belief that 2 2½ percent growth this year is a goldilocks scenario that will allow decent economic growth but would be low enough that the fed would not raise rates more than one more time this year also u s stocks appear undervalued selling at only 14x 2019 s estimated earnings about 10 percent below their long term average overseas europe s stocks are projected to be at 12x earnings while emerging markets stocks are the cheapest at about 10x earnings despite our strong economy inflation has stayed near the fed s target 2 percent range that low number puzzles economists one explanation is that hard to measure productivity numbers are too low in other words because u s workers are more productive than the numbers indicate that helps keep inflation low underestimating hard worker americans is a mistake u s industrial output in 2017 was 62 percent higher with 29 percent fewer workers than it was 30 years earlier in 1987 if the economy keeps growing until next july it will break the all time 10 year expansion record set in the 1990s some forecasters who are predicting a 2020 recession believe that growth is long overdue to end australia holds the all time record its economy is completing a 28 year growth streak certainly stock markets will probably continue to have high volatility but given double digit declines from

few announce their divorce on social media but then amazon founder and chief executive officer jeff bezos isn t most people the world s richest man tweeted wednesday that after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation he and his wife mackenzie would split also unlike other people bezos divorce may impact one of the world s most valuable publicly traded companies bezos s wealth is largely based on his shares of amazon stock and since washington state where the couple has lived has community property divorce laws that could give mackenzie bezos a claim on half of jeff bezos fortune as they married one year before he started the company that raises questions of what impact the divorce might have on the company and its leadership a 2013 stanford study separation anxiety the impact of ceo divorce on shareholders noted that there are three different ways in which the end of a chief executive s marriage can have an effect on a company one concerns the productivity and concentration of the ceo the emotional impact and distractions from the practical issues that come up in a divorce proceeding can affect how well a chief executive can manage a company although not routinely ceos even at prestigious companies will resign in under two years a second issue is the perception of risk companies typically grow by undertaking strategies that come with a degree of inherent risk like acquiring another business or introducing new product lines a ceo during and after a divorce will have concerns about personal wealth that can be greatly reduced the executive might become too risk adverse to protect existing wealth in corporate stock or on the contrary chase after too much risk in a hope to win back what was lost the third issue is control a ceo with a large ownership stake and bezos is amazon s single largest shareholder with 16 3 percent of the stock might be forced to sell shares to satisfy a divorce settlement that would reduce the executive s control over the company and possibly cause a drop in share value because of the large amount sold investors don t seem too worried at least for the moment amazon shares were up slightly on wednesday a few hours after bezos released the information that may be due to the way bezos phrased his message stressing the continued good relations and sense of partnership between him and his wife knowing what will happen is impossible west palm beach divorce attorney jeffrey fisher told cnbc that valuing the stock could be contentious there would be an argument by the attorneys that the amazon stake is not worth as much without bezos in control so that would affect any settlement fisher said on the contrary mackenzie bezos might instead opt for a settlement that didn t require a sale of shares and the corresponding dilution of control and value but knowing the future is impossible particularly when 137 billion is on the line
reuters amazon com inc shares seesawed as investors questioned how the impending divorce of company founder jeff bezos would affect his control of the most valuable company on wall street and its ambitious expansion plans bezos whom forbes lists as the world s richest person worth an estimated 136 2 billion said via twitter on wednesday that he and his wife of 25 years mackenzie will divorce amazon shares were down 0 5 percent in afternoon trading on thursday after gaining earlier in the session the split throws into question how the couple will split their fortune which includes an approximately 16 percent ownership stake in amazon s roughly 811 4 billion market capitalization divorce laws in washington state where they live hold that property acquired during a marriage is generally divided equally between spouses most analysts and fund managers are largely sanguine and say the divorce will not lead to any significant change in the company s leadership or its growth prospects prominent short seller doug kass however who runs hedge fund seabreeze partners said he sold his stake in amazon on news of the divorce that was after initially buying a stake in late december and naming amazon among his best ideas list is it premature to ask what happens to amazon when jeff bezos chooses to turn over the day to day running of the company he founded he said his announced divorce gives me pause for thought the couple has multiple residences across the country so there is a possibility the divorce could be filed in a state where marital property is not presumed to be divided equally new york matrimonial lawyer bernard clair said in that case a judge would likely determine mackenzie bezos share of amazon stock based on her contribution to her husband s success which could include helping him make important business decisions or raising their children so he could focus on work any transfer of jeff bezos stock would be subject to u s securities and exchange commission disclosure requirements as an officer and director at the company bezos could be required to file an sec form 4 within two business days of any transfer though former sec lawyer broc romanek noted a provision of u s securities laws exempts share transfers made pursuant to a domestic relations order even if bezos were exempted from filing a form 4 he would be required to update promptly the record of his amazon holdings on file with the sec if his position in the company changed by 1 percent or more said d c securities lawyer thomas gorman mackenzie bezos would also need to file a similar record if she received more than 5 percent of amazon stock peter henning a securities law professor at wayne state university noted that amazon unlike fellow tech giants facebook inc and google inc does not give its founder s shares greater voting rights if mackenzie bezos is given a large block of shares she could have a big say at the company gorman agreed she could wind up with some sort of control block and get herself a directorship he said it depends on what she wants to do any effort to dilute mackenzie bezos voting rights by creating a separate class of shares would require a shareholder vote said gorman though he added that he thought such a move unlikely nobody wants to run their divorce through a shareholder meeting he said robert bacarella portfolio manager of the monetta fund said that while he is not changing his investment in amazon he expects other growth focused portfolio managers may trim their stakes due to concerns about the divorce s impact this is such an over owned company and this gives them an excuse to say maybe i ll trim some back because it adds a new question mark he said bacarella however said he is not concerned because even if mackenzie bezos liquidated a stake that could be as high as 8 percent there would be no fundamental reason behind the sale any impact would be short term in nature unless you worry that he will get so distracted by the divorce that he cannot manage the company this will be a non event said michael pachter an analyst at wedbush securities in los angeles he is given control of the company because shareholders like him and his vision not because he has 50 percent of the stock thomas forte an analyst at d a davidson said questions about the future of the company due to the divorce are legitimate due to jeff bezos outsized influence on its value should he leave the company for any reason its shares would likely immediately fall more than 10 percent he said his influence on the company is as a significant as if he had super voting shares because of his track record and the way he runs the company as if he owned the whole thing he said reporting by david randall and jan wolfe editing by anthony lin and dan grebler
news of amazon chief jeff bezos and wife mackenzie bezos divorcing sparked questions about how the split could affect the world s most valuable company s stock while there were questions there wasn t panic investors are in wait and see mode the news which came wednesday via a tweet from jeff bezos barely moved amazon s share price it closed friday at 1 640 56 what s at risk for jeff bezos and wife mackenzie amazon stock share price amzn the tech bellwether s market cap is roughly 784 billion it has about 477 million shares outstanding jeff bezos owns almost 79 million of those shares those shares as well as his other assets put his net worth at roughly 137 billion reportedly he and his wife of 25 years have no prenuptial agreement the way their assets are split depends on the state in which they file for divorce if it is washington where they live their assets may not necessarily be split 50 50 the state s law provides that everything a couple builds and accrues during their marriage is community property as business insider noted in its report it added that washington s courts attempt to split assets and debts fair and equitably there s also the chance that the couple drafted a postnuptial agreement to avoid negatively affecting amazon s stock stuart slotnick chairman of the matrimonial department of law firm buchanan ingersoll rooney issued a statement on the matter saying there is no reason that there should be a dispute over assets or money because there is more than enough to be equitably distributed without either party seeing a change in their lives jeff bezos will focus on control of his company and will likely elect to maintain the stock and voting rights in the amazon shares over other assets it s unlikely there s any risk to the company why amazon investors could benefit from the bezos divorce amazon faang dow jones if the couple has to sell amazon shares as part of the divorce those shares will become part of amazon s free float according to zerohedge as a result amazon s weight in indexes like the s p 500 could increase index fund managers would then have to buy more amzn shares to account for the change indexes typically use a company s available float rather than the number of shares outstanding to determine weighting amazon is considered one of the most highly liquid stocks traded in the us therefore it s unlikely that jeff bezos selling shares would impact amazon s share price significantly the publication further notes it added that may not be the case for other stocks if index managers liquidate other holdings to buy amazon quoted in the report david dziekanski a portfolio manager at toroso investments said that index managers may need to sell a little of everything else to buy amazon he concluded the equity markets will absorb any amazon additional shares without much impact on price featured image from shutterstock price charts from tradingview the post why jeff bezos divorce could be bullish for amazon shares appeared first on ccn
the gofundme fundraiser that promised to help privately fund president donald trump s plan for a wall spanning the length of the u s mexico border surpassed 20 million dollars in donations this week but the man behind it brian kolfage a rising conservative media star may have had another goal through his border wall campaign he claims to have gathered 3 5 million email addresses which are essential to his broader operation a wide ranging and multipronged effort to collect a list of trump supporters who have proven to be sources of donations for conservative efforts former employees told nbc news according to former employees and public records including website archives nevada business registrations and property records kolfage has repeatedly created gofundme campaigns and published inflammatory fake news articles pushing them both from websites that he sought to hide behind shell companies and false identities in part to harvest email addresses those addresses were then used to push people back to kolfage s websites to sell a brand of coffee he owns or to be stockpiled for future use by conservative campaigns kolfage a triple amputee air force veteran had mostly worked behind the scenes of this operation until the viral gofundme campaign made national headlines retired u s air force sr airman brian kolfage speaks to reporters during a 2016 groundbreaking ceremony for a new home he and his family were receiving through the gary sinise foundation s rise program at sandestin florida on jan 14 2016 devon ravine northwest florida daily news via ap file six days after the campaign was launched it was edited to include a new call after donating sign our petition we need 100 million signatures the text repeats four times at the top of the page before any description about the fundraiser itself a spokesperson for gofundme told nbc news that all donors would be refunded because kolfage had changed the language midcampaign erasing an earlier pledge to refund every single penny if the goal of 1 billion was not met those donors will also be offered a way to refuse the refund and instead have it routed to a new charity set up by kolfage the spokesperson said kolfage also used gofundme to solicit donations by check to a p o box in colorado manned by former freedom daily writer amanda shea the amount raised via checks is unclear though kolfage noted in a tweet that payments by check had put them over the record gofundme says it has no hand in refunding those funds we process refunds for donations made online through gofundme that does not include any offline donations the spokesperson said the campaign however is only the most high profile part of kolfage s email harvesting operation which former employees told nbc news extends back to his creation of far right news websites an effort that resulted in a facebook ban fake news real emails kolfage s email harvesting previously relied on two ultra conservative websites freedomdaily and right wing news that frequently trafficked in false and politically divisive news according to two former employees and two owners of competitor websites lindsey lowery a staff writer at freedomdaily from january 2017 to january 2018 shared a text message with nbc news in which kolfage discussed his email harvesting plans kolfage told lowery that we can make our own through the website to steal collect emails in september 2017 lowery said kolfage would create a petition or campaign related to an article she wrote on freedomdaily and then embed the email bait in that article people would get worked up about the subject matter so they d want to go sign the petition to add their name to the cause lowery said brian is referring to stealing the emails in this text because the people didn t sign up to get spammed with his news it was simply to be part of the petition i believe that s how he got his email distribution built up former u s air force senior airman brian kolfage center sits in a wheelchair next to his wife ashley right who holds their daughter paris during the national september 11 memorial and museum s salute to service tribute honoring u s veterans in new york on nov 10 2014 bebeto matthews ap file as soon as we would hit publish on an article we d immediately have about 200 300 people on the article because of the spike in traffic that those emails being blasted out would provide lowery said despite kolfage s repeated denials of owning the now defunct freedom daily former employees and competitors most of whom asked for anonymity out of fear of retribution provided company emails employment documents and company checks that show kolfage s home address as freedom daily s corporate business address kolfage told nbc news that he simply managed the finances and administration for freedom daily he said the operation s true owner lives in another country and is unwilling to talk about the website the one site kolfage does claim to be associated with right wing news features a chief operating officer on its website named steven smith whose headshot is a reverse image of a stock photo kolfage declined to provide biographical details or contact information for smith who former employees allege does not exist kolfage is listed as the site s social media strategist kolfage told nbc news that smith is real but operates the website anonymously for fear of threats to his family from the left freedomdaily was part of a network of websites operating under the umbrella of liberty alliance a christian online media empire that hosts and serves advertising on the websites of the far right s loudest and most partisan voices freedomdaily and other right wing content makers under liberty alliance would swap hyperpartisan content to attract readers and frequently trafficked in far right propaganda and false articles freedomdaily shut down in february 2018 the same month the site was sued for publishing an article that had falsely identified the driver of the car that killed a protestor during a unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia in august 2017 while several of the other defendants have paid settlements to the incorrectly identified person lawyers for the plaintiff told nbc news they were still trying to find the freedomdaily s owner to enforce a default entry against the site freedomdaily s owner failed to respond to the lawsuit kolfage and his editor in chief the conservative blogger jeff rainforth moved on to a new site right wing news kolfage bought already popular and verified facebook pages from the conservative commentator john hawkins who operated a right wing news site with a different web address according to former kolfage employees and hawkins public accounts just as his new business was growing kolfage claimed he spent 300 000 on ads to attract some 3 5 million followers facebook removed the pages associated with kolfage s websites in october as part of a crack down on inauthentic behavior cut off from the major source of his audience kolfage appeared to revert to a previous tactic tapping his growing list of email subscribers politics as usual after his facebook ban kolfage started a gofundme page imploring people to donate to help him stop social media censorship as the donations poured in he s raised 73 000 through the campaign and an undisclosed amount via a new landing page he set up to receive donations directly he urged supporters to sign his petition we need 1 million signatures to take to the white house his site stated as of friday the censorship campaign has collected over 31 000 emails a number dwarfed by 3 5 million signatures and emails he s collected with the campaign to build the wall joe trippi who is widely credited with pioneering campaign email lists on former new hampshire gov howard dean s presidential campaign in 2004 said that gofundthewall s tactics mirror email collecting projects he s seen from both parties he called 3 5 million signatures collected in less than a month a really big number even by current standards whether it was howard dean or rand paul or john mccain there s a pretty short period between 2003 and 2010 where this stuff tended to be pretty organic and idealistic trippi said they legitimately cared about the issues we looked it at as a real democracy building thing trippi said that the practice of building email lists has since been co opted by people looking to make money off politically active people pick your day in between there but somewhere it got commoditized he said what kolfage will do with the signatures isn t clear and he and his representatives declined to talk about them on the record but his options extend past the dissemination of fake news kolfage s ties to liberty alliance could prove useful in monetizing his email list during the rise of the tea party liberty alliance s owner brandon vallorani perfected the art of publishing conservative content alongside merchandise collecting one of politics most valuable email lists along the way vallorani and representatives for liberty alliance did not respond to requests for comment the selling of email lists in political circles has become standard practice as a residential candidate hillary clinton turned over her email list of about 10 million people to the democratic national committee in april 2017 the list was valued by the fec at 3 5 million trump s list of 20 million supporters is reportedly for sale problems have arisen when the lists are harvested by more free wheeling sources within liberty alliance three republicans who rented an email list from the far right news site big league politics another liberty alliance site came under fire last year reps devin nunes of california and steve scalise of louisiana and sen ted cruz of texas all paid for the ability to reach big league politics readers who had signed up for updates through the site but cruz and scalise both ceased using big league politics email list after one of the site s writers was tied to a secret message board driving harassment campaigns based on the fringe right wing conspiracy theory qanon big league politics founders former breitbart staffers dustin stockton and his wife jennifer lawrence are now working as gofundthewall s public relations contacts stockton and lawrence left big league politics in 2017 more fundraisers the wall isn t kolfage s first foray into online fundraising since 2013 he s used gofundme to finance professional projects and lawsuits and to buy land in june 2013 kolfage crowdfunded his wounded warrior mentor engagement program which he claimed to have launched in response to president barack obama s slashing the funds that used to pay for kolfage s trips to military hospitals my wife and i visit newly severely wounded veterans and their families at various military hospitals such as walter reed brooke army medical center and landstuhl regional medical center in germany kolfage wrote on gofundme please help keep this program alive by 2015 he had raised over 20 000 through the gofundme and an additional fundraiser a calendar sold on the hyperpartisan conservative news site 100percentfedup which netted an additional 4 000 according to a facebook post by kolfage and an interview with the site s owner 100 percent of those funds were used for these trips kolfage told nbc news in a text message but there is no record of kolfage visiting walter reed brooke army medical center landstuhl regional medical center or other veterans hospitals since 2013 according to representatives from each hospital contacted by nbc news buzzfeed news was first to report the details of kolfage s mentor progam no one on our staff that was here during that time period can recall working with mr kolfage robert whetstone deputy of communications at brooke army medical center wrote in an email to nbc news in 2014 kolfage launched a t shirt campaign to cover the legal fees associated with a lawsuit against people he said had defamed him on facebook calling him a plagiarist and a racist among other things in 2015 kolfage s wife started a fundraiser asking for 100 000 to buy land for a new home kolfage s most recent fight4freedom fundraising campaign newsletter came from his personal email address but spoke about him in the third person if you re ready to give back to a veteran who has given so much then this is your chance to directly impact him and his family as well as fighting for conservative values the email read to people who signed the petition and received the email the sender s name appeared as donald trump

nearly half of establishments 47 offered defined contribution plans typically in the form of 401 k plans advertisement advertisement the 401 k plan gets its name from the section of the revenue act of 1978 in which it was introduced it s referred to as a defined contribution plan because 401 k s are funded by fixed sums of money such as 8 of salary contributed regularly by employees and often their employers too the ultimate value of the account is uncertain as it depends on how long the money has to grow and how quickly it grows meanwhile defined benefit plans are exemplified by traditional

401 k plan the biggest mistake you can make regarding your 401 k plan is not participating in the first place the plan sponsor society of america found that in 2016 85 of eligible employees contributed to 401 k plans that s quite good but it also means that 15 did not unless those people have some other solid income streams in store for them in the future they re leaving their retirements at risk if you re not participating in your employer s plan because you know you ve already lined up sufficient retirement income perhaps through a pension then that s fine but if you re just putting it off or don t think participating is really worth it you re putting your future financial security at risk consider that 1 it s typically easy to participate and 2 a 401 k plan can help you amass hundreds of thousands of dollars for retirement with some tax breaks thrown in as well putting off investing for retirement for just one year might even cost you 100 000 or more advertisement advertisement even if you re still very young don t assume you can put off investing because retirement is still so far away remember even if you re only 30 and think you re 35 years away from retirement any money you invest now will have 35 years to grow that s powerful look at the table below which shows how much each thousand dollars you invest might grow to over various periods years of 8 growth final value of 1 000 investment 5 years 1 469 10 years 2 159 15 years 3 172 20 years 4 661 25 years 6 848 30 years 10 063 35 years 14 785 40 years 21 725 calculations by author note how much a single 1 000 can grow to if it has 10 years to grow versus 40 years you can amass more than 10 times as much money if your money has four times longer to grow notice too that between each five year period the amount by which the total changes also grows the difference between years five and 10 is only 690 but the difference between years 30 and 35 is a whopping 4 722 the lesson is clear start early and invest aggressively because your earliest invested dollars can grow the most mistake no 2 not contributing enough to your 401 k another blunder often becomes clear only in retrospect not contributing as much as you could have to your account when the folks at schwab recently conducted a survey of 1 000 participants in the 401 k accounts they administer they found many regretting that they hadn t spent less in order to have saved more here are the top spending regrets advertisement advertisement 55 regretted not spending less on meals out 31 regretted not spending less on expensive clothes 28 regretted not spending less on new cars 28 regretted not spending less on vacations 26 regretted not spending less on newest tech gadgets take a few minutes to ask yourself whether you could contribute more to your 401 k than you re contributing now three stacks of cash each bigger than the last with a green arrow pointing upward laid on top of them image source getty images mistake no 3 not increasing your 401 k contributions regularly even if you think you re contributing enough to your 401 k every year you should aim to save more every year or at least until you re socking away as much as you need to which could be as much as 15 or 20 of your income advertisement advertisement the folks at fidelity ran the numbers for an imaginary 25 year old who starts out earning 40 000 annually and saves annually until retirement at age 67 the eye opening results below show the power of making modest increases to your contributions expressed in both monthly and annual terms increase change in monthly income in retirement change in annual income in retirement one time 1 increase 190 more per month in retirement 2 280 more per year 1 increase every 5 years for 25 years 690 more per month in retirement 8 280 more per year 1 increase every year for 12 years 1 930 23 160 more per year source fidelity com most of us could probably use an additional 1 930 or however much you end up with each month in retirement mistake no 4 not contributing enough to get full employer 401 k match another mistake you might make especially if you re not contributing a lot to your 401 k is not taking full advantage of an employer match most 401 k plans come with a match in one common type of employer match the employer contributes 50 of your contributions of up to 6 of your salary so if you earn 70 000 and contribute 6 or 4 200 your employer will add another 2 100 that s 2 100 of free money and a guaranteed 50 return on your investment which you d be hard pressed to find anywhere else advertisement advertisement some good news in the 401 k world is that matches have been rising recently hitting a median of 4 in 2016 per a vanguard report up from 3 5 in 2014 and 3 in 2007 there are some companies with much bigger matches though so don t assume that 4 or 5 is top notch some workers receive 6 to 10 from their companies though such contributions are far from the norm mistake no 5 loading up on too much company stock another blunder is stuffing your 401 k with too much of your employer s stock yes you may know your employer far better than you know any other company and that gives you an edge as an investor but there s risk too consider for instance that you already get most or all of your income from your employer if you also have most of your retirement money invested in your employer too then you have a heck of a lot of eggs in one basket if the company runs into trouble then not only your job may be in jeopardy but your retirement too remember that plenty of workers have been blindsided when their employers fortunes changed think of enron and other companies where employee retirement savings took big hits or completely imploded in april the wall street journal profiled a general electric retiree who had some 280 000 in company stock upon retiring but watched his shares value plummet to 110 000 since april ge shares have dropped further roughly 30 as of this writing advertisement advertisement consider having no more than 5 or 10 of your overall retirement savings in your employer s stock mistake no 6 staying with your 401 k plan s default investment choices it s also a big mistake to be too conservative in the way you invest your money especially if you re young you may be plowing huge sums into your 401 k every year but if your money s growing much more slowly than it could you ll be losing out on a lot of gains a common way that people unknowing invest their money too conservatively is if they don t actively select investments and instead just leave fund in their plan s default investments which are often very conservative for most folks especially the young the stock market is the best choice for much or all of their money yes it can be volatile but over long periods it has always gone up check out the table below featuring data from wharton business school professor jeremy siegel who has calculated the average returns for stocks bonds bills gold and the dollar between 1802 and 2012 asset class annualized nominal return stocks 8 1 bonds 5 1 bills 4 2 gold 2 1 u s dollar

wrong investments it s easy to see why you should be invested in stocks and perhaps have a portion of your portfolio in bonds for diversification because you can t pick individual stocks in your 401 k you ll need to choose from the stock focused mutual funds and or exchange traded funds etfs that are on your plan s menu and this presents another opportunity to make mistakes if you re not careful you may end up choosing funds that perform poorly you can research mutual funds at sites such as morningstar com where you can look up funds holdings performance and more be sure you understand the difference between actively managed and passively managed funds too an actively managed fund will have financial pros studying the chosen universe of stocks and carefully selecting investments for the fund according to its stated focus which might be large companies foreign companies etc the managers will also be deciding when to buy and sell various investments and sometimes they do a lot more buying and selling than is ideal resulting in a lot of commission costs and capital gains taxes passively managed index funds on the other hand simply aim to mirror the performance of an index such as the s p 500 which represents about 80 of the u s stock market by purchasing all the investments in that index in the same proportions so if you re invested in an index fund that tracks the s p 500 your money will be spread across those 500 companies and you ll enjoy roughly the same performance as the s p 500 while some actively managed funds do well the vast majority don t do as well as passively managed index funds over the 15 years ending in june 2018 about 92 of u s large cap stock mutual funds lagged the returns of the s p 500 the pattern holds true for indexes of smaller companies too about 95 of u s mid cap stock funds trailed the popular s p midcap 400 index over those 15 years while the s p smallcap 600 index outperformed nearly 98 of all u s small cap funds there are bond and real estate focused index funds too here are some candidates to consider spdr s p 500 etf nysemkt spy vanguard total stock market etf nysemkt vti vanguard total world stock etf nysemkt vt vanguard total bond market index fund nasdaqmutfund vbmfx vanguard reit index fund nasdaqmutfund vgsix mistake no 8 ignoring fees in your 401 k a key reason why index funds outperform so many managed mutual funds is their low fees a typical actively managed stock mutual fund might carry an annual fee known as the expense ratio of 1 or 1 5 or more while many broad market index funds sport annual fees of less than 0 25 or even 0 10 that s often a difference of more than one whole percentage point here s a look at how much of a difference a single percentage point can make imagine two identical mutual funds one of which has an expense ratio of 1 1 and one of which charges only 0 1 the table below shows how much annual investments of 10 000 would grow assuming they averaged returns of 10 annually and then had those fees subtracted investing period balance assuming 8 9 growth balance assuming 9 9 growth 10 years 164 663 174 315 20 years 550 920 622 348 30 years 1 5 million 1 8 million calculations by author that seemingly small single percentage point can cost you tens of thousands of dollars over many years potentially even hundreds of thousands of dollars a 401 k account can charge you other fees too on top of the fees charged by each fund or investment held in the account and few people realize it a recent report from the folks at td ameritrade noted just 27 know how much they re paying in fees on their 401 k accounts 401 k plans aren t free about 95 of 401 k participants are paying administrative and other fees in addition to fund fees larger companies tend to have lower 401 k fees while smaller companies tend to charge more anything above say 1 is worrisome and some plans charge 2 or even 3 or more be sure to find out what kinds of fees you re being charged in your 401 k and give extra consideration to choices with low fees you may find the fees listed on your statements or in your plan s literature and your human resources department should be able to tell you what they are as well you can also compare your employer s 401 k with those of other companies at brightscope com if your fees seem steep let your company know if they re downright outrageous you may want to contribute just enough to max out any employer match and then do the rest of your retirement saving through iras accounts that offer similar tax breaks to a 401 k and regular brokerage accounts three eggs on a bed of currency on each is written a word roth ira 401k image source getty images mistake no 9 not considering the roth 401 k more and more employers are now offering roth 401 k s and it s a mistake not to investigate this option especially if you re still decades from retirement with a traditional 401 k you contribute your income before it s taxed thereby reducing your tax bill for the year when you withdraw the money in retirement it s taxed as ordinary income to you with the roth 401 k meanwhile you contribute post tax money and thus get no up front tax break however you get a big tax break when you retire if you follow the rules you get to take all the money out of the account tax free imagine for example socking away 10 000 annually for 25 years and having it grow at an average rate of 8 per year you d end up with close to 790 000 and that would all be available to you in retirement free of tax yes you were taxed on that money but every dollar you withdraw will be yours to keep this is an especially big advantage if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is now tax free withdrawals also do away with any uncertainty regarding federal income tax rates if you invest in a roth 401 k you don t need to worry about whether the government will later raise your tax rate and take a big bite out of your retirement savings opting for a roth 401 k may be a smart decision but there are circumstances in which a traditional 401 k may be preferable for example if you expect your tax bracket in retirement to be significantly lower than your current one you may want to shield some of your current income from your steep tax rate by contributing to traditional 401 k s and iras mistake no 10 ignoring important 401 k rules another blunder is not being aware of the various rules on 401 k accounts for example you generally can t withdraw money from your 401 k until age 59 1 2 take money out before then and you ll likely face a 10 early withdrawal penalty there are some exceptions though if you leave your job in the year that you turn 55 or later you can withdraw funds from that employer s 401 k without penalty retiring early due to a qualifying disability can also free you from the penalty as can a few other circumstances such as financial hardship and if you re in no hurry to withdraw money know that you can t delay doing so forever a 401 k account whether traditional or roth comes with required minimum distributions an rmd is a certain amount of money that you re required to withdraw from your 401 k each year and it changes with your age you re required to start taking rmds on april 1 following the later of the calendar year in which you reach age 70 1 2 or retire per the irs failing to take your rmd on time can result in one of the harshest tax penalties a whopping half of what you were supposed to withdraw but did not withdrawals from a traditional 401 k will count as taxable income while roth 401 k withdrawals are tax free given that contributions to a roth 401 k are made with taxed money here s another rule to understand your employer s matching contributions may not be yours to keep right away some 401 k plans gradually give you ownership of the match according to a vesting schedule for example if your employer adds 4 000 to your 401 k in a given year you may only take possession of 1 000 immediately while the rest comes in annual installments of 1 000 the best 401 k s grant you immediate ownership of employer matches but some companies have lengthy vesting schedules to motivate you to stick around mistake no 11 cashing out or borrowing from your 401 k cashing out your 401 k account when you change jobs or borrowing against it to meet some financial need is another mistake because it stops the distributed money from growing for you when you leave your employer you usually have a few options leave your 401 k money in the account transfer the money to your new employer s 401 k plan transfer the money to an ira or cash out leaving the money in the account is easiest but you ll often face some kind of account management fees with this option cashing out shortchanges your future don t think of that sum of money as a windfall you can remove and enjoy a 401 k is not meant to be a short term savings account but a long term vehicle to help fund your retirement don t make the mistake of assuming the account is too small to make much of a difference either even if you only have 20 000 in it if that sum remains invested for another 20 years and grows by an average of 8 annually it will end up worth more than 90 000 that can go a long way in retirement indeed if you withdraw 4 of that amount per year in retirement as a common rule of thumb recommends it will give you more than 5 000 per year or close to 450 per month also keep in mind that if you cash out a 401 k before you hit age 59 1 2 you ll have to fork over that 10 early withdrawal penalty not to mention income taxes if it s a traditional 401 k when leaving a job it s often best to roll over any 401 k money into your new 401 k account or into an ira borrowing from your 401 k meanwhile is also usually a mistake in the best case scenario you pay the funds back after a year or three but even then you ll have missed out on the growth that money could have achieved in the meantime the worst case scenario is that you never pay it back and end up paying a penalty and taxes for failing to do so that happens to plenty of people who had the best intentions of paying it back mistake no 12 not appreciating the downsides of 401 k s a final mistake to avoid is not appreciating that 401 k s are imperfect it s wise to be aware of the areas in which they fall short or have room for improvement for example 401 k s offer limited menus of investment choices typically somewhere between a dozen and several dozen mutual funds by contrast most ira accounts let invest in just about any individual stock and choose among thousands of funds then there are 401 k s fees which can sometimes be hefty even when they seem small they can do meaningful damage to your results some plans charge big fees even for index funds that you can invest in elsewhere for a pittance a wall street journal article from 2016 noted that according to vanguard group investors in a plan that charged 0 25 a year could in theory amass 20 more money over a four decade career than they could in one that charged 1 25 all else being equal you also can t easily withdraw money from a 401 k account until you reach a certain age that s generally a good thing as it encourages you to let the money keep growing but some people might prefer stockpiling money in a regular taxable account where they have more control over it remember that regular taxable accounts don t offer free matching funds from employers though taxes can be a downside of 401 k s too if you have a traditional non roth 401 k you ll pay taxes at your ordinary income tax rate on any withdrawals made in retirement depending on how much income you earn at that time your tax rate could be significant think about dividends for example dividends received in a regular taxable account currently face a 15 tax rate for most folks but when you distribute them from a traditional 401 k account and they re taxed as income you might pay a higher rate reminder if you re in say the 24 tax bracket that doesn t mean all your income is taxed at 24 only the income that falls within that bracket the overall rate you end up paying known as your effective tax rate is likely much lower the bottom line all this talk of downsides and 401 k mistakes might have you thinking that 401 k accounts aren t all that wonderful don t think that they are extremely powerful retirement saving tools not only for the significant tax savings but also because they take money out of your paycheck before you even see it they can make it easier to save aggressively and effectively for retirement by automating much of the work revisit the tables earlier in this article to refresh yourself on just how many hundreds of thousands of dollars you might amass then go ahead and make good use of any 401 k account available to you while avoiding the costly mistakes above more from the motley fool selena maranjian has no position in any

around christmas day karl krause and daan colijn started receiving emails from their fans telling them their pictures were being used to promote pedophilia in several viral posts on twitter they were outraged emails krause said they were saying how can that be you are not pro pedophilia i know that krause and colijn are gay travel bloggers who tell their followers of gay friendly and lgbtq owned businesses and communities throughout the world they had no idea their faces were being used to promote an idea they found abhorrent one of their pictures which features krause and colijn kissing in front of a rainbow flag had been stolen by a twitter troll who went by the name alex an account that was created in december the account then tweeted messages promoting pedophilia it s frustrating to see someone misusing our image for political purposes basically supporting an argument against the lgbtq community with our work krause said the account successfully spread across twitter the deliberately defamatory idea that pedophilia is an acceptable part of lgbtq life over the last half decade that concept has become a staple of far right internet trolls on websites like the fringe message board 4chan and the troll s message quickly gained internet traction some far right news websites wrote articles based on the tweet including the federalist papers which published a post with the headline resistance member says pedophilia is sexual orientation claims bigotry one tweet from the troll s account which used the handle vaceyi stated that pedophilia is a sexual orientation you bigots that tweet has drawn more than 16 000 replies and received attention on far right parts of the internet drawing scathing responses from right wing commentator and former major league baseball pitcher curt schilling and pizzagate conspiracy theorist jack posobiec among others they took the fake message seriously and used it to suggest that the lgbtq community supports the sexual abuse of children they are actually trying to argue that pedophiles are an oppressed minority posobiec wrote on twitter attaching screenshots of vaceyi s tweets many warned this day would come various efforts to tie the lgbtq community to pedophilia have been linked back to 4chan including the creation of a fake rainbow flag for gay pride month that supposedly was designed to show acceptance of pedophilia the flag and a fake lgbtp acronym were debunked by the fact checking organization snopes in 2016 a 4chan post stated if they want to demand that society accept their horses identities then it s time we slip in one of our own and implored users to convince them pedos deserve rights too shortly after vaceyi s tweets went viral one 4chan user posted posobiec s tweet mentioning the account wondering if posobiec knew that vaceyi is a troll does know he s being trolled by you guys and just going with it to look good or does he think the person tweeting this is serious the user asked the user behind vaceyi did not respond to a request for comment the vaceyi account used strategies that have become common among efforts to spread misinformation and propaganda on social media building up a small following by tweeting pro lgbtq hashtags and retweeting gay and lesbian aid organizations before sending the pro pedophilia messages krause said he and his followers repeatedly reported the vaceyi account using his identity to twitter which insisted he provide proof of his identity the account later changed its profile picture to a stock photo of two black men kissing twitter permanently suspended vaceyi on thursday night after nbc news asked about the account twitter rules do not allow the promotion of child sexual exploitation the company s rules also bars impersonation and hateful conduct this type of deliberate attempt to undermine and disrupt the health of the public conversation has absolutely no place on our service a twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement coordinated activity of this nature including running multiple accounts and adopting fake personae is a violation of the twitter rules we are aggressively taking action pursuant with our policies zeke stokes the vice president of programs for the lgbtq advocacy group glaad told nbc news that platforms need to work faster to cut down on this sort of defamation against the lgbtq community social media platforms have the right and the responsibility to protect their products from being weaponized and their users from being targeted by those who wish to spread hate misinformation and malicious rhetoric stokes said anti lgbtq leaders have long tried to surface these debunked lies about lgbtq people despite the fact that our culture knows these fear tactics are blatantly false smears that have attempted to tie the lgbtq community to pedophilia are decades old according to thomas g plante a psychologist and professor at santa clara university who has studied the psychopathology behind pedophilia for more than 30 years the critical thing is that sexual orientation in and of itself is not a risk factor for psychopathology for anything let alone pedophilia plante said in an interview the majority of people who are pedophiles are step fathers older brothers next door neighbors or others like that it has to do with access impulse control problems and other kinds of psychopathology the recent spate of anti science talking points about pedophilia from extremists drives me kind of crazy plante said you ve got plenty of people out there who are experts in this stuff who treat and evaluate people plante said all of that gets discarded because there s someone out there who has an anonymous twitter account who s much louder in the meantime krause said this experience has emboldened him to continue his work showing spaces gay travelers can go without harassment through out the world we see our work as activism said krause people should know about this part of our work don t fall for this other thing we try to tell people that we just want to be treated equally
mark zuckerberg announced on tuesday that he will host a series of public discussions about the future of technology in society which the facebook ceo admitted will require him to put myself out there more than i ve been comfortable with every few weeks i ll talk with leaders experts and people in our community from different fields and i ll try different formats to keep it interesting zuckerberg wrote in a post on his personal facebook page these will all be public either on my facebook or instagram pages or on other media the announcement comes in the form of zuckerberg s annual personal challenge which in previous years has included everything from killing the meat he ate to wearing a tie to work it also points to growing skepticism from politicians the general public and even many technologists over the possible harms of facebook and other tech that has quickly taken hold in the lives of millions of people among the critiques leveled at technology companies is the notion that some of its innovations have been created without properly anticipating negative impacts or manipulation by bad actors a line or argument that zuckerberg alluded to i m an engineer and i used to just build out my ideas and hope they d mostly speak for themselves zuckerberg said but given the importance of what we do that doesn t cut it anymore zuckerberg said that although he had been hesitant to speak publicly on controversial topics he was ready to engage more in some of these debates about the future the tradeoffs we face and where we want to go the new challenge follows on the one he set in 2018 which he said at the end of the year has ended up being more than a one year challenge we re a very different company today than we were in 2016 or even a year ago we ve fundamentally altered our dna to focus more on preventing harm in all our services and we ve systematically shifted a large portion of our company to work on preventing harm he wrote zuckerberg s challenges didn t use to be so heavy in fact some of them were fun in 2009 facebook had 150 million users and the most important challenge facing zuckerberg was trading in his t shirt for a tie when he went to work zuckerberg vowed 2010 would be a year of progress with his mandarin skills and it appears to have paid off zuckerberg has charmed crowds in china with his speaking skills even if they ve been criticized as clumsy in 2011 zuckerberg killed a chicken pig and a goat as part of his personal challenge which was to only eat meat that he slaughtered the animals were then sent to a butcher who would send the meat back to zuckerberg for his home cooking adventures which made use of every part of the animal zuckerberg ate chicken livers and made stock from chicken feet according to fortune the year facebook went public 2012 zuckerberg vowed to stick to his roots and code every day in 2013 zuckerberg s goal was to meet someone new who doesn t work at facebook every day and have a conversation with them the next year he focused on writing one thank you note every day which zuckerberg said would be tough because he s a really critical person i always kind of see how i want things to be better and i m generally not happy with how things are or the level of service that we re providing for people or the quality of the teams that we built but if you look at this objectively we re doing so well on so many of these things i think it s important to have gratitude for that he told businessweek in 2015 zuckerberg committed to reading a new book every other week and announced each title on the a year of books facebook page where he encouraged other facebook users to join him the next year zuckerberg built his own iron man style artificial intelligence powered assistant named jarvis which was voiced by morgan freeman in a video posted at the end of the year he showed how the ai operated in his home from helping his daughter practice her mandarin to a t shirt cannon that fires a fresh gray t shirt when zuckerberg says fresh shirt in 2017 two months after the u s presidential election zuckerberg decided to go on road trips to meet more americans
attorneys in san francisco representing an alphabet shareholder are suing the board of directors for allegedly covering up sexual misconduct claims against top executives the suit comes months after an explosive new york times report detailed how google shielded executives accused of sexual misconduct either by keeping them on staff or allowing them amicable departures for example google reportedly paid android leader andy rubin a 90 million exit package despite asking for his resignation after finding sexual misconduct claims against him credible similarly amit singhal was allowed to quietly resign after sexual misconduct claims were made against him too the original report spurred a massive protest during which thousands of google employees walked out of offices around the world in response the company ended its forced arbitration policy for sexual misconduct allegations and said it would start providing more transparency around sexual harassment investigations the new lawsuit filed in california s san mateo county asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty abuse of control unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets the attorneys say the lawsuit is the result of an extensive original investigation into non public evidence and produced copies of internal google minutes from board of directors meetings the directors wrongful conduct allowed the illegal conduct to proliferate and continue the suit reads as such members of alphabet s board were knowing and direct enablers of the sexual harassment and discrimination the suit also accuses board members of employing contradictory standards if you were a high level male executive at google responsible for generating millions of dollars in revenue google would let you engage in sexual harassment and if you get caught google would keep it quiet let you resign and pay you millions of dollars in severance the suit reads on the other hand if you were a low level employee at google and were accused of sexual harassment or discrimination you would be fired for cause with no severance benefits in this way alphabet and the board were able to maintain optics and superficial compliance with its code of conduct internal rules and laws regarding sexual harassment by appearing to take decisive action against a significant number of low level employees and by concealing the blatant and widespread sexual harassment by senior google executives the board avoided a much bigger scandal in late october google ceo sundar pichai told employees that google had fired 48 employees for sexual misconduct over the past two years the shareholder plaintiff james martin has held alphabet stock since october 2009 google did not immediately respond to a request for comment

beijing china s economic performance in 2018 was rather disappointing according to official statistics the country s growth rate up to the end of the third quarter was 6 7 per cent the lowest since the global financial crisis the real situation was probably even worse a lack of progress on institutional reform together with obstacles to structural adjustment have been fuelling doubt among many foreign and domestic observers about china s growth prospects some even anticipate a financial crisis caused by a bursting housing bubble or large scale debt defaults by local governments and corporations the trade war with the united states only deepens such worries although a slowdown was inevitable in china after four decades of breakneck growth the chinese government should try to stop further deceleration this year otherwise china s economic financial and social stability will be jeopardised this can be achieved if the government adjusts its macroeconomic policy stance begin with monetary policy the people s bank of china pboc is currently responsible for at a minimum maintaining the stability of economic growth employment prices and the exchange rate that is too many objectives to pursue simultaneously as reflected in sudden and frequent monetary policy reversals since late 2011 the pboc has changed its policy stance four times in response to fluctuations in housing prices but its manoeuvres have often undermined its other objectives for example while tightening monetary policy can rein in runaway housing prices it exacerbates the growth slowdown in fact monetary tightening might not even be called for though many argue that the pboc s past liquidity injections especially its large stimulus in response to the 2008 global economic crisis caused the real estate bubble housing prices began to skyrocket long before indeed it is not at all clear that increasing the money supply boosts prices it may even work the other way around because rising housing prices have absorbed too much liquidity the pboc has to increase the money supply to support the real economy with china s growth steadily declining and the consumer price index at around 2 per cent the pboc would do well to adopt a more expansionary monetary policy fiscal levers can be used to contain housing prices which given popular frustration with the real estate market remains an important objective of course expansionary monetary policy would put downward pressure on the renminbi compounding the effects of the us federal reserve s fed ongoing normalisation of interest rates but that needs to be allowed to happen with the pboc no longer shouldering the responsibility for maintaining exchange rate stability for too long china s obsession with currency stability has deprived the pboc of true monetary autonomy it is time to move on chinese enterprises should have learned by this point how to protect themselves from exchange rate fluctuations and china maintains capital controls that effectively protect it against an excessively sharp devaluation let alone a run on the renminbi in any event the more important challenge for china s leaders is to devise a new approach to fiscal policy even us president donald trump s administration with its limited understanding of economics recognises government s vital role in strengthening areas in which the private sector has insufficient incentive to invest but that are important to national security and economic stability at the end of 2017 china s official public debt to gdp ratio stood at 36 2 per cent the real figure is probably significantly higher if one accounts for contingent liabilities especially the debts owned by local government financing vehicles but even then china s fiscal position is rather strong compared to most countries especially bearing in mind that not all local government debts are bad debts this means that china still has room to pursue expansionary fiscal policy with a focus on reversing the investment slowdown that fuelled the decline in gdp growth in 2018 in the first three quarters of 2018 fixed investment grew by just 5 4 per cent year on year compared with 7 5 per cent in 2017 largely because growth in infrastructure investment which accounted for some 27 per cent of fixed investment plummeted from 19 8 per cent in 2017 to just 3 3 per cent in 2018 a major concern here relates to the efficiency of infrastructure investments but the concern that inefficient investments are fuelling debt accumulation can be addressed effectively with better designed projects and appropriate limitations on the role of local governments in particular rather than permit local governments to borrow from commercial banks to fund infrastructure investments the central government should foot the bill the combination of higher expenditures and lower revenues resulting from tax cuts and fee reductions may cause china s budget deficit to gdp ratio to exceed 3 per cent but like the cny7 threshold for the us dollar exchange rate that threshold should not be considered sacred as long as interest rates for government bonds can be kept low the government should not be afraid to issue more of them expansionary macroeconomic policy alone will not resolve all of china s problems in the long term and it undoubtedly carries significant risks but given the paramount importance of stabilising growth the chinese authorities need to use all of the tools at their disposal yu yongding a former president of the china society of world economics and director of the institute of world economics and politics at the chinese academy of social sciences served on the monetary policy committee of the people s bank of china from 2004 to 2006 copyright project syndicate

i ruined all my future potential for joy that first time i tasted roquefort with canadian ice wine i was on a trip with a then partner in his home region of niagara on the lake a wine growing area just outside of toronto enjoying some time among the vines i was a novice with zero knowledge of wine fundamentals so the tasting room attendant showed me the light wanting to expose me to the wonders of nectarlike ice wine she carved a nugget of salty funky roquefort and changed the course of my life i took a sip of syrupy near cloying wine followed by a nibble of the creamy cheese though individually the wine and cheese felt like short jagged bursts of an incomplete musical score together the strong sharp flavors of the cheese and the luscious fruitiness of the wine felt like a symphony it was harmony i ve held on to that memory for a decade now it has guided my approach to pairing wine with food i learned that lightning doesn t strike the same place twice and perfection is a fool s errand when it comes to food and wine pairings few hold the imagination or drive sales quite like dramatic cheese plates surrounded by bottles of wine creamy camemberts funky epoisses sharp vermont cheddar and grassy manchego represent an atlas of flavor on a plate why not indulge with some vino while you re at it unfortunately a myth prevails that there s a perfect solution to pairing each cheese with a specific vinous suitor question for you when was the last time you were hanging out by a party s cheese plate talking with friends and other partygoers about how great the pairings were do you remember what you were even eating or drinking was there a quiz at the end of the party i hope the answer to all these questions is oh my no because what a boring fete just like that old convention of pairing red wines with meat whites with fish most rules governing cheese pairings are tiresome and keep you in a box stop worrying start drinking but i suppose you came here for actual tips not a treatise i ll oblige the first and last lesson i ve picked up about wine and food pairings is to throw out the tasting notes there are so many other factors in a wine that make them suitable for food pairings and knowing that a beaujolais villages wine tastes like cranberries black pepper and violets is less useful than knowing about its texture weight minerality tannins acidity level alcohol level and sweetness a great wine balances all of these elements and as such often makes a great food partner that includes cheese wines that tend toward weighty oaky tannic and boozy are often just too much for food and certainly overpower the often subtle flavors of cheese when i m planning to have friends over for drinks and cheese i tend to stock up on cool climate wines whites and reds i avoid big bruisy wines which generally hail from warmer regions and tend toward over ripeness low acidity and higher alcohol levels wines like aussie shiraz argentine malbec and napa cabernet have their place sure particularly those nights i want to channel my inner olivia pope or am digging into a giant steak but for brunch book club or a casual hang light and nimble wines do the trick easygoing sicilian frappato and cool climate loire valley cabernet francs are my go to reds mainly because both express softer tannins and higher acidity they re lively and tend toward funky a nice foil for grassy or stinky cheeses france s loire valley and beaujolais regions produce some of the country s best drink me now wines in recent years the general vin de table table wine or vin de france designations have modernized beyond old associations with plonk you ll find many wines now carrying these on their label instead of vineyard or appellation designations some contemporary winemakers feel boxed in by traditional methods governed by appellation d origine controlee certification the trade off for eschewing aoc strictures is greater control for the winemaker these wines range from 15 to 30 reasonable and not outrageous and they pack a lot of flavor for the price producers i recommend include la boutanche whose wines feature cheeky updates on the critter labels of yesteryear and domaine catherine et pierre breton one of the loire s masters of mind blowing and complex cabernet franc though the big name wines of the burgundy bordeaux and rhone regions still get a lot of love from grocery stores and volume retailers wines from the loire valley have been taking over more shelf space especially in better curated wine shops where small production winemakers often land for frappato try marchese montefusco 15 a nice introduction to sicily s food friendly indigenous grape sicily is a great region to explore value driven small production wines and this frappato full of aromatic berry flavors and soft smooth tannins is no exception when it comes to white wines i tend to turn to cool climate u s regions i head south from big name regions napa and sonoma for santa barbara s fresh apple forward chardonnays which don t often see the oak treatment so common in napa the wines there have a tendency toward freshness and vibrancy with relatively common apple and pear flavors apples go with cheese right seek out names like qupe au bon climat and ojai vineyard which have strong national distribution over in the east new york state s cool finger lakes region produces excellent and electric riesling a far cry from the sweeter blue german bottles of the 80s producers to look out for include pioneers hermann j wiemer red tail ridge and dr konstantin frank which all grow and bottle estate fruit with a hands on and personal approach to their vineyard practices of course if all else fails you can t go wrong with pairing cheese with sparkling wine life s a party stop fretting the small stuff frappato and riesling are two grapes that pair well with a variety of cheeses from sicily try marchese montefusco frappato left from the finger lakes try dr konstantin frank riesling e jason wambsgans chicago tribune tns
news of amazon chief jeff bezos and wife mackenzie bezos divorcing sparked questions about how the split could affect the world s most valuable company s stock while there were questions there wasn t panic investors are in wait and see mode the news which came wednesday via a tweet from jeff bezos barely moved amazon s share price it closed friday at 1 640 56 what s at risk for jeff bezos and wife mackenzie the tech bellwether s market cap is roughly 784 billion it has about 477 million shares outstanding jeff bezos owns almost 79 million of those shares those shares as well as his other assets put his net worth at roughly 137 billion reportedly he and his wife of 25 years have no prenuptial agreement the way their assets are split depends on the state in which they file for divorce if it is washington where they live their assets may not necessarily be split 50 50 the state s law provides that everything a couple builds and accrues during their marriage is community property as business insider noted in its report it added that washington s courts attempt to split assets and debts fair and equitably there s also the chance that the couple drafted a postnuptial agreement to avoid negatively affecting amazon s stock stuart slotnick chairman of the matrimonial department of law firm buchanan ingersoll rooney issued a statement on the matter saying there is no reason that there should be a dispute over assets or money because there is more than enough to be equitably distributed without either party seeing a change in their lives jeff bezos will focus on control of his company and will likely elect to maintain the stock and voting rights in the amazon shares over other assets it s unlikely there s any risk to the company why amazon investors could benefit from the bezos divorce if the couple has to sell amazon shares as part of the divorce those shares will become part of amazon s free float according to zerohedge as a result amazon s weight in indexes like the s p 500 could increase index fund managers would then have to buy more amzn shares to account for the change indexes typically use a company s available float rather than the number of shares outstanding to determine weighting amazon is considered one of the most highly liquid stocks traded in the us therefore it s unlikely that jeff bezos selling shares would impact amazon s share price significantly the publication further notes it added that may not be the case for other stocks if index managers liquidate other holdings to buy amazon quoted in the report david dziekanski a portfolio manager at toroso investments said that index managers may need to sell a little of everything else to buy amazon he concluded the equity markets will absorb any amazon additional shares without much impact on price featured image from shutterstock price charts from tradingview
reuters with the conclusion of the first round of negotiations yesterday in beijing the way ahead for the united states and china to avoid a full scale tariff war has become clear with fifty days remaining before the march 1 end of the truce trump and xi announced to prevent u s tariffs increasing from 10 to 25 percent on 200 billion of chinese imports negotiations are likely to continue until the deadline but before march 1 trump will declare victory in this phase of the trade war extending the truce for another six months in which a second phase of negotiations will address even more contentious issues each december the ceo and his team set objectives for the year to come like the leadership of apple or amazon they assess the headwinds including signs of slowdown in the chinese economy projections of flagging global economic growth and uncertainties about the trade war on that basis they make decisions about how they are going to deliver the growth they have promised shareholders in china s case 6 5 percent on december 18 celebrating the fortieth anniversary of china s opening to the world xi reminded his 1 4 billion fellow citizens shareholders that over those four decades their party led government has delivered economic growth of 10 percent a year but his speech also struck an odd note when he declared boldly that there is no great master who can dictate to the chinese people my response was say what the most frequent question beijing policymakers asked me is whether the current u s government can take yes for an answer in current negotiations lighthizer has the lead the chinese have studied his successful negotiation of the new nafta mere months ago they see the differences between the old nafta and the new agreement as plus or minus 10 to 15 percent chinese negotiators have dissected the white house summary of what trump and xi agreed to at the g20 meeting when announcing the truce it promised to shrink the bilateral trade deficit reduce chinese non tariff barriers provide american companies a larger share in key chinese markets and constrain theft and forced transfer of intellectual property but on the much more difficult issue of industrial policy and the role of the government in the chinese economy it was instructively silent thus before march 1 expect trump to declare a triumph in a great trade deal that will feature china s purchase of more than a trillion dollars of additional u s products in addition to purchases of additional u s gas oil and agricultural produces expect the agreement to include targets for increases in american companies share of banking insurance and equity markets since american producers account for 6 percent of china s current gas imports 3 percent of its oil imports and 14 percent of its agricultural imports and chinese companies control 98 percent of its banking market 95 percent of the equity business and 91 percent of insurance all this should not be that hard phase two of the negotiations will then struggle with the more difficult issues of protection of intellectual property and industrial policy yogi berra cautioned against making predictions especially about the future nonetheless if placing my bet today i make the odds of a great deal as more likely than not

lisa renner who has been at the district and involved with the art show for 11 years and behind the scenes of the art show for five years applauded the students including some of the finalists who completed the piece in only a few days which she described as telling of the students natural art talent most teachers start their students on pieces in october with some finishing in a couple of weeks and some longer i believe anybody can learn to create art but there are those that have the gift naturally and when you see a student that can produce a finalist piece in a few days you know that they have so much talent within them that you want to help nurture that more and you can see they are going to go somewhere professionally with their future rennels said if you can do this then i can push you to do more and more stuff it widens the techniques too as far as medium and techniques this year she shared the show kept the same rules and theme as previous years and the hlsr committee will further narrow down the finalists this week to choose who will be participate in the big show the kids are just excelling and pushing their skillset every year to do more more and more renner

high school students will talk about their pieces that got picked in elementary school so it becomes that k 12 kind of experience for some of them there is that nostalgia and personal touch to it but the kids as well as the teachers when we see the pieces hanging that inspires us for the next year renner added
jeff estes has worked as a federal contractor for 35 years in cape canaveral florida now he and his colleagues are out of work because of a partial government shutdown that as of saturday became the longest in american history for estes a union official and electrician the shutdown is becoming particularly burdensome because he s paying for his two kids to attend college and the government s recent decision to change contractors forced him and his coworkers to reapply for their jobs with much of the government at a standstill estes and his colleagues members of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers aren t sure whether they will still have a job when it s over he said those in a position to know are furloughed leaving estes and many others more than frustrated as the government shutdown enters its 22nd day on saturday it s not a d problem it s not an r problem it s washington d c the beltway estes told nbc news people in america and the workforce should not be used as pawns deal with your business without putting me out of the job do your job and i ll keep doing mine approximately 800 000 federal employees are estimated to be furloughed or working without pay because president donald trump and congress cannot reach a deal to reopen the government they are at an impasse over 5 7 billion for construction of a wall along the southern border the number of furloughed employees does not include federal contractors like estes it s unclear how many contract or grant employees are affected by the shutdown or even how many there are in total but a volcker alliance report estimated that nearly 5 3 million worked as contractors in 2015 unlike furloughed federal employees who have received assurances that they will be paid once the shutdown ends contractors are not owed back pay that has left them in an even murkier economic position most americans cannot afford to miss a paycheck said joseph stiglitz an economics professor at columbia university whose work relating to inequality earned him the nobel memorial prize in economics while everyone tends to have a house car health insurance and car payment to make the person they owe money to aren t inclined to be particularly forgiving or account for a government shutdown stiglitz said it s an inequality issue in that it affects people at the bottom stiglitz said and it hits them really strongly because in america so many have experienced such high levels of inequality that a large fraction of americans have no substantial cash reserves they depend on that paycheck coming in every month sen lisa murkowski r alaska said she knows the shutdown is having a significant impact on her state telling nbc news that she has spoken to a number of constituents since the shutdown took effect hundreds of federal workers and contractors rally against the partial federal government shutdown thursday outside the headquarters of the afl cio in washington chip somodevilla getty images her state is feeling the economic pain from the ongoing political fight more than most alaska has the most federal workers affected per capita than any other state and nearly half the federal workers there work for agencies without appropriations they re the ones who are trying to knit this all together that are trying to figure out ok we ve got earthquake damage that we re dealing with and it s costing us more than we thought it was going to murkowski said it s cold it s four below in fairbanks where i went to high school this morning you don t think that jacks up people s home heating like sky high that could be a reason for economic concern beyond just the individual household particularly in small communities where businesses are dependent on those individuals spending their paychecks when individuals are living as close to the edge as such a large fraction of americans are living these are the kinds of events that can precipitate a downward spiral stiglitz said the shutdown isn t affecting only labor either and as the shutdown continues further without a clear potential conclusion after the president threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years experts say the economic ripple effects could heavily impact the entire nation jason furman professor of the practice of economic policy at harvard kennedy school and the most recent chairman of the council of economic advisers under president obama said the nation is entering increasingly uncharted territory the impact really depends heavily on how the highly ambiguous rules are interpreted and implemented by the administration for example the decisions around snap and refund checks matter a lot furman said in an email overall however we know that the costs of the shutdown grow non linearly with time as agencies run out of ways to get around it so expect them to grow it s the uncertainty that leaves a lot of experts worried about the economic impact that a prolonged shutdown could have especially during a period of global market uncertainty currently the country faces a trade war stock market uncertainty an economic slowdown in china and an economic slowdown in europe two key trading partners no time is a good time but this is a particularly bad time because the nature of uncertainty is that it compounds exponentially stiglitz said we re talking about 5 7 billion for a wall the economist added but the costs that are inflicted on the economy are orders of magnitude beyond that 5 7 billion
the construction engineering company disappointed on two fronts what happened shares of fluor flr 0 05 declined 37 7 in 2018 according to data from s p global market intelligence it was a disappointing year for the company and it comes after fluor entered last year with high hopes of a significant upturn in its revenue and earnings fluor s exposure to heavy industries such as chemicals energy mining power and industrial infrastructure make it a cyclical play on the long anticipated recovery in capital spending from the oil and gas and mining industries as such the stock entered 2018 with high hopes and the ongoing recovery in energy and mining metals prices continued in the first half of the year indeed the company saw a good recovery in new award wins and its backlog started to grow again sequentially for the first time since 2016 so what went wrong fluor s two big problems in 2018 first fluor s stock suffered from the company s poor execution which caused management to slash its full year 2018 guidance from 3 10 4 50 at the start of the year to 1 80 1 90 by the third quarter the problems relate to charges on a downstream project in europe and a gas fired power plant in florida second the significant declines in energy and mining commodity prices in the second half of the year largely down to fears over the growth prospects for china has led investors to doubt that the upcycle in fluor s end demand can continue moreover companies such as cummins cmi 0 41 a manufacturer of engines used in oil and gas and mining equipment have already lowered expectations for its shipments to those industries in 2018 meanwhile caterpillar s cat 1 11 management has been talking of slower but longer growth in mining capital spending is it a temporary slowing or the beginning of a protracted period of weakness now what the opportunity with fluor s stock lies in the possibility that momentum in its end markets will continue and the company s execution will improve in 2019 if so there s considerable upside potential in the stock on the other hand there s no guarantee that commodity prices will improve and fluor s execution issues mean it can t be regarded as a failsafe way to play the commodity investing theme

if you recently left an employer you may have to decide whether or how your 401 k should come along with you a 401 k rollover can help you consolidate your retirement savings into fewer accounts open up additional investment options and even save you money in certain circumstances you ll usually face the decision of what to do with your 401 k when you leave a job but you might even have an old 401 k that you ve forgotten about hanging around from a previous employer it s never too late to examine your holdings and decide whether to roll your assets into your current employer s 401 k or an ira or choose another option instead a 401 k rollover is when you transfer the account balance in your old 401 k to a new or existing 401 k or individual retirement account ira how to roll over your 401 k rolling over your 401 k typically involves just a few basic steps however there are a lot of different ways to approach the process so it s best to first clearly understand your priorities and any special circumstances and considerations that might apply to you 1 decide where you want your money to go you have a few destination options to choose from when you roll over a 401 k use a rollover ira the most commonly used is a rollover ira this is simply a traditional ira except it houses funds rolled over from another retirement account like a 401 k investors typically roll over funds into like accounts a traditional 401 k into a traditional ira and a roth 401 k into a roth ira you may also roll over funds from a traditional account into a roth account but you ll owe taxes at your current income tax rate on the amount converted if you expect a year of low income perhaps from an extended gap between jobs then this conversion may be advantageous transfer to a new 401 k the other option is to roll over funds from an old 401 k into your new employer s 401 k plan this keeps all of your retirement investments consolidated so that they re easier to manage for high income earners another reason to transfer to a new 401 k may be to keep the backdoor roth ira option available by sidestepping legally the ira aggregation rule as long as the fees are reasonable for the current 401 k plan this isn t a bad option 2 open a new account or use an existing one you may need to open a new 401 k or establish an ira before initiating a rollover after all you need an account to roll your funds into if you already have a 401 k or ira account that you want to use then you don t need to open a new account however if you prefer to keep your rollover funds separate from an existing account then opening a new account is still an option opening an ira is a simple and straightforward process with most online brokers it can be done entirely online with just a few forms and clicks 3 contact your old 401 k plan administrator to begin the rollover process to transfer funds from your old 401 k you ll need to get in touch with your former employer s plan administrator and indicate that you want to roll over your account there are two ways for administrators to transfer your funds to your rollover destination direct and indirect rollover direct rollover a direct rollover is the easiest way to roll over your 401 k if this is available to you it s the best option to avoid any pitfalls that could result in taxes and penalties with a direct rollover you provide the administrator of the prior 401 k plan with the information for the receiving account for your funds and they usually transfer the funds to the new 401 k account directly sometimes you might receive a check made out to your new ira or 401 k plan and it s your responsibility to forward the check to the appropriate party if you have any questions about where to send the check you can contact your new 401 k plan administrator or your ira brokerage for clarification indirect rollover the other option is an indirect rollover instead of transferring funds directly from your old 401 k to your rollover destination the plan administrator sends the funds to you you are then responsible for depositing the funds in the amount of your old 401 k into your rollover account the major downside with indirect rollovers is that 401 k plan administrators are required to withhold 20 of the taxable funds for the irs you ll get the amount back on your tax return if you complete the rollover but in the meantime you are short by 20 for your new 401 k

restaurants are a mixed bag right now shares of better burger chain shake shack shak 0 56 made a round trip ending almost nowhere in 2018 after putting up a 60 mid year rally shares reversed course and ended the year with a 5 gain however that paltry return still handily beat the overall market s loss of 6 as measured by the s p 500 index in spite of the burger joint s outperformance over the last year as it expanded across the country and overseas investors should exercise caution before jumping on the bandwagon more sales lower averages through the first three quarters of 2018 shake shack put up 335 million in revenue good for a 28 year over year increase though the bottom line is of secondary importance to the still small and mostly regional chain most locations are in the northeast u s it s worth noting that earnings per share increased 22 over the same time period to 0 56 however most of that sales and profit growth is due to the company s aggressive expansion as many as 34 new shacks were opened domestically in 2018 with an additional net 14 to 16 franchised most of which are located internationally that s a better than 30 increase over 2017 and management sees another 36 to 40 domestic locations and 16 to 18 franchised ones opening during the new year that rapid pace of openings and diners warm reception of the brand is impressive but sales at existing stores have been relatively flat going on two years now same shack sales a combination of foot traffic per location and average guest ticket size is expected to be 0 to 1 higher than in 2017 according to research group tdn2k overall restaurant industry comparable sales have been in the same range all year paired with on average lower foot traffic that implies shake shack and its peers are hiding declining guest counts with higher menu pricing metric q1 2018 q2 2018 q3 2018 october 2018 november 2018 industry comparable store sales 0 1 0 9 1 2 0 8 1 1 industry foot traffic 2 7 2 1 30 2 2 1 8 shake shack shak 0 56 same shack sales 1 7 1 1 0 7 n a n a long term sustainability shake shack and other better burger chains are part of the problem america is eating out more than ever before and in an attempt to scoop up market share new locations are popping up faster than the dining out trend can keep up hamburger joints are among some of the most aggressive when it comes to expansion at the end of the day over expansion and resulting declines in traffic mean lower profits per average location shack level profit margins are down to 26 4 on the year compared with 27 2 a year ago through the first nine months of 2018 shake shack s adjusted ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization profit margin was 17 7 down from 18 9 during 2017 thus even though shake shack is growing in size and its existing stores are maturing its profit margins are getting smaller if all was going well the opposite should be occurring that makes this burger chain s stock a bet on whether it can grow its total number of locations faster than its competition at least until it can find a way to break out of the restaurant industry average given that shake shack has few tailwinds other than consumers spending lots of money eating out there are other restaurant stocks out there worth owning instead check out the latest shake shack earnings call transcript
the high yielding renewable energy company has a few things it must accomplish to win back investors this year check out the latest pattern energy earnings call transcript last year was a tough one for most stocks as the market sold off over worries about a slowing global economy however it was an even rougher one for pattern energy pegi whose stock tumbled 13 4 more than double the loss of the s p 500 that s because some cracks started forming in the high yielding renewable energy company s foundation which caused investors to become concerned about its ability to grow that leaves pattern energy with a few things on its to do list for 2019 here are three it needs to accomplish to ease investors concerns and win back their support no 1 continue shoring up the balance sheet pattern energy has grown at a fast pace over the past few years by issuing new debt and equity to fund acquisitions however all that borrowing has pushed the company s leverage ratio to a concerning level which forced the company to take action in recent months to improve its financial profile the company did that by selling a couple of non core assets which not only bolstered its balance sheet but also gave it the cash to reinvest in some higher returning opportunities while pattern made solid progress on its asset recycling plan last year it needs to make even more in 2019 ideally the company should continue selling select assets until it has reduced its leverage ratio below its target of less than 3 times corporate debt to earnings that would enhance its financial flexibility so that it can pursue new growth opportunities that could emerge in the future no 2 improve dividend coverage pattern energy had been an excellent dividend growth stock considering it increased its payout in each of its first 15 quarters as a public company however the company pressed pause on dividend growth last year because its payout ratio was around 100 of its cash flow which left it with no room for error the company s aim is to get its payout ratio down to a more comfortable level of 80 of its cash flow it can do that by continuing the progress of its capital recycling plan for example the company sold its k2 wind power facility in canada for 166 million valuing it at 15 times cash flow and used 23 million of that money to invest in stillwater wind in montana buying in at about 10 times cash flow if the company can continue to sell assets for a much higher value than it buys them then it could quickly reduce leverage as well as its dividend payout level no 3 formalize a sustainable long term growth strategy pattern energy noted that with access to capital it has a large enough pipeline of acquisition opportunities to grow cash flow per share at more than an 8 annual pace with upside into the double digits depending on how much outside financing it can obtain however with its share price slumping 13 last year it s becoming too expensive to issue equity to fund growth meanwhile with its elevated debt level it can t use more debt to finance growth either as a result the company needs to target a more sustainable expansion plan that doesn t require outside capital with the company aiming to improve its dividend coverage ratio to 80 it will have more retained cash to fund expansion add that capital to an improving balance sheet and pattern energy should eventually be in the position if self funding growth what it needs to do is provide investors with a better idea of how much it can expand both cash flow and its dividend without having to rely on outside funding once it achieves its targeted leverage and payout ratio by doing so it would give investors more confidence in its ability to deliver sustainable growth even if capital market conditions deteriorate which was the case last year lots to watch in the new year as attractive as pattern energy s 8 4 yielding dividend might be after last year s sell off there are still questions about its long term sustainability because of the company s high payout ratio and elevated debt levels however if the company can address those concerns by completing its to do list it would become a much more attractive stock for income seeking investors in the meantime investors should put it on their watch list so that they can keep an eye on its progress
traditional masculinity is toxic and encouraging boys not to cry is dangerous to their health according to the world s leading psychology group in its first official guidelines on the treatment of men and boys the influential american psychological association says many male traits including stoicism competitiveness dominance and aggression are harmful and can lead to violence depression and suicide it argues that this traditional masculinity ideology pushes boys toward anti femininity and forces them to mask the appearance of weakness while encouraging risk taking aggression and violence as a means of solving problems traditional masculinity is toxic and encouraging boys not to cry is dangerous to their health according to the world s leading psychology group stock image as a result it limits men s psychological development constrains their behaviour causes gender role strain and has a negative impact on their mental and physical health but critics have accused the report of taking an anti male stance which depicts traditional male values as nearly monstrous the report paints a picture of generations of boys under constant pressure by society to conform to masculine expressions who are censured by their parents and peers if they fail to maintain the expected behaviour its authors say transgender issues are at the forefront of the cultural conversations with evidence suggesting a link between adherence to rigid masculinity in gay bisexual and transgender men and higher rates of self destructive behaviour such as drug taking the apa is regarded as a leading authority on psychological matters its manual of mental disorders is taken as the bible of mental illness and consulted by british psychologists and health experts while the controversial guidance was years in the making its publication in the wake of the metoo movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault feeds a prevailing narrative about the dangers of traditional masculinity critics last night accused the authors of anti male rhetoric stock image critics last night accused the authors of anti male rhetoric frank furedi emeritus professor of sociology at kent university said suddenly the reluctance of some men to cry on demand is recast as pathology this is not a scientifically informed document it is an ideologically driven attempt to devalue male identity professor chris ferguson a fellow of the apa complained that the guidance read like an activist s agenda saying in sweeping terms traditional men are portrayed as nearly monstrous their cultural values associated with everything from sexism to promiscuity to their own declining health but psychologist ryon mcdermott who helped draft the report said the profession needed to help men break free of masculinity rules that don t help them and focus on potentially positive aspects of masculinity such as courage and leadership and dr glenn wilson a british psychologist and author of the great sex divide said male female differences are not socially constructed they have early evolutionary origins male and female typical traits have both advantages and disadvantages for example psychopathy increases the likelihood of crime but is useful in battle
a caption in this story has been corrected to reflect the correction location of namaqua park mariano medina and his family were the big thompson valley s first permanent settlers medina was also the area s first businessman and established a small settlement west of loveland later named namaqua born in taos new mexico medina was a small man of mexican descent with jet black hair which never turned gray as he aged he had piercing coal black eyes and a swarthy face his feet were small and his hands showed the effects of an outdoor life he wore rich colorful clothing and with the side seams of his trousers slashed to mid calf with an insert of red cloth medina claimed to be well educated by spanish priests and could speak 13 different languages spanish was his native tongue but he knew a little english he may also have known some french because of his close association with the area s french trappers medina could converse in some of the indian dialects learned during his fur trading days after a colorful career including acting as a guide for one of fremont s expeditions he met louis elbert papin in 1844 papin like medina was a fur trapper papin had a flathead indian wife named tacaney and at the time they met tacaney was pregnant with papin s child papin wanted to return to civilization but his wife demanded that she remain close to her people medina who had spent a solitary life as a trapper and scout reasoned that it was time for him to settle down for some horses and a blanket medina purchased papin s wife when the baby was born tacaney named the child louis papin tacaney apparently spoke only her flathead dialect the settlers called her mary and medina called her john she was a large woman but very little else is known about tacaney except that she was highly skilled in beadwork george andrew jackson one of the early colorado prospectors met antoine and nicholas janis and jose de mirabal in fort laramie during the summer of 1858 these men traveled south and stopped at the big thompson river they built a few cabins and apparently spent the winter trapping medina joined these men but unlike the others he began to work on establishing a permanent settlement after the area was surveyed medina filed a homestead claim in 1860 the rocky mountain news took note of the new town called miraville at the crossing of the big thompson river as the french trappers moved on the place became known as big thompson then the name was changed to mariano s crossing medina recruited several mexican families from his hometown of taos to help him work the land and build up the population of the small village to provide some income mariano constructed a sturdy toll bridge over the river to keep the bridge well above water level even during flood stage medina built substantial cribbing on either side the bridge sat on pilings driven into the river bottom a locked gate stood at each end medina cleverly positioned the bridge such that it was difficult to get around without a lengthy detour he charged 1 to cross the bridge and the toll was probably higher when the river was at flood stage in 1861 the ute indians drove off 60 of medina s best horses he and his men followed the trail left by the utes for 25 miles mariano shot one of the utes using his 50 caliber hawken rifle the remaining indians fled and the stock was returned the indian raid prompted medina to construct a small 15 foot by 25 foot stone fort on the north side of the big thompson river to allow defenders to shoot in any direction the fort included six gun ports the walls were 18 to 20 inches thick and the roof was flat and built of sturdy hand hewn logs on top of the roof was sandstone slabs covered with a foot of earth the fort was later converted into an icehouse mariano s crossing also had other buildings on the south side of the river including medina s home his home was an 18 foot by 20 foot log structure with two doors and three windows the other cabins including medina s combination store saloon were arranged around a plaza travelers stayed in a long low building that included a dining and cooking area as well as several rooms in the adobe store saloon tacaney sold her handmade garments including buckskin pants and moccasins this was the only store of any kind between laporte and denver and medina must have enjoyed good trade medina purchased cattle from immigrants passing through the area he would fatten the cattle and sell them later or exchange them for other animals in 1862 ben holladay moved his overland stage route from central wyoming south into colorado to take advantage of the growing denver market indian raids also prompted the move and to protect the new route camp collins was established in laporte the route north from denver followed what was generally known as the cherokee trail which ran along the foothills through laporte the route crossed the big thompson river at mariano s crossing a stage station was established at mariano s crossing with james boutwell and his wife sarah as managers not only did they receive a paycheck they also were given the right to homestead 160 acres the boutwells and the medinas got along quite well sarah saved the life of tacaney s newborn baby rosita by wet nursing her in 1862 in 1866 holladay sold his stage line to wells fargo a large livery barn was built by wells fargo on the north side of the big thompson and the place was now called big thompson station it retained this name until 1868 when a post office was established the first postmaster hiram tadder changed the name of mariano s small settlement to namaqua and this name stuck until the settlement was abandoned in 1877 the colorado central railroad was constructed east of namaqua through the new town of loveland with rail service loveland dominated the area and grew to become the economic center of the big thompson valley mariano medina passed away at namaqua a year later at the age 66 and was buried in a cemetery located to the south of the settlement near the present day namaqua school in order to allow development of the land some of the bodies of the medina family were moved to namaqua park and placed under a concrete slab with a long low headstone as for the town of namaqua it withered away and its abandoned buildings sat empty as it crumbled into history unfortunately the landowner razed the buildings and much of the lumber was either burned or destroyed some of the hand hewn logs possibly from medina s home had been integrated into a small picnic shelter by the city of loveland when their possible historic importance was discovered they were saved and used to construct a replica of medina s cabin inside the loveland museum present day namaqua park with its stately cottonwood trees is located east of the actual town site kenneth jessen has lived in loveland since 1965 and has contributed to area newspapers for more than four decades he has written more than 2 000 illustrated articles published along with 20 books jessen is in his third year teaching adult education at colorado state university osher program and has lectured in northern colorado
you have to love the 20th century that was it advertisement for hours i d been struggling to articulate what exactly it was that was so endearing about charlotte north carolina sure it was green it was livable it was determined to be seen as progressive and it has great food but it wasn t the typical east coast experience and certainly not the typical southern city it has no centuries old storefronts no crumbling mansions shedding light on a bygone era heck it lacks almost any historic neighborhoods at all newsletters beast travel digest get the entire world in your inbox subscribe by clicking subscribe you agree to have read the terms of use and privacy policy instead as local historian tom hanchett so ably distilled into that one sentence charlotte is a city that has been racing to turn its 20th century successes into something that lasts which as somebody who finds urbanism endlessly fascinating i found totally charming i was in charlotte for the most unglamorous of reasons it s on the way i love road trips and one of my favorite directions from my home base of washington d c is going down south richmond charleston savannah st augustine miami atlanta asheville etc but the part i never looked forward to don t shoot me was central north carolina not i 95 not i 85 none of it unless you need to stock up on fireworks or stuckey s pecan logs that was just territory to get through as fast as possible advertisement but in the back of every travel writer s mind is the haunting fear that hey maybe i m missing something so as i was planning a road trip to and from miami for the holidays i took the charlotte regional visitors authority up on its offer to show me what the city has to offer and i am glad i did my visit to the queen city left me sufficiently enchanted to make charlotte the second selection for our new series on underrated destinations it s still a big world advertisement the appeal of charlotte outside of summertime when the city s proximity to a plethora of outdoors activities ups its allure comes down mainly to three areas urbanism history and food on my first night we stayed at the ivey s hotel cleverly situated inside an apartment building done up in what i would call a southern luxury aesthetic right in the center of the city it was located near one of charlotte nc tours offices and therefore convenient since our first day began with a whirlwind bike tour around the city to get a sense of what this rapidly growing metropolis has going on advertisement as the cityscape is relatively flat a bike is probably the best way to navigate it zooming around with tour guide mikal massey and his indefatigable boss dianna ward what becomes rapidly clear is that charlotte is at the center of the debates raging about the future of american cities bike paths crisscross the city and development is springing up along its above ground metro rail like that of most cities facing rapid growth and gentrification some of it is more memorable than others it has new urban parks playing off of its skyline my favorite vantage point for taking in the cityscape was romare bearden park which also has a magnificent sculpture by richard hunt another highlight for those looking for their historic home fix is in the older fourth ward where over the years a number of venerable homes have been moved to preserve them creating along the way a new urbanist oasis in the center of the city as we biked here and there person after person of different races genders sexual orientations and ages stopped us to chat with dianna ward and while it was definitely by happenstance it seemed the city writ large was conspiring to drill home the idea that charlotte is a place focused on welcoming all with the exception of the historic fourth ward a few old neighborhoods like upper middle class myers park and various former textile mills being repurposed for multi use projects most of the city s architecture dates from the latter half of the 20th century especially after the banking boom of bank of america and wachovia advertisement nobody wants to save 30 year old buildings explains hanchett when i ask why there aren t significant numbers of historic buildings like you d expect to see across the south in 1900 charlotte had roughly 20 000 people by 1940 100 000 today the city s core has roughly 860 000 and 2 5 million in the urban region and with that kind of rapid growth came destruction and construction and because existing buildings weren t exactly old there wasn t a push to preserve them i m sitting with hanchett anyone serious about exploring historical charlotte should check out his website at haberdish located just a couple blocks from one of the new metro stations the restaurant which focuses on regional fare including livermush is one of a number of restaurants around the city that have made it a more appealing destination two more i d recommend are good food on montford a super popular restaurant located along a strip famous for food and night time fun and haymaker a chic spot just off romare bearden park describing the culinary revolution underway in the city dianna ward says emphatically if you re just average you re on the way out advertisement of course the big question that has long faced charlotte is can it become more than just a city to which people have to move for work can it be a city where people want to live or even just visit it s an irony because for much of western history culture has followed or at least swum alongside money florence the netherlands new york etc charlotte has been a center of the financial world for decades and it s made a concerted effort to have a robust cultural footprint yet despite a growing number of museums such as nascar bechtler the mint museum the billy graham library being seen as a center of culture has often eluded it one museum alone however makes a stop in charlotte worthwhile the levine museum of the new south located in the city core the museum takes visitors on an in depth unflinching walk through the region from the end of the civil war to the present day along the way it tackles everything from the hope of reconstruction to the rise of jim crow and segregation the region s industrial explosion as a textile manufacturing center and the dire poverty of many of its citizens working in its agricultural sector it examines how charlotte s business first attitude softened the drama of desegregation essentially business leaders didn t want the chaos in other southern cities so they made sure charlotte integrated albeit on a surface level which has echoes of its role in lgbt issues today in the state as somebody originally from new england with only a superficial knowledge of the american piedmont and its development post world war ii i have to say that this was one of the best museums i ve visited in years one of the central figures in the city s business history that the museum talks about is the tobacco tycoon james buchanan duke best known to people from my hometown of newport rhode island as the father of doris duke duke was one of the turn of the century s more successful businessmen at one point controlling roughly 90 percent of the u s cigarette market and also creating what became duke energy while his daughter s properties of rough point and shangri la have become iconic charlotte has a little duke gem of its own the h shaped james buchanan duke house a beautiful colonial revival mansion built for the tycoon in the tony old myers park neighborhood today it s a historic hotel my final night in charlotte was spent there and it was an absolute delight as its leafy confines ensure you forget you re just minutes from the center of a bustling city advertisement it was the perfect hospitable end to my stay because now i know i need not fear a central north carolina stop on my southern road trip route update the article mistakenly referred to a sculpture in romare bearden park as being by bearden it was by richard hunt
man oh man is cnn touchy about the allegation that the cable network lost interest in reporting on the border situation by a reporter at kusi in san francisco after they found out the reporting didn t fit their narrative cnn s pr arm shot back with a statement that cnn called several stations looking for a reporter and ending up booking nobody advertisement here s how things stand now at first kusinews accused cnn of rejecting an appearance by one of its reporters for political reasons but now the news director is conceding he didn t really know why the network turned him down the ap s dbauder reports brian stelter brianstelter january 11 2019 kusi stands by our original story kusi news kusinews january 12 2019 you d think this would have blown over by now but even president trump

could it be that climate change is a universal menace a recent article in forbes addresses the idea that the galaxy might be strewn with extinct alien civilizations burned to a crisp by ferocious planetary warming the idea is certainly intriguing and has obvious relevance as a cautionary tale for us but could it be true the article doesn t say these hypothetical societies died out thanks to an alien fondness for suvs instead the aliens are hypothesized to be the victims of a natural process the aging of their home star coupled with the bad luck of having no planet similar to venus in their solar system this may sound puzzling but the reasoning is straightforward it s an established fact that stars get hotter as they age unlike humans the sun for example shines by fusing hydrogen into helium in its hellish core six hundred tons of hydrogen are fused per second but this process reduces the number of particles in the sun s deep interior that reduces the gas pressure causing sol to collapse a bit under its own weight the collapse raises the pressure and the particles respond by moving faster which is to say they get hotter so with time the sun heats up and gets brighter this isn t something you re likely to notice day to day the sun s brightness increases by about 0 00000000003 percent obviously there s no hurry to buy a new pair of ray bans but over the long haul this slow brightening and accompanying increased energy output will wreak havoc on earth s biosphere the unlovely details were worked out by penn state planetary scientist james kasting who determined years ago that the sun s warming will eventually evaporate our oceans dumping enormous quantities of water vapor into the atmosphere water vapor is a highly potent greenhouse gas which causes yet more heating earth will be toast without the bread part this unpleasant turn of events isn t up for debate we know it will happen although there s some uncertainty about exactly when you ll have to kiss the oceans goodbye not to mention all your plant and animal friends maybe in a billion years or so according to the article this inexorable heating something that eventually happens in every solar system might catch alien societies by surprise if they don t have a cousin of venus to study venus is an example of what happens to a planet when its host star is too nearby or too hot the second rock from the sun was once a kinder gentler wetter world you see but because it s closer to the sun than earth is its oceans dried out long ago and today the temperature on venus is a sweaty 900 degrees f it s a palpable example right there in the sky of what wanton global warming can do venus is closer to the sun than earth is and temperatures on the planet reach up to 900 degrees fahrenheit nasa jpl you might liken it to the stocks used to punish petty criminals in the 18th century they served as a public warning to encourage responsible behavior a venus look alike in a solar system might serve a similar function clueing in aliens about a fate that might befall their own planet if not then perhaps there could be a lot of broiled and braised extraterrestrial societies out there bummer yes but i doubt it s a major concern for any alien intelligence as noted the time scale for the sun s brightening is on the order of a billion years and for most stars even longer and that suggests that this particular problem may not be high on any aliens list of worries stephen kane the university of california astronomer upon whose work the forbes article is based says we can expect some serious temperature oscillations much sooner slight changes in planetary orbits with time will have a much larger effect on shorter timescales than the gradually growing brightness of the star he says if a civilization can adjust to these orbital changes then it should have no problem adjusting to the long timescale changes of the star and could even potentially move to another planet and terraform it and if there isn t any nearby planet to fill the bill it s pretty straightforward to construct a bunch of artificial habitats in cooler more distant orbits undoubtedly there are many ways that alien societies might tank but this one seems improbable if our cosmic confreres are advanced enough to be our intellectual peers or better they re clever enough to see the dangers of a star growing old and do something about it want more stories about space aliens follow nbc news mach on twitter facebook and instagram
2008 was to say the least not a great year for the global economy with that it should come as no surprise that it was also not a great year for the toronto stock exchange tsx canada s largest marketplace for publicly traded companies in fact it was the worst year for initial public offerings ipos in the history of the pricewaterhousecoopers pwc annual survey of canadian equity with only ten ipos none of which came about in the final six months of the year the total value of the stocks issued on the tsx plunged 80 percent from 3 0 billion in 2007 to a mere 547 million at the year s end there were 1 232 company stocks listed on the tsx fast forward a decade and canadian markets are nearing the end of 2018 which is predicted to be a blockbuster year by experts at pwc yet as of last month s tsx report there are only 811 company stocks publicly traded on canada s principal exchange a 34 percent drop from 2008 it was the worst year for initial public offerings ipos in the history of the pricewaterhousecoopers pwc annual survey of canadian equity since its nadir in 2009 the canadian economy has enjoyed a healthy recovery national gdp has climbed by 36 percent the unemployment rate has plummeted from a post millennium high of 8 3 percent to a four decade decade low of 5 8 percent and canada has emerged as a thriving startup ecosystem ranking third on startupblink s annual report in 2017 what is shocking is that despite this upward economic trajectory the number of publicly traded companies continues to decline although this phenomenon lacks a single root cause it is being driven by two principal factors disillusionment with the hassle of public markets coupled with a surge in the availability of private investment despite this upward economic trajectory the number of publicly traded companies continues to decline the economist describes the process of going public as an immediate nightmare which is a cross between an election campaign a show trial and an ironman event during this time founders must determine a strategy prepare the requisite legal documents and assemble a board of directors in a mere couple of months once the nightmare is over and the flotation process is complete further hardships lie ahead one of the biggest surprises is the founder s complete and unconditional accountability to thousands of newly minted shareholders who as told by forbes will nasty emails and think you aren t worth your paycheck shareholders care about nothing but the short term stock price the pressure to maximize the share price at the end of each quarter puts immense stress on founders to maximize the company s value in the immediate term in an interview with maclean s magazine ari pandes an associate professor at the university of calgary explains the stark difference between guiding a public vs a private company all of these people are on you if you don t produce a result within a quarter whereas before you might have had people who were more long term oriented this short term chase really makes it more onerous on management teams pandes refers to this as a fatigue with public markets where many executive teams would prefer the flexibility and comfort that comes with managing a private company no level of fatigue is capable of slowing down public investment without a viable alternative conveniently at least for ipo averse management teams access to private financing in the form of both private equity and venture capital has exploded over the past decade according to the canadian venture capital and private equity association cvca in 2009 canadian private equity deals totaled just over 5 billion less than an eighth of the 42 2 billion of private equity activity completed in a frenzied 2014 while 2014 seems like a banner year for canadian private equity highlighted by the 12 5 billion tim hortons mega merger with burger king the market looks to have settled at a relatively high watermark with 26 3 billion of deals in 2017 and 14 5 billion in the first half of this year venture capital has experienced a similar rise increasing from 993 million in 2009 to 3 5 billion last year 2018 is poised to be a record year with 1 9 billion in venture capital funding raised in the first half alone conveniently at least for ipo averse management teams access to private financing in the form of both private equity and venture capital has exploded over the past decade while stocks have been vanishing from the tsx exchange traded funds etfs have sprouted in their place an etf is a diversified bundle of stocks bonds and other assets similar to a mutual fund traded on an exchange like a corporate stock compared to mutual funds etfs are characterized by lower fees and superior liquidity in canada etfs are issued by a wide range of firms including the bank of montreal blackrock the world s largest asset manager and first asset a subsidiary of canadian investment giant ci financial etfs have experienced staggering growth over the past decade in 2008 there were under 100 listed on the tsx by the end of september 2018 there were 600 despite their rapid growth etfs only constitute 160 billion of the toronto stock exchange s 2 29 trillion market cap good for just under seven percent while etfs improve market liquidity and provide some opportunity to shareholders their broader economic impact cannot compare to that of a public company and as more and more companies remain private relying on funding from private equity and venture capital their earnings are reaped by only the wealthiest financiers excluding average investors from some of the most lucrative offerings specifically with 421 fewer publicly traded companies than there were in 2008 canadian investors have far less selection than they did a decade ago further the decline in selection has affected the asset mix of the canadian pension plan canadian equities constituted 25 percent of the fund in 2008 compared to a mere 3 3 percent in 2017 while etfs improve market liquidity and provide some opportunity to shareholders their broader economic impact cannot compare to that of a public company the decline of canadian ipos has led to another troubling economic trend the consolidation of canada s largest companies some headline grabbing deals include the 28 billion acquisition of spectra energy by enbridge canada s fourth largest company and metro s creation of a 16 billion retail empire following the 4 5 billion acquisition of jean coutu since 2015 the average market capitalization of companies in the s p tsx 60 an index of 60 large public canadian corporations has increased 14 percent compared to only 10 percent growth in the national economy the rise of corporate consolidation has contributed to the oligopolization of canadian industries such as financial services telecommunications and retail maybe most frighteningly the consolidation of large corporations creates a positive feedback loop as companies grow through acquisitions they have greater access to capital which provides funding for even more acquisitions in the future the decline of canadian ipos has led to another troubling economic trend the consolidation of canada s largest companies the dwindling numbers of publicly traded companies is not a uniquely canadian predicament a similar phenomenon has occurred south of the border where the number of publicly traded companies in the united states in 2017 was 3600 less than half of the number two decades prior in the states opinions differ wildly on the threat of corporate consolidation and the disappearing ipo in his article titled private inequity frank partnoy of the atlantic argues that the decline of ipos is harming smaller investors citing speeches from sec chair jay clayton and an interview with jay ritter of university of florida a leader scholar on ipos as evidence that the changing corporate landscape is a threat to average americans the bloomberg opinion editorial board counters partnoy s position referencing a recent study conducted at the university of virginia that concluded public index funds yield similar returns to more exclusive private investment opportunities the editorial board continues adjusted for risk private equity investments of recent vintage have actually lagged public markets none of this is to say the ipo is completely dead this past summer pwc s national survey dubbed the first half of 2018 slow and steady with a total of nine tsx issues over the year s first six months nonetheless the severely stunted ipo climate reflects underlying shifts in social attitudes and paradigms akin to individuals seeking refuge from the incessant pressures of social media businesses favour the comfort and control of staying private shielding themselves from the scrutiny of the public sphere

letter to the editor letter to the editor thank you for your article on conservancy hornby island s concerns for herring around hornby and denman islands organization calls for halt to herring roe fishery jan 6 2019 i d like to make the following comments on mr davis s response to our concerns 1 the science that dfo does each year is extremely limited as it only looks at the biomass of spawn although the herring management plan is called integrated it does not at all consider the needs of all the species in the strait of georgia marine web that rely on herring how much herring do the chinook salmon whales migratory seabirds seals and sea lions need to sustain themselves the management plan is sprinkled with terms like ecosystem precautionary principles risk aversion and sustainability how are we to believe dfo when the application of their integrated planning has resulted in the closure of four of the six major spawning areas on the coast and prince rupert had such a low volume of fish last year that the boats didn t even go out 2 there is a lot of evidence that the strait of georgia stock is nowhere near historic high levels as stated by mr davis first nations elders and old time fishermen have stated that the historic high was probably twice what it is now there used to be major spawns in burrard and saanich inlets and all around the southern gulf islands those are all gone so to say based on the scientific measure of stocks from nanaimo to comox that the whole of the sog is at historic high levels is just not believable 3 mr davis mentions the unknown of changes in ocean conditions applying the precautionary principle would therefore mean that we should slow down the harvest until we better understand what effect climate change may have on herring populations 4 mr davis says market prices are not dfo s concern there is a principle in resource management called highest and best use which means that managers especially of a public resource like wild fish should not allow their exploitation unless we are using them for their highest value to the public it is why section 31 of the fisheries act states that it is illegal to catch wild fish stocks for low value products such as fertilizer and reduction for fish farm food 5 it is further interesting that mr davis stated in your online article on jan 6 that dfo was planning to approve the pacific herring roe fishery with a maximum harvest rate of 20 per cent when they were supposedly seeking public input to the plan until jan 9 it seems dfo had already made the decision why bother with a draft seeking public input if they have already made the decision we appreciate mr davis saying that hearing from groups like conservancy hornby island is useful we only hope they act on it grant scott for conservancy hornby island

where these tasks are concerned the world bank has been sidelined by other institutions such as the china led asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and by the sharper focus of regional lenders such as the asian development bank adb and the african development bank the bank a bloated bureaucracy of more than 10 000 employees and 120 worldwide offices has lost its way by getting involved in socio economic tasks that have little relevance to its original remit of tackling infrastructure and other reconstruction tasks the sudden and largely unexplained resignation of jim yong kim as president of the world bank has provoked the usual speculations as to who would succeed him but the real issue now is how relevant the sprawling washington based institution is to today s economic development needs the world bank is supposed to be a global leader on infrastructure but also saw part of its role taken over by the g20 global infrastructure hub in sydney and by powerful infrastructure initiatives promoted by china japan the us and australia world bank s president jim yong kim during his opening press conference in kiev ukraine 14 november 2017 kristalina georgieva the chief executive officer of the bank would step in as interim president on 1 february 2019 photo epa efe given the way the bank has wished itself into the wilderness the question is not who the next leader is but whether anyone wants the job at all given its diminished status big names canvassed in the past such as former us treasury secretary larry summers will hardly be in the running there is speculation that developing nations among the world bank s 189 members may push to get their candidates into the office the names of indonesian finance minister sri mulyani former colombian finance minister jose antonio ocampo and nigerian former finance minister ngozi okonjo iweala have also been mentioned but if trump gets his way it is unlikely that any of them will be chosen the job has gone by tradition rather than by right to an american and kim is no exception south korean by birth he subsequently became a us citizen his sudden departure effective the end of january to become vice chairman and partner in new york fund management group global infrastructure partners brought token regrets and faint praise from us president donald trump without any hint as to who the successor will be easing out kim a 2012 appointee of barack obama s administration adds to the list of reversals of obama policies that trump had been pursuing since taking over the white house yet with due respect to kim s achievements his departure may not be a bad thing if the world bank is to regain relevance it needs a radical new direction and a strong leader to show the way a new leader man or woman offers an opportunity for the kind of imaginative thinking that trump for all his faults showed when he reached out to north korea s leader kim jong un trump might bring the world bank s focus back to infrastructure an area close to his heart and where trillions of dollars are needed not least in asia if so he might consider jin liqun the president and chairman of the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib promoting someone like jin as a candidate would delight china and might even remove some of the impetus for the reform of multilateral institutions that beijing has pushed for through the aiib as a counterweight and what better way could there be for washington to capture china s belt and road initiative there are other possible candidates already at the helm of development banks including the asian development bank s president takehiko nakao that would put trump in japan s good books and reinforce the us japan alliance that controls the adb that would exclude the lawyers from whom several former world bank heads have emanated or medical doctors like jim yong kim or defence specialists like the institution s legendary former president robert mcnamara but it would open the door to those with hands on experience in infrastructure by trying to be all things to everyone promoter of poverty reduction health care and education agency social welfare advocate economic and financial policy adviser environment agency and only then infrastructure builder the world bank has lost its identity and sense of purpose the international bank for reconstruction and development as it was called in 1944 to lend money toward post world war ii reconstruction it was principally about infrastructure arguably it can only survive now by going back to its roots the new beijing daxing international airport under construction on october 26 2018 the new airport located 46 kilometres south of downtown beijing and designed to take pressure off overcrowded beijing capital international airport in the northeastern suburbs will open to air traffic at the end of september 2019 photo simon song trump flirted last year with the idea of a us national infrastructure bank to bring together public sector and private interests like his plan for a us 1 trillion scheme to make american infrastructure great again that appears to have fallen through if he switches his attention now to the global stage trump could do a service to stock and bond markets and to the cause of infrastructure development increasing the issuance of world bank bonds for infrastructure could provide a major asset class for investors it could be a way to tap the estimated us 120 trillion of institutional funds that often shun more direct forms of infrastructure investment because of the lack of a public sector guarantor and it could open the way for greater volumes of equity investment the world bank could then revert to being a real bank it was designed to raise capital in global markets using minimal paid in government capital and triple a credit ratings and to direct this into investments it is in short the perfect vehicle for infrastructure finance if used properly anthony rowley is a veteran journalist specialising in asian economic and financial affairs this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as why the world bank needs to go back to infrastructure roots

washington the partial shutdown of the us government has begun to make it harder to assess the health of the economy by delaying or distorting key reports on growth spending and hiring government data on home construction and retail sales for example won t be released next week because staffers who compile those reports have been furloughed the retail sales report provides a snapshot of consumer spending which fuels more than two thirds of the economy with macy s and kohl s having said thursday that their holiday sales were weaker than expected a broader gauge of retail spending would have provided important clarity in addition the next report on the economy s overall growth set for jan 30 won t be released if the shutdown remains in effect even if the government has fully reopened by then federal workers won t likely have had enough time to produce the scheduled report on the nation s gross domestic product not all agencies are closed congress approved funding last year for the labour department so the government s next monthly jobs report will be released as scheduled on feb 1 but it s unclear how long the department will be able to issue jobs reports the most closely watched barometer of the economy after that though the economy remains healthy in most respects there are rising concerns that growth could slow or even stall in coming months the trade war between the united states and china which has helped depress global growth is likely slowing business investment the stimulus from the trump administration s tax cuts is expected to fade and borrowing costs have risen since the federal reserve raised short term interest rates four times last year before rebounding this week stock markets had plummeted roughly 16 per cent from their peak oct 2 many economists increasingly see the shutdown should it persist as a drag on the economy michael feroli of j p morgan has downgraded his forecast for growth in the first three months of 2019 because of the shutdown he now expects the economy to grow at a 2pc annual rate down from his previous estimate of 2 25pc the shutdown is costing the economy about 1 2 billion a week according to standard poor s some of that loss will be regained after federal workers eventually receive back pay for the time they missed but many government contractors won t be made whole and lost business such as scheduled hotel stays from trips to national parks that won t be taken may not be made up fed officials are now stressing their flexibility on rate hikes emphasising that they will be patient and their policy data dependent by this the fed means that the government s latest readings on hiring inflation and growth will factor heavily in its rate decisions yet much of that data will now be unavailable to the fed or anyone else for us one of the biggest effects of the shutdown has been around data raphael bostic president of the fed s atlanta regional bank said wednesday we re worrying about that even some reports that are released on schedule are likely to be distorted by the shutdown for example the january jobs report may show an artificially high unemployment rate and low employment figure that s because up to 380 000 federal employees who aren t working or being paid during the shutdown but who will return to work afterward could be counted as unemployed for january if so that would raise the unemployment rate by 0 2 percentage point estimated ben herzon an economist at macroeconomic advisers a forecasting firm and the monthly job count could decline by 380 000 if the shutdown continues through the end of january herzon said that could push the monthly job figure into negative territory if all the federal workers eventually receive back pay as occurred after previous shutdowns then the january jobs report would later be revised to restore those 380 000 jobs according to the labour department s bureau of labour statistics future jobs reports could be jeopardised too if the government remains shut down the census bureau conducts the monthly surveys that the bls uses to calculate the unemployment rate census is part of the commerce department which remains closed during the shutdown the bls wouldn t say whether data collection will continue beyond january if the shutdown continues a business journalists organisation on friday urged all parties to end the shutdown saying it is deeply troubled by delays in release of the economic reports timely access to data about the united states economy is critical to decision making by our nation s businesses and consumers

it s a very different time for the ski industry than when grand targhee opened for business in late 1969 baby boomers were coming of age and america was increasingly prosperous innovations had made skiing accessible to the merely athletic and not the truly adventurous and not least wide bodied jets had made long distance travel possible skiing was booming then grand targhee located on the western side of the teton range near driggs idaho was one of 97 ski areas in the united states founded during the 1960s according to a compilation of founding years put together by the international skiing history association others included breckenridge keystone park city crested butte ski apache in new mexico schweitzer in idaho and jackson hole in wyoming the pace has slowed to 23 new ski areas in the 1980s and just eight in the century s last decade there were still significant acreage expansions at ski areas vail basically doubled in size during the late 1980s and 1990s for example but the best mountains had been taken skier days began flattening in 1978 79 national skier days were at 50 2 million not counting pacific coastal states the highest they ve reached since then was 60 5 million last year a drought year in colorado and other states they fell back to 53 3 million participation however has not kept up with population growth for more than 15 years the ski industry has been pondering how to pick up the pace that dilemma was discussed again recently when mike kaplan chief executive of the aspen skiing co met with local elected officials kaplan described a flat skier visit environment for the industry the four ski areas in the aspen area did about 500 000 skier days in 1967 68 the year that snowmass opened by 1993 it was doing 1 4 million skier days since then that number has changed little except for a dip during the recession of a decade ago the critical problem he identified at a meeting covered by the aspen times scott condon is that ski areas remain heavily dependent upon the same folks who produced the big gains in the 1960s and 1970s baby boomers who by the way are overwhelmingly white guys baby boomers have been aging out they were responsible for 31 1 percent of skier visits nationwide in 2005 06 notes condon that had dipped to 14 8 percent last season despite the offer of discounted tickets to older skiers older skiers are valuable to the ski industry because they tend to have the time and money to spend more time on the slopes 9 1 days for those 65 years of age and older that s the highest of any age cohort other than those 17 and younger too there s more competition as was observed by kaplan and others including cruises beach getaways and trips to las vegas a youth movement is occurring adrienne saia isaac marketing and communications director for the national ski areas association told the times generation z ages 21 and younger comprised 34 percent of skier visits last season the largest age group gen xers aged 38 to 53 and millennials ages 22 to 37 have been holding steady in skier visits she said however they ski and ride less than prior generations for at least 15 years the ski industry has been confounded by the rapid drop out rate of beginners only 19 percent continue on to become proficient and long term customers there have been a number of successful innovations that would make a difference if more widely adopted says rick kahl editor of ski area management an industry publication too often though ski schools reject those changes and marketing departments resist spending the necessary money of course ski towns aren t withering away there are no boarded up windows common in small farming towns ski towns nearly all of them have the problems of success such as affordable housing and then there s vail resorts whose stock has gained appreciably in the last 22 years a reflection of the company s profitability now alterra mountain co wants to get in on the action most rental cars at airport not well equipped for snow breckenridge colo the summit daily news recently set out to find out what visitors coming from denver international airport would find in rental vehicles for a trip to colorado mountain resorts the results something less than comforting of the six car rental firms only one said it could guarantee a four wheel or all wheel drive vehicle true the vast majority of their suvs and pickup trucks come equipped with all wheel or four wheel drive capability but no guarantees and snow tires forget about it in other words many of the vehicles driven by out of state visitors to colorado mountain resorts do not meet the state s requirements for driving in inclement weather it used to be called the chain law but most rental car companies prohibit the use of chains too of course how many ski towns residents know how to use chains anymore in the good old days say the 1970s and 1980s they used to be part of the essential tool kit utah s bac law lowered park city colo to

for all states each day an average of about 29 people die in the united states in alcohol related deaths the park record reports that dui arrests have dropped more than 50 percent over the past seven years despite a booming population what will be the effect on tourism in park city the park record talked with david corsun who directs a hospitality management school at the daniels college of business if you really want to ski utah you re going to ski utah he said you re just going to figure it out utah has long had among the most restrictive laws governing alcohol in the united states

does the u s government shutdown affect the county the jackson hole news guide in early january described minimal impact that s largely because yellowstone and grand teton national parks don t draw that many visitors in winter due to the snow there s not a lot of formalized activity in winter said mark berry vice president of the grand teton national park foundation the foundation is not a formal agency of the federal government but rather a nonprofit formed to assist as needed this is a time when the park needs assistance even if the number of users is small the foundation has secured portable toilets for placement at popular trailheads to avoid the sort of messes reported in yosemite and other places the bridger teton avalanche center has also been relying on nonprofit funds to squeak by during the shutdown its forecasters are deemed essential which means they are part of about 420 000 federal employees forced to work without pay backcountry users will still be able to check the avalanche center s daily bullets but operations may be hampered as time goes on said bob comey the director that s where another nonprofit the friends of bridger teton avalanche center will come in it will cover incidental operating costs that cannot be deferred until funding resumes assuming that the shutdown does not last for years as president donald trump vowed will happen unless he gets

lyle muller the iowa center for public affairs journalism a federal judge has struck down as unconstitutional a 2012 iowa law that banned undercover recording at agricultural production facilities in the state saying the law s primary aim is curbing speech critical of practices at those facilities when the state seeks to regulate protected speech it bears the heavy burden of showing that the prohibition satisfies constitutional scrutiny senior judge james gritzner of iowa s southern district wrote in a ruling he handed down wednesday jan 9 defendants have not met their burden iowa s law prohibited anyone from working undercover at an agricultural production facility to record how animals are treated or crops are treated or modified supporters of the law said it was needed to keep activists from trespassing on private property and to protect facilities from potential health risks outsiders could bring with them critics said it kept activists reporters and other citizens who wanted to expose unhealthy conditions for animals from learning about those conditions and reporting them the animal legal defense fund iowa citizens for community improvement which acts as a watchdog on factory farms bailing out benji a nonprofit organization for dog and puppy protection people for the ethical treatment of animals peta and the center for food safety sued in a petition filed by aclu iowa the iowa center for public affairs journalism which runs iowawatch joined the iowa freedom of information council in an amicus curiae or friend of the court filing supporting the lawsuit saying the law restricted newsgathering by journalists iowawatch has done reporting on dog breeding facilities that violate animal health laws undercover investigations have been a long part of journalism in the united states and i m grateful to see the court recognize that randy evans executive director of the iowa freedom of information council said at a des moines news conference defendants were gov kim reynolds attorney general tom miller and montgomery county attorney bruce swanson former gov terry branstad signed the law after the iowa legislature passed it gritzner s ruling granted the plaintiffs request for summary judgment in their favor and against the defendants request for judgment in their favor gritzner said in his ruling that iowa s law in effect implicates first amendment rights because you could not break the law without engaging in speech he said the law effectively criminalized undercover investigations of certain agricultural facilities like puppy mills and he wrote the law was similar and in parts identical to laws in other states that regulate conduct and speech about agricultural operations in fact iowa is one of many states that have passed or attempted to pass such legislation in the last decade gritzner wrote of those in effect several have been invalidated or limited based on first amendment challenges gritzner wrote that the state had shown no evidence that the law s prohibitions would protect perceived harm to the ag facilities or biosecurity he cited incidences of lawmakers saying they wanted to curb activists from spreading damaging or false information about the facilities and agriculture production practices plaintiffs and their amici the freedom of information council and iowa center for public affairs journalism frame this legislative trend within the context of an on going tension between members of the news media and the agriculture industry he wrote the freedom of information council and iowa center for public affairs journalism brief in support of the lawsuit stated that the public wants consumer news about the food they eat and how it is produced but that the iowa law hampered reporting unflattering news under the law a first conviction would be a serious misdemeanor while a second conviction would be an aggravated misdemeanor this is an important victory for free speech in iowa rita bettis austen the aclu iowa lead attorney in the case said at the des moines news conference which aclu iowa showed via facebook live these laws which penalize investigative reporting on agricultural facilities have proliferated in the last decade across the country not just here in iowa bettis austen said the ag gag law was clearly a violation of iowans first amendment rights to free speech and it silenced advocates and ensured that animal cruelty unsafe food safety practices environmental hazards and inhumane working conditions went unreported for years bailing out benji executive director mindi callison said the ruling was groundbreaking because of it hopefully other states are able to overturn their ag gag laws callison said the associated press reported that the iowa attorney general s office is considering an appeal the ap also reported an iowa pork producers association statement on the ruling iowa pig farmers will continue to properly care for their animals and provide safe and secure working conditions for their employees and they will fight those who try to destroy or attack their livelihoods one case at a time federal courts also have struck similar laws in idaho utah and late last year wyoming and a case challenging a restrictive law in north carolina is pending

already struggling to make ends meet the masses are braced for yet another mini budget a second by the incumbent government finance minister asad umar says the mini budget to be unveiled on jan 23 will facilitate businessmen and carry good news for the stock exchange but with the government already struggling with crises such as those relating to fiscal deficit and balance of payments expecting good news is like expecting the unexpected and since a budget is all about generating money people know very well that they are only going to be burdened with more taxes in the new mini budget the tsunami of change has transformed into a storm of inflation in just five months of the new government economic indicators both at the maco and the micro level are nothing to write home about the rupee has plummeted to an all time low against the american dollar foreign exchange reserves are alarmingly low exports have only marginally increased despite a massive depreciation of the rupee bears continue to dominate the stock market due to uncertainties over the government s economic policies and in the political arena the central bank s interest rate has gone up to 10 a cut in the development outlay in the first mini budget is feared to bring down the economic growth from 5 8 in the last fiscal year to something around 4 in the ongoing one household budgets too have taken a huge hit while power and gas tariffs have undergone big hikes the trickle down effect of the falling oil prices in international market has been too small the rise in the value of dollar has its effects too the prices of medicines have already gone up by up to 15 and those of many other imported items are anticipated to rise adding to all that is the government s anti encroachment drive that has resulted in huge unemployment and that too at a time of increasing hardship published in the express tribune january 13 2019 like opinion editorial on facebook follow etoped on twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces
a potentially significant second amendment battle is forming in boulder colorado where officials recently adopted a ban on a number of ordinary weapons the ban effectively has made jon caldara the president of the denver based free market think tank independence institute a criminal and he has declared he won t comply meanwhile the mountain states legal foundation is suing the city for the ordinance which requires owners to certify their assault weapons as defined by the city otherwise the weapons must be removed from the city or be destroyed violators face fines confiscation and jail time the foundation contends in a court brief that the city cannot undermine the exercise of fundamental and unalienable rights and ignore the u s constitution and controlling supreme court precedent can the city it asks ignore its state constitution and state law by infringing upon and criminalizing an individual s unalienable and natural right to self defense and the right to keep and bear arms the supreme court has dismissed ordinances in washington d c and chicago similar to boulder s recognizing an individual right to bear arms boulder s ordinance 8245 banned the sale and possession of guns in the city defined as assault weapons in addition to bump stock devices and large magazines and banned the sale and possession of weapons to anyone under age 21 city officials such as councilman aaron brockett have bluntly stated their aim my hope is that we will see more bans so these weapons will no longer be available caldara noted in a commentary that progressives formerly advocated for individual and constitutional rights progressives have not just rejected that proud tradition they have remade it into the ugly opposite the end justifies all coercing speech with speech codes and forcing cake bakers to create statements against their core religious beliefs social justice warfare and identity politics the nanny state banning everything from plastic straws to tobacco products and forcing private health insurance products at gun point he said progressives wield intolerance like the weapon it is but are they kidding us or themselves when they smugly assert their tolerance do they believe their celebrate diversity bumper stickers blind to the hypocrisy i find myself thinking about this since at the beginning of january i became a criminal in my tolerant hometown of boulder boulder which did so much to promote the civil rights of the lgbt community in decades past when alternative lifestyles were misunderstood and feared is now leading the charge against people like me whose lifestyle is misunderstood and feared he continued in boulder if your core beliefs include dressing as the opposite gender or following the teachings of the quran our city government will bend over backwards to protect you from those who wish to separate you from your community you d never be forced to self identify to government authorities to submit to inspection to be registered and made to pay fees to keep your core beliefs caldara said he is asking for progressives who run city government to live up to their assertion of tolerance and just let me be because i own a long gun with a pistol grip and a detachable magazine i had to the end of december to self identify to the police present myself for investigation and my gun for inspection pay fees in order to receive a police issued permission slip all to avoid jail time monetary penalties and the confiscation and destruction of my gun i have never been convicted or even charged with a crime in my 54 years of life but this week i became a criminal i am no different then potentially thousands of other boulderites who cannot bring themselves to submit to this ugliness for that decision he said his daughter in boulder s school has been commented on by teachers in front of their classes has been ganged up on by students and bullied because her father is a murderer wnd reported boulder s move has met with widespread resistance from gun toting hippies only 342 assault weapons or semiautomatic rifles were certified by boulder police before the dec 31 deadline meaning there could be thousands of residents in the university town of 107 000 in violation of the sweeping gun control ordinance
this past fall i realized that i was an addict it wasn t a common one like drugs alcohol sex food or social media but it was an addiction it was causing me to lose control of my life and driving me to try and hide it from family and friends today i can now say that i am a recovering addict of cable news and the insidious and all consuming 24 hour news cycle i am in recovery now but each day i must fight the urge to grab a cable remote and turn on fox news which was once my fix of choice so that i can hear that stirring phrase fox news alert that once sent shivers of anticipation through my body as a child of the television age my addiction probably started when i was young i remember watching the camel caravan on nbc in the early 1950s the anchor was john cameron swayze in his pre timex days later i watched the huntly brinkley report on nbc and by the time i went to college i watched walter cronkite on cbs by the time i was 11 or 12 i became fascinated with network coverage of political conventions and when i was 15 i took a portable radio to the 1960 boy scout national jamboree in colorado springs so i could listen to the republican convention had i exhibited these symptoms today my parents likely would have sought professional help for my incipient news addiction but those were simpler times when children were allowed to roam free and grow up free of clinical pigeon holing for the next decade my life went on with no worsening of my addiction until 1986 when cable television came to silver creek and i now had access to cnn founded in 1980 by a man foolish enough to marry jane fonda ted turner i had news 24 hours a day like today there usually wasn t a lot of fresh news to report everyday but cnn s reporters could find new angles on a story no matter how preposterous at times and supply talking heads who could analyze a story no matter how much of that analysis was repetitious i didn t care it was news and cnn knew how to beat a story to death through the early 1990s i continued watching cnn and msnbc but i now know that both cable channels leaned to the left and harbored elitist bicoastal tendencies out of sync with america west of the appalachians and east of the sierras it was around 1996 that i began hearing about fox news founded by roger ailes who had put rush limbaugh on national radio in 1988 it took our cable company until 2001 to add fox news but i latched onto it like a man in the desert latches onto water or a news junkie latches onto a hot story i rarely watched cnn or msnbc anymore fox news was my happy place and i even put up with bill o reilly s misogyny and constant interruption of guests my addiction was fed on a daily basis beginning with fox and friends in the morning until hannity in the evening and if i had trouble sleeping far into the night during the 2016 presidential campaign i sensed that news was beginning to control my life i shouted at anchors and talking heads as if they could hear me there were days when all i did was wait by my television for the next fox news alert or the next repetitious remark from a washington talking head fox news was on constantly and when my wife would get tired of it i would surreptitiously watch on a bedroom television finally in the run up to the recent midterm elections i could no longer live with my addiction and the endless and repetitious stories concerning which party would win which houses of congress i was also beginning to understand that those continuous fox news alerts were nothing more than a come on for poor news addicts like myself i had reached a point where i didn t know what to do but then a light shown through the fog the source was rush limbaugh who one day stated on his show that it was possible to break one s addiction to cable news and in doing so you could become a happier person it hasn t been easy to break my addiction to cable news because it took a lifetime to get where i am but i m working on it now i limit my new intake to the observer magazines like national review and commentary and to a lesser extent the buffalo news those publications tell me what i need to know is the nation at war has our economy and the stock market collapsed what are beetle bailey and sergeant snorkel up to this morning and will i be able to solve the hocus focus picture puzzle today today i may be slightly less well informed but i am far happier for any of you who are also addicted to cable news and the 24 hour news cycle understand that there is hope for recovery thomas kirkpatrick sr is a silver creek resident send comments to editorial observertoday com

a mobil food mart in hartford that accepts snap benefits credit julia werth ctmirror org washington with no end to the federal shutdown in sight anti hunger advocates are becoming anxious about the fate of federal nutrition programs like food stamps school lunches and other programs for the poor that are run by the u s department of agriculture the usda which is one of the federal agencies shuttered as a result of the partial shutdown has told connecticut officials it has funding for these programs through january but if the shutdown persists the agency might not be able to continue to subsidize the programs through the entire month of february besides funding the popular supplemental nutrition assistance program snap that provides food stamps to more than 384 000 individuals in 215 000 connecticut households the usda is responsible for several other smaller nutrition programs that help feed the elderly and pregnant women and children about 2 480 low income connecticut residents age 60 and older receive packages of canned fruit vegetables meat and fish bottled juice powdered milk cheese peanut butter and other food items through the commodity supplemental food program another program the emergency food assistance program helps supplement the diets of low income americans by providing them with emergency food and nutrition assistance at no cost usually through food banks and food pantries in 2018 connecticut received about 6 6 million pounds of food from this usda program the usda also administers the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children that provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods health care referrals and nutrition education for low income pregnant women new mothers and infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk federal money for wic has already dried up and the connecticut department of public health which administers the program did not respond to questions about the program s status federal funding for school breakfast and lunch programs may also be halted it is unconscionable to hold hostage programs like snap wic and school meals that are essential to the nutrition health development learning and well being of tens of millions of americans said james weill president of the food research action center the trump administration has been less than forthcoming about how long these critical safety net benefits can and will be provided but the specter of cut offs starting in february is causing increasing fear and confusion he added the usda and a number of other federal agencies are shuttered because congressional democrats and president donald trump could not agree on funding for the president s signature campaign promise of a border wall between the united states and mexico the usda did not return calls on the status of the funding of its nutrition programs but the day after christmas the usda wrote to the agencies that administer the programs in connecticut saying food purchased before the shutdown which began on dec 22 would be delivered to the commodity supplemental food program for the elderly and the emergency food assistance program that helps stock the shelves of more than 500 food pantries in connecticut the usda letter also said that if congress and the white house did not come to an agreement to end the shutdown state agencies may choose to continue the programs by spending their own money with the understanding that funding will not be provided without an appropriations act once federal funding becomes available food distribution program costs incurred during this lapse may be eligible for federal reimbursement only to the extent that the programs were administered in accordance with federal statute and regulations the usda letter said delauro demands answers on fate of food stamps the usda also addressed the status of the food stamp program saying snap will continue operations and eligible households will receive monthly benefits for january we understand the uncertainty that these circumstances present for usda food and nutrition service customers and partners nationwide the usda said in its letter dated dec 26 effective today many fns staff will be furloughed pending reinstatement of funding by congress and will not be available by phone or email they cannot carry out normal work functions until funding is restored households that received snap assistance had an average household income of about 813 a month in 2016 the average snap benefit per household was about 249 a month unlike smaller nutrition programs the cost of the food stamp program is too great for states to take over even temporarily prompting rep rosa delauro d 3rd district to say snap is on the precipice of massive benefits cuts if that happens people will go hungry children veterans seniors all because of a tantrum by the president delauro said that is unimaginably cruel on tuesday dozens of house democrats including delauro wrote usda secretary sonny perdue demanding to know what would happen to the food stamp program after the end of the month if the shutdown continues in their letter the lawmakers said the usda received 3 billion worth of reserve funding for snap in the 2018 budget bill but estimations based on program participation suggest this amount would fail to provide all recipients with full benefits even for the month of february in this scenario where federal funds are unable to cover full benefit costs the law requires usda to instruct snap state agencies on how to ration available funding among snap recipients to date it remains unclear how such benefit reductions will be carried out the lawmakers wrote they demanded perdue outline the usda s specific plans for administering snap after january 2019 and explain how usda would instruct state agencies to reduce snap benefits for the month of february and beyond the lawmakers also asked perdue to detail what methods will be used to determine benefit reductions on a per recipient basis and to address reports that retailers who wanted to participate in the snap program were not having their applications processed meanwhile there has been no movement on an agreement that would fund the usda and the other agencies for the rest of the federal fiscal year which ends on sept 30 house democrats plan to begin holding votes on individual bills that would open the closed agencies this week beginning with the u s treasury department but trump says he will not sign an appropriations bill that does not contain money for his wall and he does not appear to be bending at all on that demand the president plans to address the nation tuesday evening on the humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border and travel later in the week to the u s mexico border

photo credit ap us president donald trump washington the us government shutdown on saturday became the longest in history and is taking a growing bite out of the world s largest economy with each passing day economists say while most of the 21 lapses in government spending since 1976 left barely a scratch on economic growth the length of this shutdown makes it harder to say just how bad the impact could get it s not a hard stretch to say that initially it s smaller and then it expands the pain starts to widen beth ann bovino chief us economist at s p global ratings told afp think of it as a butterfly effect with about a quarter of the federal workforce affected the shutdown is currently squeezing an estimated 1 2 billion a week out of the economy bovino said but that figure could grow if it drags on at the current rate within two weeks it will have cost america more than the 5 7 billion us president donald trump is demanding for a wall on the border with mexico the dispute with congress that led to the failure to pass funding for government operations following extended closures in 1995 and 2013 the us economy continued to grow while stock markets mainly went sideways and gdp growth lost in one quarter can rebound in the next as the government springs back to life and workers recoup lost salaries but some losses can never be recovered in myriad but often unseen ways the 4 trillion federal budget is felt in the daily lives of all americans well beyond the 800 000 government workers now going without pay many of whom missed their first paychecks on friday switching off even a part of the government means that life force quickly begins to bleed away payments to farmers and poor families craft beer labels food inspections and economic data all have fallen victim to the budget impasse meanwhile tax refunds and borrower income verifications crucial to the mortgage industry were briefly up in the air with billions at stake the tentacles start to touch many avenues of life and that s a very sad thing bovino said us coast guard cutters their crews working without pay on monday began icebreaking at commercial ports in the frigid waters of great lakes near the canadian border so local steel mills can remain supplied with iron ore meanwhile farmers cannot collect aid payments designed to help ease the pain caused by trump s trade war with china hurting the poorest most small business administration loans to help mom and pop businesses trying to invest hire and grow have been delayed there are no government loans for seeds or cattle

the last in an occasional series examining the legacy of the administration of gov dannel p malloy and the challenges awaiting his successor ned lamont looking back the eight years of health policy under gov dannel p malloy s administration resembles an obstacle course many of the malloy administration s health care policies and budget decisions were reactions to events outside of the governor s control circumstances that took hold before he took office or conditions handed down from the federal government his legacy in health policy and the challenges gov elect ned lamont will soon inherit can be assessed in terms of malloy s handling of these challenges the outgoing governor s two terms nearly dovetailed with the rollout of the affordable care act the federal health care law that expanded insurance coverage to millions of americans and boosted federal funds for health care programs connecticut s early decision to expand medicaid under obamacare to more than 200 000 poor adults has had a positive effect on that population s health the state s uninsured rate and the program s per person costs but it also created a new set of regulations and funding mechanisms for connecticut to navigate and malloy s enthusiastic embrace of the law s federal funding provisions often put him at odds with providers malloy inherited a state in fiscal disarray making his promise to maintain the state s social safety net hard to keep as tackling a daunting budget deficit became the priority and while he may have prevented some fiscal pain for future generations social services and health spending were sometimes victims in his fight against the state s budget demons the malloy years also coincided with a dizzying rise in the numbers of people addicted to opioids both prescribed drugs like oxycontin and illegal drugs like the deadly heroin mix in fentanyl in an epidemic that doesn t seem to be slowing and a year into malloy s first term the shooting that killed 20 young children and six adults at sandy hook elementary school pushed the state s mental health delivery system into sharp focus forcing a reconciliation with how the system failed to prevent that shooting and what needed to be fixed medicaid expansion a vulnerable safety net malloy came into office as connecticut undertook an ambitious effort to bring thousands of people into the state s medicaid pool making it one of the first in the country to voluntarily expand medicaid coverage after the passage of the affordable care act the expansion enacted under gov m jodi rell in 2010 meant more than 200 000 adults without minor children were able to enroll in medicaid and access health insurance for the first time as a candidate and then throughout his years as governor malloy pledged to support the social safety net that came with the expansion and he honored that promise for the most part advocates said while other states made severe cuts to their medicaid programs husky grew dramatically from covering around 457 529 people in june 2010 to more than 800 000 people today about one in five connecticut residents under malloy the department of social services dss has prioritized getting medicaid insured residents primary care providers supporting intensive care management programs for those with high needs and delivering long term care in people s homes or communities rather than in nursing homes malloy also altered the medicaid system in 2012 by dispensing with the companies handling the state s medicaid benefits and switching to a system where the state pays hospitals and doctors directly that system an unusual way to manage a state medicaid program explains how per person spending has consistently dropped making connecticut one of the few states in the nation to bring down its medicaid spending said roderick bremby the commissioner of dss what most states will tell you is medicaid is driving more of the budget he said in connecticut it s not the case gov dannel p malloy former access health ct ceo kevin counihan and lt gov nancy wyman announced data they said showed a drop in the uninsured rate in 2014 malloy took office as one of the key components of the affordable care act the state level private insurance marketplace known in connecticut as access health ct was still in its formative days it was a learning experience for all of us how do you get this out and what do you do said lt gov nancy wyman who oversaw much of the administration s health policy work wyman praised the setup of the exchange which the administration called the most successful state sponsored health insurance exchange in a recent retrospective report as a bipartisan effort we worked with both sides of the aisle in our state she said in more recent years malloy was a vocal defender of the aca against repeated efforts by a republican congress and the trump administration in washington to tear it down while gop efforts to repeal the aca haven t been successful malloy and barnes have consistently faced down threats that the federal government would limit federal medicaid spending or allow states to install a work requirement for medicaid recipients he worked very diligently to implement the affordable care act to meet the needs of connecticut said patricia baker president and ceo of the nonprofit connecticut health foundation but faced with a slow boiling fiscal crisis and a historic deficit the state government needed to make cuts wherever it could which meant that leaving the social safety net untouched was not an option critics suggested that health related spending was often the first thing on malloy s chopping block at the same time connecticut expanded medicaid coverage to cover more childless adults for example malloy moved to tighten the income eligibility threshold for medicaid s husky a program for parents with minor children that proposal would have moved more than 35 000 people off medicaid and onto subsidized private insurance plans from the obamacare health exchange although the legislature rejected that 2013 proposal three years later it changed direction and approved rolling back eligibility guidelines for husky a forcing an estimated 23 700 people off medicaid an attempt to further tighten the income eligibility for the medicaid program was rebuffed by the legislature last spring while those cuts may have saved money in the state budget in the short run baker said it could make caring for those people more expensive in the long run when they show up for care it s more acute and the health outcomes are worse baker said i understood why he might propose it but i don t think in the long run it s a wise policy malloy later fought with lawmakers on another proposed cut to state spending on health care which would have reduced the population eligible for a program that uses medicaid money to help medicare enrollees pay medical expenses that medicare doesn t cover the legislature reversed that change a decision that heartened seniors worried about their medicare costs but that the administration saw as an irresponsible delay of needed cuts heather gates president of the mental health agency community health resources speaking at a press conference about the state budget in 2015 credit arielle levin becker ctmirror org support for the state and nonprofit agencies that handle the basic health needs of the state s most marginalized residents became a perennial fight for advocates like heather gates who has been the president of the mental health organization community health resources for more than two decades gates gave malloy high marks for his commitment to improving housing stock for the mentally ill and incorporating mental health services into primary care despite those budgetary challenges malloy took office when the state was heading into its worst fiscal challenges in quite some time gates said i think we were fortunate that he had experience running government he s smart he has good policy sense she said but cuts to the multiple agencies that provide or support health care from the department of children and families to the prisons to the department of mental health and addiction services were frustrating she said what has been much more disappointing in a very significant way is for five years in a row the governor proposed very very significant cuts and reductions said gates referring to funding for behavioral health services i ve never quite experienced in my career a period of time that has been so challenging financially with the funding support for services for the most needy being under attack malloy s 2016 cuts hit across the health care system touching medicaid substance abuse domestic violence shelters nutrition assistance and mental health care particularly hard so did the emergency cuts he made by executive order last year after a month without a 2017 2018 budget and the cuts had tangible results gates said chr reduced staff and closed one of its intensive housing and residential programs as a result of budget cuts they were substantial and they were real she said in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at sandy hook elementary school in newtown and with an addiction crisis taking lives across the state the cuts to behavioral health services were hard to swallow said patricia rehmer who led the department of mental health and addiction services dmhas from 2009 to 2015 but she conceded those services made up a large chunk of the state budget and were an understandable place to look when the numbers weren t adding up in government when you re running a state agency especially in human services where do you cut rehmer asked there s no good place to cut new priorities after sandy hook former mental health and addiction services commissioner patricia rehmer at left stands with malloy in 2015 as he announces more funding for mental health services the sandy hook shooting in 2012 forced the state to reckon with children s behavioral and mental health services on several levels in the weeks after the shooting the administration reversed its plans to cut more than 7 million in funding from mental health and addiction programs that had been approved the previous fiscal year malloy and wyman prioritized behavioral health over the following years supporting the expansion of programs that serve people with serious mental illnesses and a system for pediatricians to consult by phone with child psychiatrists new laws also changed how insurance companies cover mental health services with the help of the lieutenant governor always saw behavioral health as really a part of overall health said rehmer he made sure that i had a seat at the table when they were talking about health care reform rehmer said she remembers speculation in the days after that the closing of a nearby state hospital might have contributed to the circumstances around the shooting malloy s insistence that institutionalizing those with mental illness isn t the answer was a relief she said governor malloy was great in terms of saying people deserve to live in the community we don t want to keep people institutionalized she said instead malloy doubled down on crafting housing policy to better serve those with mental health issues like supportive group homes gates the community health resources president said while that work made a difference the state still needs to bolster and improve access to the underlying mental health system she said medicaid rates still don t adequately reimburse providers for behavioral health services for example those that were in the administration when the shooting happened were deeply affected by it and took efforts to improve services very seriously she said i don t think there s been enough attention paid to the behavioral health system for kids across the board though the new limits on gun ownership that the malloy administration fought to get passed in the months after the shooting had their own public health implications said jeremy stein the executive director of ct against gun violence i think the reality was that it was a response to a horrific act stein said whether you call it public health or public safety i think it s just two sides of the same coin stein said he hopes lamont will go further as the public safety committee for the governor elect s transition team has recommended fighting the opioid epidemic another event outside of malloy s control was the opioid epidemic deaths from drug overdoses nearly tripled over six years of malloy s time in office from 357 in 2012 to 1 038 in 2017 fentanyl now drives the state s drug epidemic of those 1 038 deaths 677 involved the synthetic opioid drug which is 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin using a combination of local state and federal resources connecticut has pushed prevention education and medication assisted treatment those and other efforts like expanding access to the drug overdose reversal drug naloxone restrictions on the prescribing of prescription opioids and a program connecting recovery coaches to people in emergency rooms earned connecticut a b grade from the national safety council when it evaluated what states are doing to protect their residents from opioid overdoses in 2016 malloy convened experts from yale schools of medicine and public health to create a three year planto address opioid overdoses in the state while a statewide public awareness campaign change the script pushes messages related to addiction prevention treatment and recovery wyman said that strengthening opioid prescribing laws was another important tool in the state s fight against opioid addiction malloy pushed for new laws limiting initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain in most cases and that helped prescribers identify patients who might be misusing drugs opioid prescriptions dropped from just over 2 6 million in 2015 to almost 2 2 million in 2017 according to state data but that hasn t made the situation the lamont administration will inherit any less of a crisis 2017 data from the centers for disease control and prevention showed that connecticut s increase in overdose deaths that year was around 10 percent the second highest increase in new england reversing his predecessor s stance against medical marijuana malloy favored making connecticut the 17th state to legalize it for the chronically ill five years after rell vetoed a medical marijuana bill approved by the legislature malloy supported and signed legislation allowing patients with debilitating diseases like cancer parkinson s and post traumatic stress disorder to buy it the law also created a licensing process for dispensaries and growers while potential patients and medical marijuana advocates cheered the program and its later expansion the medical community was skeptical said matthew katz ceo of the connecticut state medical society the problem was that there was no evidence that it was medically effective there was no research katz said but the program has proven popular under the oversight of the department of consumer protection and a board of medical professionals it has expanded to cover more than 30 500 registered patients with one of 31 approved conditions a new way of doing business vicki veltri executive director of the office of health strategy credit mackenzie rigg ctmirror org recently the malloy administration focused on one way to simplify the health care system in connecticut in february he chose wyman to oversee the consolidation of a the complex web of agencies regulations and funding mechanisms that influence health care with the creation of a new entity the office of health strategy the new office led by former healthcare advocate victoria veltri brings together three programs the federal grant funded state innovation model the office of health information technology and the office of health care access the new office serves as an umbrella organization for all health policy including collecting and using health data managing federal grant money developing ways to keep down costs like the price of prescription drugs and supporting a long delayed effort to create a state system for sharing health records electronically between practices wyman said as independent hospitals consolidate into massive health care systems insurance companies adapt to protect their bottom lines new public health threats emerge federal health care laws remain in flux and racial and socioeconomic discrepancies in health care access become more clear wyman said the office will be a crucial part of the state s health landscape for years to come health care is just changing by the minute wyman said we needed an office that could really react to those changes quickly that changing environment alongside the chronic issues plaguing the state s health systems will pose a daunting challenge to malloy s successor lamont through his spokesperson declined to comment for this article at a meeting of the committee of health experts advising lamont s transition team in december dr m saud anwar the mayor of south windsor and the chair of the internal medicine department at manchester memorial and rockville general hospitals summarized the wide array of stubborn health policy

the ambition of china hawks in the trump administration is to maintain american dominance by halting china s economic rise it s strange that president xi jinping appears to be working toward the same end the risk for any economy approaching china s level of development is that it gets ensnared in the middle income trap once the low hanging fruit of urbanization and industrialization have been plucked countries tend to get stuck in second gear latin america the former soviet union and the largest middle eastern countries have never managed to close the gap with the u s europe and japan that opened up a century ago

could recapture some of its old glory and the chrysler building would get a boost from the improving neighbourhood said jeffrey langbaum a senior analyst at bloomberg intelligence the owners would have to improve the property to keep up with new construction he said the new york chrysler building at street level al drago advertisement the skyscraper completed in 1930 was for a short time the tallest building in the world only to be surpassed when the empire state building opened in 1931 it s one of the most recognisable symbols of the manhattan skyline with its sunburst patterned

chrysler corp founder walter chrysler bankrolled construction of the skyscraper which was in a race to become the world s tallest building designed by architect william van alen the tower features a number of automotive touches including radiator caps and at one point served as the headquarters for the car company full price there are buyers out there that would pay absolutely full market price mr birnbaum said there s a wide spectrum of international buyers that would love to own that property the art deco masterpiece was briefly the world s tallest skyscraper when it was completed in 1930

has spent millions on improvements for the empire state building to compete with newer offices catering to tech reliant financial firms tricky valuation the stock of office buildings in midtown is very old and new state of the art buildings are in very high demand because they offer things that older properties don t offer said bob knakal chairman of new york investment sales at jones lang lasalle those are things like ceiling heights fewer columns or column free spaces and the ability to integrate new technologies in an extremely efficient way arriving at a valuation for the skyscraper involves several moving parts including complex air rights and ground lease terms recent sales of other large office buildings nearby have gone for around us1000 per square foot to us1500 per square foot according to jim costello senior vice president of real capital analytics applying that maths to the 1 2 million square foot 110 000sq m chrysler building would lead to a valuation of 1 2 billion to 1 8 billion though it could be worth less since a deal probably wouldn t include the land costello said a painting of the chrysler building adorns the lobby ceiling mark lennihan advertisement the tower faces increasing expenses tied to its ground lease the land under the chrysler building is owned by the cooper union school which raised the annual fee to 32 5 million last year from 7 75 million in 2017 ms stacom confirmed more increases are scheduled in coming years the question here is the degree to which the leasehold interest can support the increased ground rent which will be the determinant factor in establishing its value said woody heller vice chairman and co head of the capital markets group at savills studley mr heller represented a consortium of banks that in 1997 sold the chrysler building to tishman speyer which spent 100 million on renovations when it bought the building and still owns a small stake buildings that enjoy this extraordinary level of notoriety will

retirees can find solid high yield stocks if they take the time to look here are three you ll want to examine right now if you have entered or are nearing retirement then you re probably looking for stocks that can offer you a healthy dose of income high yielding brookfield infrastructure partners bip 1 34 enviva partners eva and w p carey wpc 1 28 can all do just that however there s more to the stories here than just dividends here s a quick rundown on why these three dividend stocks could be perfect additions to your retirement portfolio yes to dividends no to drama keith speights brookfield infrastructure partners retirees want a lot of some things and very little of others you can put dividends into the former category and drama in the latter brookfield infrastructure partners offers retirees plenty in the dividend department with relatively little drama brookfield infrastructure s distribution currently yields a whopping 5 56 the partnership thinks it can increase its distribution by at least 5 annually it has easily topped that goal in the recent past with the distribution soaring nearly 47 over the past five years but a high yield isn t so attractive to retired investors if it comes along with a tremendous amount of volatility and worries about the sustainability of the distribution program that shouldn t be a problem for brookfield infrastructure the company focuses on infrastructure assets such as communications towers energy transmission lines ports railroads and toll roads these kinds of assets provide a reliable revenue stream that enables brookfield infrastructure to keep those distribution payments flowing the company continually looks for opportunities to expand and it sometimes sells assets to buy more promising ones for example brookfield infrastructure sold off its stake in a chilean electricity transmission business in early 2018 and is redeploying its cash to buy stakes in a natural gas pipeline in india and a natural gas gathering and processing business in western canada such wheeling and dealing contributes to brookfield infrastructure s growth maybe there s a little drama with this stock but it s the kind that retirees will like check out the latest brookfield infrastructure partners earnings call transcript take a chance on this super high yield brian stoffel enviva partners i m still decades away from retirement age and tend to shy away from dividend paying stocks for enviva which manufactures wood pellets in the american southeast for use by european and asian power plants i make a small exception i first bought shares in august 2016 since then the stock is up 18 roughly on par with the s p 500 when you throw in the effect of reinvested distributions however the returns are much better 42 to be exact that s because enviva currently offers a distribution of 2 53 per share per year equivalent to an 8 8 yield at today s prices the thesis behind the partnership is simple invest heavily in logistics to manufacture and transport wood pellets abroad this includes high capacity facilities throughout the southeast united states as well as deep water ports in the atlantic and gulf of mexico next lock customers international power plants into long term contracts the average contract length as of the last quarter was 9 4 years then focus on efficiency and squeeze out distributable cash flow for investors i don t however think retirees should back up the truck on enviva over time its power company customers will probably transition to more sustainable inputs like solar and wind the contract lengths offer a buffer for now the company also experienced a hiccup with a fire at a port in 2018 but has since recovered and its distribution coverage is once again acceptable in the end a small part of your retirement portfolio devoted to enviva has the chance for small share price appreciation but supercharged returns thanks to the outsize distributions check out the latest enviva partners earnings call transcript income and diversification reuben gregg brewer w p carey real estate investment trust reit w p carey offers retirees an over 6 yield backed by more than two decades of annual increases that yield meanwhile is roughly 2 percentage points higher than those of its peers with similar dividend track records don t be too concerned about the yield difference carey s back story can be seen as a net positive for long term investors willing to think outside the box one big knock against w p carey is that it historically operated an asset management business that operation has been largely shuttered at this point it s now another boring triple net lease reit which means it owns properties for which the lessees pay most of the operating costs it s a stable business model with long term leases that usually contain built in rent increases often the purchases carey and its peers make are directly from the eventual lessees who use the cash for things such as expansions and acquisitions carey makes the spread between its funding costs and the rates it earns on the property so far so good what separates w p carey from most of its peers is diversification the biggest names in this niche are focused on retail properties carey is spread across several sectors including industrial 27 of rents office 23 retail 17 warehouse 16 education 4 and other it also generates around 35 of its rents from foreign markets while its peers tend to be domestically oriented far from a negative all of this diversification gives carey more levers to pull as it seeks out new investments yes w p carey does things a little differently but its long history of success suggest that this is a net positive if you can see beyond the typical way triple net lease companies operate check out the latest w p carey earnings call transcript
