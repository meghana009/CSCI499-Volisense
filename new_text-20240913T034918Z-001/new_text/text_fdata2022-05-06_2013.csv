the federal reserve on wednesday announced its biggest rate hike since 2000 with a half percentage point increase as it works to crush soaring us inflation with inflation at the highest rate in four decades federal reserve chair jerome powell sent a message directly to the american people expressing concern for the pain caused by rising prices and pledging to use all available tools to bring them down but he told reporters he remains confident the economy is strong enough to withstand rate increases without tipping into a recession after a quarter point hike in march the us central bank s policy setting federal open market committee fomc pushed the benchmark interest rate above 0 75pc as it works to cool the economy and confirmed more increases will be appropriate the hike will raise the costs of all types of borrowing from mortgages to credit cards to car loans cooling demand and business activity inflation has become an overriding concern after the world s largest economy saw annual consumer prices surge 8 5pc over the 12 months to march the biggest jump since december 1981 policymakers continue to believe inflation will gradually return to the fed s 2pc target as it raises borrowing costs but in a statement following the conclusion of its two day meeting the fomc said it will be highly attentive to inflation risks in an unusual move powell opened his news conference speaking to the american people inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship that is causing he said promising to use all tools available to bring it down expeditiously he acknowledged that higher interest rates also bring their share of pain but everyone would be better off if we can get this job done the sooner the better to achieve that aim he said additional 50 basis point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings however a more aggressive three quarter point hike is not under consideration the fed s goal is to engineer a soft landing reining in inflation while avoiding a contraction in economic activity and powell said that outcome is likely it s a strong economy and nothing about it suggested that it s close to or vulnerable to a recession he said but with china s pandemic lockdowns worsening global supply snarls and the war in ukraine pushing commodity prices higher analysts fear factors beyond the central bank s control could undermine that goal and perhaps plunge the us economy into a recession the fomc acknowledged the highly uncertain impact of russia s invasion of ukraine and western sanctions on moscow which are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity in addition covid lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions the statement said though it contracted in the first quarter powell said the economy was healthy enough to withstand higher rates and pointed to robust job gains and strong household and business spending however central bankers cannot engineer a solution for the worker shortages that have challenged businesses and raised fears of a wage price spiral when employees demand higher salaries and fuel price increases powell downplayed those concerns saying some of the inflation is due to price shocks while fed policy can help address the imbalance in the labor market on wednesday payroll services firm adp reported private employers added a weaker than expected 247 000 workers in april a sign that companies are struggling to find available labor while government data released tuesday showed there are nearly two openings for every job seeker the fomc also said it would begin reducing its massive bond holdings starting june 1 beginning at the pace of 47 5b a month and then doubling after three months also aimed at removing stimulus from the economy the decision was widely expected and many economists believe the fomc will again hike rates by a half point in june though ian shepherdson of pantheon economics said after that we think all bets are off given the likelihood of a steep sustained drop in inflation a clear softening in manufacturing and a meltdown in housing market activity stock markets cheered the fed move closing sharply higher with big gains in interest sensitive tech shares
the u s air force s next generation air dominance ngad fighter will be the most expensive fighter jet ever built ngad will also be the first sixth generation fighter designed to fight china in the pacific the crewed fighter will also control robotic wingmen each of which will cost more than an f 35 the u s air force is bracing the public and congress for the highly anticipated next generation air dominance ngad fighter and the sticker shock wave the world s first sixth generation jet will leave in its wake the ngad fighter set to begin replacing the f 22 raptor in 2030 will cost multiple hundreds of millions of dollars easily two or three times the cost of the f 35 the fighter is being optimized for the asia pacific theater and will be accompanied into battle by robotic sidekicks air force secretary frank kendall in remarks reported by defense news told lawmakers that the crewed version of the ngad fighter jet would cost multiple hundreds of millions of dollars ngad includes both crewed and uncrewed fighters the uncrewed version would cost no more than half as much as the crewed version a per unit cost of 200 million would easily make crewed ngad fighters the most expensive fighter jet of all time and to be clear kendall s statement leaves plenty of room for the jet to actually cost in excess of 300 million for context the f 35a costs 77 million while the new updated f 15ex super eagle costs 80 million if a crewed ngad costs 300 million and the uncrewed version 150 million that same pot of money could buy nearly six f 35as ngad is a fundamentally different aircraft than the f 35a the f 35a was designed in the 1990s as an economical replacement for several fighters including the f a 18c av 8b harrier f 16 and a 10 thunderbolt the f 35 was designed to fulfill multiple missions including traditional fighter air to air roles air to ground strike roles and close air support the new fighter is better compared to and will replace the f 22a raptor the world s first fifth generation fighter designed purely for the air superiority mission nurphoto getty images a u s air force f 35 assigned to raf lakenheath flies a low altitude run through the mach loop wales january 2022 we don t know a lot about ngad other than that it was designed and flown in less than a year the strategic environment has changed a lot since the late 1980s when the raptor was first envisioned and ngad will reflect that the aircraft is likely to be laser focused on china which means operating over the sweeping expanse of the asia pacific region a war with beijing will involve moving tactical aircraft across thousands of miles operating from remote bases carved out of tiny islands and flying long range missions against enemy air and ground defenses an ngad might for example fly 1 400 miles from guam to kadena air base on the japanese island of okinawa there it could bolster the island s air defenses protecting the american and japanese bases on the island from chinese fighters attempting to establish air superiority and strike aircraft pummeling allied bases on the way there and back it could use its range to skirt around chinese warships with long range surface to air missile systems loop images getty images an f 22 raptor at raf fairford july 2017 the f 35 can t do that but that s not what the f 35 was meant for the f 22 however can t do that either and that s what the f 22 was meant for in the first place what will ngad look like stephen trimble defense editor at aviation week space technology spelled out some ideas at the check six podcast trimble suggests a long range fighter with the ability to cruise at 70 000 feet much higher than current fighters above the speed of sound using breakthrough technologies such as daytime or optical stealth usaf getty images f 111 assigned to raf upper heyford dropping 500 pound mk 82 practice blue band bombs the f 111 was one of the largest tactical jets flown by the u s air force one thing we can infer about the new fighter is that it will be big previous generation fighters used external fuel tanks to extend their range on combat missions allowing aerial refueling tankers to stay out of harm s way external fuel and weapons however ruin an aircraft s stealthy profile making it much more visible to radar as a result ngad will have to store a large amount of fuel and air to air missiles under the skin buried within the fuselage of the aircraft trimble suggests ngad could be as large as the f 111 a large long range strike aircraft that served from the late 1960s to the 1990s the f 111 was 73 feet long could fly from treetop level to 60 000 feet had a maximum takeoff weight of 100 000 pounds and with internal fuel alone had a range of 2 600 nautical miles usaf getty images an f 111 parked alongside an f 4 phantom 63 f 15 65 and mirage iii the f 22 is 62 feet long flies at up to 65 000 feet has a maximum takeoff weight of 83 000 pounds and has a range of 1 600 nautical miles while carrying 10 000 pounds of fuel in external tanks this number suggests that if the air force wanted an air superiority fighter with a 2 000 nautical mile range enough to fly from guam to okinawa an f 111 sized aircraft is not far from the mark no matter what ngad actually looks like it will probably be unlike anything we ve ever seen before it will also cost a lot more than we ve ever paid for a fighter jet before but in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine which many predicted would never happen it seems likely that the u s will indeed pay whatever it costs both to deter china from launching a similar attack on taiwan or if deterrence fails clearing the skies of people s liberation army air force fighters now watch this

sean pavone shutterstock colleges where acceptance rates have decreased the most since 2001 each fall thousands of high school students and their families begin the nerve racking process of applying to college whether families are navigating the admissions process for the first time or for the fifth time it s still a journey that requires a slew of research and patience while college enrollment has gone down over the last several years throughout the 2000s and 2010s enrollment in public and private universities reached record highs edsmart identified 10 colleges that have shown the greatest decline in acceptance rates between the 2001 admissions cycle and 2020 data came from the integrated postsecondary education data system at the national center for education statistics only colleges and universities with at least 1 000 applicants were included in the analysis for each college we ve included offerings that potentially make a school more attractive to applicants from affordability to academic programs determining the exact reasons why these colleges have seen a record setting growth of applications over the last 20 years is difficult to quantify for many students over the decades pursuing a secondary degree is a path to improve career and earning opportunities indeed a 2018 college board report found that the median annual earnings for workers with a bachelor s degree was 24 900 higher than those whose highest degree was a high school diploma while there are many factors at play in addition to education attainment such as the type of career field and personal characteristics the report also found that the unemployment rate for workers age 25 and older with at least a bachelor s degree has consistently been half the rate of high school graduates the growing interest in applying to college may also be influenced by the widespread adoption of the common application a single standardized online application form introduced in 1988 more than 900 colleges accept the common app which sees a 10 increase in applications for the schools once they adopt this system the common app makes the process streamlined for both colleges and applicants as prospective students can fill out one form for several institutions for high schoolers saving time during the process can be appealing it can also lead to applying to more schools since they don t need to spend extra time to add a few more safety or reach institutions to widen their chances each school on this list allows applicants to apply with the common app the conversation around the decreasing acceptance rates has spurred discourse among the higher education community several ivy league schools are looking to downplay their single digit admission rates by withholding their admission data stanford university began the same practice in 2018 in hopes of making students feel less anxious to apply even as many institutions experience a rise in popularity with record numbers of applications they continue to improve their offerings from student life to academic rigor read on to see the list of schools that have seen the biggest change in competitive admission rates and learn more

on this list of colleges with decreasing acceptance rates pitzer is a private institution and while the annual cost runs around 57 000 before financial aid pitzer is known for its strength in majors like neuroscience environmental analysis and critical global studies pitzer is noted for student led policy initiatives this influence has spurred such actions as the adoption of gender neutral residence halls and bathrooms recognition of indigenous peoples day and the selection of the college s first african american president environmental impact has also been a focus with pitzer being the first college in california to divest endowments from fossil fuel stocks and placing a campus wide ban on plastic water bottles popova valeriya shutterstock 9 colby college waterville maine acceptance

as measured by the alerian midstream energy select index ameix 2 4 april s correction came on the heels of energy demand fears with the threat that china would extend its lockdowns to include beijing and the potential for a global economic slowdown due to the war in ukraine and higher interest rates earnings announcements began in late april with a few large energy infrastructure companies announcing volume growth and healthy earnings increases compared to last year for the remainder of 2022 we remain positive on the industry as 1 free cash flow after distributions is poised to increase rapidly year over year for the industry 2 hydrocarbon volumes should grow as drilling activity improves and 3 capital allocation remains focused on returning excess cash to investors through buybacks and potential distribution increases 5 crude oil as measured by the west texas intermediate wti benchmark was up 7 9 for the month of april and is now up 35 3 for the year 4 crude oil prices have moved sharply higher due to the war in ukraine russia produces 10 million barrels per day mmbbls d of crude oil or about 10 of global supply and is the second largest crude oil exporter after saudi arabia 6 markets are worried that crude oil supplies may be disrupted which could lead to a spike in prices well above current levels while sanctions so far have avoided russian crude oil sanctioning russia s energy exports would likely lead to a further spike in global crude oil and natural gas prices even if crude oil sanctions are not implemented we would expect a geopolitical risk premium to remain in crude oil prices for the near future should things normalize we view crude oil prices in the 70 80 range as being positive for long term investment in the american energy industry while the ukrainian war will have an as yet unknown effect on crude oil supply fundamentals remain robust as energy consumption continues to rise post covid commodity analysts continue to see a tight supply environment for both crude oil and natural gas in 2022 and potentially into 2023 as energy demand appears to be on trend to exceed peak pre covid levels 7 we believe that current crude oil and natural gas prices are sufficient to lead to u s volume growth in 2022 and 2023 with increases in production already showing up in recent energy information administration eia data the promise of these

it was the governor s strongest signal yet that he might singlehandedly allow medical marijuana for kentuckians suffering from certain medical conditions example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video frankfort ky gov andy beshear sounded increasingly confident thursday that he will have the leeway to take at least some executive action to make medical marijuana legally accessible in kentucky it was the governor s strongest signal yet that he might singlehandedly allow medical marijuana for kentuckians suffering from certain medical conditions his prediction comes as his legal team reviews his options on a long running issue that stalled in the legislature the democratic governor first floated the possibility of executive action about a month ago and since then the latest bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the republican dominated state senate the legal analysis is not yet finalized but i do think that there is going to be room for at least some executive action beshear said thursday when asked for an update at his weekly news conference the governor maintains that legalizing medical cannabis has strong support among kentuckians he didn t specify thursday what actions might be at his disposal to make it legally available whatever steps we re able to take we want them to be clear the governor said we want it to serve a purpose it is not a back end way to allow recreational marijuana so we want to make sure that we do it right beshear said there are folks out there suffering who could benefit from medical cannabis he said he spoke recently with a woman whose son suffers from post traumatic stress disorder after multiple deployments with the military that s the type of help we ought to be providing the governor said beshear didn t offer a new timetable for a decision having previously said a decision could come this summer on possible executive action he instructed his legal team to analyze potential options for executive action that could create a framework to allow medical cannabis in the state the governor s office set up a website for public comments on the issue and a medical cannabis advisory committee is being formed to gather public input the challenge is that there are thousands of people who want to be a part because there are thousands of people who feel very very strongly about this issue he said a bill aimed at allowing kentucky to join the majority of states that have legalized medical marijuana passed the kentucky house this year but died in the senate republicans have supermajorities in both chambers the bill would have strictly regulated the use of cannabis for a list of eligible conditions including cancer multiple sclerosis chronic pain epilepsy and chronic nausea instead a measure creating a cannabis research center at the university of kentucky won final approval from lawmakers key lawmakers resisting the legalization of medical cannabis pushed for the center as an alternative they said it would allow more time to study the effectiveness of marijuana in treating certain ailments the governor has said he sees value in the cannabis center s formation but said he won t wait for it to do cannabis studies before deciding whether to take action beshear has received pushback from some prominent republicans for considering executive action republican senate president robert stivers said recently that kentuckians should be concerned that the governor thinks he can change statute by executive order he simply can t legalize medical marijuana by executive order you can t supersede a statue by executive order because it s a constitutional separation of powers violation stivers said beshear has said he would prefer that lawmakers pass a measure legalizing medical marijuana but said they failed to get the job done make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this download the whas11 news app now for apple or android users
is this the big one on wednesday i warned that the federal reserve had made a colossal mistake when it increased its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points and it looks like investors on wall street fully agree we just witnessed one of the largest single day stock market crashes in history and of course this comes at a time when stock prices had already fallen quite dramatically even before the carnage on thursday stocks were off to their worst start to a year in decades so will things settle down soon or is this the beginning of a truly historic stock market collapse millions of americans better hope that it is the former because trillions upon trillions of dollars in paper wealth is on the line i have always warned my readers that you only make money in the stock market if you get out in time it doesn t matter if you were holding certain stocks when they soared to all time record highs what is going to determine if you make a profit or not is when you choose to sell and markets tend to go down a whole lot faster than they go up on thursday the dow was down more than 1 000 points the s p 500 plunged more than 3 5 percent and the nasdaq got absolutely crushed the dow jones industrial average lost 1 063 points or 3 12 to close at 32 997 97 the tech heavy nasdaq composite fell 4 99 to finish at 12 317 69 its lowest closing level since november 2020 both of those losses were the worst single day drops since 2020 the s p 500 fell 3 56 to 4 146 87 marking its second worst day of the year the reason why the nasdaq plummeted so dramatically was because tech stocks were in free fall mode once again large tech stocks were under pressure with facebook parent meta platforms and amazon falling 6 8 and 7 6 respectively microsoft dropped 4 4 salesforce tumbled 7 1 apple sank 5 6 if you think that those numbers are bad just look at what happened to etsy and ebay etsy and ebay dropped 16 8 and 11 7 respectively after issuing weaker than expected revenue guidance shopify fell nearly 15 after missing estimates on the top and bottom lines the declines dragged nasdaq to its worst day in nearly two years we have seen other bad days on wall street in recent years but this definitely feels different i think that kim forrest has done a better job than anyone else of summarizing what we just witnessed i expected some selloff but the great puking that s happening i didn t expect said kim forrest founder and chief investment officer at bokeh capital partners is this capitulation i remember what capitulation feels like this kind of feels like capitulation when everything even the good names are getting barfed out i could not have said it better myself so precisely what was the trigger that prompted this rush for the exits well a lot of analysts are pointing to the fed s decision to raise interest rates on wednesday here is one example it s going to be incredibly difficult for the fed to normalize interest rates without having a negative impact on growth and earnings said paul nolte portfolio manager at kingsview investment management so stock prices are too high if we re going to see a flattening or a decline in earnings per share because there is so much leverage in the market right now rapid declines could precipitate wave after wave of forced selling in fact it appears that this is already happening to a certain degree ultimately it certainly won t take too much to turn this market slide into a market avalanche meanwhile we continue to get more indications that the u s economy as a whole is really slowing down on thursday we learned that worker productivity declined at its fastest pace in nearly 75 years during the first quarter worker productivity fell to start 2022 at its fastest pace in nearly 75 years while labor costs soared as the u s struggled with surging covid cases the bureau of labor statistics reported thursday nonfarm productivity a measure of output against hours worked declined 7 5 from january through march the biggest fall since the third quarter of 1947 at the same time we continue to get more bad news on the inflation front one of the largest meatpackers in the western hemisphere is warning that steaks and burgers will get even more expensive in the months ahead beef will be getting even more expensive at u s grocery stores in the months ahead according to one of the country s biggest meatpackers national beef co controlled by the brazilian giant marfrig global foods sees relatively stable margins in the next two quarters according to tim klein who heads marfrig s u s operations that means even though their costs to buy cattle are increasing the company will ultimately be able to pass that on to consumers in the form of pricier steaks and burgers and the rapidly rising cost of fertilizer will inevitably make trips to the grocery store much more painful later this year a fertilizer shortage is putting the food supply at risk fertilizer prices have tripled from where they were in 2021 and it s forcing mid michigan farmers to change how they grow their crops you re cutting off one hand to save the other said seth cords so many things are simultaneously going wrong and the outlook for the second half of this year is exceedingly bleak but for a long time stock prices were able to defy economic reality even though economic conditions were rapidly deteriorating all around us investors just continued to party on as stock prices just kept going higher and higher of course now everything has changed trillions of dollars in paper wealth has already been wiped out and trillions more will likely be wiped out in the days ahead but wall street doesn t even realize that what we have been through so far is just a warm up act much more difficult days are coming and eventually we will see financial disaster on a scale that is absolutely unprecedented in our history hopefully that time can be put off for as long as possible but the clock is ticking and what happened on thursday should be a major league wake up call for all of us it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael and my brand new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available on amazon com in addition to my new book i have written five other books that are available on

after years of documenting my design projects on the internet for the world to watch criticize and hopefully enjoy in 2018 i found myself once again crying in the shower we are renovating an old farmhouse in oregon and i was extremely frustrated with our renovation process i was so sick of feeling dumb being mansplained by my contractor and doubting every decision i knew so much about design and renovation and had been writing about it for years on my blog but i wished so badly that there was a book full of real life anecdotes to help educate and support me so i pitched the book the next day and four short years later it s here although the world has changed dramatically since that tearful shower the information in this book has become even more relevant as so many people staying indoors were focusing more on their homes so here are five tips from the new design rules the book guides you through the renovation and decoration process from my perspective with lots of stories and photos it reveals things like bathroom makes to avoid and how high should you really hang art my goal was to help people learn the rules of design so they can creatively break them thus making a choice not a mistake avoid the too small rug design by dee murphy the too small rug is such a common mistake but it can throw off the whole room in this living room dee murphy not only followed the rules by having at least the front two legs of all the furniture on the rug but she layered the vintage rug over a simpler sisal rug to ground the conversation area even more we wrote more about living room rulesand i also did a super dated but still fun video about rug size here vary the art configuration on each wall art direction by emily hendersondesign and styling assistance by emily bowser and julie rose this is a great styling tip that i ve used in almost every room what you want to avoid is every wall having one similar piece of art hung at the same height instead think about doing what we did here mixing a gallery wall mirror shelves leaning art diptychs or one large scale piece of art even if you like more minimal simple design which i do you want to vary the type or scale of art so it doesn t feel redundant and to give each piece its own moment don t chase every trend when it comes to permanent finishes design by ben mendansky you can absolutely bring stylish design ideas into your home but take those risks in lighting furniture and decor elements that don t require demo and hiring out to change do what ben mendansky did with the light fixtures here y all he ombre d the yellow from light to dark yes take risks but be really really careful leaning hard into trends in your permanent finishes like tile flooring windows and architectural details don t hang curtains too high off the floor design by rosa beltran high water curtains can make a room look silly but most big box stores only stock certain length ready made curtains 84 is almost always too short fyi always size up 90 96 usually works for 8 9 ceilings so the curtains hang long enough to touch or almost touch the floor you can hang the rod near the ceiling or halfway between window and ceiling like in this case not at the top of the window but always try to get as close to the floor as you can we have a fun graph and more photos in this post also please note there is a bunny on the bed don t overlook what you already have design by sara ruffin costello in this world of everything at our fingertips hello internet shopping it s tempting to replace something old with something new but before you do look at your pieces with new eyes if you like the shape and style but not the color or fabric you could do what sara ruffin costello did and reupholster a vintage chair in a patterned fabric if the above room tempts you know that the rest of her incredible home in new orleans is peppered through the book and knocks me down every time i see her creativity that green paint the floor tile the door you will make mistakes in the renovation or decoration process we all do it s part of the creative process but i hope this book can help you avoid as many as possible and unleash your creativity and maybe shed fewer shower tears thank you emily and congratulations on your beautiful book emily is also having a book signing in nyc on may 12th you can grab tickets here ps all our house toursand an apartment makeover for joanna s sister after her husband died top photo design by christa martin
bill gates hits back at elon musk says shorting tesla doesn t mean betting against the environment or electric cars responding to elon musk s claims that he is shorting tesla stock bill gates says such a position is just an investment not a move against helping solve climate change elon musk accused the microsoft billionaire in a tweet last week of betting as much as half a billion dollars that shares of the electric car company would fall in a text exchange between the two billionaires leaked online that musk said was authentic the tesla ceo asked gates if he was still shorting the stock gates said he was and that he wanted to talk to musk about philanthropy musk denied the request outright advertisement advertisement sorry i cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against tesla the company doing the most to solve climate change musk reportedly said in the text exchange advertisement advertisement but gates told the bbc in an interview wednesday that his bet against tesla is unrelated to advocacy for pro environmental projects and government policies that has nothing to do with climate change i have ways of diversifying gates said in an interview he added that just because he was betting against tesla doesn t mean he was against the rise of electric cars the popularity of electric cars will lead to more competition for selling those cars so there s a difference between electric cars being adopted and companies becoming infinitely valuable he told the bbc musk and gates have a history of frosty relations and musk has attacked gates on twitter repeatedly after gates said he was concerned about the range and premium price of tesla vehicles in a 2020 video with youtuber marques brownlee musk said in a tweet that his conversations with the former microsoft ceo have been underwhelming tbh more recently amid musk s takeover of twitter the tesla and spacex ceo tweeted a picture of gates side by side with an emoji of a pregnant man saying in case u need to lose a boner fast gates told cnbc s squawk box in july 2020 that musk should cut back on his controversial vaccine comments and focus on electric cars and rockets in a new york times podcast later that year the tesla ceo responded to gates comments about musk s lack of experience with vaccines calling gates a knucklehead musk has also attacked gates in tweets regarding his vaccine advocacy in a tweet last week musk said he was moving on from attacking gates for shorting tesla but gates appears unruffled there s no need for him to be nice to me gates said of musk in the bbc interview disagreements and attacks between the two men have drawn outsize attention because of their immense wealth musk overtook gates as the world s second richest person in 2020 and later surpassed amazon founder jeff bezos to take the top spot the tesla ceo is currently the richest person in the world according to the bloomberg billionaires index while gates sits at fourth on the list gates has pledged to give away most of his fortune over his lifetime this story was originally featured on fortune com

per share revised to a range of 1 65 to 1 75 commenting on the results casey keller president and chief executive officer of b g foods stated first quarter results delivered strong sales growth behind pricing and elevated demand however inflation on key input costs was higher than expected primarily resulting from the war in ukraine and continued supply disruptions and had a significant impact on gross margins recent pricing actions are expected to recover higher costs in the second half of 2022 financial results for the first quarter of 2022 net sales for the first quarter of 2022 increased 27 3 million or 5 4 to 532 4 million from 505 1 million for the first quarter of 2021 the increase was primarily due to pricing initiatives including list price increases and trade spend reductions and the impact of product mix partially offset by volume declines primarily due to price elasticity and supply chain challenges in the first quarter of 2022 resulting from the covid 19 omicron variant base business net sales1 for the first quarter of 2022 increased 28 1 million or 5 6 to 532 2 million from 504 1 million for the first quarter of 2021 the increase in base business net sales was driven by an increase in net pricing and the impact of product mix of 36 2 million or 7 2 of base business net sales and the positive impact of foreign currency of 0 1 million partially offset by a

the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 the decrease was driven in part by comparisons against a very strong first quarter of 2021 for the company s spices seasonings and supply chain challenges during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2020 the company s spices seasonings increased 14 9 million or 20 4 base business net sales of all other brands in the aggregate increased 3 9 million or 3 7 for the first quarter of 2022 gross profit was 101 3 million for the first quarter of 2022 or 19 0 of net sales gross profit was 117 8 million for the first quarter of 2021 or 23 3 of net sales during the first quarter of 2022 the company s gross profit was negatively impacted by higher than expected input cost inflation including materially increased costs for raw materials and transportation the company expects input cost inflation will continue to have a significant industry wide impact during the remainder of fiscal 2022 the company is attempting to mitigate the impact of inflation on its gross profit by locking in prices through short term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements and by implementing cost saving measures the company also announced list price increases in 2021 and again during the first and second quarters of 2022 and where appropriate has reduced trade promotions to its customers for certain of the company s products however increases in the prices the company charges its customers generally lag behind rising input costs as such the company did not fully offset the incremental costs that it faced in the first quarter of 2022 and may not fully offset the incremental costs that the company is facing and expects to continue to face in the remainder of fiscal 2022 selling general and administrative expenses decreased 3 6 million or 7 0 to 46 8 million for the first quarter of 2022 from 50 4 million for the first quarter of 2021 the decrease was composed of decreases in

facility the company recorded a gain on the sale of the portland property plant and equipment of 7 1 million during the first quarter of 2022 the positive impact during the quarter of the gain on sale was partially offset by approximately 2 2 million of expenses incurred during the quarter relating to the closure of the facility and the transfer of manufacturing operations net interest expense decreased 0 2 million or 0 6 to 26 8 million for the first quarter of 2022 from 27 0 million in the first quarter of 2021 the decrease was primarily attributable to a slightly lower average long term

compared to 34 1 million or 0 52 per adjusted diluted share for the first quarter of 2021 the decreases in net income diluted earnings per share adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share were primarily attributable to industry wide input cost inflation and supply chain disruptions partially offset by list price increases trade spend reductions and a net benefit during the first

activities including list price increases and trade spend initiatives and cost savings initiatives to offset these costs but there can be no assurance at this point of the ultimate effectiveness of these activities and initiatives the company s management is not able to fully estimate the impact covid 19 industry wide supply chain disruptions cost inflation and the company s cost inflation mitigation efforts will have on the company s results for the remainder of fiscal 2022 and the company s guidance should be read in this context the ultimate impact of the covid 19 pandemic on the

and adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses are non gaap financial measures used by management to measure operating performance a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of the company s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the company s consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income changes in stockholders equity and cash flows the company defines ebitda as net income before net interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt the company defines adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for cash and non cash acquisition divestiture related expenses gains and losses which may include third party fees and expenses integration restructuring and consolidation expenses amortization of acquired inventory fair value step up and gains and losses on the sale of certain assets and non recurring expenses gains and losses the company defines adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses as adjusted ebitda adjusted for covid 19 expenses management believes that it is useful to eliminate these items because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and the company s ability to generate cash flow from operations the company uses ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses in the company s business operations to among other things evaluate the company s operating performance develop budgets and measure the company s performance against those budgets determine employee bonuses and evaluate the company s cash flows in terms of cash needs the company also presents ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses because the company believes they are useful indicators of the company s historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in the company s credit agreement and the company s senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures as a result reports used by internal management during monthly operating reviews feature the ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses metrics however management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional gaap operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity and therefore does not place undue reliance on these measures as its only measures of operating performance and liquidity ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses are not recognized terms under gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income net income or any other gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses are not complete net cash flow measures because ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity s obligation to service

indicators of an entity s ability to fund these cash requirements ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda before covid 19 expenses are not complete measures of an entity s profitability because

elon musk s deal to acquire has had its ups and downs much like the stock price of most of his companies but it seems like a final arrangement is approaching and that once it arrives musk will be pulling the strings of the social networking platform where he spends a great deal of his time cnbc reported on thursday that musk is expected to serve as twitter s temporary ceo as soon as the deal is official it was previously reported that musk had selected a ceo to his newly acquired social media platform and the news that musk will be taking over until his preferred choice comes aboard likely spells the end of current ceo parag agrawal s tenure it s anybody s guess how all of this will actually shake out though this is elon musk after all the bigger question is how musk is financing the takeover musk has backed a good amount of the deal with funding based on his own shares of tesla stock and bank loans but to foot the massive 44 billion bill he also needed a ton of outside investor money which it appears he got from some unlikely or very likely depending on whom you ask places based on new sec filings musk recently secured more than 7 billion in equity funding from around 19 sources which include sums in the hundreds of millions from various hedge funds as well as some more notable sources like the saudi royal family per the filing saudi prince alwaleed bin talal bin abdulaziz alsaud has agreed to purchase 34 948 975 shares of twitter at 54 20 upon completion of the deal with musk which is notable because prince alwaleed had previously said nuts to a similar offer popular on rolling stone musk is also getting 375 million from qatar which is a little curious considering musk has repeatedly claimed that his twitter will be a bastion of free speech qatar is not really a fan elon musk files new paperwork showing he s got more than 7bn of equity financing to roll into his twitter purchase including binance some qatari group and a saudi billionaire pic twitter com h1jtbzunjp mark di stefano markdistef may 5 2022 musk landing massive investments from wealthy overseas nations isn t surprising but the list of musk s financiers does raise the question of huh what s going on here for example many of the names on this list are all nebulously or tangibly connected to the wider trump universe this may simply be due to the fact that nearly all of america s megarich are all in business together in order to make each other more rich still maggie haberman at the times points out that zach witkoff the son of witkoff capital founder steve witkoff 100 million investment in musktwitter recently got married at mar a lago with trump in attendance steve witkoff in turn used to be one of trump s real estate lawyers editor s picks oracle ceo larry ellison is also a big investor forking over 1 billion ellison is good friends with musk apparently he s also one of trump s wealthiest supporters meanwhile brookfield a canadian asset management company and a new 250 million investor in twitter is also deeply linked to the trumps in 2019 brookfield took out a 99 year lease on 666 fifth avenue which was owned by the kushner family paying the entire lease s 1 1 billion sum up front and massively bailing out the kushners struggling business in return strangely brookfield subsidiary westinghouse electric which is the only u s company that makes large nuclear reactors like say the ones that the saudi government was actively pursuing as part of its nuclear power plan how are twitter s new financiers going to affect twitter as we know it it is as yet unclear what seems like a safe bet right now is that trump will get his account back thanks to a new ceo who truly understands the poster s heart

develop and commercialize a portfolio of covid 19 test systems during the continuing but evolving uncertainty caused by covid 19 for the three months ended march 31 2022 the company continued to incur significant expenses in connection with pending legal matters the company performed an assessment to determine whether there were conditions or events that considered in the aggregate raised substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended march 31 2022 are being issued the q1 financials issuance date initially this assessment did not consider the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that had not been fully implemented because as described below substantial doubt was determined to exist as the result of this initial assessment management then assessed the mitigating effect of its plans to determine if it is probable that the plans 1 would be effectively implemented within one year after the q1 financials issuance date and 2 when implemented would mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern the company achieved significant revenue growth in recent years while profitability has not been at levels as expected it has taken steps including investments in automation to mitigate headwinds such as labor availability volatile capacity planning and implementation of operational efficiency targets to proactively monitor production with the overarching goal for profitable growth during the three months ended march 31 2022 the company undertook measures to increase its total revenues and improve its liquidity position by implementing the global competitiveness program the main pillars of the global competitiveness program include the following focus on higher margin business in growth markets lower manufacturing costs reduce infrastructure costs strategic review of non core businesses and assets in addition the company will continue to focus on regulatory approvals for its dpp sars cov 2 antigen test system dpp respiratory antigen panel and dpp hiv syphilis test system these measures and other plans and initiatives have been designed to provide the company with adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the twelve month period following the q1 financials issuance date the company s execution of those measures and its other plans and initiative continue to depend however on factors and uncertainties that are beyond the company s control or that may not be addressable on terms acceptable to the company or at all the company considered in particular how the ongoing healthcare and economic impacts of covid 19 on the global customer base for the company s non covid 19 products continue to negatively affect the timing and rate of recovery of the company s revenues from those products by for example decreasing the allocation of funding for hiv testing thereby continuing to adversely affect the company s liquidity although the company has entered into agreements to distribute third party covid 19 products in the united states its ability to sell those products could be constrained because of staffing and supply chain limitations affecting the suppliers of those products the company further considered how these factors and uncertainties could impact its ability over the next year to meet the obligations specified in its existing credit agreement those obligations include covenants requiring i minimum cash balance of 3 0 million and ii minimum total revenue amounts for the twelve months preceding each quarter end for the next year the minimum total revenue requirements range from 43 8 million for the twelve months ending june 30 2022 to 48 8 million for the twelve months ending march 31 2023 upon an event of default under the credit agreement the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable in such an event there can be no assurance that the company would have sufficient liquidity to fund payment of the amounts that would be due under the credit agreement or that if such liquidity were not available the company would be successful in raising additional capital on acceptable terms or at all or in completing any other endeavor to continue to be financially viable and continue as a going concern the company s inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the near future whether for purposes of funding payments required under the credit agreement or providing additional liquidity needed for its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business prospects results of operations liquidity and financial condition accordingly management determined the company could not be certain that the company s plans and initiatives would be effectively implemented within one year after the q1 financials issuance date without giving effect to the prospect of raising additional capital pursuant to the company s existing at the market offering agreement increasing product revenue in the near future or executing other mitigating plans many of which are beyond the company s control it is unlikely that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its required financial obligations including its debt service and other obligations due to third parties the existence of these conditions raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve month period following the q1 financials issuance date the company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended march 31 2022 have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve month period following the q1 financials issuance date as such those unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities

not believe are reflective of its core or ongoing operating results these measures are used by management to evaluate the company s performance and make resource allocation decisions each period these

to execute a plan and collaboration among many entities and partners according to gov doug burgum you can t celebrate a project like this that is on the cutting edge of innovation unless you ve got entrepreneurs unless you have risk takers unless you have people that are willing to get out and try to do things with new models in places where people say it will never work he said applied

about 4 500 computers used as mining machines stacked on top of each other along a straight line all the way down the center of the building one side of the building was noticeably cooler than the other side because of the fans pushing the heat from the computers from one side to the other a wall of computers as seen from the backside seems to go on endlessly inside one of the buildings at applied blockchain s hosting facility north of jamestown john m steiner the jamestown sun burgum said the digital economy needs power like electricity to run on whether it is running a server farm that manages transactions online managing emails or even businesses such as banks or health care providers advertisement you need power and you need data centers to run all that he said companies like applied blockchain want to be in north dakota because of its reliable and affordable power supplies the climate and the state having the right policies he said north dakota has a solution for energy policies that no state in the nation has he said we are the first state in the nation that has primacy away from the epa u s environmental protection agency north dakota has a combination of cold dry weather and cheap electricity costs that attract data center operators to the state two montana companies have a 1 9 billion data center planned near williston north dakota and another company is building one in grand forks burgum said another company is thinking about using power from the garrison dam as a carbon free source of power for a data center it is happening here because in north dakota unlike the federal government we believe that innovation is the solution to the problems not regulation he said regulation is backward looking regulation adds costs to companies like applied

other currencies advertisement cryptocurrencies are stored in virtual wallets such as klever or coinbase multi cryptocurrency wallets cryptocurrency can be purchased and sold on exchanges and each cryptocurrency system is separate and not interchangeable other than through these exchanges cryptocurrency transactions are recorded and kept through a ledger called blockchain each block is

in the european union to really talk about afrezza the potential of afrezza as well as the pediatric trial and the studies that we re doing and i walked back invigorated on opportunities on how we can continue to advance the science within diabetes we ve also had several fda interactions on afrezza in the pipeline trying to think about the label change as well as preparing to go to advance clofazimine into phase 2 and we also had advisory board with roughly 10 of the top thought leaders in nontuberculous mycobacteria for the first time where we could really assess how we think about ntm how we re positioning clofazimine and to confirm our strategic direction relative to where we re going in our clinical trial before we go to the fda so within the ut collaboration here on the slide our pdufa date is may of 2022 we eagerly await for the fda to give us notification on actually ut we are focused on preparing to support the expected commercial launch of ut in june on the pipeline our sad trial is almost complete i ll describe that in a second we expect full results from the mad section in q3 on mnkd 201 and mnkd 501 both of these are progressing nicely we re in doing animal inhalation studies and really looking at the levels as well as the bleomycin induced lung models here in q2 and q3 on the afrezza side we had 9 8 million of revenue for the quarter 21 growth year over year our afrezza pediatric trial site certification continued to increase each month and were on track for our patient goals for 2022 we also kicked off the afrezza basal combination study which i ll show you some progress on that very shortly and finished a quarter with 233 million in cash on a tyvaso dpi update we are deferring the unitor on any questions related to indications fda approval timelines any questions on the label that will all go through unitor they are handling the day to day communications with the fda we do look at the decision and we are excited to continue to focus on what we can control which is manufacturing commercial products for launch in q2 as well building out the plant expansion to support the additional readouts that ut expects for copd and ipf on mnkd 101 which is our clofazimine product we have completed part a yesterday thank god so we have done cohorts a 1a2 and a3 leave out those patients up to 90 milligrams which is the highest dose we thought we should go and we ve so far have seen great tolerability with no safety signals we ll now wait for the full data set to be analyzed along with pk and pd and assess the proper doses here for part b well now on the low end we ll go to 30 milligrams which we think is more than enough to overcome any mics and we are debating whether to go to 90 or 60 based on the data coming out of part a we think we can go to 90 and it would probably make sense to go to 90 just to have the max tolerated dose top lines are expected here in q3 from the mad part obviously in part a we know the safety and tolerability of clofazimine looks very strong in the nebulized formulation i m now going to bridge a little bit over to the afrezza because we haven t spent a lot of time on afrezza last few earnings calls but i thought we should share with you some of the activities we re doing and what s changed over the last few months starting in february we had a refocused effort and that effort is starting to show early signs of impact on driving nrx ultra acting share so on the left side you can see here this is our patient funnel we look at all patients coming into afrezza assist which is our reimbursement hub as well as our cash program as well as our free goods program which takes out a lot of the costs that used to exist in our old program and you can see on average we re at about 187 patients a week now involved in one of these three programs up from 122 so these are patients that don t necessarily show up in the symphony if they are free goods or cash pay but this is activity that s showing continued growth and momentum of the diabetes franchise when we look on the right side we started refocusing our efforts on ultra acting share which is defined as and afrezza and we ve had a multi year decline in share and this year we changed our field incentive comp as well as our target list to really focus on moving market share back in the right direction we had our first sales meeting in person in the last three years due to covid and that meeting happened and you can see early on nrxs which is where you ll see that progress we ve gained almost 1 market share through april since january with this new focus we ll continue to watch this closely this is one of our key metrics for 2022 and we re excited about what that can bring on inhale 1 this is our pediatric trial we now have 18 sites confirmed these are high quality us investigators from leading academic centers as well as some of the top private practice doctors we met with our colleagues in europe and there was some interest in a couple countries such as germany israel and italy to add a pediatric site in those countries to get experience for those investigators who have a strong desire to learn more about inhaled insulin as we think about filing in europe sometime down the road what you can see here on the u s only focused so far is we are meeting and exceeding our target enrollment and we the randomization there s a delay of a couple weeks between time we get enrolled in the time they actually randomize so it s not that we ve lost 16 or 17 patients in these numbers there s just a delay from the time they actually enter the trial to the time they re actually randomized i think only one randomization failure has happened so far but otherwise this trial is on track to continue to hit our goals for this year the next trial i want to talk about which again we haven t given much focus on we ve referred this previously as the pump switch trial if you look up on clinicaltrials gov it s called the afrezza with basal combination study and one of the things we ve realized about afrezza is a lot of people enjoy their insulin pumps that have type 1 diabetes and a lot of them when we get questions about our script refill trends it turns out a good proportion of type 1 used afrezza for special occasions or their mealtime on top of their pump and so we have no clinical data in showing what afrezza plus an aid pump looks like in greater than one dose for some of the trials were done years ago we also have zero data on switching a patient often insulin pump so we can show people safely how to switch from their insulin pump to afrezza tresiba and show that they can have hopefully equal or better glucose control and quality of life this is the first time in history that we can see that there s a pump switch from a pump over to afrezza and we also decided to maintain a control group so we can see what happens if we take people on a pump and continue them on the pump for the duration of the 12 weeks so we ll really be able to compare in this pilot study staying on your pump adding afrezza to your pump only for your mealtime using the pump just for your basil and or switching off calling a detached lifestyle over to afrezza plus tresiba and the reason this is important as we do see an opportunity in the future where we see once weekly basils coming that s a very compelling proposition for patients as well as oral basil potentially watching what do later this year with their readout and type 2s so i want to understand how best to use afrezza in different combinations this trial s primary output is no difference in a1c between the three treatment options the good news is pretty much by the end of this month this trial will be fully enrolled and we should have the results here in late q3 early q4 i think when you look at clinical trials the excitement around enrollment tells you the excitement around the trial and the fact is this trial enrolled literally in 60 days these 25 patients so we re very excited about it its two sites very focused effort here and we we ll await these results very shortly in the next quarter or two now i m going to turn it over to our cfo steve binder steven binder thanks mike and good afternoon please to review select first quarter financial results please supplement this call by reading the condensed consolidated financial statements and mdna contains our 10 q which is being filed with the sec this afternoon let s start by looking at revenues for first quarter of 2022 afrezza net revenue was 9 8 million versus 8 1 million in 2021 a growth rate of 21 the increase was driven by wholesaler inventory ordering patterns during the first quarter of 2021 which were adversely impacted as wholesalers decreased inventory levels plus price including a more favorable growth to net deduction of 38 7 and underlying trx growth moving to collaboration services revenue for the first quarter was 2 2 million versus 9 3 million for 2021 the revenue in the first quarter was mainly associated with united therapeutics specifically the next gen r a efforts clinical supplies for patients in the brief study extension and some pass through expenses we did not have and did not expect to have revenue from our commercial supply agreement with united therapeutics in the first quarter we expect to start recognizing revenue associated with the ut commercial supply agreement in the second quarter revenue associated with the manufacturing activity in the first quarter of 2022 was deferred on the balance sheet in the amount of 7 4 million which i will discuss in greater detail in a few minute from a cash standpoint we were able to invoice and collect from united therapeutics for these manufacturing activities the graph on our next slide shows the quarterly of afrezza gross margin trend from the first quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022 our gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 was a record 77 which in fact increasing afrezza net revenue and lower cost of goods mainly related to the absorption of indirect and overhead costs at our factory where we now produce two products we expect the gross margin for afrezza to be at least 70 for the full year 2022 but it can fluctuate quarter to quarter based on manufacturing activity and spend across both products the next slide is similar to one that i showed last quarter and that we have been deferring the revenue associated with our tyvaso dpi manufacturing activities since the second quarter of 2021 and will not be able to recognize this revenue until we sell product to ut which we expect in the second quarter of 2022 for the first quarter of 2022 we have 7 4 million in manufacturing expenses recognized in our p l without a corresponding revenue offset since the second quarter of 2021 the amount of manufacturing expenses recognized in our p l without a corresponding revenue offset totaled 21 million which sits on our balance sheet as of march 31 2022 deferred revenue will be recognized over the manufacturing services agreement life which currently runs to 2031 united therapeutics is funding this cost as we ve been invoicing and collecting from ut now that we have looked at afrezza and collaboration services separately let s look at the gross profit and gross margin for both side by side please note that collaborations and services is mostly associated with our agreements with ut afrezza gross margin increased from 47 in the first quarter of 2021 to 77 in the first quarter of 2022 we discussed earlier and the gross profit associated with afrezza increased almost 100 to a record 7 5 million the collaboration services was loss for the first quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the revenue deferral i just spoke about we expect this to term positive once revenue is allowed to be recognized when we start selling product to ut let me conclude with some final comments having done our convertible debt and sale lease back financings in 2021 before the capital market downturn this year we are in a strong financial position to fund our growth with a cash and investments balance of 233 million as of march 31st in addition with rising interest rates which are likely to continue for some time we are well positioned with minimized interest rate risk the vast majority of our debt which includes the convertible mann debts are at a fixed rate of 2 5 also anticipating a rising interest rate environment we negotiated an interest rate ceiling for our floating rate debt with midcap about a year ago with a maximum exposure of only 1 over the current rate operationally we are showing continued progress in turning afrezza into a money making brand and we are preparing to support the expected commercial launch of tyvaso dpi as the fda action date approaches thank you now i turn back over to mike for some additional comments michael castagna you re saying the money making brand was a great comment steve steven binder all right michael castagna thank you everyone so talking about the pipeline here so we remain very excited about the pipeline we talked about afrezza and tyvaso dpi and clofazimine the next couple things we ll start to hear about over the coming quarters will imatinib going forward and the outcome of bleomycin model as well as dna alpha and thirona these programs take a little more time in the beginning and then once we get them through and get the cmc part working these programs progress quite rapidly in the coming years additionally on the cannabinoid side receptor life sciences received fd â and ind for the fda to progress their development and we continue to keep in touch with fosun around their small molecule inhibitor and how that s progressing in development we ll continue to look for more collaborations on our technology platform as we continue move forward post the next fda action date with tyvaso when we look at our milestones for 2022 we clearly lay out every year and you can see so far we re on track to meet and most of these milestones exceed them we obviously did not hit the first one which we think was very important on the tyvaso dpi pdufa date that s been extended to may and we remain optimistic about that date and our ability to hopefully get tyvaso to patients here in q2 so one i think important thing when we come to you on our next earning call will be two additional sources of revenue as related to out back in q4 earning s call on tyvaso manufacturing and tyvaso royalties the bars of revenue growth for mannkind continue to grow and we look very look â look out very forward about the exciting opportunities we have to exponential grow revenue over the coming years between afrezza collaboration services business development as well as manufacturing and royalties we re going to stop there and open it up for questions question and answer session operator thank you your first question comes from the line of brandon folkes from cantor fitzgerald your line is open brandon folkes hi thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on another good quarter brandon folkes obviously confident on the tyvaso dpi approval but how should we think about optic spending just in the case where tyvaso dpi does not get approved this month perhaps pushed off a little bit just any color in of how we should think about maybe some levers in your current opex spend that may come down and then secondly maybe just on afrezza can you just elaborate and apologize if i missed this but where was wholesaler inventory at the end of this quarter thank you michael castagna okay i think the first one i would say and steve correct me afrezza and tyvaso even there was a delay that s mostly picked â this is all picked up by ut and that s why i see some of the deferred revenue on our p l so that doesn t impact our particular cash burn or anything around mannkind and also inventory steve steven binder yes inventory remained constant between december of 2021 and march of 2022 so it wasn t much of a wholesaler inventory channel change brandon folkes great thanks and one more if i may obviously just with that very strong cash balance you have how do you think about maybe bringing in licensing a few more pipeline products obviously you pull through pretty robust pipeline but i guess do you have the capacity maybe asked in different way to bring in additional products just given valuations for in licensing maybe coming down thank you michael castagna yes brandon i think m a is going to be something we continue to evaluate as a company we ve had a lot of inbound interest on looking at different opportunities so far in 2022 obviously a lot of companies i think there is about 170 companies trading for less than cash value so there s opportunities in that space there s also opportunities for companies continuing to streamline their â the products that they re going to focus on and then there s plenty of pipeline opportunities to go but i think on the pipeline we feel pretty good about the shots on goal that we have in progressing those on the ability to find additional cash generating assets i think is where our focus is because we think we can continue to harmonize the g a expense and the p l that we have as well as the infrastructure we ve built up so i think we ll continue to watch out for those as valuations have become more normal in the last couple of years things were just ridiculous but i do think things are finally coming in a good range that we re sitting in a good spot as a company to continue to look at these things brandon folkes thanks that s very helpful i appreciate it congrats again michael castagna thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gregory renza from rbc capital markets your line is open gregory renza hey good afternoon michael and steve congratulations on the progress and thanks for taking my question maybe just building on the previous question with respect to tyvaso dpi decision coming up and maybe just around scenario planning i think you answered the question just around opex i m just curious how various scenarios playing out whether of course it s approval but as mentioned delay or otherwise how you think about the potential permutations of your strategy that you earlier mentioned of business development are there accelerants that we would see or other things to contemplate with respect to that that decision coming with tyvaso coming up thank you michael castagna hey greg i don t want to comment too much i think we re literally within weeks of the fda decision i think we just got to wait for that to come through and i think that ll bring a lot of clarity around the anxiety i hear from our shareholders what does this mean from indication what does this mean from the platform what does this mean from mannkind and like i said i think our focus is making sure we have product supply available upon launch and approval and i think that s what we want to make sure we re ready for ut but i want to really defer a lot of tyvaso related questions for us we have enough cash we show out the balance sheet last year even if there was another delay it doesn t fundamentally change how mannkind s operating we look at this as all upside to the current operating plan that we have and that s some of the decisions we made last year around the sale lease back and the convertible debt was so that we can fund our pipeline and fund our growth and not be fully dependent on the unit the decisions and the fda some of the interactions there but obviously want this we think it s important to get the patients we re excited to partner with ut they ve been an incredible partner and we want to get this to patients as soon as possible we want to make sure we can supply and be there and so hopefully that gives you some clarity but i think if things are delayed it doesn t shift anything we do that much we still want to go up inventory we still want to be ready day one of launch and we re focused on our pipeline and our platform equally as much right now gregory renza great that s really helpful appreciate all the color and looking forward to the update operator your next question comes from the line of thomas smith from svb securities your line is open thomas smith hey guys good afternoon thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress just on tyvaso dpi i understand ut is handling all the fda communications directly but i was wondering if you could comment on whether there s been any other requests where you ve had to provide data to the agency since the last submission i think it was back in february that led to the major amendments michael castagna i would thomas i don t want to speak on behalf of ut they re the ones having face to face request i â from my knowledge and perspective i don t think there s been anything major that s come in since the initial request but i d have to refer to ut to answer that properly thomas smith okay okay michael castagna coming out prior to mannkind i can tell you that thomas smith okay that s helpful and then just on the tyvaso dpi commercial manufacturing preparations could you just give us an update on where you are in terms of scale up activities has there been any changes to your plans or your forecast on manufacturing here over the last couple of months as we get closer to the anticipated launch later this year michael castagna no i think the only thing we continue to try to do is we re purposed a lot of equipment over the years that we had and we want to make sure that equipment s operating optimally how we increase yield how do we increase product loss in the process so i think we re just trying to continue to improve everything that this team has set out to do and honestly a lot of it s been operator training and so they are more proficient they make a lot of clinical batches they made some practice runs they obviously go through validation so i think that s helping all the new employees gain a lot of experience with our process and our equipment and that s probably the biggest thing we can be doing is just continue to build proficiency because the operation is going to be running 24x7 for the foreseeable future so i think that s number one is making sure we re keeping our talent weâ re training our talent and we re getting them proficient in how to operate it s a very multiple step process with different teams involved so i think just getting each of those teams on a 24x7 basis operating running equipment properly is really important thomas smith okay got it and then just one last one maybe on the afrezza pediatric study can you just remind us how many sites you re ultimately targeting and then as you think about expanding your sites here into europe how are you thinking about the balance the regional enrollment between the u s versus ex u s sites michael castagna yes i think on the sites we ve gone back and forth but somewhere between 25 and 40 is â i think 40 is probably the max you would go to weâ ve got a couple investigators who have seven patients eight patients and growing so i think it s just a matter if we had 25 sites each getting 10 patients we will be done in the next nine months excuse me in terms of enrollment so i just think it s how are we enrolling how are we tracking and it takes time to get a lot of these academic centers up and running from a contractual basis so several great sites like in boston stanford these guys are just coming on board right now so we haven t even really started a lot of the academic centers so i think letâ s see how they re progressing i think in europe we don t have a target number i think it was more nice to hear some thought leaders that are really podium type presenters want to be involved in the trial and so we re looking to see we weren t trying to go to europe but it doesn t hurt us to have a few sites in europe collect some patients there and i think in that market medtronic 7ag was all the hype at attd and thinking about an alternative opportunity to those patients who aren t on pumps is a real market opportunity in new york that we got to look at and i think some of these countries have decent reimbursement and many of them don t have decent reimbursement so i think it s just trying to understand what is the value proposition of afrezza for example can you justify the cost of insulin pump or avoidance of a pump and that cost is equal to afrezza versus mdi injection so i think really understanding our pump switch trial that we re doing how that s going to show outcomes and efficacy as well as the efficacy we get in peds will start to drive some of the the strategy for ex u s but ultimately just getting peds done and getting good results will be important and but we think probably 25 to 35 sites is going to get us there thomas smith got it that makes sense all right guys thanks for taking the questions appreciate it michael castagna thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bert hazlett from btig your line is open bert hazlett yes thanks congrats on all the progress and my apologies if some of this has been touched upon but i came on late but just with regard to afrezza and the focus on the ultra acting share nice to hear everybody has been able to get back together with salesforce meetings is there any contemplation of potential salesforce expansion should this gain traction down the road or is that something that maybe really not under contemplation you re really trying to find out more about what strategies are working or what could work at this point michael castagna i think bert like we will always â if we see ways to grow the company faster we now have the capital to deploy so if alejandro and ben and our team leading efforts over there we can start to show some consistent week over week and month over month growth trends and marketing programs are starting to work i think we have a good plan for ada and aace so we have some good conferences this year some good podium presentations so again if the noise is positive we re seeing the momentum we re happy to fuel that fire to make it grow faster we re not looking to spend more than we are in a meaningful way until we start to see some additional progress but we are willing to in the event we do see that continue bert hazlett okay great and then just with regard to tyvaso dpi maybe you touched on it but apologies if you have have you talked about expectations for the label of this and then could you just comment on potential competitive landscape as you think about dpi rolling out again obviously you are with a great partner but love to hear your thoughts on competitive positioning of the molecule or the program thanks michael castagna yes i think bert i m not going to comment on the label i think ut had their earnings call yesterday they were pretty silent about that so i m going to defer to them on any comments on that question and i think on the competitive landscape again i know there s some patent wars between ut and liquidia i m going to defer ultimately to the experts over there on those questions so i don t want to â too much comment only because we re so close to the pdufa date let s get that date across the finish line and then happy to talk further around those things bert hazlett okay head to try though thank you michael castagna if you did it will be bert so thank you thank you bert operator your next question comes from the line of steven lichtman from oppenheimer your line is open unidentified analyst hey this is david on for steve thanks for taking the questions just one for me regarding what s your latest outlook on sort of the macro landscape are you seeing any supply disruptions or inflationary pressures and if so how does that impact your gross margin outlook for the rest of the year thank you michael castagna yes i think overall the company we had to give slightly higher raises than historical we know some of our suppliers are going up a little bit but i ll let steve comment but obviously inflation is impacting everybody but fortunately a lot of our operations are fixed costs and a little bit of variable but steve steven binder yes and a lot of our large supply agreements we had locked in for a period of time some of them will expire during the year and we ll have to renegotiate them so i don t expect right now a huge increase but there is definitely a slight increase over the previous year but we re pretty well locked in for period of time michael castagna and if you think about on the flip side the euro and the dollar has gone in our favor and we have this large insulin supply commitment so that s actually coming down from a cost perspective nicely so fortunately it probably balances each other out but we re not seeing any major supply disruptions we ve bought lot of safety stock where we can see risk and there s things here that pop up but we want to make sure a 2 pump or hose doesn t cause us to have a delay so the biggest impact honestly has been our bluhale device that we ve been working on the chips are going out of stock and there s free manufacturing we got to redo the mother board other boards that s been probably the biggest headache but again that s not impacting afrezza or tyvaso these are launch opportunities enhancements to accelerate growth but they re not on the critical timeline yet but those are probably little things that annoy us unidentified analyst okay great appreciate the color guys steven binder okay thank you dave michael castagna thank you steve operator and there are no other question at this time let me turn the call back to mr michael castagna ceo for closing remarks michael castagna i just want to say thank you to everyone for listening today i know it s a turbulent time and we re on a tremendous amount of stress to continue to perform and fortunately we re coming out of covid but we re entering into an inflationary period with a volatile stock market mannkind is in a really good position to whether the storm we weathered worse over the last five years and we feel very optimistic about the position we re in as well as the opportunity to continue to grow the company on behalf of shareholders and help patients so i just want to say thank you to everyone for all the work and really looking forward to executing the rest of this year and hopefully having a great 2022 thanks again and we ll look forward to â i think we have a couple of investor conferences coming up in the month of may so you ll be hearing about those very shortly operator this concludes todayâ s conference call thank you all for participating you may now disconnect

at the start of 2022 it often seemed as if nothing could bring the world together but russia has now managed to change that the country s brutal attack on ukraine is condemned across the board it is uniting people left and right and across national borders that unity is good the time for talk is long past and effective action is necessary meaningful dialogue as we strived for before is not an option for russia which is so blatantly violating international law which is using military force against an independent sovereign nation as ukraine and which is responsible for atrocities for the suffering we see taking place in ukraine every day nato secretary general jens stoltenberg told reporters the action so far has been in sanctions imposed by countries across europe and across the atlantic russian oil and gas are now off limits as is most trade there are more steps ahead at nato and the european union and at the state department the pentagon and allied ministries blueprints are being drawn up to enshrine new policies across virtually every aspect of the west s posture toward moscow from defense and finance to trade and international diplomacy the washington post writes but while the sanctions are starting to bring down the russian economy and hopefully grinding its war machine to a halt one european company disagrees with the policy we don t think sanctions on imports will be appropriate guillaume faury chief executive officer of airbus told reporters this will be a small impact on russia and would have large consequences on the rest of the countries and the industry so we think the no sanction policy actually is the most meaningful one airbus a major weapons producer has an agenda here it imports about half of the titanium it uses from russia it needs titanium to build its planes titanium pairs well with modern carbon frames and wants to secure its russian supply in other words airbus is focused on kissing up to russia and staying on putin s good side in order to maintain its access to russian titanium even though that means turning a blind eye toward the deaths of thousands of innocent ukrainians bloomberg notes the policy is working to date airbus a major customer of russia s vsmpo avisma corp has so far been able to keep importing which hasn t been directly targeted by a growing list of european union sanctions aimed at punishing president putin that is a major mistake weapons manufacturers should follow national policy not make it for the governments they work for by weakening sanctions airbus endangers the entire sanction regime while at the same time trying to grow business with the pentagon by proposing to sell tanker refueling jets to the air force airbus is not the only european company flouting sanctions the christian science monitor reported on may 2 the giant french owned auchan hypermarket has bursting shelves and full stocks of almost everything from toilet paper to fresh meats and vegetables citrus fruits and bananas to a wide range of domestic cheeses and dairy products several american fast food chains such as burger king and subway are still operating in some locations in russia while the heads of those companies wisely closed up shop in russia some franchise owners have kept individual restaurants open internationally the sanctions on are working russia s annual inflation rate is almost double what the united states is encountering economics columnist sebastian mallaby wrote in the washington post in battle you take casualties to inflict larger casualties on the other guy economic warfare is no different he is calling for more and deeper sanctions even as some companies want them removed these companies are on the wrong side of history american policymakers should be taking steps to limit their use of its products and should instead focus on winning the sanctions battle against russia

global markets were plunged into chaos last night after central banks ramped up their fight against inflation on a bleak day for the economy the bank of england raised interest rates to a 13 year high while warning inflation will top 10 per cent plunging britain into recession the grim analysis came just a day after the federal reserve raised rates in the us by the most in 22 years in an attempt to get a grip on rising prices the pound plunged more than 2 per cent to a low of 1 2326 a level not seen for nearly two years as officials on threadneedle street sketched out a gloomy forecast of soaring inflation and stalling growth the ftse 100 index gave up most of its gains yesterday afternoon as the bad news sunk in and was trading down 0 5 per cent or 38 7 points early this morning at 7 464 6 wall street in new york stock markets tumbled with more than 1 000 points was wiped off the dow jones industrial average as it fell 3 1 and in new york stock markets tumbled yesterday with more than 1 000 points was wiped off the dow jones industrial average as it fell 3 1 per cent the tech heavy nasdaq index sank by 5 per cent while the s p 500 index of america s top companies slid by 3 6 per cent it was one of the worst days for us stocks since the covid crash of 2020 investors feared a string of rate hikes were on the way despite attempts by the fed on wednesday to downplay its aggressiveness central banks around the world are attempting to push inflation down by raising rates encouraging saving rather than spending but if they hike rates too fast they risk depressing the covid recovery and even tipping economies back into recession this is a worry for high growth companies such as amazon facebook owner meta and netflix as much of their valuation is based on the belief that they will rake in money over the future this could be under threat if the economy slumps and spending falls or if interest rates are higher making borrowing more expensive david madden an analyst at equiti capital said investors were in for a choppy period he added it seems that fears about lower growth in the us are still in circulation despite the fed not acting excessively hawkish investors were relatively sanguine about the fed s 0 5 percentage point rate hike on wednesday evening but this was flipped yesterday as traders digested the dreary economic outlook randy frederick of the schwab center for financial research in the us said the extreme reversal in sentiment was truly extraordinary meta dropped by 7 per cent amazon by 7 6 per cent microsoft by 4 4 per cent and google parent alphabet by 4 7 per cent three bank of england economists vote for a bigger rate hike despite the looming threat of a recession three members of the bank of england s monetary policy committee voted for an even bigger interest rate hike jonathan haskel catherine mann and michael saunders all argued rates should rise from 0 75 per cent to 1 25 per cent they were outvoted by their six colleagues on the mpc including governor andrew bailey who settled on a hike to 1pc bailey said the bank was toeing a narrow line between trying to curb rampant inflation and supporting the economy while rate hikes should help to keep a lid on prices they also run the risk of throwing the covid recovery into reverse as businesses and households face higher borrowing costs the bank itself is forecasting a slump in economic activity from the end of this year as rising prices dampen spending in the uk sterling tanked as investors sold the currency worried that its value would be eroded by rising inflation and an economic slump gloomy forecasts from the bank of england predicted inflation would soar to 10 25 per cent in the fourth quarter its highest level since 1982 in response

new york after breathing a sigh of relief when the federal reserve held off on signaling more aggressive measures ahead to fight inflation wall street tumbled on thursday amid renewed anxiety over rising interest rates while the pound slumped on fears of a uk recession the sell off was new york s worst since 2020 and saw the nasdaq dominated by tech firms that are particularly sensitive to higher rates lose five per cent while the dow and s p 500 fell more than three per cent with us inflation at levels not seen since the 1980s the fed on wednesday hiked the key lending rates by half a per centage point but cheered markets at least at first by saying a three quarter point increase was not in the cards that message was not as hawkish as feared but the fed still is engaged in one of the most aggressive tightening cycles that we have seen in decades said angelo kourkafas investment strategist at edward jones it didn t necessarily change the narrative that economic growth is slowing while the fed will tighten monetary policy at a fast pace pound slips in britain the pound suffered after the bank of england released an updated forecast predicting annual inflation would rise above 10 per cent and the economy would contract later this year while hiking its main rate by an as expected quarter point the pound plunged more than two per cent due to the changes in the economic forecasts which pointed to a potential recession by year end and the warnings that rates may not rise as high as markets had been expecting in the months ahead said market analyst michael hewson at cmc markets uk the boe said uk output was expected to contract in the final quarter of the year when inflation is likely to enter double digits as household energy prices rise sharply although the central bank does not forecast a full blown recession for the moment uncertainty over inflation and growth puts rate setters in a tricky dilemma city index analyst fawad razaqzada said the key risk facing the uk is not necessarily tighter policy but uncertainty over monetary policy and more to the point stagflation central banks worldwide are raising interest rates to fight inflation that is sitting at the highest levels in decades as economies ease pandemic restrictions while dealing with the war in ukraine which increased already high energy costs news that turkish inflation soared to 70 per cent in april highlighted the battle policymakers face in controlling prices

listen to this article listen to this article washington ap the federal reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark short term interest rate by a half percentage point wednesday its most aggressive move since 2000 and signaling further large rate hikes to come the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago the fed also announced that it will start reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which consists mainly of treasury and mortgage bonds those holdings more than doubled after the pandemic recession hit as the fed bought trillions in bonds to try to hold down long term borrowing rates reducing the fed s holdings will have the effect of further raising loan costs throughout the economy all told the fed s credit tightening will likely mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses over time including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans speaking at a news conference wednesday chair jerome powell made clear that further large rate hikes are coming there is a broad sense on the committee he said referring to the fed that additional half point increases should be on the table in the next couple of meetings but powell also sought to downplay any speculation that the fed might be considering a rate hike as high as three quarters of a percentage point a 75 basis point hike is not something that the committee is actively considering he said a remark that appeared to cause stock indexes to rise with prices for food energy and consumer goods accelerating the fed s goal is to cool spending and economic growth by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow the central bank hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow spending enough to tame inflation yet not so much as to cause a recession it will be a delicate balancing act the fed has endured widespread criticism that it was too slow to start tightening credit and many economists are skeptical that it can avoid causing a recession at his news conference powell stressed his belief that restoring price stability that is curbing high inflation is essential to sustaining the economy s health in their statement wednesday the central bank s policymakers noted that russia s invasion of ukraine is worsening inflation pressures by raising oil and food prices it added that covid related lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions which could further boost inflation inflation according to the fed s preferred gauge reached 6 6 last month the highest point in four decades inflation has been accelerated by a combination of robust consumer spending chronic supply bottlenecks and sharply higher gas and food prices exacerbated by russia s war against ukraine starting june 1 the fed said it would allow up to 48 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them a pace that would reach 95 billion by september at september s pace its balance sheet would shrink by about 1 trillion a year powell has said he wants to quickly raise the fed s rate to a level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth fed officials have suggested that they will reach that point which the fed says is about 2 4 by year s end the fed s credit tightening is already having some effect on the economy sales of existing homes sank 2 7 from february to march reflecting a surge in mortgage rates related in part to the fed s planned rate hikes the average rate on a 30 year mortgage has jumped 2 percentage points just since the start of the year to 5 1 yet by most measures the overall economy remains healthy this is especially true of the u s job market hiring is strong layoffs are few unemployment is near a five decade low and the number of job openings has reached a record high powell has pointed to the widespread availability of jobs as evidence that the labor market is tight to an unhealthy level that would tend to fuel inflation the fed char is betting that higher rates can reduce those openings which would presumably slow wage increases and ease inflationary pressures without triggering mass layoffs for now with hiring robust the economy has added at least 400 000 jobs for 11 straight months and employers grappling with labor shortages wages are rising at a roughly 5 annual pace those pay raises are driving steady consumer spending despite spiking prices in march consumers increased their spending 0 2 even after adjusting for inflation even if the fed s benchmark rate were to go as high as 2 5 by year s end powell said last month the policymakers may still tighten credit further to a level that would restrain growth if that turns out to be appropriate financial markets are pricing in a rate as high as 3 6 by mid 2023 which would be the highest in 15 years shrinking the fed s balance sheet will add another layer of uncertainty surrounding how much the fed s actions may weaken the economy

stocks fell thursday in response to looming fallout from the federal reserve s stepped up fight against inflation a sharp sell off left the dow jones industrial average more than 1 000 points lower thursday wiping out the gains from wall street s biggest rally in two years as worries grow that the higher interest rates the federal reserve is using in its fight against inflation will derail the economy the benchmark standard poor s 500 index fell 3 6 marking its biggest loss in nearly two years a day after it posted its biggest gain since may 2020 the nasdaq composite slumped 5 its worst

that misplaced exuberance said ben kirby co head of investments at thornburg investment management advertisement wall street s breakneck reversal reflects the degree of investors uncertainty and unease over the array of threats the economy is facing starting with inflation running at the highest level in four decades and how effective the federal reserve s bid to tame higher prices by jacking up interest rates will be on wednesday the fed raised its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point as part of an effort to slow consumer borrowing and tamp down inflation the market rallied when fed chair jerome h powell dismissed the possibility the fed could resort to a more aggressive three quarter point hike in the future now traders are starting to fret more about the effect of the fed s moves to damp demand and slow the economy the fed is between a rock and a hard place and because of instant information investors are experiencing both fear and greed at the exact same moment said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra the fed s aggressive shift to raise interest rates has investors worrying about whether it can pull off the delicate dance to slow the economy enough to halt high inflation but not so much as to cause a downturn the pace and size of interest rate increases are being scrutinized closely on wall street investors realized that by the fed continuing to take a very measured approach it could actually allow inflation to remain out of control stovall said advertisement business as inflation soars how is arizona iced tea still 99 cents tall cans of arizona iced tea have cost 99 cents since 1992 the family behind the company says it s committed to that price even as the prices of aluminum and corn syrup climb higher the fed s half point increase had been widely expected the central bank also announced that on june 1 it will start reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which consists mainly of treasury and mortgage bonds those large holdings are a policy tool the fed uses to keep long term interest rates such as those on mortgages low powell s assurance that a 0 75 point increase is not in the offing doesn t mean the fed is done raising rates as it fights to tame inflation economists at bnp paribas expect the fed to keep raising the federal funds rate until it reaches a range of 3 to 3 25 up from zero to 0 25
