six months twenty three lessons what the world has learned from russia s war in ukraine when it was first launched in the wee hours of february 24 the kremlin s full scale invasion of ukraine was supposed to last just a few days and end with the quick capture of kyiv fast forward six months those plans collapsed in spectacular fashion as ukraine beat back russian troops through a combination of sheer determination and plentiful western arms but despite ukraine s success the conflict is far from over on the contrary it appears to be settling into a long attritional battle that will test ukrainian and western resolve the conflict moreover has already transformed much of what the world thought it knew about not only military operations and strategy but also diplomacy intelligence national security energy security economic statecraft and much more so as the war hits its half year mark we asked experts across our vast network to share the biggest lessons they ve learned from the crisis the results an illuminating and wide ranging primer for policymakers and the public alike are below scroll and click through the carousel below to jump to a lesson lesson for western diplomacy don t second guess ukrainians since day one there s been too much reluctance in the biden administration to share real time intelligence with ukraine for fear that not everyone in the ukrainian government is trustworthy to send heavy weapons for fear that ukrainians don t know how to use them and that it would take too long to train ukrainians to send large enough assistance packages for fear of corruption there s also been an enormous reluctance to use the right language to describe the united states actual goal when defense secretary lloyd austin talked about defeating moscow so badly that it cannot attack ukraine again us president joe biden dressed him down yet time and again ukrainians have proven themselves worthy of america s trust and then some with western intelligence they were able to withstand the invasion of kyiv s hostomel airport which could have been decisive and eradicate scads of russian generals in addition to the russian navy s flagship the moskva with us weapons ukrainian soldiers pushed the russians out of kyiv and forced them to retreat to the donbas now with american long range rockets they ve hit dozens of high value targets the bottom line is obvious when ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy and his team say they need something the request is legitimate and the united states should honor it immediately melinda haring is the deputy director of the eurasia center return to top lesson for global diplomacy putin s regime can t be trusted and needs to be defeated six months of russia s genocidal war against ukraine as well as years of the kremlin s invasions of neighboring states and more recent hybrid warfare against the west have made it clear that any agreements with putin s regime are simply not viable and often counterproductive russia invaded ukraine in 2014 after having committed to be a guarantor of its sovereignty and territorial integrity under the budapest memorandum in its most recent assault the kremlin seized one fifth of ukraine s territories following years of negotiations over the conflict in ukraine within the normandy format and the minsk agreements moscow has been vocal about its disrespect for international law liberal institutions and all kinds of international treaties with partners and rivals alike by committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in ukraine violating the basic principle of freedom of navigation weaponizing food supplies and refugees and engaging in energy and nuclear blackmail putin s regime has posed existential threats not only to the future of the ukrainian nation but also to a rules based world order appeasement dialogue and compromises with an aggressor have never worked russia escalates when it senses weakness and withdraws when it senses strength if the world wants a sustainable peace in the region rather than a tactical pause in russian assaults the west must learn the language of power which is the only language putin understands yevgeniya gaber is a nonresident senior fellow at the atlantic council in turkey return to top lesson for us foreign policy the united states can no longer rely on strategic ambiguity when a state possesses substantially more power than its adversaries a policy of strategic ambiguity can spark reluctance among those adversaries to take actions that might provoke retaliation especially if the more powerful nation has a reputation for responding unpredictably or disproportionately but when a state s relative power is perceived to be in decline then a policy of strategic ambiguity can conversely inspire adventurism in an adversary especially if the declining power is seen to be withdrawing or otherwise appears weak or distracted the long era of strong american relative power allowed us policymakers the luxury of adopting policies that featured strategic ambiguity but those days have unfortunately passed as was demonstrated when russian president vladimir putin invaded ukraine undeterred by the intentionally ambiguous signals that the united states had sent during the preceding decades about the nature of its commitment to ukrainian sovereignty he was also encouraged by the perception of us weakness in the wake of the withdrawal from afghanistan and dysfunction in its domestic politics there is an important lesson here for us policymakers who might prefer to cling to strategic ambiguity when seeking to deter a chinese invasion of taiwan for instance or iranian aggression in the gulf today more explicit statements about us red lines are in order in the current environment such statements are likely to help prevent rather than provoke an escalation william f wechsler is senior director of the rafik hariri center and middle east programs at the atlantic council return to top lesson for us national security washington must contend with beijing moscow and tehran at the same time the biden administration came to office believing it could park relations with russia putting it on a stable and predictable footing while prioritizing competition with china as part of its national security policy but moscow had other ideas by launching the largest land war in europe since world war ii putin reminded washington how much its security and prosperity is tied to peace and stability in europe the biden administration was forced to return to the drawing board and rewrite its national security strategy which has still not been published more than one and a half years into biden s term because the first version gave short shrift to russia china should be a priority but the united states remains a global power with global interests its national security strategy must reflect that reality an effective approach must address the serious threats posed by china and north korea in the indo pacific iran in the middle east and russia in europe moreover these threats are interconnected with russia china and iran increasingly working together success in one of these theaters will strengthen not sap us power to deal with the others matthew kroenig is the acting director of the scowcroft center for strategy and security return to top lesson for military operations equipment doesn t win wars people do russia spent around 65 billion on defense in 2021 or more than ten times what ukraine did that year if equipment was the deciding factor russia would have achieved the overwhelming lightning fast victory it sought months ago but in this war ukraine has shown that good leadership and training of which it has plenty but russia has very little make all the difference since both countries share a long military tradition dating back to imperial russia the difference in their respective performances on the battlefield and the reasons why are instructive since 1993 ukraine has been part of the us national guard s state partnership program in which its armed forces have been trained according to the us model of giving mission type orders to junior officers and non commissioned officers ncos explaining the commander s intent and empowering them to make on the spot decisions based on the changing facts on the ground no one becomes an expert combat decision maker overnight so realistic exercises are held and a culture is fostered that encourages individual initiative and demands rigorous assessment this open and transparent way of operating has resulted in high morale and performance on the battlefield by contrast russia s armed forces which rely heavily on conscripts lack professional ncos and discourage initiative and feedback decision making authority remains heavily centralized with only senior officers permitted to act independently this is why so many russian generals have been killed in this war nobody at a lower level had the leadership experience big picture understanding or authority to act decisively when things didn t go as planned the russian way of war has been predictable battlefield failure and low morale colonel john buss barranco was the 2021 22 senior us marine corps fellow at the atlantic council s scowcroft center for strategy and security return to top lesson for military planning nimble modern weapons can defeat larger conventionally armed forces especially when on the defensive the united states has organized an effective arsenal of democracy to defend ukraine in the battle for kyiv russian tanks troop carriers supply trucks helicopters and fighter aircraft were demolished by small and mobile ukrainian defensive units armed with weapons such as stingers javelins nlaws and drones a platform heavy twentieth century russian force was defeated handily by a light twenty first century one in the battle for the donbas russia s twentieth century artillery greatly outnumbered ukraine s artillery until fairly small numbers of new american made highly mobility artillery rocket system himars were introduced their precision strike capability destroyed scores of russian ammunition dumps and headquarters among other units thereby slowing the russian advance and in the black sea russian naval vessels vastly outnumbered the remnants of the ukrainian navy until accurate ukrainian made neptune and american made harpoon missiles were introduced forcing the russian navy to retreat these were all essentially defensive situations for ukraine now ukraine will seek to regain as much of its occupied territory as possible but it will not be easy ukrainian forces will use many of these same precision strike systems to try to regain kherson and the donbas but they will also be advancing against strong russian defensive positions this worked well initially for american forces two decades ago when taking offensive action against iraqi insurgents and afghan insurgents but it remains to be seen whether ukrainian forces can pull off the same feat the outcome will determine whether putin can claim some degree of success in his ruthless adventure hans binnendijk is a distinguished fellow at the scowcroft center for strategy and security return to top lesson for deterrence troop deployments work better than threats of economic sanctions as russian troops assembled to invade ukraine early this year many defense analysts believed the threat of severe economic sanctions would be enough to deter a russian attack but for putin revanchist territorial aims outweighed any potential harm that might be done to the russian economy through western sanctions while great damage has been done to the russian consumer economy the ruble has strengthened and foreign reserves have increased due to high oil prices and shifting russian markets putin s judgment appears to have been correct at least in the short term nato leaders had made it clear that they would not commit troops to defend ukraine which led putin to miscalculate on two fronts underestimating ukrainians ability to defend themselves and the west s willingness to rapidly arm them so western defense officials have relearned a cold war era lesson what deters russian aggression is nato troops on the alliance s eastern flank not the threat of economic sanctions it s possible that if alliance troops had deployed to ukraine it could have deterred the invasion but they may have also started world war iii deploying troops forward on nato territory now will assure that putin does not miscalculate again the cornerstone of the recent nato summit was an effort to absorb and implement this lesson nato s deterrent posture is shifting from deterrence by punishment to deterrence by denial and allied forces are being positioned forward to deny russia s ability to occupy any bit of nato territory battalion sized nato battle groups have now been deployed to eight frontline allies and american forces in europe have increased to one hundred thousand many believe that even more needs to be done to assure deterrence by denial for example by deploying brigade or even division level nato forces to frontline allied countries hans binnendijk is a distinguished fellow at the scowcroft center for strategy and security return to top lesson for the global economy the new tools of conflict are economic and they are powerful when russia invaded ukraine president biden made clear that the united states would not directly intervene militarily but that didn t mean the united states and its allies were left without recourse instead the group of seven g7 nations decided to freeze approximately 350 billion in russian assets to put that in perspective it s roughly the size of austria s entire economy the move shocked russian president vladimir putin and his central bank putting enormous pressure on the russian economy it also turned heads around the world most countries hold some reserves in dollars and euros and now they re thinking hard about the risks to those assets in the event of a future crisis but since the united states japan the european union and the united kingdom are aligned countries don t see many alternatives for now china s renminbi is not yet a viable option as a true international currency so what s the takeaway going forward for the global economy the united states and the dollar are stronger with allies josh lipsky is the senior director of the geoeconomics center return to top lesson for economic statecraft don t separate sanctions from longer term foreign policy objectives in the run up to invasion great hope was placed on sanctions as the primary tool with which to deter russian aggression putin the widespread thinking held could not possibly want to ruin his economy for the sake of murdering ukrainians but rationality is a concept that can be perilously difficult to nail down and economic rationality was not a factor in putin s plans for ukraine sanctions as a deterrent were worth the effort but were ultimately not going to stop the invasion this lesson needs to remain front of mind during what is likely to be a long war the inability of the west to use sanctions to prevent war does not mean they are a useless gambit instead they should constitute a strategy for longer term goals any tactical advantages that accrue from sanctions should be considered positive externalities not an explicit end goal those policy goals should remain what biden discussed in late february that sanctions are meant to isolate putin and his regime so long as putinism remains the dominant form of rule in russia there is no going back to the pre war period in which many in the west clung to the idea that trade could integrate putin s kremlin into a rules based system only after putinism the primary driver of russia s external aggression is gone should the west use the leverage of lifting sanctions to allow for russia s economic reintegration brian o toole is a nonresident senior fellow at the geoeconomics center and worked at the us department of the treasury as a senior adviser to the director of the office of foreign assets control return to top lesson for economic statecraft sanctions work but they are messy and take time policy tools are generally imprecise when they work which is not always it is seldom in accord with the clean outcome or short timeline often promised in a us state department or national security council policy paper this is especially true with sanctions which can be intended to weaken an adversary over time these are the purposes of the current sanctions against russia which resemble the clumsy contentious and inconsistent economic measures imposed against the soviet union after its invasion of afghanistan in 1979 while these measures did not cause the ussr to collapse they made it harder for the soviet leadership to escape the consequences of the unreformed soviet economy s weakness they took away the western investment technology transfer and loans and credits that had propped up the soviet economy and masked the rot within the resulting economic trouble became obvious even to regime supporters by the early 1980s putin s decision to wage war on ukraine may bring similar results technology restrictions have hurt russian industrial production new financing and investment from the west is basically unavailable and one way or another russia s income from exports will decline time is not on ukraine s side which is why the country needs more military assistance or the sharp edge of policy but putin has chosen to wage a dirty war and make the west an enemy sanctions and other means of economic pressure may make his choice seem like folly in addition to evil daniel fried is a weiser family distinguished fellow at the atlantic council and a former us ambassador to poland return to top lesson for wartime strategic communications influence operations are a day in day out job despite the challenges it faces the ukrainian government successfully created and continues to implement a strategic communications plan to galvanize international support denigrate russia and inspire confidence in its ability to lead the country conducting this type of campaign isn t sexy it s a grind day in day out to share talking points with communicators identify audiences to persuade pull together data and then connect with journalists political figures and influencers who can further spread the government s message but the beauty of what the ukrainians have accomplished is that a vast network of people who follow the government s messaging lead and further spread the campaign in ways that their individual networks can understand thus building new advocates and reinforcing ukraine s base of support although president zelenskyy is the focal point of this campaign he s in no way the only person who has remained on message everyday people around the world not just ukrainians feel empowered to advocate for ukraine and disparage russia images that include the blue and yellow of the ukrainian flag sunflowers and children holding anti war signs are so widely established that social media posts that include these types of visuals no longer require any explanation in large part the ukrainian government uses firsthand accounts and video clips as evidence which further reinforces its message and crucially it has not resorted to large scale mis and disinformation as russia has overall the cohesion and duration of the ukrainians campaign can and should be used as a template for what the united states and its allies can accomplish with an influence strategy communications discipline and a willingness to grind day in day out to meet the end goal jennifer counter is a nonresident senior fellow at the scowcroft center s forward defense practice return to top lesson for hybrid warfare don t ignore the fundamentals by almost every measure vladimir putin s special military operation has been a strategic failure while still dangerous russia is arguably at its lowest point of soft influence in recent history with pushback coming from neutral nations and even ones dependent on russian energy russian war crimes have been laid bare for the world to see and repudiated by all but the kremlin s most stalwart allies nato resolve is stronger today than many could have ever imagined russia has lost its dominance of the narrative and is instead regularly trolled by ukraine which offers an alternate example of executive leadership in volodymyr zelenskyy every day that ukraine continues to resist albeit at horrific cost to its people amounts to an incremental humiliation to russia squarely countering its ever aspirational status as a great power much of the current condition has resulted from the kremlin ignoring the fundamentals of warfare including lessons openly observable from recent us forays in afghanistan iraq and elsewhere first and foremost has been the poor utilization of intelligence starting with russia choosing the more kinetic end of the spectrum instead of focusing on its more adept gray zone activities in doing so russia s intelligence apparatus miscalculated both the resolve and capability of ukraine as well as the level of support for ukraine from the international community this has contributed to staggering russian losses on the battlefield and horrors against the ukrainian people perpetrated by an unprofessional russian military there have also been similarly poor results in the function of sustainment the military term for keeping operations going until objectives are achieved hybrid warfare is akin to a scalpel not a knife in pursuing strategic effects and that level of precision requires robust awareness provided by a competent intelligence community that must be trusted to deliver bad news russia s authoritarian governance model is poorly suited to this similar shortcomings have resulted in poor control of the information domain russia s z and anti nazi campaigns have been easily countered by a competent ukraine that clearly knows its adversary and is able to effectively respond to its messaging through social media campaigns coupled with broader outreach to the global community in looking at russia s experience the united states and its allies should ensure that the fundamentals of waging hybrid warfare are not ignored arun iyer is a nonresident senior fellow at the scowcroft center for strategy and security s forward defense practice and served in a variety of operational and operational leadership assignments in the us department of defense from 2005 2020 return to top lesson for the energy sector decades of energy diplomacy can disappear with one brutal invasion efforts to draw russia into the democratic fold of its western neighbors through decades of economic integration and trillions of dollars of energy trade failed to prevent a brutal senseless war in ukraine as well as the kremlin s weaponization of energy supplies across europe as a result european energy systems are transforming in record time toward operating without russian oil and gas this unprecedented shift is neither cheap nor easy and will take years to achieve in countries hooked on russian energy and reliant on carbon intensive economies in the meantime skyrocketing energy costs mandated curtailments and general uncertainty around energy supplies this winter will fuel temptations to slide back into the yoke of russian energy dependence but the risks of returning to the status quo of energy diplomacy with russia monumentally outweigh any short term relief that the kremlin could offer through its supply blackmail that s because moscow s nationalization of the russian energy industry leaves little room for market based decisions while geopolitical priorities often aggressive ones take precedent supply shut offs and curtailment across europe have shattered russia s veneer of reliability while the country has doubled down on the unabated fossil fuel economy rather than investing in diversification regardless of the war s conclusion and potential leadership changes in russia the de russification of european energy sources is heading toward a point of no return the short term costs and challenges of this massive transformation cannot be underestimated but forging reliable resilient low carbon and affordable energy systems ones that can t be threatened or manipulated by monopolistic suppliers will benefit all of european society olga khakova is the deputy director for european energy security at the global energy center return to top lesson for global intelligence russia is not ten feet tall six months ago there was a plethora of doom and gloom analysis the notion that the russian military believed it could take kyiv in thirty six hours was reportedly shared not only by putin but also by western academic and intelligence community analysts almost everyone got this fantastically wrong except of course the one entity that mattered most the ukrainians who fought bravely and nearly unanimously believe they ll win a quick russian blitzkrieg turned into a morass that will go down in military history with 80 000 russian casualties and no end in sight to putin s special operation now we see that the russian military is a potemkin village corrupt unfit and fundamentally lacking in basic principles of logistics equally important russian hybrid warfare efforts in ukraine particularly in the information operations space have also fallen short previous efforts around the world such as moscow s meddling in the 2016 us presidential election had spooked many and perhaps for good reason but russia succeeded in the past mainly because it operated without pushback no longer ukraine now appears one step ahead at every turn consider the ukrainian defense ministry s expert trolling on twitter after a presumed strike by ukrainian forces on a russian airfield deep in occupied crimea it showed russian tourists fleeing the beach to the sound of the 1983 bananarama track cruel summer how times have changed ukraine trolling russia not vice versa this is exactly what was needed in the information operations sphere an offensive strategy that was proactive instead of reactive marc polymeropoulos is a nonresident senior fellow in the forward defense practice of the atlantic council s scowcroft center for strategy and security and worked for twenty six years at the central intelligence agency return to top lesson for would be invaders you can t hide preparations for a full scale invasion in the four months leading up to the invasion kremlin owned online outlets increasingly reported that ukraine was preparing to attack the eastern donbas region or even russia itself the dfrlab monitored these open sources on a daily basis to measure the frequency of this messaging in the pre invasion period russian online coverage of the narrative about an impending ukrainian attack rose dramatically with a nearly 50 percent increase in january 2022 over the previous month the narrative also became increasingly hostile accusing ukraine of planning a chemical attack in the donbas for example meanwhile footage from social media particularly telegram and tiktok documented ongoing russian troop movements and deployment along ukraine s border the spread of hostile kremlin narratives in those final months before the invasion were in sync with the spread of russian troops on the ground with russia essentially preparing domestic and international audiences for the invasion alongside actual military preparations through the combined open source intelligence analysis of russia s behavior both online and offline it became clear that putin s intentions were hiding in plain sight eto buziashvili is a georgia based research associate for the caucasus at the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab return to top lesson for cybersecurity the private sector should play a critical military operational role in cyberspace the information revolution has long been credited with changing key aspects of warfare network centric operations cyber offense and defense and online information operations are now established elements of military doctrine and operations but russia s invasion of ukraine has generated a new role for the private sector which is engaging in direct cyber combat against russian cyber attacks and in support of ukraine s military and governmental functions while ukraine has its own capable cyber defenders who for example stopped an attack against the ukrainian electric grid those efforts have been complemented by private sector firms that have worked with kyiv both by helping to identify and disable malware and by taking additional actions to create a much more defensible ukrainian cyberspace both microsoft and cisco have published reports detailing defensive cyber efforts and european cybersecurity firms such as the slovakian firm eset have also been engaged ukraine s cybersecurity defense has additionally been enhanced through the use of starlink terminals and the transfer of ukrainian governmental functions to cyber clouds outside ukraine the actions that these private companies have undertaken foreshadow the critical role such firms will play in future twenty first century conflicts going forward the united states nato and the democratic nations of the indo pacific need to organize appropriate planning and operational collaborative mechanisms with key elements of the private sector to assure effective operation of cyberspace in the event of armed conflict the united kingdom s national cyber security center and the more recent us joint cyber defense collaborative are a good start but those are not currently suited to the challenges of full scale combat maintaining the functioning of information technology in wartime particularly for critical infrastructures such as energy food water transportation and finance will be an indispensable requirement for nations as a whole as well as for effective military operations working in advance to assure the coordination of the intelligence and operational capabilities of the private sector with those of the government will be critical to the effective defense of cyberspace franklin d kramer is a distinguished fellow and board director of the atlantic council and has served as a senior political appointee in two administrations including as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs return to top lesson for us homeland security ignoring the home front is a serious mistake after an initial burst of activity culminating in late april and early may efforts by the us department of homeland security dhs to counter russia s hybrid war in the united states appear to have faded even amid a russian avalanche of disinformation as the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab has documented the last update to the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency s shields up webpage was dated may 11 and the most recent entry in cisa s russia cyber threat overview was dated april 20 the last russia specific public alert russian state sponsored and criminal cyber threats to critical infrastructure was revised may 9 while dhs and the fbi are in frequent communication with agencies companies and individuals targeted by russian cyberattacks the public is often unaware of this quiet but vital activity so more needs to be done by dhs and others to get the american people to understand and better resist the russian hybrid warfare campaigns that promote divisive propaganda and social media manipulation russia s hybrid warfare strategy which uses disinformation even more than cyberattacks seems designed to wear down western democracies opposition to russia s aggression senior dhs and administration officials should speak out more publicly on what americans can do to counter russian disinformation cyber threats and other russian hybrid warfare targeting of the civilian population the home front specifically unity in the united states and nato in opposing russian aggression against ukraine is a vital source of national power ignoring it or treating ukraine as almost entirely a military and diplomatic crisis could be a perilous mistake thomas s warrick is a nonresident senior fellow at the scowcroft center for strategy and security s forward defense practice return to top lesson for us assistance policy invest deeply in key resilient partners even as washington sends billions of dollars worth of arms to ukraine amid the ongoing war it should also be planning for long term security assistance to the country the goal must be to ensure ukraine s ability to deter future aggression and repel it if it comes this will be an enormous undertaking but like insurance the costs pale in comparison to those of another round of war president zelenskyy sees his country developing into a big israel and the model of us assistance to israel also applies here us partners who are on the front lines of competition with russia and china need capabilities from missile defenses and anti tank weapons to superior intelligence and counterintelligence that enable them to absorb and survive strikes by adversaries they also must have the ability to impose unacceptable costs on the aggressor in the post war era building a ukrainian air force missile corps and special forces that can defensively strike behind russian lines will be essential annual appropriations excess defense articles and prepositioned us stocks for emergency use are all tools that can be employed to this end supporting the growth of a domestic industry that develops and produces innovative ukrainian solutions to ukrainian vulnerabilities will also be key this approach reinforces a requirement that must accompany such assistance the willingness and ability of ukraine to defend itself on its own which is something its citizens have already demonstrated in spades this also means that in extremis us interoperability with a key partner will be assured daniel b shapiro is a distinguished fellow at the atlantic council s middle east programs and a former us ambassador to israel return to top lesson for nato the alliance is a uniquely valuable institution that requires enduring political and financial investment nato is a sometimes arcane institution where disagreement and drama are routine occurrences among a membership that will soon reach thirty two members accordingly the alliance can be an easy target for politicians seeking to score points domestically with the presidents of the united states and france having called into question nato s utility and purpose in the recent past but these critiques inevitably overlook the outsize role nato has played in enabling peace and prosperity in europe and beyond it s no coincidence that large scale war is again raging in europe within years of nato s most important members openly questioning whether it had outlived its usefulness putin read american and french disillusionment with nato as a lack of commitment to the alliance and an opportunity to permanently rupture transatlantic unity fortunately the habits of cooperation that the transatlantic community has developed over seven decades are not easily displaced and nato is once again showing its indispensability as a political and military actor it s a lesson that political leaders must absorb even after the resolution of russia s war in ukraine had nato not existed as the current crisis unfolded the breathtaking levels of cooperation currently on display among allies in support of ukraine and in strengthening deterrence in europe would not be possible rather than using nato as a punching bag leaders must expend the political and economic capital to keep the alliance healthy and adaptive christopher skaluba is the director of the scowcroft center s transatlantic security initiative return to top lesson for ukraine there s no way back for relations with russia since the collapse of the soviet union bilateral ties between post soviet ukraine and russia have been colored by centuries of imperial baggage while this complex relationship became particularly thorny after russia s seizure of crimea in 2014 a significant number of ukrainians continued to harbor positive attitudes toward russians while political parties advocating a thaw in bilateral ties remained popular in traditionally russophile regions of ukraine all this changed dramatically on february 24 the unprecedented devastation caused by the invasion has completely transformed ukrainian perceptions of russia particularly in formerly moscow friendly and now heavily bombarded parts of eastern ukraine the sheer scale of the violence which has included widespread war crimes has been a traumatic wake up call for the many ukrainians who still clung to notions of russia as a brotherly nation at the anecdotal level it is now routine to encounter ukrainians struggling to come to terms with russia s betrayal or expressing pure hatred toward the russian people as a whole many ukrainians are no longer able to engage with russian relatives while growing numbers are ditching the russian language and switching to ukrainian recent opinion polls reflect the profound nature of these changes with ukrainian backing for euro atlantic integration skyrocketing and support for closer ties with russia collapsing to record lows the war is far from over but it s already clear that the relationship between russians and ukrainians has been irrevocably damaged peter dickinson is the editor of ukrainealert return to top lesson for china today s ukraine is not tomorrow s taiwan chinese strategists believe the united states strategic ambiguity over taiwan is dead in all but name as demonstrated by biden s repeated gaffes about washington s willingness to defend the island through force and us house speaker nancy pelosi s recent visit there they believe that if a war breaks out in the taiwan strait washington will fight till the last taiwanese just as it has been seen as doing in ukraine against russia in a proxy war to contain beijing mobilizing its allies along the way to support the effort yet even while the west has been able to inflict painful punishment on russia s economy putin s war shows that sanctions are a double edged sword especially when it comes to china the world s second largest economy beijing has been keeping a close eye on european citizens who are shouldering record high inflation and surging electricity prices ahead of a potentially very cold winter chinese officials relentless push for economic liberalization serves as more than just a means of gaining from globalization it also acts as a signal to the west over china s core interests warning if i go down you re going with me from beijing s perspective political diplomatic and economic retaliation against pro independence actions in taiwan when coupled with the threat of a total military blockade and china s nuclear saber rattling can serve as a credible deterrent that puts the onus of escalation on the enemy in this case the united states therefore beijing will act under the assumption that in the event of a war in the taiwan strait time and momentum are on its side meaning that the price the chinese people are willing to pay for taiwan is significantly higher than that of western constituents tuvia gering is a nonresident fellow in the atlantic council s global china hub return to top lesson for middle east policymakers america will always do the right thing but only after exhausting all the alternatives while this adage is often attributed to winston churchill there s actually no record of him ever saying it nevertheless it has long resonated with washington s foreign partners and allies who have been repeatedly frustrated by the inconsistencies and inactions that have too often characterized us policies over the decades most recently leaders from the united arab emirates publicly expressed their disappointment that the biden administration didn t respond quickly enough when houthi rebels attacked the abu dhabi airport in january and similarly saudi leaders were aghast when the trump administration didn t respond after iran attacked the country s energy infrastructure in 2019 but the biden administration s strong and unwavering response to putin s invasion of ukraine has proven once again that the united state can indeed be relied upon especially when confronted by a globally resonant crisis on a scale that necessitates american leadership that lesson has not been lost on leaders in taipei or beijing and leaders in the middle east who are inclined to doubt american resolve should note that washington has taken powerful and economically painful actions to support ukrainian sovereignty even though no treaty committed the united states to this in advance just as there was no treaty that required the united states to come to kuwait s defense when saddam hussein invaded the country rather than demanding such commitments american partners in the region would be better advised to work with the biden administration to think through scenarios that might require a similar us response and to work together to build interdependent capabilities to deter them william f wechsler is senior director of the rafik hariri center and middle east programs at the atlantic council return to top lesson for germany and its allies seize this moment for a strategic reversal putin s war in ukraine was a rude awakening for decision makers in berlin and for average germans from hamburg to munich decades of divestment from both hard power and energy diversification plus the strategic detachment with which germany had pursued its global engagement came home to roost this left europe s largest economy exposed to energy blackmail by moscow and with few options to shore up nato as the cornerstone of its own defense or hold putin at arm s length by supporting kyiv with weapons lofty pronouncements by chancellor olaf scholz about boosting his country s defense capacity have in reality been tough to follow with actual action this is especially true for arms deliveries to ukraine or bundeswehr boots on the ground to strengthen nato s eastern flank on the energy front the jury is still out on whether a mix of government intervention conservation efforts the rapid deployment of liquid natural gas terminals and even a potential pause of germany s exit from nuclear power can help avert the worst for europe s economic engine berlin s credibility as a reliable nato and eu ally has taken a severe toll especially in eastern europe moving forward the transatlantic partners will need a more strategic germany politically economically and militarily as everyone prepares for a long term confrontation and competition with moscow and other autocrats the indisputable failure of cornerstones in german foreign defense and energy policies extends beyond berlin decision makers many of whom have long lamented in private their country s lack of global leadership the united states and european allies should seize on germany s existential crisis as an opportunity for a reset and engage german policymakers in concrete initiatives they should demand and support new german leadership in key areas such as nato s eastern defense europe s energy transition away from russia and new efforts on both sides of the atlantic to reduce economic and technology dependencies on any one actor the experience of the last six months and what is to come this winter can help germany develop a new leadership role that advances european and transatlantic objectives jörn fleck is

2 million for the six months ended june 30 2022 representing a decrease of rmb8 1 million or 17 4 compared with rmb46 3 million for the six months ended june 20 2021 the decrease was mainly due to the decreased income recognized from confirmed prc government grants of rmb17 8 million the decrease was partially offset by the increase in bank interest income of rmb9 7 million attributable to the increased bank and cash balances after our initial public offering research and development expenses were rmb258 5 million for the six months ended june 30 2022 representing an increase of rmb100 9 million or 64 0 compared with rmb157 6 million for the six months ended june 30 2021 the increase was primarily due to the increase in third party contracting fees as well as employee costs for our

rimini street inc nasdaq rmni a global provider of enterprise software products and services the leading third party support provider for oracle and sap software products and a salesforce partner today announced that the university of technology sydney uts has switched from oracle to rimini street for improved support and security of its oracle database and technology platforms in doing so the university has slashed wait times for support requests enjoyed improved service quality and innovative advanced security to protect its database and application middleware rimini street is also helping the university manage through the ongoing it skills shortage by reducing the amount of it labor required for support and instead allowing resources to focus on the rapid transition to hybrid learning uts is one of australia s leading universities with around 45 000 students and 4 000 staff the it department employs around 300 staff and is responsible for the digital experiences supporting the people processes and culture at the university the university faced challenges during the pandemic including a massive shift to online learning and remote work and a growing it skills shortage the large decline in the number of international students enrolling in australia has also seen it budgets shrink because of these limitations uts needed to refocus its strategic resources more efficiently uts like all universities in australia has had to rapidly transition to a hybrid learning model that includes classroom and online service delivery there are many innovations and technologies needed for the transition to hybrid learning budgets are tightening across the board and the quality of service delivery expectations remain the same or higher said daniel benad group vice president and regional general manager australia new zealand and oceania rimini street students can now log into their online classes from almost anywhere in the world which adds a new layer of complexity for the it team fast reliable and secure systems are needed to keep up with the changing world and to remain a leading provider in the education market focusing on the big issues with more time and money to spare maintaining their oracle database landscape was draining on the university s it budget and internal resources support tickets were often slow to be resolved by the software vendor preventing it staff from completing other system maintenance and responding quickly to new it challenges staff were preoccupied with keeping databases operating properly in a rapidly scaling up environment and had little time to focus on university initiatives to support growth and innovation skilled staff are only getting more expensive to hire and retaining these employees just to work on support and operational tasks for our enterprise software is no longer sustainable said brian kelly head of it operations at uts we ve had to really maximize the resources we have to keep our it services growing improving and meeting the needs of the university in addition as uts increasingly moved towards a hybrid learning model for its students and a remote working environment for its staff cost capability supportability and flexibility were key to guaranteeing robust and reliable it services the rapid move into the remote workspace also opened new avenues and risks for cybersecurity attacks and breaches as the number and location of users increased so too did opportunities for unauthorized access as such the university was conscious it needed to increase the security of its oracle software particularly as routine patching was a costly and time consuming endeavour for its it team that did not necessarily provide the fastest protection model in the case of a discovered vulnerability uts is relatively new to the hybrid working and learning space and it s important to be mindful of risks from such a rapid transformation said kelly the university began to look at ways to get improved support better security and reduced operating costs for its oracle database landscape while also reducing the resource drain on its it team uts turned to rimini street s enterprise software support and security solutions lowering costs and response times each rimini street client benefits from the company s flexible premium level enterprise software support model including its industry leading service level agreement of 10 minute response times for all critical priority 1 cases all clients are also assigned a primary support engineer with an average of 20 years experience in enterprise software and backed by a team of functional and technical engineers in addition rimini street s database management services provide uts with new expert skills from skilled and responsive engineers since partnering with rimini street resolving support tickets is easier and quicker with expert engineers available to respond to challenges at any time being able to shrink how much time is spent on routine work has really allowed us to prioritise the bigger picture and rimini street gives us time back in our day said kelly the team is no longer worried about how long a patch or upgrade will take how long it ll take to get issues resolved or how many hours they ll have to dedicate to something routine rimini street has taken care of that for us and having such a quick turnaround for support has really eased up our workload rimini street gives us high quality support for these business as usual activities without breaking our budget being able to be flexible with what senior ict staff we hire means we re putting a microscope on what our team actually needs rather than allowing necessity to dictate it rimini street protect proactive security having the time and resource availability enabled uts to develop and deploy additional enterprise security enhancements further rimini street s security solutions gave uts peace of mind that it would be secure and remain live while it implemented the additional security enhancements completed security enhancements include secure identity management and access controls said kelly thanks to rimini street we now have time and budget to spare and we are now looking at developing and deploying additional security measures utilizing a cloud first strategy we re also working on automating service management and migrating to the cloud anything that improves the quality of user experience uts is yet another example of an institution that has benefited from rimini street s comprehensive and effective database support and security

on tuesday the washington post and cnn business broke the news that a former twitter executive filed a whistleblower complaint with three federal agencies last month accusing his former employer of fraud enabling dangerous security vulnerabilities and maintaining ties with authoritarian countries twitter has pushed back on several of the allegations but the news has already sent shockwaves through the industry the complainant is 51 year old peiter mudge zatko a famous hacker and internet pioneer who was fired by twitter in january observers were quick to compare zatko s actions to those of frances haugen the facebook whistleblower whose massive release of company documents fueled months of scrutiny of the social network zatko is being represented by whistleblower aid the legal organization that worked with haugen advertisement just who is peiter zatko what does his complaint reveal about twitter if what he alleges is true what are the implications some answers where did this guy come from in the 1990s peiter zatko was best known as mudge an anonymous hacker who researched security vulnerabilities in early web networks and joined influential hackerspaces like l0pht and cult of the dead cow the latter once counted a young beto o rourke among its ranks sticking to his sobriquet mudge spoke at events like defcon and testified to the senate in 1998 about the internet s susceptibility to large scale cyberattacks he eventually met with president bill clinton on the issue as mudge zatko played an important role in connecting hackers with political officials parlaying that matchmaking into security consulting and contracting with the government in the 2000s mudge revealed his identity and eventually landed a job at darpa the pentagon s research arm whose work paved the way for the modern internet he later worked on special projects for tech companies like motorola google and stripe helping to boost their security standards advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement in july 2020 twitter experienced its worst breach ever when a teenager hijacked the official accounts of figures like barack obama joe biden and kanye west to make it appear as though they were shilling bitcoin months later then ceo jack dorsey hired zatko as twitter s head of security in order to enact much needed changes to protect the platform zatko worked there until this january when his position was terminated by dorsey s successor parag agrawal at the time few details were given as to the reason a twitter spokesperson has now told cnn business that mudge was axed for ineffective leadership and poor performance though zatko believes he was ousted for bringing security issues to light please tell me what mudge means according to a book on the cult of the dead cow it s just a reference to a former classmate s surname ah well what are the wildest accusations the complaint dispatched to the federal trade commission the securities and exchange commission and the department of justice portrays a company negligent of urgent issues at best and guilty of actively misleading investors and regulators at worst advertisement advertisement perhaps the most shocking accusation concerns india whose repressive rulers have ordered thousands of tweet and account takedowns censored protesters messages and threatened the network s indian employees with force in turn twitter recently sued the indian government zatko claims that the indian government forced twitter to hire specific individual s who were government agents who would have access to vast amounts of sensitive data without disclosing this fact to users a source told the post that one employee in question was probably a government agent in addition zatko s filing states that before he was fired twitter received specific information from a u s government source that at least one employee was also working for a foreign government s intelligence agency neither claim is absurd given that a former twitter manager was indicted just this month for acting as a saudi agent without proper disclosure advertisement advertisement then there are the vulnerabilities the complaint says zatko had warned the company that half of its 500 000 servers were using unencrypted software and that about 40 percent of employee laptops were not sufficiently protected from outside threats in fact about 30 percent of computers even blocked software updates with necessary fixes the filing further alleges that thousands of these barely protected laptops also had access to twitter s source code meaning any targeted hack could give malicious users full knowledge of the mainframe employees claimed these vulnerabilities came about due to inadequate testing by company engineers advertisement advertisement in addition zatko says that out of twitter s nearly 7 000 total employees about half had unmonitored access to sensitive internal company software giving them broad control over operations and user data while an internal presentation said that this unfettered employee access may have been responsible for 7 percent of the company s security breaches zatko put the number close to 60 percent in the 2020 hack for example the teenage culprit reportedly impersonated a twitter staffer in order to enter internal networks advertisement such debunking of internal data appears to have been a constant of zatko s tenure in his complaint zatko alleges that ceo parag agrawal dissuaded him from giving a full picture of twitter s security problems to its board of directors instead agrawal and other executives apparently worked to censor any damning security data misleading investors and regulators from various countries in the process zatko s filing also mentions that the company had neglected to comply with a 2011 ftc consent decree ordering twitter to beef up its security and ensure bad actors could not access private user information a source countered to cnn that zatko at times lacked understanding of twitter s ftc obligations zatko didn t just struggle with agrawal employees told the post that zatko often had trouble conveying security threats to jack dorsey when he was still ceo thanks to dorsey s general absence he was simultaneously ceo of the payments company square and lack of communication in the period leading up to his resignation are any of mudge s claims credible considering that mudge has long been a trusted name in digital security and twitter has undergone high profile hacks time and again the complaint definitely should be taken seriously at the same time some twitter workers told cnn they d found zatko s claims unpersuasive and lacking credibility when he brought them to the company advertisement advertisement advertisement however other unnamed current and former employees have backed zatko up according to the washington post current and former employees also agreed with the complaint s assertion that past reports to various privacy regulators were misleading at best these twitter workers also agreed that too many people had untrammeled access to sensitive internal software and company laptops lacked appropriate security measures what does all this mean for twitter the government appears to be on it the washington post reported that connecticut sen richard blumenthal wrote a letter to the ftc on tuesday asking it to investigate the report and take action as needed in addition a senate intelligence committee spokeswoman stated that the committee is trying to set up a meeting with zatko to discuss the complaint reportedly sens dick durbin and chuck grassley have already spoken with zatko advertisement zatko says he hasn t been in touch with elon musk who s currently embroiled in a legal dispute with twitter over his self sabotaged purchase of the company however the tesla ceo s legal team says it has already issued a subpoena to zatko the lawyers are likely to focus on a section of zatko s complaint headlined lying about bots to elon musk which claims agrawal was fibbing when he tweeted in response to musk s complaint about automated accounts that twitter was effective at tracking down and expelling spam accounts musk initially wanted to pay a premium in order to buy twitter signed a contract to do so and then changed his mind when twitter s stock plummeted he s been citing twitter s supposed obfuscation about how many bots are on the platform in order to get out of the deal a claim that has been widely seen as a fig leaf it s possible zatko s complaint could bolster musk s defense in twitter s lawsuit hoping to force through the sale advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement meanwhile a former ftc chair told cnn that if twitter is found to have violated its legal obligations it could be fined billions of dollars by government regulators and if twitter is confirmed to have knowingly employed unregistered foreign agents for authoritarian governments it could further jeopardize trust and invite even more government scrutiny whatever happens twitter is likely in for another ugly fight thanks to a whistleblower who was high up in the company s ranks and whose complaints implicate leaders all the way up to the ceo and his predecessor mudge not for nothing does it rhyme with grudge

dan hedigan is settling into his new c suite role at five point holdings llc nyse fph with plans to kick off a new phase of commercial efforts at irvine s great park neighborhoods during his second earnings call as ceo of the irvine based master developer that operates under the fivepoint name hedigan shared insight into how the company aims to continue our work on development plans for the 23 million square feet of planned commercial opportunities in our three communities with an active focus on great park and valencia fivepoint is working with brokerage cbre group inc to strategize the listings of large contiguous blocks of land for commercial developers for a variety of uses he said we want to be sure we re really going to maximize the value across all of our assets hedigan told analysts this month it s the latest hint of a major mixed use diversification push for the great park neighborhoods which last month unveiled the first phase of its partnership with city of hope orange county the orange county lennar foundation cancer center we think our values are very competitive with what folks are seeing in this area in the industrial side but that s only one use we have incredible synergy with city of hope there now hedigan said on the august 2 call so we think there s a lot of opportunities and we re trying to be very strategic to really maximize our income the developer currently has entitlements for some 4 9 million square feet of commercial development in its hometown capitalizing on trends city of hope paid 108 million for the office building and land for its new irvine campus from fivepoint in 2021 fivepoint is likely to generate more value from future deals as the market has moved in our favor hedigan said he notes that the master planned community counts some 200 acres of land available for commercial development and industrial properties today in parts of southern california are going between 5 million and 7 million an acre other uses expected to be considered include multifamily healthcare office and retail we have very flexible zoning in our commercial properties which is a very unique attribute hedigan said land opportunities future land listings in irvine could represent big opportunities for commercial investors who have struggled in recent years to find land for development many specifically industrial and multifamily investors have been active in conversion strategies in which underutilized office retail or hospitality properties have been sourced for new development projects the great park neighborhoods offers something that has not been available for years large parcels of entitled land with flexible entitlement which can offer a multitude of uses including life sciences r d office and industrial hedigan said a majority of these commercial parcels are near city hope s new cancer treatment facility and future dedicated cancer hospital which broke ground last week a perfect use to support a strong life sciences market he added these unique attributes create a great opportunity for the great park venture hedigan hails from california s best known proponent of the work live play ethos in its community development newport beach s irvine co where he previously served as president of land sales and homebuilding he referenced his former employer in the earnings call noting that irvine co properties are fivepoint s neighbor on many sides their commercial development spectrum kind of ends where our property starts so there s been a natural market created in that area and the irvine co hasn t sold large blocks of land in a long time fivepoint isn t expected to list these large blocks of land at one time with the company strategizing the timing of the listings in order to maximize income we re in active conversations where we are kind of sizing what we think the market will take right now hedigan said homesite sales on the residential front fivepoint didn t close any land sales in irvine during the second quarter while the company recorded an overall 11 million loss it has made headway on its goal to do more with less the firm said it reduced its expenses by 34

designed to include 10 500 homesites though fivepoint officials have suggested that figure could ultimately increase given the state s need to boost its stock of affordable housing fivepoint acknowledged challenges in the housing market caused by inflation and rising interest rates but it will move ahead with land sales expected to close in the third and fourth quarters as has been the pattern in prior new home sales slowdowns coastal california holds up better than the inland markets and that is what we re seeing at our communities hedigan said builders sold 37 homes at great park neighborhoods during the second quarter down from 94 homes in the first quarter hedigan attributes that slip to limited inventory of homes for sale at its two for sale communities rise which has just 22 homes remaining to be sold and the just sold solis park the first model homes at the 849 home solis park community opened last month with the remaining neighborhoods expected to open through september fivepoint also began the process for land sales for its next community currently called district 5 south the developer is seeking bids from builders for the project which will include 719

housing vouchers are meant to give low income tenants choices about where to live and a chance to move to a better neighborhood that doesn t happen often housing choice vouchers are supposed to give low income tenants real choices about where to live and a chance to move to a better neighborhood but few tenants with vouchers in metro phoenix get that opportunity most of the housing that voucher holders find is concentrated in certain neighborhoods more than 70 of voucher holders or more than 8 000 households live in just 25 of all the zip codes where vouchers are used an arizona republic analysis found here s one example of how the geography of housing remains so lopsided more than 300 voucher holders live in each of the top 10 zip codes for voucher use but the median number of vouchers used across all zip codes where voucher holders live is 37 zip codes where voucher holders live tend to be poorer and have fewer opportunities than the rest of metro phoenix they are also some of the neighborhoods with the highest rent increases and highest eviction rates section 8 housing choice vouchers are akin to school choice vouchers said owen metz senior vice president of the affordable housing developer dominium apartments which accepts housing vouchers one gives parents options to send their children to a school of their choice the other provides opportunity for families to help choose where they live but metz said there is a problem many landlords don t accept vouchers even though most schools do in metro phoenix as of april almost 12 000 households were living in rentals subsidized by the voucher program according to hud which is roughly 2 of all renter occupied households in metro phoenix zip code 85301 in central glendale is the top zip code for voucher usage it also has more eviction actions since 2015 than any other valley zip code median rents there also have risen by 143 from 2014 to 2022 according to rent data tracked by zillow many of the zip codes where the most voucher holders live such as 85040 just south of sky harbor or 85201 in central mesa have almost twice the percentage of people who live below the poverty line than metro phoenix has in a few zip codes the program seems to be meeting its intended goal of allowing people to live in places where there are a mix of incomes and affordable housing stock more than 300 renters with vouchers call zip code 85251 in central scottsdale home an area where median incomes are higher and rents are much higher the arizona republic requested and analyzed housing choice voucher data by zip code from the seven housing authorities that serve the phoenix area six of the seven maricopa county phoenix glendale mesa tempe and scottsdale provided data chandler did not writing in a letter to the republic that the housing authority does not keep data on the number of vouchers used by zip code chandler represents under 4 of all vouchers reported leasing in the phoenix area according to city level data from hud the name is housing choice voucher program and in theory you can take your voucher into the world and pick housing of your choosing said alicia mazzara deputy director of housing equity and data analysis at the center on budget and policy priorities a progressive think tank based in washington d c but obviously there are strings around that tougher than ever to find a home landlords unwilling to rent to voucher holders limited housing authority budgets a shortage of vouchers available and rents that are outpacing voucher subsidies are making it harder than ever for phoenix area voucher holders to find housing those who do often struggle to find a home outside a handful of the same neighborhoods many of which don t have the same resources or amenities that wealthier neighborhoods do only 11 of voucher holders live in low poverty neighborhoods or zip codes where the percentage of residents living below the poverty line is less than 10 they tend to live in neighborhoods with fewer parks and playgrounds less access to grocery stores quality schools and jobs and higher industrial pollution levels these are among some of the conditions that researchers have summarized into what is called a child opportunity index a single measure that combines 29 different indicators of whether a neighborhood is very high high moderate low or very low opportunity the republic found just 2 of voucher households live in zip codes deemed very high opportunity areas more than 65 of all voucher households live in very low or low opportunity zip codes a few of the areas in metro phoenix with a high number of vouchers have a mix of higher end and affordable homes but rents have soared in those neighborhoods also out of state corporate buyers are snatching up those areas affordable apartments and no longer accepting housing vouchers according to public records voucher holders and housing advocates drew schaffer director of the phoenix based william e morris institute for justice isn t surprised that voucher holders in metro phoenix disproportionately live in higher poverty lower opportunity areas a 2019 study of voucher usage in the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the u s came to similar conclusions you could do the same analysis in most american cities and you would find a version of the same story he said on the rise metro phoenix

black child opportunity index level moderate priced out and more neighborhoods that are deemed higher opportunity often have higher rents that can price out people with vouchers the republic s analysis found but that s only part of the picture pamela bridge director of advocacy and litigation at community legal services said the main reason why the landscape of voucher usage is so lopsided is simple voucher holders are shut out of the market by landlords in some neighborhoods when we have landlords that don t take section 8 vouchers what happens is the only landlords that do are in areas with low opportunity bridge said that means worse schools further distances for tenants to travel to work less opportunities for groceries and things that they need around them everything else that the rest of us get to enjoy studies of the voucher program in several cities have found that landlord voucher denial rates are higher in wealthier neighborhoods where voucher payments are likely to be below market rents having source of income protections laws that would prohibit landlords from denying tenants based on whether they pay rent with a voucher or not would help level the playing field advocates say an increasing number of cities across the country including tucson have begun to pass those protections biases and assumptions about voucher holders and their families also play a part in landlord and sometimes community resistance housing advocates say not in my backyard ism or nimbyism has become a key barrier to building more affordable housing units and density in some areas the zip codes where the fewest voucher holders live have a larger share of single family and owner occupied homes than renter occupied homes according to the republic s analysis measures like poverty and opportunity they re important but they don t tell us everything mazarra said some renters may choose to stay in the neighborhood they grew up in or feel most comfortable in and others may want to be closer to family in certain places she said the history of inequitable development and housing discrimination also looms large in phoenix where the impact of redlining can still be felt today schaffer of the william e morris institute said in phoenix the development of racially concentrated areas of poverty is evident in the community resources available to people the access to schools food health care all of the basic needs of living top news headlines inequities in who and where vouchers are used could be violations of federal law if certain protected classes of people are disparately impacted the fair housing act of 1968 which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race religion sex disability or national origin is not just a box checking exercise said schaffer but something that all states cities and counties need to be proactively examining mazzara said it kind of feels like we ve created separate but unequal neighborhoods and now we re asking the voucher program to fix it she encourages local governments to prioritize investments in every neighborhood so that people can access the same opportunities no matter where they live housing authority level policy changes could also have an immediate impact tailoring fair market rents which determine how much of rent a voucher can pay for to be higher or lower for different areas of the valley could be one way to help voucher holders afford housing in a wider range of neighborhoods advocates say ultimately bridge is concerned that the realities of the housing choice voucher program will continue to hinder any progress made to address systemic inequities in housing it worries me that we are going backwards that all the leaps and bounds that we ve made with section 8 allowing families to live in scottsdale or whenever they wanted to live bridge said that we are now just going to have the only landlords in low income areas take section 8 coverage of housing insecurity on azcentral

rimini street support and security enables university to slash support wait times improve security reduce support costs and improve its service delivery as tertiary education sector adopts hybrid learning and navigates labor shortages las vegas business wire rimini street inc nasdaq rmni a global provider of enterprise software products and services the leading third party support provider for oracle and sap software products and a salesforce partner today announced that the university of technology sydney uts has switched from oracle to rimini street for improved support and security of its oracle database and technology platforms in doing so the university has slashed wait times for support requests enjoyed improved service quality and innovative advanced security to protect its database and application middleware rimini street is also helping the university manage through the ongoing it skills shortage by reducing the amount of it labor required for support and instead allowing resources to focus on the rapid transition to hybrid learning uts is one of australia s leading universities with around 45 000 students and 4 000 staff the it department employs around 300 staff and is responsible for the digital experiences supporting the people processes and culture at the university the university faced challenges during the pandemic including a massive shift to online learning and remote work and a growing it skills shortage the large decline in the number of international students enrolling in australia has also seen it budgets shrink because of these limitations uts needed to refocus its strategic resources more efficiently uts like all universities in australia has had to rapidly transition to a hybrid learning model that includes classroom and online service delivery there are many innovations and technologies needed for the transition to hybrid learning budgets are tightening across the board and the quality of service delivery expectations remain the same or higher said daniel benad group vice president and regional general manager australia new zealand and oceania rimini street students can now log into their online classes from almost anywhere in the world which adds a new layer of complexity for the it team fast reliable and secure systems are needed to keep up with the changing world and to remain a leading provider in the education market focusing on the big issues with more time and money to spare maintaining their oracle database landscape was draining on the university s it budget and internal resources support tickets were often slow to be resolved by the software vendor preventing it staff from completing other system maintenance and responding quickly to new it challenges staff were preoccupied with keeping databases operating properly in a rapidly scaling up environment and had little time to focus on university initiatives to support growth and innovation skilled staff are only getting more expensive to hire and retaining these employees just to work on support and operational tasks for our enterprise software is no longer sustainable said brian kelly head of it operations at uts we ve had to really maximize the resources we have to keep our it services growing improving and meeting the needs of the university in addition as uts increasingly moved towards a hybrid learning model for its students and a remote working environment for its staff cost capability supportability and flexibility were key to guaranteeing robust and reliable it services the rapid move into the remote workspace also opened new avenues and risks for cybersecurity attacks and breaches as the number and location of users increased so too did opportunities for unauthorized access as such the university was conscious it needed to increase the security of its oracle software particularly as routine patching was a costly and time consuming endeavour for its it team that did not necessarily provide the fastest protection model in the case of a discovered vulnerability uts is relatively new to the hybrid working and learning space and it s important to be mindful of risks from such a rapid transformation said kelly the university began to look at ways to get improved support better security and reduced operating costs for its oracle database landscape while also reducing the resource drain on its it team uts turned to rimini street s enterprise software support and security solutions lowering costs and response times each rimini street client benefits from the company

assigned a primary support engineer with an average of 20 years experience in enterprise software and backed by a team of functional and technical engineers in addition rimini street s database management services provide uts with new expert skills from skilled and responsive engineers since partnering with rimini street resolving support tickets is easier and quicker with expert engineers available to respond to challenges at any time being able to shrink how much time is spent on routine work has really allowed us to prioritise the bigger picture and rimini street gives us time back in our day said kelly the team is no longer worried about how long a patch or upgrade will take how long it ll take to get issues resolved or how many hours they ll have to dedicate to something routine rimini street has taken care of that for us and having such a quick turnaround for support has really eased up our workload rimini street gives us high quality support for these business as usual activities without breaking our budget being able to be flexible with what senior ict staff we hire means we re putting a microscope on what our team actually needs rather than allowing necessity to dictate it rimini street protect proactive security having the time and resource availability enabled uts to develop and deploy additional enterprise security enhancements further rimini street s security solutions gave uts peace of mind that it would be secure and remain live while it implemented the additional security enhancements completed security enhancements include secure identity management and access controls said kelly thanks to rimini street we now have time and budget to spare and we are now looking at developing and deploying additional security measures

institution that has benefited from rimini street s comprehensive and effective database support and security said benad as international borders continue to open and students choose australia as an

basis since inventory write downs are based on future activity and observation and therefore cannot be projected for the fourth quarter and full fy 2022 the variability of these charges may have a

joining us to review aviat networks results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 the company continued to focus and execute on our key long term targets of growth margin expansion and bottom line improvement despite persistent supply chain headwinds and inflationary challenges for the fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 the aviat team s hard work and commitment resulted in revenue of 77 4 million which represents growth of 8 0 versus q4 of last year adjusted ebitda of 9 1 million a 31 increase versus the same period prior year non gaap eps increase of 52 a strong debt free balance sheet continued share buybacks of 0 75 million for the full year fiscal 2022 aviat achieved revenue growth of 10 2 to 303 0 million which also represents our second consecutive fiscal year of double digit top line growth adjusted ebitda of 38 3 million a 17 increase over last year non gaap eps growth of 24 repurchased 5 4 million in aviat shares these financial results reflect the continued demand we see for our products in the market in fiscal year 22 we increased our global share of demand and added 175 new customers this demonstrates we have the differentiated offering to take accounts from the competition and grow in north america in fiscal year 22 we grew market share by 6 and are now 1 overall in the region on top of this in north america q4 was our best bookings quarter in over a decade and in the rest of the world we continue to gain traction and post encouraging results and bookings we see five main factors for our success in fiscal year 2022 strength in private networks innovation of our multi band solutions further evolution of our software offering traction and expansion with the aviat store and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges let me touch on each of these our value proposition for private networks remains unmatched our reliable high power radios customer service and support and end to end solutions offerings including application software managed services routers and now wireless access solutions via our redline acquisition on the first day of the current quarter is second to none we are the leading microwave vendor in private networks in north america and have increased our market share in this segment in fiscal year 22 please note that for the first time our private networks share of demand is higher than the next two competitors combined revenue in private networks grew 11 this fiscal year and fy 22 was the highest bookings year in our history in this segment which included among other things six new state wide network wins involving a mix of not only microwave products and services but also routers application software and managed services our strength in this segment is unrivaled and with our wallet expansion initiatives our prospects in private networks are exciting in fiscal year 22 we have seen significant wins and repeat orders for our unique wtm 4800 multi band solutions aviat is the only vendor with a single box multi band radio and an extended distance multi band solution all delivering ultra high capacity transport over large longer distances with total cost of ownership that is up to 90 lower than fiber fy 22 has seen significant market successes of our industry leading multi band solutions including an increase in multi band sales by more than 80 year over year penetration into access networks of two tier 1 accounts in west africa a new tier 2 mobile operator win in southeast asia a new tier 1 mobile operator win in china that demonstrates aviat s competitiveness versus huawei a new tier 2 mobile operator win in east africa a large service provider in germany with a 14 000 kilometer fiber optic network many new isp and rolled broadband networks in the u s a and worldwide q4 was the highest bookings quarter to date for multi band with over 60 of these bookings from the emea region operators in countries with high microwave spectrum fees quickly recognized the benefits of deploying aviat multi band as an alternative to traditional microwave only links in countries such as the philippines nigeria and kenya aviat multi band links can provide savings of up to usd 20 000 per link per year in spectrum fees alone in countries where spectrum fees are moderate operators have embraced aviat multi band systems to achieve the following one scale capacity up to 10 gigabits per second via software two reduced power consumption and three cut tower related costs and site visits when compared to using multichannel microwave links that are scalable only to a fraction of the capacity multi band is widely recognized to be a key solution for operators building or preparing for 5g networks network rollouts and aviat leads the industry in this area moving to software in the fiscal year we enhanced our frequency assurance software or fas with new algorithms for interference detection and reporting we introduced new health assurance software or has to improve overall network health and reduce downtime and we evolved our provision plus platform with enhanced ip mpls management capabilities all these investments resulted in an increase in fy 22 management and application software sales by over 50 compared to fiscal year 21 a key win here was with a large state government where we achieved the first sale of our hosted has software which is a software as a service offering and will give us annual recurring software revenue stream this contributed to the fiscal fourth quarter 2022 being our highest bookings quarter for management software since the company s inception we are just getting started with recurring software and we expect much more of this business in fiscal year 23 another significant factor for aviat s success in fiscal year 22 was the aviat store initially launched to serve rural broadband isps in north america the store is now expanding globally and we added 72 new accounts in fiscal year 22 in the north america isp space aviat has the 1 position in radios licensed for operations clearly our value proposition is working the store represented over 8 of our fiscal year 22 revenues and we look forward to the opportunity provided by large funding sources coming in the quarters and years ahead this includes the 20 billion rural digital opportunity fund or rdof and the 65 billion bipartisan infrastructure fund which have yet to impact our business looking forward we can provide some intelligence on the rdof program some customers have started limited spending against rdof this quarter in advance of getting the actual funds authorized our customers believe funds will be dispersed later this calendar year or early next calendar year if the program follows the caf funding profile we would estimate the peak of the spending would be three years from now we continue to expect rdof to be a positive catalyst for us however as with most government appropriations the plan is subject to change we thought we should share the color we have with you to amplify our readiness for this catalyst we are in the process of rolling out a new e commerce platform which will increase our ability to address this demand in the u s and for customers with similar buying characteristics across the globe moving on to supply chain although the supply chain has been a challenge throughout the fiscal year our team worked tirelessly to address issues and interruptions to ensure we met our customers expectations our diligence and persistence in working with supplier partners to solve problems and shortages along with our inventory approach to buffer supply interruptions allowed us to deliver products and results consistently in some cases this has meant incurring expedited costs to alleviate bottlenecks and delays in the fourth quarter we again had no revenue impact from supply shortages this despite semiconductor chips remaining on allocations along with over 100 other components our costs were negatively impacted as a result of the covid lockdowns in asia these lockdowns caused significant expedites to be incurred supplier pushout and decommits late in the quarter remain a problem but the team successfully overcame this throughout the year including six such events in the fourth quarter overall we continue to see some improvement in the supply chain but risks remain the specific improvements include that lead times are stable the number of critical shortages is no longer increasing the number of force majeure events has recently reduced to 0 the overall number of components on allocation remains high but we see evidence that we ve gone through the peak of the allocation environment the key risks currently include the semiconductor wafer shortage as well as third and fourth level suppliers subject to covid lockdowns our results for customers and shareholders would not be possible without all of the aviat employees this was a solid quarter and excellent fiscal year we remain focused and continue to execute and those collective efforts are reflected in our financial and operational results we ve continued to demonstrate our ability to grow and to take share of demand aviat s core values include customer focus as part of our focus on the customer we advanced our voice of the customer process this effort by our sales and marketing teams resulted in a fiscal year ending backlog of 245 million this represents an increase of 9 versus the prior year our three growth drivers 5g private networks and rural broadband leave us well positioned to capture significant opportunities with our differentiated products software and services offerings lastly at the beginning of our new fiscal year we closed the redline communications acquisition which we anticipate to add approximately 20 million of revenue and be accretive to gross margin and earnings in fiscal year 23 we are pleased to have redline as part of aviat and are excited about the opportunity to further demonstrate the value of the aviat s operating system with that let me turn the call over to david to review our financials before coming back for some final comments david david gray thank you pete and good afternoon everyone during my remarks today i will review some of the key fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year financial highlights noting our detailed financials can be found in our press release filed this afternoon as a reminder all comparisons discussed today are between fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 unless noted otherwise for the fourth quarter we reported total revenues of 77 4 million as compared to 71 7 million for the same period last year an increase of 5 7 million or 8 0 driven by strong growth in europe asia pacific and latin america north america which comprised 63 of total revenue for the fourth quarter was 48 8 million an increase of 2 4 million or 5 1 from the same period last year driven primarily by our private networks business international revenue was 28 6 million for the quarter an increase of 3 6 million or 13 3 from the same period last year as pete mentioned our backlog grew by 9 0 year over year to 245 million continuing our trend of trailing four quarter book to bill ratios above 1 which started in fiscal 2018 gross margins for the quarter were 35 5 and 35 7 on a gaap and non gaap basis as compared to 36 1 and 36 2 in the prior year gross margins remained under pressure from inflationary headwinds and expedite costs related to supply chain disruptions we also incurred additional costs to overcome the asian covid related lockdowns which primarily impacted our freight expense our mix this quarter was weighted towards our longstanding projects in backlog as a result our previous price actions were less impactful fourth quarter gaap operating expenses were 22 2 million an increase of 0 1 million from the prior year fourth quarter non gaap operating expenses which exclude the impact of restructuring charges share based compensation and deal costs were 19 5 million this is a decrease of 0 9 million from the prior year due to general cost controls and benefits from prior restructuring actions fourth quarter gaap net income was 4 3 million compared to 2 8 million last year gaap income before tax was 7 3 million an increase of 3 6 million or 95 from the prior year driven by improved operating profit and a 2 6 million gain from on marketable securities partially offset by currency and m a related costs fourth quarter tax provision was 2 8 million compared to 0 9 million last year as a reminder the increase in tax provision year over year will not increase our cash taxes paid the company has over 500 million of nols that will continue to generate shareholder value via minimal cash tax payments for the foreseeable future fourth quarter non gaap net income which excludes restructuring charges share based compensation m a related costs and noncash tax provision was 7 8 million compared to 5 3 million for the same period last year the fourth quarter non gaap eps came in at 0 67 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to 0 44 per share for the same period last year an increase of 52 adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 9 1 million an increase of 2 2 million or 31 from the prior year adjusted ebitda margins were 11 8 million for the quarter moving on to the balance sheet our cash and marketable securities at the end of the fourth quarter were 47 8 million up from 33 8 million the prior quarter we continue to have no debt fourth quarter cash flows from operations were 13 5 million the strong cash generation resulted from a moderation of supply chain induced working capital increases we experienced earlier in the year we executed 0 75 million of stock repurchases in the quarter our balance sheet remains very solid leaving us well positioned to execute our long term plans with that i will turn it back to pete for some final comments pete pete smith thanks david just a few additional comments before opening up for q a fiscal year 2022 represented a significant year for aviat networks the company continues to grow we announced our first acquisition in greater than 10 years and are well on track to realizing the planned synergies we announced our partnership with maxlinear to develop the next generation system on chip which will ensure our differentiation for years to come this will be a more capable commercial alternative based on a newer generation of technology than competitor chips the new generation will enable us to deliver ultra high capacity payloads over longer distances with the lowest possible total cost of ownership additionally this chip will consume less power and create advantages in cost system design and supply chain our strategy from a few years back was to work with maxlinear as a strategic chip development partner and innovate in systems this strategy has yielded significant product differentiation as you can see from our market success and current product offering with the latest partnership agreement with maxlinear we feel confident we have the right strategy for the future as well based on the company s outlook we are establishing our 2023 guidance inclusive of the redline communications business revenue for fiscal year 2023 to be in the range of 330 million to 340 million and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 43 million to 45 million with that operator let s turn the call back for a few live comments and then open up for questions operator certainly thank you pete smith your line is now open please go ahead pete smith yes we just wanted to give a quick update on the ceragon extraordinary shareholder meeting we are disappointed in the results we remain interested in the transaction however for there to be a transaction there needs to be engagement and to date there has been very little and since this has been a public offer the information is in the public domain and we don t believe that there is very much else to say so with that said we d like to turn it back to the operator and start the question and answer period question and answer session operator and our first question comes from the line of scott searle from roth capital scott searle pete dave nice job on the quarter maybe just to dive in on the gross margin front certainly headwinds on that front as it relates to inflationary cost component availability the lockdowns in china and the freight costs could you quantify the impact that you saw in the june quarter and we ve had some i ll call it a thawing on that front what are you seeing in the immediate future as we re looking into the september quarter and into the back half of the calendar year here pete smith yes i want to shy away from specific quantification but it was a fairly large impact on our margins in the quarter probably in the tune of 60 basis points 70 basis points what we see looking forward is actually an absence of those headwinds and we expect pretty good margin progression as we head into fiscal 23 so it s a little bit of a onetime event that we expect to continue the improving trend that we had seen in previous quarters starting up in 2023 scott searle great and maybe looking at the services side of the equation very good quarter i think both from a top line perspective and a gross margin perspective i wonder if you could give us an idea was there anything unusual in there in terms of onetime benefits and particularly now going forward is that a normalized level to be thinking about the gross margin performance particularly as we start to see contribution from redline coming in and pete maybe from a high level as well i know you gave the 20 million guidance for redline for the current fiscal year but how are you expecting that to flow into the p l over the next couple of quarters how is your early integration on that front going pete smith maybe you go first david gray yes i ll start off on the services margin question yes we had a very good quarter in services margin that was driven by north america we had some very very good projects but we ve also been very focused on execution and taking cost out of our service offering so we ve made some good headway there do we expect to maintain those that level of service margin probably not at that level but we don t see a reversion to where we had been historically we expect improved service margins overall pete smith okay and then on the redline part of your question we ve been aggressive in the way we ve managed our supply chain and redline we re starting to run that standard operating process on redline so we think that if you want to calendarize that 20 million it will ramp through the year and we ll also be able to get our operating system in there and start to reduce cost with respect to how in the prepared remarks we said that we re ahead of our planned synergies and that s really on the sg a front that we are our thesis when we bought it we thought that we could take cost out and that thesis has proven out to be true over the first seven weeks or so of ownership scott searle got you and if i could just two last ones just on the guidance you gave guidance for the year i m wondering if you could calibrate sequentially how you re thinking about things on the front sounds like the gross margins start to come back but if you were to net out redline how are you seeing september shape up and then that macro view for fiscal 23 pete what s the thought in terms of the contribution of rdof in there and any sort of the other government funding initiatives and lastly and i apologize in advance but the obligatory ceragon question in terms of are there next steps for you and that stated are there other things and opportunities in the pipeline that you re starting to see that are piquing your interest pete smith okay so those are three questions so in our guidance we do not have rdof in our guidance so we would say that that s a positive catalyst when that materializes with respect to the progression we are a project based business in our prepared remarks we said that we had record public safety so that would mean that we re in the july to june calendar that you d see the ramp through the year but i would expect that there will be some project cutoffs and a little bit of lumpiness from quarter to quarter but the way our backlog is you would expect the progression to kind of go up as we move through the year and then with respect to ceragon next steps i would submit that there are if there is engagement there s next steps if there s no engagement there s no next steps the positive outcome for us are raised our visibility and there s more opportunities for us to grow by acquisition than there had been previously so while we didn t get the results we wanted in the extraordinary shareholder meeting it s been net net positive for aviat operator and our next question comes from the line of tim savageaux from northland capital markets tim savageaux i wanted to talk about the booking strength in the quarter which you called out in sort of multiyear or nearly decade terms maybe let s focus on north america and what the drivers were there for q4 in particular you did mention some initial spending activity on the rdof side and to what extent was rural broadband in general a factor in that order strength or can we attribute most of that to private networks and i ve a follow up pete smith yes tim i would attribute most of it to private networks and that s why we gave the color of six state networks tim savageaux is that in the quarter or for the year pete smith that was for the year tim savageaux and also to follow up on some of the carrier wins well i wanted to see if you could maybe toss out a book to bill for q4 either overall or north america just given the superlatives you put on the numbers in terms of the year and i was also interested in the tier 1 win in huawei s backyard i guess and how significant you view that to be and what that means both from a revenue perspective and also for future potential wins pete smith okay so i think we because we have a lumpy project based business we don t like the book to bill and that s why on a quarterly basis and that s why we said our backlog year over year is up 9 the win in china that s a demonstration of our ability to deliver our multi band which is highly differentiated and we re using that we re in where the spectrum costs are highest in china or the cost of linking towers together is the most expensive and i wouldn t say we want to raise guidance on that we brought that up because it demonstrates our ability to compete in tier 1s and in huawei s backyard tim savageaux great maybe one more follow up for me if i may you re coming off a couple of years organically of double digit growth here and looking at a more conservative start to that year organically this year and mentioned that you don t really have much in the way of government or rdof supported revenue or nothing actually in your forecast can that really by itself i guess if that were to come through in some reasonable way puts you back into double digits for 23 and that s it for me pete smith yes i mean that s fair i mean tim you re probably doing the math on what it would need to be and if it comes it could certainly put the core business into that level of growth yes and that would be kicking in of the either the rdof funding or the building infrastructure fund or bif h r 3684 so just so we watch those items pretty closely and if we get the kick in then that will be a positive catalyst for us operator and our next question comes from the line of erik suppiger from jmp securities erik suppiger can you talk a little bit about kind of some of the demand that you re seeing in europe and how much of this is related to the war in ukraine pete smith yes our biggest demand is in the uk and that s a private networks project similar to the bulk of our business in north america and we previously disclosed that we only had 1 contractor in russia and we only had one potential commercial opportunity in ukraine so ukraine russian war has had a de minimis impact on us the bulk of the growth has been driven by private networks in the uk but we have picked up some tier 2s in europe and some isps specifically in germany erik suppiger can you discuss obviously you had some pretty robust growth in europe why is why are private networks coming a lot so much for you pete smith so if we roll back the clock about five quarters ago we refreshed our commercial leadership because we were not doing very well in the emea team and we ve upgraded the team the teams running our voice customer and our sales funnel process and now i would say with that leadership we understand our value proposition we chase opportunities that we can win and our conversion rate is better than it was five quarters ago erik suppiger okay and africa was down year over year was there anything notable that caused that pete smith yes i think that s we think africa is well positioned for growth and it s really just a low on the capex cycle and i think watch that space in the coming quarters and you ll see a bounce up there operator and our next question comes from the line of theodore o neill from litchfield hills research theodore o neill backlog can you give us any information about the mix between products and services and whether or not you re seeing stronger growth in either one of those david gray so yes we definitely had a mix skewed towards services this quarter it s typically it s probably about 6 percentage points or 7 percentage points higher than it normally is from a mix standpoint and we also had we already talked about the strong execution that increased the margins there we don t think there s a fundamental shift in the mix between product and services as pete said a project based business that is going to be a little lumpy and we re going to have this kind of variability quarter to quarter this just happened to be a strong quarter for services coupled with positive margins on those services that was good for us theodore o neill okay and in terms of your north america revenue and market share here being so strong is that a particular product area that s creating that for you or is that across the board pete smith so i would say our wtm high capacity radio is a key product but one of the reasons we win in private networks across the globe and in particularly in north america is our end to end offering so we do the network design the network plan provide the hardware software and services sometimes do the install and sometimes we do the ongoing network monitoring and that core competency along that those elements of value is what are the components of the winning value proposition operator and our next question comes from the line of orin hirschman from aigh orin hirschman congratulations on the result i just wanted to drill down again on redline how much of redline revenue was in the past fiscal year david gray past fiscal year is about just over 19 million pete smith yes so yes so 19 millionâ orin hirschman â pete smith we are in about 19 million so we re signing up for nominal growth while we restructure the business and get our voice of the customer and sales funnel process in place so that s we want to make sure we get the cost out get the business off of the canadian exchange and get it the resources deployed and run our voice of the customer and sales model process so we re so that s what we re doing with redline in the first 12 months orin hirschman okay where i m going with the question is just to understand the organic growth rate even without redline considering how the backlog has risen and the book to bills have been positive it would seem like again i don t know the timing of the orders on the book to bill but it would seem like it gives you running room especially not counting anything from rdof or the infrastructure buildout pete smith yes so we want to make sure that we give guidance that can hit you re right that we have rdof upside if we can pull in the backlog we can and as we execute that we ll revisit our guidance as we go through the year orin hirschman okay and my final question is on the software side i know you mentioned there are additional software offerings coming you alluded to can you say anything more about that or even just the timing pete smith so we launched our about 1 5 years or two years ago the fas frequency assurance software then we in the last quarter we launched our health assurance software and we re contemplating a couple of other assurance softwares to build out our software suite and help network operators run their networks at a lower total cost of ownership and we would say within the fiscal year we will launch our next assurance software and build our advantage there operator thank you this does conclude the question and answer session of today s program i d like to hand the program back to pete smith for any further remarks pete smith i d like to thank everyone for your continued interest and your call your attendance on the call we d like to thank our suppliers customers employees and shareholders and we look forward to speaking with you at the end of q1 and giving you an update on our progress operator this concludes today s conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect good day

with discovery success about escalones the escalones porphyry skarn copper gold project has estimated inferred resources of 426 million tonnes of 0 367 total copper within the oxidized zone based on nearly 25 000m of drill core from 53 holes the 3 45 billion pounds of copper should be amenable to heap leaching with an average recovery of 71 the company is focused on exploring the mancha amarilla target immediately to the south of the existing resource in addition three significant hydrothermal alteration zones each measuring between 2 000m and 3 000m in diameter lie 8 10km to the north of the main discovery mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability as there is no certainty that all or any part of the resources will be converted into reserves inferred resources are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling it is reasonably expected that the inferred resources could be upgraded to indicated resources with continued exploration about zonia the zonia project is in yavapai county arizona and consists of 261 mineral claims and additional surface rights all totaling 4 279 55 acres it is a near surface copper oxide resource and a brownfields site having already been mined in the late 1960s and 70s the project is at the pea level and has been significantly de risked with over 50 000 metres of drilling completed to date and with substantial amounts of detailed engineering completed further details can be found here the world copper

rockville md and suzhou china aug 23 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases announced that the first patient dosing in australia for its proprietary pd 1 il 2 bispecific antibody fusion protein r d code ibi363 in phase i clinical trial for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas it is first candidate drug to conduct clinical trial in australia in innovent s pipeline the study nct05290597 is an open label multi center phase i study evaluating the safety tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ibi363 in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose rp2d interleukin 2 il 2 a cytokine secreted mainly by antigen activated cd4 t cells is vital for maintaining cd4 regulatory t cell treg level cd4 t cell differentiation and maintaining cd8 t cell and natural killer cell activity il 2 was the first cytokine to be discovered and identified as playing a pivotal role in t cell growth and expansion aldesleukin il 2 was approved by u s food and drug administration for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma in the early 1990s but it has not been widely used in clinic due to poor selectivity narrow therapeutic window and side effects ibi363 potential first in class candidate drug was independently developed by innovent its active ingredient is pd 1 il 2 bispecific antibody fusion protein the il 2 arm of ibi363 has been engineered to maximize efficacy and reduce toxicity whereas the pd 1 binding arm achieves pd 1 blockade and selective il 2 delivery therefore ibi363 has both functions of simultaneously blocking pd 1 pd l1 pathway and activating il 2 pathway allowing more precise and efficient targeting and activation of tumor specific t cells ibi363 not only showed promising anti tumor activity in a variety of tumor bearing pharmacological models but also exhibited prominent antitumor efficacy in pd 1 resistant and metastatic models meanwhile ibi363 demonstrated a good safety profile in preclinical in vivo models dr morteza aghmesheh southern medical day care centre located in new south wales australia stated wild type il 2 is clinically validated as monotherapy but limited by toxicity and low response rate due to poor selectivity ibi363 a novel pd 1 il 2 bispecific molecule designed to selectively activates pd 1 positive t cells by cis activating il 2 but not pd 1 negative bystanders or naïve t cells with the potential to significantly decrease toxicity related to il 2 and potentially overcome immunotherapy resistance we look forward to the positive results in the safety tolerability and efficacy of ibi363 in the clinic dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent stated most patients will develop primary or secondary resistance after treatments of immune checkpoint inhibitors at present treatment options are limited upon progression after immunotherapy and there is a huge unmet clinical needs ibi363 developed by scientists at innovent academy can enhance anti tumor immune response by reversing t cell exhaustion improving the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors especially for patients with resistance to immunotherapy or cold tumors while minimizing il 2 related side effects we are pleased that the first patient dose of ibi363 has been completed in australia in parallel the ind for ibi363 has been approved by nmpa in china we are looking forward to the positive results of ibi363 in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma ibi363 is our first molecule to initiate clinical study in australia which marks a solid step of innovent s global innovation strategy the company will also accelerate the development of more innovative molecules with high global potential taking advantage of cross regional r d and clinical resources adhering to the long term development strategy of driven by innovation developed through globalization with an aim to benefit cancer patients worldwide about

democratic representative charlie crist of florida won his party s nomination for governor tuesday night edging out state agriculture commissioner nikki fried in a grueling primary campaign to represent his party in november s election now the real battle begins in less than 11 weeks crist a former florida governor will face gop governor ron desantis in a state that has seen some of the country s most closely contested statewide campaigns in recent decades the race will likely be a referendum on the republican party s momentum in a midterm elections season defined by critical differences between the two parties on issues like inflation and abortion access as well as social policies regarding education race and lgbtq rights among other matters in his first term desantis a former member of congress who narrowly won his seat against democrat andrew gillum in 2018 has become a prominent figure in the modern conservative movement for his administration s conservative social policies as well as his combative relationship with the news media during his four years in office desantis is often mentioned along with former president donald trump as a prospective nominee for the white house in 2024 and in recent months his endorsement has been sought by republican candidates as he has campaigned for conservative politicians in battleground states around the country democratic gubernatorial candidate charlie crist speaks during an august 17 campaign event in pembroke pines florida on tuesday he won his party s nomination for governor democratic gubernatorial candidate charlie crist speaks during an august 17 campaign event in pembroke pines florida on tuesday he won his party s nomination for governor joe raedle getty images north america republicans have an inherent advantage in the sunshine state despite its historically competitive political nature florida has not elected a democratic governor since 1994 crist who served as governor for four years before a failed independent run for the senate in 2010 lost to gop governor rick scott by a single point in 2014 after switching to the democratic party and unlike some republicans in other traditionally close states desantis has seen his stock stay positive as issues like abortion have come to dominate the national conversation despite his signature on several controversial pieces of legislation such as restrictions on lgbtq and race based curricula in schools as well as a 15 week ban on abortion desantis had a 53 percent approval rating entering the summer according to morning consult polling meanwhile analysts at the cook political report and fivethirtyeight have given the gop a slight advantage to retain the governor s seat in november with the latter projecting desantis to win by a near double digit margin polling within the sunshine state has favored desantis as well although democrat gillum considered a slight favorite to win in 2018 came within a half point of victory before a scandal toppled his political career recent university of north florida polling gave desantis a 7 point advantage over fried while crist was down 8 points against the governor and while national polling and voter registration data have shown an energized democratic base before the midterms republicans are enthusiastic as well setting the stage for a hotly contested election season this fall money is likely to play a significant factor the desantis campaign has a war chest of nearly 18 million to spend in defense of his seat while florida campaign finance reports show crist with campaign accounts in the low six figures leaving him with significant ground to make up in the coming weeks however recent polling by two progressive florida organizations indicated that the race could be much closer than anticipated with any potential democratic candidate polling just 5 points behind desantis in a head to head matchup but crist who is based in st petersburg has arguably been running against desantis for months running ads heavily focused not on his primary opponent but on the governor and how he would better oppose his agenda crist who has been in politics since his election to the state senate in 1992 has run on his prior experience in the governor s office as a former republican turned democrat he cites his willingness to work with president barack obama and his controversial decision to veto an abortion ban while in office election day is november 8

the idea that the u s economy may be in a recession got a boost on tuesday from the s p global survey of purchasing managers the services side of the s p global purchasing managers index pmi fell into a steep contraction in july as consumers cut back on discretionary spending due to high inflation squeezing household budgets economists were expecting a bounce in august after weeks of falling gasoline prices instead the services side sunk even deeper into contraction and the manufacturing side slipped closer toward contraction the composite index which blends both services and manufacturing is at the lowest level in 27 months s p global noted that the rate of contraction also outpaced anything recorded outside of the initial pandemic outbreak since the series began nearly 13 years ago in other words the economy appears to be shrinking at a rapid rate even though businesses added more than half a million workers to payrolls in july output is back to may 2020 levels when much of the economy was shuttered due to the pandemic gathering clouds spread across the private sector as services new orders returned to contractionary territory mirroring the subdued demand conditions seen at their manufacturing counterparts said siân jones senior economist at s p global market intelligence europe s economy is contracting also s p global said european business activity declined for a second straight month in europe however there s a pretty clear culprit for the downturn soaring energy prices and fear of what russia might do to the continent s energy supply when winter arrives this weighs heaviest on manufacturing where output has now fallen for three straight months the services sector remains above water but barely so the eurozone composite index fell to 49 1 from 49 9 in july the lowest level in 18 months new orders declined for both services businesses and manufacturers and inventories are piling up at factories as goods go unsold cost of living pressures mean that the recovery in the service sector following the lifting of pandemic restrictions has ebbed away while manufacturing remained mired in contraction in august seeing another record accumulation of stocks of finished goods as firms were unable to shift products in a falling demand environment this glut of inventories suggests little prospect of an improvement in manufacturing production any time soon said s p global s andrew harker the u k composite index managed to stay in positive territory just barely while declining to the lowest level in 18 months the uk private sector moved closer to stagnation in august as mild growth of activity across the service sector only just offset a deepening downturn at manufacturers said s p global economics associate director annabel fiddes s p global s surveys also showed that private sector activity in japan and australia declined so the sun never sets on what appears to be a burgeoning global recession closer to home macy s posted better than expected quarterly results but warned investors that it is less positive about the months ahead the company said that inflationary pressures have weighed on consumer sentiment and began throttling spending in mid june the company said it was managing its inventories to lower levels but expects large inventories throughout the industry to weigh on prices and profits in the second half of the year nordstrom also posted quarterly results that beat expectations while warning of a sharp deterioration in demand starting in mid june and a need to clear unwanted inventory toll brothers quarterly results highlighted the speed at which the housing sector has fallen into recession the quarterly cancelation rate the percentage of signed contracts canceled in the quarter jumped from 3 8 percent in the previous quarter to 13 percent in the most recent quarter historically around a seven percent cancelation rate is normal for toll brothers so the market has gone from an unusually low rate of cancelations to an unusually high rate economic conditions have changed with a violent rapidity since the arrival of the pandemic in 2020 that appears to still be the case as we move through the second half of 2022

bloomberg federal reserve bank of minneapolis president neel kashkari said us inflation is very high and the central bank must act to bring it back under control by many many measures we are at maximum employment and we are at very high inflation so this is a completely unbalanced situation which means to me it s very clear we need to tighten monetary policy to bring things into balance he said tuesday at a gathering of the wharton club of minnesota in minneapolis when inflation is 8 or 9 we run the risk of unanchoring inflation expectations and leading to very bad outcomes that would cause us to have to be very aggressive volcker esque to then re anchor them he said referring to former fed chair paul volcker who tipped the us economy into recession to conquer inflation in the 1980s compelling evidence we definitely want to avoid allowing that situation to develop so with inflation this high for me i m in the mode of we need to err on making sure we re getting inflation down and only relax when we see compelling evidence that inflation is well on its way back down to 2 he said referring to the fed s inflation target us consumer prices rose 8 5 in the 12 months through july the fed aims at a different gauge called the personal consumption expenditures price index which rose 6 8 in the year through june kashkari who prior to the pandemic was the fed s most outspoken dovish policy maker has in recent months become its biggest hawk the us central bank has been raising interest rates at a rapid clip this year in a bid to bring down inflation which is near the highest levels in four decades it hiked rates by 75 basis points at its last two meetings and policy makers have said the same again could be on the table when they gather next month fed officials are headed to jackson hole wyoming this week for an annual conference that will be attended by central bankers from around the world chair jerome powell will have a chance to reset expectations in financial markets for the path of interest rates going forward when he addresses the confab on friday kashkari saw some positive news on the supply side which he blamed for roughly two thirds of the inflation in the us with fiscal stimulus and fed policy blamed for the remaining third and he said that it would make the fed s task easier if supply constraints eased strong dollar he also acknowledged that a stronger us currency could help dampen inflation by lowering the cost of imported goods asked if the impact of a stronger dollar would weigh on fed policy he said officials were making policy for the us economy and american people but what happens in other countries does affect the us so in that context it will get factored in as we analyze these feedback loops of us raising rates what does a strong dollar mean for inflation that may then mean that we have to do less because it may bring down the price of imports he said updates with quotes from second paragraph 2022 bloomberg l p
guenther steiner described kevin magnussen s arrival at haas as a different world that mick schumacher needed to adapt to the dane returned to the american team following nikita mazepin s sacking just weeks before the season started and looked as if he had never been away he earned p5 in his very first race back and has since finished within the points on four more occasions his arrival also represented a significant step up in terms of team mate comparison for schumacher who went from facing a fellow rookie with a habit of spinning to an f1 veteran who has a podium finish under his belt taking his time to readjust to this new yardstick of which he would be measured against the young german found his feet at the british grand prix and has finished ahead of magnussen in every race since then team principal steiner has praised schumacher s ability to deal with the pressure and said he believes his role is to give each driver the same opportunity i think a lot of pressure was brought from outside into him and i don t know how he deals with that one because he s doing his own thing there he said as per motorsport com but i think on what i always do and always will do as team principal is i give them the same opportunity as the other driver and as long as you keep that you can look in both drivers eyes and say hey this is what you ve got it s now down to you to find a solution to it because i cannot drive the race car i know it s not going as you wanted to go but keep on trying this is the same opportunity other than the upgrade in hungary everything was always equal treatment and with strategy the same thing so that is the only thing that i can try to stabilise so that he stays focused mentally then obviously the interference from outside i cannot manage that because i cannot go into his head steiner described magnussen s arrival as a different world for schumacher to adapt to but believes he has now adjusted to it obviously at some stage when kevin came in it was a different world for him and he needed to adjust to it the 57 year old said but i cannot tell him that he needs to see that on the data where he loses time and stuff like this but i think he got over that you know obviously we would have liked it to come earlier because then we would have more points but in the end silverstone and austria they were two good races for him so then i hope now we are on that road with his f1 future in doubt mick schumacher needs to show he is deserving of his spot nine races to go and your future in the sport as the carrot dangling in front of you the second half of the 2022 season could prove to be career defining for mick schumacher in his rookie season he was afforded some slack given the slowness of the haas car and also his consistent ability to beat mazepin but now with both the car and his team mate quicker schumacher has been asked to step up if you were to ask anyone if schumacher would continue with haas just five or six races ago the answer would not have been as positive as it is now the back to back points scores at silverstone then austria has raised the german s stock and also shook the lack of a points score monkey off his back but it is still not enough to guarantee he will be at haas come next season with a lack of available seats the team have been coy when it comes to offering to extend schumacher s contract which ends following the 2022 season schumacher was described as the one loser following the filling of the aston martin seat and it removed any leverage he may have had in terms of agreeing to a new deal what does now face schumacher is nine races to prove he is worthy of a place in the sport haas may choose to go elsewhere with reports linking them to a move for mclaren s daniel ricciardo but even if schumacher did leave the team it does not necessarily mean an end to his time in f1 for the son of one of the most famous drivers to ever race it is time to prove it is more than just his last name that is keeping him on the f1 grid

there was an extraordinary heat wave in march in northern india which caused wheat yields to drop the heat wave in northern europe was worse and also affected wheat output as a result of the heat wave and the collapse of exports from ukraine the world may be short by around 14 million tonnes of wheat this has caused prices to spiral and there are frantic efforts by major importers to ensure adequate supplies including those from last year s crop stored in silos india s prime minister had made an assurance that the country could feed the world since we had had a bumper crop but a reassessment after the march heat wave led to a hastily imposed export ban on wheat something that dismayed farmers eyeing windfall gains due to high international prices but by now the situation may be grimmer this year s output could be 10 lower than last year thanks to lower procurement combined with higher allocation both to the public distribution system pds and to the pradhan mantri gareeb kalyan anna yojana pmgkay the current stocks are less than adequate between the pds and pmgkay free foodgrain scheme the total annual requirement is around 32 million tonnes add to it a minimum buffer stock of 8 mt that must be maintained for contingencies emergencies and price stability unfortunately the current stock which includes carryover stock from last year and a fresh procurement of 20 mt falls short this possible shortfall has been denied by the department of food and public distribution however the best indicator of any impending shortage is conveyed by prices wheat inflation is running at 12 traders anticipate an annual production of only 95 mt sharply down from 111 mt last year even an independent assessment by the united states agriculture department pegs india s production this year at 98 mt the pmgkay commitment was recently extended for a sixth time to the end of september 2022 the in kind transfer of free foodgrains has not only ensured some amount of food security but also protected the recipients from food inflation that s because the benefit was given in kind rather than in cash the total incremental outlay for the sixth phase is around rs 80 000 crore the government can consider tapering the benefits of pmgkay which was begun during the first wave of covid tut its termination should not be abrupt in this context it is worth emphasising that the import of wheat is not a national embarrassment nor should it be politicised india has been proudly self sufficient in foodgrains for several decades after the initial success of the green revolution and of policies of public procurement which give production incentives to farmers but over the years many distinct changes in the consumption patterns of indians are discernible first there is the transition from coarse cereals like jowar and bajra to fine cereals like wheat and rice second is the increase in consumption of meat dairy and poultry these require higher production of foodgrains including corn and soya as animal feed in fact demand for animal feed has gone up sharply and so has the cost causing high inflation in milk the third trend in changing consumption patterns is more food being served ready made in restaurants and community kitchens that too is likely on a net basis to lead to an increase in the demand for food thus if we extrapolate the demand for foodgrains taking into account changing consumption patterns and rising incomes and prosperity it is clear that domestic availability will not be enough at the current rate of growth of productivity yields and acreage hence sooner or later india has to plan for food security which has a significant linkage with imports or encourage indian companies to own food production in other land abundant countries like australia or ethiopia the current situation of food insecurity is grim the recently published report state of food security and nutrition in the world states that 40 6 of india s population suffered from moderate or severe food insecurity during 2019 21 the proportion of those who are severely food insecure has risen from 20 3 in 2018 20 to 22 3 the world average is much lower at 10 7 thus more than a third of the world s hungry and undernourished people are in india which is alarming and embarrassing if not shameful india s rank in the global hunger index has also dropped to 101 out of 116 countries the ghi score has been improving in the past few years but the latest score of 27 5 is still considered serious even sub component scores for stunting wasting and child malnutrition are worrisome the ghi is computed using three dimensions of child mortality children malnutrition and food supply adequacy in another aspect of its food economy india has very high dependency on imported edible oils even in pulses a crucial source of proteins production has not kept pace and imports make up 10 to 15 of total consumption that could go up in the future milk production is the highest in the world but per capita consumption needs to go up substantially to come up to the world average for that to happen we need much higher production of animal feedstock like corn this too implies pressure on increasing agricultural production at a faster pace it is thus clear that in the near future india s dependence on food imports will rise this by itself is neither a matter of national prestige nor an embarrassment we are after all big importers of energy which we hope to reduce with greater use of renewable energy similarly we have to approach the challenge of meeting food security needs by increasing imports in the coming years and combining it with strategic planning and coordination technology will also play a role in increasing productivity and ensuring crop diversification but till we meet the challenge of food security needs till we have better technology to increase yields and diversify crops till we combine strategic planning and coordination in imports the large scale import of wheat will be necessary to ensure food security and domestic price stability dr ajit ranade is a noted economist
san francisco elon musk quickly latched onto explosive new allegations tuesday about twitter s handling of bot and spam accounts a key issue in his months long dispute with the social media giant and his attorneys were expected to raise the issue in court as soon as wednesday musk the ceo of tesla and spacex has been locked in a legal battle with twitter since he announced that he was abandoning a deal to purchase the site for 44 billion earlier this year among musk s complaints is that the social media company is vastly undercounting the number of spam and bot accounts on its platform and therefore overstating the number of legitimate users on tuesday the washington post reported that twitter s former head of security peiter zatko had filed a whistleblower complaint with federal regulators including the securities and exchange commission accusing twitter of lying about bots to elon musk zatko a well known figure in the security community alleges that twitter is not incentivized to tally the true number of bots and spammy accounts on the service which counts 238 million daily users zatko also alleges that twitter deceived regulators regarding its defenses against hackers a claim that could provide support to musk s charge that twitter has been untruthful in its reports to shareholders the whistleblower complaint provides limited evidence to back up zatko s claims nonetheless musk tweeted a screenshot of the post article and wrote so spam prevalence was shared with the board but the board chose not disclose that to the public he also tweeted a meme of jiminy cricket a character from the movie pinocchio with the words give a little whistle a line from a song that continues and always let your conscience be your guide musk s team is due wednesday to appear in delaware chancery court for a hearing on his ability to demand information about twitter s internal practices and data according to individuals with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing legal proceeding musk s team could use the whistleblower complaint in that hearing to bolster his arguments or seek more time the judge has rejected musk s requests for information from more than 20 company leaders including zatko but the whistleblower claims could open the door for them to make further requests legal experts said twitter has repeatedly pushed back against the argument that it does not tally or work intensely to combat bots and spam in may ceo parag agrawal said the company removes half a million spam and bot accounts each day a number the company updated in july to 1 million a day twitter fully stands by our statements about the percentage of spam accounts on our platform and the work we do to fight spam on the platform generally said twitter spokeswoman rebecca hahn in response to zatko s allegations we have already issued a subpoena for mr zatko and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding said alex spiro a partner at quinn emanuel who is representing musk in his ongoing litigation with twitter but any new allegations that twitter misled shareholders and regulators could bolster musk s case in delaware chancery court in october according to five legal experts who spoke with the post the arguments would depend on the severity of the revelations as well as data supporting any new claims and the extent to which musk relied on such claims in consummating the deal the question ultimately boils down to the credibility of the assertions made by the whistleblower and that is usually determined by the existence of hard evidence attorney howard fischer a former sec counsel said in an email while significant attention appears focused on twitter s alleged undercount of bots what might be more concerning are the allegations about twitter s technological contingency plans on tuesday afternoon twitter s shares traded at about 39 86 down more than 7 percent from monday s close and significantly below the 54 20 per share musk had offered in the acquisition deal musk did not respond to a request for comment musk has been angling to exit his deal to purchase the social media site alleging twitter s longtime estimate that bot and spam accounts make up fewer than 5 percent of its monetizable daily users is untrue he terminated his agreement to buy twitter alleging its miscount of bots would present a material adverse effect a fundamental change to the business that for example cuts steeply into its value and he has since countersued the company for allegedly misleading his team accusing twitter of fraud and breach of contract zatko is a security pioneer who is known in the industry for his history of exposing software flaws under the handle mudge his tenure at twitter however was controversial resulting in repeated clashes with fellow executives and ultimately his firing the complaint alleges that twitter misled regulators from the federal trade commission and securities and exchange commission on security issues twitter s hahn said zatko s allegations were riddled with inaccuracies the true number of bots and spam accounts on twitter is likely to be meaningfully higher than the figure twitter claims the complaint alleges twitter executives have little or no personal incentive to accurately detect or measure the prevalence of spam bots the complaint alleges adding deliberate ignorance was the norm among its executive team a redacted version of the 84 page filing went to congressional committees the post obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior democratic aide on capitol hill the allegations about bots strengthen musk s case for sure because you have someone with inside knowledge said anthony casey a professor of law and economics at the university of chicago law school but he cautioned that the allegations don t seem to be a smoking gun because there doesn t appear to be concrete evidence that the company was intentionally lying about the number of bots it has to be more than just you guys were sloppy about this because you didn t really care casey said it adds to musk s case but i still think he s got a weak case the allegations could be a jumping off point for musk s legal team to seek more information legal experts said as he seeks to bolster his argument it gives them a reason to dig in said robert penza an attorney at law firm polsinelli who practices in the delaware court of chancery still he said musk would probably have to show that twitter intentionally had misleading information in its financial statements and that those substantially skewed the business multiple divisions at twitter are in charge of fighting spam and bots as the head of security zatko was not directly responsible for eradicating bots but his role touched upon some aspects of bot removal zatko was fired long before musk s initial twitter investment became public in april in the run up to his acquisition announcement later that month four people familiar with the company s processes for spam detection who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal matters told the post that the company keeps several internal tallies of spam and bots known as prevalence across the service beyond the number supplied to wall street the post also obtained an internal document which was redacted to hide the numbers showing that spam prevalence was a number shared with the board the document was supplied to the board at a meeting zatko attended according to two of the people the four people said the social media company estimates the broader amount of spam and bots on the service by using software to sample thousands of tweets each day as well as 100 accounts that are sampled manually three of the people said that the company s internal bot prevalence numbers were almost always less than 5 percent twitter s hahn said the company is transparent about the number of accounts it removes for violating its rules in addition there are many rule following bots that are allowed to stay the company doesn t report a total number of bots because it would just be a minimum number of the ones they ve caught she said the internal measurements of prevalence focus on how many people are seeing the rule breaking bots which the company believes is the more accurate measure of potential harm than an overall count since many bots are inactive hahn added twitter and musk became embroiled in a legal battle this summer after musk backed out of his deal to buy the social media company twitter filed suit alleging he had breached his contract while disrupting the site s operations and dragging down its stock in response musk filed a countersuit late last month alleging a spate of new issues including that a majority of ads are shown to fewer than 16 million users that s a tiny fraction of the 238 million daily users that twitter claims could earn the company revenue by viewing ads alexander manglinong an attorney who focuses on business litigation at the firm stubbs alderton markiles pointed to musk s waiving of due diligence in consummating the agreement depriving him of a deeper look at twitter s internal workings in saying the tech mogul faces an uphill battle he might be emboldened thinking that this is now his ticket to beating twitter he said it may cause him to act even more rashly he has more than what he had previously whether that s actually going to be anything substantive that s going to affect the case that s unclear to me musk s legal team has already shown its willingness to question high ranking former executives issuing a subpoena to former twitter chief executive jack dorsey zatko was already one of the executives whose records musk s legal team attempted to obtain but a judge denied the request musk s team has asked for information from more than 20 company leaders but the judge so far has only allowed them to obtain internal communications from a single twitter executive former head of consumer product kayvon beykpour zatko alleges in his complaint that an unnamed senior executive attempted to shut down a key tool for stopping bot and spammy accounts the tool internally called ropo for read only phone only blocks an account from tweeting until a user can prove it is linked to a real person that executive was beykpour who was fired by agrawal this year said two of the people familiar with the company s processes with spam as well as a third person familiar with the discussions the complaint says beykpour became critical of the tool after personally receiving a small number of unsolicited dms text messages but the people said that beykpour thought ropo was riddled with much broader errors and was not trying to shut down the tool but was proposing an overhaul beykpour declined an interview request zatko s attorney from the nonprofit law firm whistleblower aid said before publication that there had been no interaction with musk s team but that he would respond to subpoenas zatko also alleges in the complaint that twitter s security systems had massive deficiencies leaving the company vulnerable to repeated hacks and even the real possibility of a sitewide shutdown he says that during his year long tenure at the company many workplace servers and laptops were running out of date and vulnerable software and far too many employees had access to internal systems that contained sensitive user data and software twitter s hahn says security practices are up to industry standards twitter trial
