clean air in cities is the exception not the rule the vast majority of city dwellers around the world 86 percent or 2 5 billion people are breathing in air that has levels of fine particulate matter at levels higher than what the world health organization recommends according to a recent study advertisement advertisement first words the majority of the world s urban population still live in areas with unhealthy levels of pm 2 5 lead author veronica southerland of george washington university said in a statement behind the quote that pollution which is associated in cities largely with the burning of fossil fuels was responsible for 1 8 million additional deaths in 2019 according to the study which was published in the lancet planetary health journal the burden of pollution falls particularly hard on children according to another lancet study which found that the pollutant nitrogen dioxide or no2 a common byproduct of burning fossil fuels in cars and power plants has led to almost 2 million additional cases of childhood asthma there was some good news researchers noted that efforts to clean up roadways and industrial sites in the u s and europe had led the share of childhood asthma caused by no2 to fall from 20 percent to 16 percent over the two decades between 2000 and 2019 advertisement advertisement the findings suggest that clean air must be a critical part of strategies aimed at keeping children healthy study co author susan anenberg of george washington university said in a statement even safe levels of fossil fuel pollutants may not be safe but fossil fuel pollution causes death and damage even at levels deemed safe by the environmental protection agency the european union and the world health organization who according to a third study published this month in the lancet what the data shows long term exposure to pm 2 5 and other compounds produced by burning fossil fuels leads to higher rates of heart disease lung cancer and childhood asthma even at levels below those deemed safe by the epa eu and who the study found what is pm 2 5 pm2 5 stands for fine particulate matter often emitted by combustion or in wildfire ash that are 2 5 micrometers or 20 to 30 times smaller than a human hair their tiny size allows them to bypass the hairs and mucous membranes that the body uses to protect itself against contaminants penetrating deep into the bloodstream and leading to lung vascular and heart disease that study looked at the impacts posed by breathing in low levels of no2 ozone o3 pm 2 5 and black carbon soot all common byproducts of burning fossil fuels in cars and power plants it found that long term exposure to these compounds was correlated with higher rates of death from lung cancer and respiratory disease the study found takeaway the studies on increased asthma and mortality underscore the urgency of improving urban air quality and reducing reliance of fossil fuels in and around our cities said robert hughes of the london school of hygiene tropical medicine in a statement while the specific policies to do this vary from city to city a common theme is that we need to radically cut down on the combustion of fossil fuels everywhere put simply we need to stop burning stuff especially where we live hughes said specifically hughes explained cutting down on combustion means moving away from using fossil fuels for home heating and to power electric utilities and transportation medical monday dangerous packaging omicron breaks hospitals and colombians win a dignified death fda must address endocrine disrupting

latin america s leftist leaders hailed the december election of gabriel boric in chile while investors pulled back leading the country s currency and stock market to fall yet boric has the chance to surprise both sides carving out a different left leaning political path rather than selling the economic populism of argentina or brazil or the authoritarian dogma of venezuela cuba or nicaragua boric could create a more progressive country and inclusive welfare state shedding chile s neoliberal economic model for a social democratic one would put it on the trajectory of other high income countries benefiting chile s citizens making growth more stable and sustainable and creating a new paradigm for its neighbors to follow chile has been on the economic rise since its return to democracy in 1989 three decades of market friendly neoliberal policies including privatizing public works lowering trade barriers and deregulating capital markets spurred foreign and domestic investment and economic growth this model boosted per capita incomes from less than 2 300 in 1989 to more than 15 000 today and 25 000 when measured by purchasing power parity or ppp making chile one of the few latin american nations to graduate from middle to high income in the world bank s rankings so why did a record number of chileans nonetheless turn out to vote for a candidate who promised to bury neoliberalism because as chile grew richer it didn t become more generous social spending since 1990 has remained around 10 of gross domestic product roughly half the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development average worse the structure of many public programs created a tiered system providing different and often better service to the middle and upper classes the world

its oecd peers its voucher system theoretically allows parents and students to choose any school but schools are clustered in wealthy neighborhoods creating geographic barriers for the less advantaged many private schools take the vouchers but also charge additional fees leaving them out of financial reach and a lack of teacher training and consistent curricula leads to uneven and low quality instruction particularly in less affluent public schools which have less leeway in hiring and firing instructors the setup puts poorer kids at a disadvantage chile s health care suffers similar problems of unequal access and care spending overall is minimal a third less than the oecd average and though chile legally offers universal health care the reality is that those with money get better treatment the upper crust funnels its mandatory payroll taxes into a better resourced private system while the bottom two thirds of chileans pay into a public system as happens in education the siphoning off of the wealthier and healthier to private providers leaves the state with fewer resources for the needier and sicker chile s vaunted private pension system also fails its elderly it expanded and deepened the nation s capital markets to be sure as chile s pension funds manage more than 200 billion roughly 80 of gdp but it has failed to provide social security eighty percent of retirees don t save enough to stave off penury the problem is structural individual accounts spread temporal risk across a person s lifetime they do not pool risk across society without any redistribution minimum wage workers will never be able to build up enough savings to support an adequate retirement never mind the high fees charged especially in the early years of the system which made afp private pension fund managers the most profitable arm of the nation s financial industry european nations the u s japan and other now high income market democracies created and expanded their welfare states long before they reached the per capita income levels chile enjoys today u s president franklin delano roosevelt introduced social security and unemployment insurance when average u s

healthcare pensions disability and other worker compensation throughout the late 1940s and 1950s when per capita incomes were less than 10 000 as well as japan climbed the socioeconomic ladder it vastly expanded public social programs during the 1970s when japan s per capita gdp was far lower than chile s today it doubled social spending as a percentage of gdp these outlays boosted worker productivity fewer among the economically active population were kept out of the workforce caring for the old young or infirm and increased political stability nurturing longer term and more sustainable economic growth chile s neoliberal model helped the nation climb the socioeconomic ladder but as the 2019 protests and the 2021 election results reveal that model can t keep it up there the unmitigated economic disparities leave the nation too politically fragile to maintain economic stability and growth even the international monetary fund now believes that government spending crowds in not out private investment favoring a bigger rather than smaller state of course if the boric government or constituent assembly prove to be more socialist than social democratic the naysayers will have a point but so far he has shown no love for the region s authoritarian left criticizing nicaragua cuba and venezuela and his economic proposals look to provide chileans with the government services and supports that citizens in other high income countries have long demanded and received for chile to thrive again it needs to change its thinking and more importantly its public spending a minimal state will no longer bring longer term stability for investors businesses or its people chile has successfully graduated to high income its policies need to catch up and if boric succeeds and they do chile s new president will have created a new model for latin america s left one based on both economic and political inclusion that creates stronger economies and democracies

listen to this article listen to this article washington with inflation surging unemployment falling and wages rising some economists are warning that the federal reserve may have waited too long to reverse its ultra low rate policies a delay that could put the economy at heightened risk on wednesday the government is expected to report that consumer prices jumped 7 1 over the past 12 months which would be the steepest such increase in decades fed chair jerome powell is sure to be grilled on the issue during a senate hearing tuesday on his nomination for a second four year term inflation has become the most serious threat to the economy a growing worry for the financial markets and a major political problem for the biden administration and democrats in congress while powell has many defenders who applaud the fed s willingness to keep interest rates low to help reduce unemployment after the pandemic recession friday s u s jobs report for december raised alarms it showed another sharp drop in the unemployment rate an unexpectedly large increase in hourly pay and chronic labor shortages though lower joblessness and higher pay benefit workers they can also fuel rising prices the jobs report led many economists to forecast more interest rate hikes this year than they had previously predicted as the fed scrambles to manage a rapidly shifting economy the fed is now widely expected to begin raising rates in march action that would in turn raise borrowing costs for many consumers and businesses by waiting as long as it has the fed might eventually be forced to accelerate its rate increases effectively pressing harder on the economic brakes yet that could slow growth disrupt financial markets and potentially cause a recession many past recessions have been caused by aggressive fed rate hikes that were intended to combat or prevent inflation last month in a sharp pivot toward fighting inflation the fed signaled that it expects to raise its short term benchmark rate currently near zero three times this year as recently as september policymakers had been divided over whether to raise rates even once in 2022 there is a substantial risk that the fed is sufficiently behind the curve that it will need to face the challenge of letting inflation remain persistently high or risk a recession said tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisors stocks have tumbled and bond yields have surged since the minutes of the fed s december meeting released last week showed officials likely to move more faster to tighten credit many economists now expect the fed to raise its key rate at least four times this year and according to the minutes of its december meeting fed officials are also considering moving faster to shed the nearly 8 8 trillion in treasury and mortgage bonds they hold a move that would also tighten credit the minutes indicated that the policymakers could start letting those holdings decline as the securities mature as soon as after the fed s first rate hike for now the fed s policies reflect mostly the emergency settings that have been in place since the pandemic struck in march 2020 besides pegging rates at essentially zero the fed is still buying bonds to try to hold down longer term rates those bond purchases are set to end in march yet on friday the government reported that the unemployment rate sank in december to 4 2 from 3 9 in november and is down from 6 7 a year earlier the fastest 12 month drop in the jobless rate since records began in 1948 it followed the largest increase in unemployment on record in 2020 with the number of unemployed dwindling businesses have been forced to raise hourly pay to keep and attract workers in the final three months of 2021 wages jumped at a 6 2 annual rate and for workers in restaurants hotels and casinos pay soared 14 1 in december compared with a year ago normally the fed would have raised rates long before duy said the fact that we ve barely started suggests the fed has misjudged how quickly the economy was going to come back online some economists though defend the fed s approach they echo the central bank s view that inflation will likely decline this year as the pandemic wanes the spike in spending on goods from cars to pelotons will fade as americans switch back to spending on travel and restaurant meals according to this view that will allow supply chain bottlenecks to unravel thereby reducing goods prices and they argue the fed s willingness to keep rates low even as the economy recovered helped support a faster pace of growth and hiring particularly compared with the grindingly slow recovery after the 2008 2009 recession the fed is closer to on schedule than they are to making a mistake said skanda amarnath executive director of employ america it s easy to monday morning quarterback to say that the fed should have done more last year but that would have risked leaving too many people without jobs even now the economy has 3 6 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic yet many economists argue that the fed remains too optimistic about inflation and that the rate will stay well above the fed s 2 inflation target this year what is currently expected in terms of what the fed is going to do in 2022 is just far too little said jon steinsson an economics professor at the university of california berkeley steinsson spoke saturday on a panel discussion of inflation at the annual meeting of the american economic association steinsson noted that adjusted for inflation interest rates are in negative territory despite the economy s rapid progress i think that s just way too low he said all three economists on saturday s panel steinsson jason furman a harvard economist and former top adviser to president barack obama and joseph gagnon a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and former fed economist said they thought inflation under the fed s preferred measure would remain at least 3 5 by year s end the fed thinks it will fall to 2 6 powell has frequently said that if the pandemic fades inflation will decline because supply chains will untangle and more people will take jobs but furman argued that other trends will offset some of those benefits once covid 19 cases decline he said people will likely drive more and send gas prices up and as with previous re openings of the economy prices for hotel rooms airline tickets and rental cars could climb the fed had hoped that more people would resume searching for work once enhanced unemployment aid ended nationwide in september schools also reopened that month potentially freeing up more women to return to work after caring for their children during online school yet that influx of workers didn t happen there are still 2 2 million fewer people working or looking for work than before the pandemic instead businesses desperate demand for workers with job openings near a record high in november of 10 6 million has sharply pushed up wages higher pay should enable more spending keeping upward pressure on prices furman said and rents are now rising fast gagnon said saturday that the fed has been too cautious in part because it is too concerned about preparing financial markets for policy changes particularly after 2013 back then in an episode known as the taper tantrum chairman ben bernanke unexpectedly said the fed would soon taper the bond purchases it was engaged in a remark that caused gyrations in stock and bond prices they were scarred by the taper tantrum gagnon said i think they have veered too far to the other side to try to minimize surprising markets gagnon also defended the fed though noting the complexity of the economy during the pandemic it seems incredibly slow what they re doing but they re turning a supertanker they re communicating to markets they are moving in the right direction it s clear that they re focused on the right things he said the fed can also accelerate its tightening of credit if necessary gagnon said if we are right about our inflation worries they ll be doing more than three rate hikes this year he said like this article gain access to all of our

washington ap federal reserve vice chair richard clarida said monday that he will step down on friday the third fed official to resign after a trading scandal at the central bank that involved potential conflicts of interest the announcement followed new revelations around clarida s trading in a stock fund in february 2020 when the coronavirus threatened to upend the global economy and the fed was discussing extraordinary rescue measures the new york times last week reported that clarida amended his financial disclosures in late december to show that he had sold and then repurchased shares in the stock fund within a matter of days previously clarida had reported only the purchases which came a day before chair jerome powell said the fed was prepared to support markets and the economy the fed had characterized the purchase as a simple portfolio rebalancing an explanation that was undercut by the revelation of the initial sale last year the presidents of two fed regional banks robert kaplan of the dallas fed and eric rosengren of the boston fed also stepped down after their questionable trading was revealed although the trades complied with fed financial ethics rules they raised the possibility of conflicts of interest because the officials could have profited from the actions the fed was taking at the time critics notably sen elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat sharply criticized the trades and called for a ban on stock ownership by fed officials kaplan had traded at least 1 million worth of stocks in 22 transactions in 2020 rosengren invested in an investment fund that held mortgage backed securities similar to what the fed has bought to try to hold down long term rates clarida who has been part of an inner circle of fed officials close to powell and known as the troika was scheduled to finish his term at the end of this month instead he will instead resign about two weeks early by doing so he will miss what would have been his final meeting scheduled for jan 25 26 clarida began his position in september 2018 after having taught at columbia university and having worked for 12 years for the investment fund manager pimco he received deferred bonuses and stock from his work at pimco and when he joined the fed in 2018 clarida s financial disclosures which report assets in a range of values estimated his wealth at between 9 million and 39 million after those resignations were announced powell unveiled new ethics rules around trading by fed board members and other top officials the rules bar fed officials from owning individual stocks or bonds and require 45 days advance notice of any trade

nationally and locally for what will be an expensive race for re election during an interview with fox news radio s brian kilmeade johnson presented himself as a candidate under siege by the democratic party their allies in the media and big tech they ve been viciously attacking me falsely attacking me johnson said running millions of dollars of ads the politics of personal destruction johnson added i ll be talking about how disastrous their democratic policies are and trying to restore confidence in our institutions and in the minds of the american public we do need to unify and heal this nation that s what i hope i can turn this campaign into after publicly weighing a run for more than a year johnson is seeking to quickly build out his campaign dylan lefler has been brought in as campaign manager during the 2020 cycle lefler served as campaign manager for arizona republican martha mcsally in her unsuccessful run for u s senate most recently he was convention director for virginia republican glenn youngkin who was elected governor virginia based fp1 strategies will serve as the campaign s general consultant johnson s campaign did not announce how much money it was putting behind the first ads but said the 30 second spots are due to air for several weeks tens of millions of dollars are expected to be spent in one of the country s pivotal contests with control of the u s senate at stake democrats will be spending on two tracks ahead of the aug 9 primary with candidates trying to get their messages out while the party and its allies aim to define johnson with voters more meet the democrats already running for ron johnson s seat in wisconsin s 2022 senate race johnson s first ad salvos were his attempt to shape the contours of the race in an ad titled stand and fight the 66 year old oshkosh republican said democrat policies have been disastrous for america and as news footage played he spoke of the 2020 summer riots defunding the police lowering bail and not prosecuting criminals and he talked of kenosha set on fire a growing number of murders in milwaukee and the waukesha christmas parade turned into a terrible tragedy the latter a reference to a low 1 000 bail recommended in an earlier case involving waukesha parade suspect darrell brooks milwaukee county district attorney john chisholm a democrat said the bail recommendation was made in error by a prosecutor under his supervision in a reference to his decision to break a campaign pledge to serve only two terms johnson explained it feels like our country is being torn apart that s not how it felt when i ran in 2016 back then i intended to serve a second term and go home but now with democrats in total control our nation is on a very dangerous path if you re in a position to help make our country safer and stronger would you just walk away i ve decided i can t i ll stand and fight for freedom state democrats had a message of their own for johnson putting up billboards in milwaukee beloit eau claire kenosha and oshkosh attacking the senator on taxes ron johnson s top priority has been enriching himself and his biggest donors at the expense of wisconsinites democratic party of wisconsin chair ben wikler said we re reminding wisconsinites that johnson who has repeatedly tried to raise costs for hardworking wisconsinites doesn t think the ultra wealthy like him need to pay their fair share of taxes the democratic senatorial campaign committee also went up with a digital and cable ad buy contending johnson has been looking out for himself among other assertions the ad references his work on a key provision of the 2017 tax cut pro publica reported that johnson s provision a tax break for small businesses and other pass through entities benefited wealthy americans including two of the biggest forces in republican politics in wisconsin and nationally johnson has denied the accusation that he was doing the bidding for his donors campaigns for democratic u s senate candidates alex lasry and sarah godlewski also went up with digital spots against johnson lasry s ad used news footage and charged johnson with being an insurrection denier a covid denier and a climate change denier while in her ad godlewski said johnson is now running and we must stop him outagamie county executive tom nelson issued a challenge to johnson and his fellow democrats in the senate race to back a proposal to ban members of congress and their families from buying and selling individual stocks the issue has flared after house speaker nancy pelosi d california defended the right of lawmakers and their spouses to trade stocks look when you go to congress just do your job nelson said in a video statement you don t need to be day trading like gordon gekko just get mutual funds and cd s like the rest of us

and ceo irwin simon irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you berrin and hello everyone we thank you for joining us for our call this morning and as the operator just noted i want to recognize the new additions to our call today including blair macneil president of our canadian business who will speak on the evolution of our canadian business and the canadian market and denise faltischek president of our international business and chief strategy officer who will speak on our global operations and its strength at the heel of international growth and legalization across europe for all of the reasons we will discuss this morning we re excited to be announcing a new parent name for our company tilray brands inc our new name reflects our evolution from a canadian lp to a global consumer packaged goods company and branded powerhouse with a market leading portfolio of cannabis and lifestyle cpg brands that are empowering the worldwide community to live their very best life through the completion of our business combination last year we positioned tilray as a disruptive cannabis industry leader with a portfolio highly sought after brand that bring people together in a memorable and positive way contribute significant operation scale benefit from a broad global distribution footprint and last but not least that are flourishing from hands on cbg expertise and operational excellence across the board the economic engine driving shareholder value is our model that seeks to generate current cash flow positive ebitda while adding the infrastructure production facilities and distribution networks to capitalize on long term growth opportunities that come with increasing acceptance of medical and recreational use of cannabis globally and ongoing cannabis legalization this is the heart of tilray s value proposition and it s unique among our peer set most importantly this model constitutes the road map to 4 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal 2024 as our results today underscore we are making tangible and notable progress toward executing against this opportunity despite challenging conditions in certain key markets and geographies despite the continuing challenging backdrop driven by covid and other competitive considerations we delivered growth in the second quarter compared to a year ago we also deeply gratified with second quarter results included in our 11th consecutive quarter of positive adjusted ebitda a strong affirmation of our ability to achieve topline growth and appear with smart disciplined operations acumen while there are multiple factors that contribute to this relatively strong outcome none is more notable than the grit hard work and resilience of tilray s global team they are performing admirably under some trying conditions and i m immensely proud of their ability to execute second we have been proficient and flexible in terms of simplifying our supply chain particularly in light of today s headwinds facing our businesses this combined with our production and cultivation efficiencies we have gained through the integration have allowed us to partially offset the negative impacts of covid and current cost pressures impacting every segment of the global economy importantly we believe there are temporary headwinds which when they abate and conditions normalize put us in even stronger position for growth as we capitalize on our leading brands our distribution network our proven execution skills and our strong financial profile and scale in canada europe u s and the opportunities around the rest of the world with that i will now turn the call over to blair macneil for discussions on our canadian business blair blair macneil president canadian business thank you irwin and i m very pleased to be here speaking with all of you today and providing an update on our canadian business i m excited to have joined the tilray team from bacardi where i successfully ran their canadian business for the last five years i see tremendous growth for tilray in the canadian market bringing new consumers into the market and taking consumers away from the illicit market at the highest level this market remains defined by an oversaturation of licensed producers and retail stores leading to unsustainable price compression and lack of profitability i want to be clear we do not believe this is a sustainable environment the strong will survive so we view this as a temporary pain point and an opportunity namely we are being more aggressive to win share capitalizing on our iconic and leading brands our innovation pipeline industry leading cultivation capabilities boots on the ground provided to us through our expanded distribution partnership with great north distributors and the strength of our balance sheet importantly even in this intensive price competitive market we have maintained our no 1 leading market share position in canada and leading positions across our portfolio of brands with top rankings across adult use product categories such as concentrates edibles flower oil pre rolls topical vapes and beverages based on recent high fire sales data in canada for the month of september through november still in the second full quarter since completion of the business combination our retail market share declined to 12 8 from 16 in the sequential period because of the heightened price deflation as i alluded to our pricing strategy is to defend share to a point but we will not severely compromise margins and to protect our gross margin we are implementing several initiatives to ensure we have the right cost index to compete profitably to be clear our canadian market share strategy is to execute relentlessly and with the precision across two main fronts that complement and reinforce each other first the strategic price reductions will drive near and long term growth in our fastest growing category vapes and pre rolls and position us for strong upside when the market consolidates further second we are ramping up initiatives to educate and bring in new consumers through many different fronts including partnering with retail and budtenders and delivering a more aggressive marketing strategy and product innovation pipeline through business intelligence and insights on the medical front we are also rolling out new tilray medical website and patient platform that gives patients access to all four medical brands and enhances their experience this includes tilray medical aphria medical broken coast medical and symbios in short we have the scale and resources in canada to allow us to double down on brand and strategically win with that i ll now turn the call over to denise faltischek denise denise faltischek president international business and chief strategy officer thank you blair and thank you all for joining us today internationally our presence continues to grow we now offer branded medical cannabis in 20 countries around the world reflecting the trust that governments healthcare professionals and patients place in us every day importantly over the past five years while everyone else was focused on other markets we were focused on europe we strategically invested acquired and built a strong infrastructure team and business across the eu which has twice the population of the u s and 20 times the size of canada just within the last couple of months policy discussions on the legalization of cannabis for adult use has intensified throughout europe with germany and portugal being the most prominent candidates the dominoes are beginning to fall and tilray is uniquely and optimally positioned when they do our two state of the art cultivation facilities in portugal and germany provide eu gmp certified pharmaceutical grade medical cannabis and we have sales and distribution arrangements to supply cannabinoid based medicine through major pharmaceutical distribution channels this includes among others our wholly owned subsidary cc pharma in germany which has preferred access to approximately 13 000 pharmacies and grow pharma in the u k notably tilray is the only company currently supplying the german government with medical cannabis cultivated in country and we are the market leader across germany in medical cannabis extracts and dried flower combined which helps to ensure that patient need in germany are met with products of the highest quality and safety while at the same time ensuring consistent supply and reducing dependence on importation in germany our revenue related to medical cannabis extract products grew 16 versus last quarter and we now had a market share of 64 in the extract market our revenue related to dried flower products grew 10 versus last quarter and we now have a market share of approximately 16 in the dried flower market as of november tilray is now the market leader in germany with an overall market share of approximately 20 our strong reputation in product quality and safety and science based cannabis research also puts us in an excellent position to capture the enormous opportunity for both medical and adult use legalization in the eu and that time may be near on the horizon because germany s incoming government coalition has reached an agreement to legalize adult use cannabis nationwide within the framework of our regulated market in terms of population germany would then become the largest country in the world to permit the sale of adult use cannabis on a federal basis and when that milestone does occur we believe we have a head start on the competition based on our eu gmp certified cultivation facility currently operating in neumunster germany which has additional capacity to immediately support the recreational market and we have a track record backed by science technology and quality control standards to offer high quality adult use cannabis brands and products on a consistent basis that we are confident would be well received in the market we are also a market leader within other countries in europe where we have achieved the following in portugal we are the only approved medical cannabis product in the market with our t18 dried flower which is distributed through our distribution partners to medical stakeholders throughout portugal in luxembourg we were selected by the luxembourg ministry of health as the exclusive supplier for the country s medical cannabis program for dried flower and oils in switzerland we distribute our cannabinoid based medical extract products to swiss patients through our local partner in france we were selected as one of four suppliers in a two year pilot experiment to supply approximately 3 000 patients with medical cannabis this experiment was to inform a regulatory framework for medical cannabis going forward and we expect a french medical market to be in the order of magnitude of germany in italy we are one of five distributors licensed to import medical cannabis into the italian medical market in the u k in the quarter we completed our first shipment of broad range dried flower products with high medium and balanced potencies into the u k market in addition we are one of only three suppliers within the irish market whose cannabinoid based medical products are eligible for reimbursement as we look ahead with respect to legalization more broadly we expect all of europe to legal medical use cannabis within the next 12 to 24 months and certain countries legalizing adult use thereafter right now there are compelling signs that portugal and israel are also gearing up for adult use market outside of the eu our businesses in australia and new zealand are performing very well with tilray branded extracts and flowers leading the market to give some highlights tilray was the first company to have both purified cbd and balanced thc extracts registered in new zealand by meeting their high quality standards this took effect october 1 and the rollout of our products is going very well patients now have accessibility to all four tilray products offered in the market and we are well positioned to drive ongoing growth in australia the reputation and trust in our brands continues to grow to give an example through a contract with the department of health of victoria 90 children are now participating in a government funded seizure program using our products which will continue until the end of 2024 consistent with this growing trust in our brands more national pharmacies in australia have requested tilray product by name driving a 29 increase in revenue quarter over quarter in fact our performance would have been stronger had our sales team not been prevented by covid lockdowns from promoting our products face to face turning to the rest of the world we see additional opportunities in argentina where we benefit from our distributor relationship with abp in brazil and even china and india so in short our international opportunities are tremendous and i look forward to keeping you updated on our progress i ll now turn the call over to irwin for a discussion of our u s operations before call closes the prepared portion of our remarks with a detailed financial overview irwin irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you denise and blair and in the u s i want to start with our cpg businesses sweetwater brewing manitoba harvest and our new addition breckenridge distillery which together generate approximately 150 million an annualized revenue and profitable ebitda and have exciting potential for future growth to offer some insight utilizing our current footprint in the u s today we re able to invest in these strong brands meaningfully expand their presence and leverage their distribution systems to parlay into cbd beverages cbd personal cares and related adjacencies the free option at play is that these attributes will later be translated into thc businesses in addition to our beverage alcohol businesses upon federal legalization in the u s much like our medmen investment we ll continue to explore thc options in the u s market once additional clarity is available sweetwater is known for its 420 beers among othersk but since our acquisition of the business a year ago we ve expanded the product line to include spirits ready to drink vodka sodas in a can in collaboration with our canadian cannabis brand riff as well as hard teas and lemonades and new craft beers including a new imperial ipa and a bc lager in collaboration with our award winning canadian craft cannabis brand broken coast it is our intention to make u s beer consumers more aware of our canadian cannabis brands prior to federal legalization because we have data that shows that beer drinking consumers are often cannabis users too we have even more opportunities with sweetwater down the road such as developing cbd products or infusing nonalcoholic spirits with thc in addition to the new sweetwater taproom located at denver international airport and please visit it on your trips we also recently acquired a second sweetwater brewery and taproom in fort collins colorado both which enables sweetwater to pursue their expansion through the rest of the u s and in the western states just a few weeks ago we announced the acquisition of breckenridge distillery widely known for its award winning bourbon whiskey collection and innovative craft spirits portfolio including bourbon whiskey gin and vodka breckenridge is an exceptional leading brand that has current distribution across 50 states working with its founder brian nolt and his team all of them who remain in place we plan to bring our cpg brand building expertise to bear and make targeted investments in marketing brand awareness and increased distribution even now breckenridge will benefit from synergies on the distribution side when paired with sweetwater we are confident that these steps will drive growth both now and in the future i should note that both sweetwater and breckenridge distilleries our business that are cash flow positive ebitda positive earnings accretive and can be leveraged for cannabis when federally permissible sweetwater s distribution currently reaches over 47 000 on and off premise points of sale and we are continuing to build the business right before year end sweetwater announced the acquisition of alpine beer and green flash iconic west coast craft beer brands to be brewed in our new fort collins facility for west coast distribution all of which complements sweetwater s existing product offerings and give us a strong foothold in california and the west part of the united states the largest state economy in the u s and the largest legal cannabis market in the world i spent my career building cpg brands with teams that i work with today and if we brought this expertise to tilray with an ability to identify and significantly expand leading cbg lifestyle brands that residate power fleet with consumers even without legalization we can therefore grow these brands while building all the sets and pieces for the immensely positive impact that legalization will bring one day with this in mind i m excited about the very fast growth of the spirits category in the u s and we re exploring additional opportunities to build out our beverage alcohol business through more categories and of course brands these cbg deals in turn ensure access to even more potential and deal flow and accretive ebitda for us turning now to manitoba harvest we have stabilized the business since assuming ownership by rebuilding its core hemp food portfolio in the latest 12 weeks our u s consumption in measured channels is up 2 on manitoba harvest a significant turnaround from the double digit decline the brand was experienced at the time of our business combination we intend to accelerate the business through 2022 as we re introducing a great deal of product innovation that will enable us to capitalize oor consumers interest in hemp products aligned with plant based low carb or keto diets as a certified b corp manitoba harvest is committed to educating consumers of both the nutritional benefits and the sustainability of hemp as we grow consumer trial and awareness of hemp foods additionally we are leveraging our ingredient division to collaborate with cbg partners who are incorporating hemp seed hemp protein and hemp oil into their brands our tilray wellness business is also developing multiple cbd beverage products for launch in 2022 we ll take full advantage of our beverage manufacturing capabilities to deliver these innovative products to market manitoba harvest products are currently available in 17 000 stores in the u s as with sweetwater there is room to run beyond that as we grow each of these brands we will be able to use these distribution systems to parlay into cbd beverages personal care products and related adjacencies these may later be translated into thc based products upon federal legalization in both cases we do not need to expend significant capital build production facilities or distribution networks they already exist and can be leveraged we are setting the standard manitoba harvest has the opportunity to become a multiple hundred million dollar company this is a clear reflection of the fact that even now before federal legalization we re building out our u s infrastructure through cannabis adjacent products putting the pieces in place to drive revenue growth today and to allow us to hit the ground wanting once legalization occurs and these assets can be more fully leveraged that being said we view our ability to go on day 1 as important in that process which is why we invested in convertible notes of medmen we have multiple benefiting options regarding medmen more broadly we continue to build our strategic position through multiple alternatives so that can we fully benefit from legalization when the time comes of course we could take additional options on multiple msos now but this approach only provides options since we cannot recognize revenue or ebitda from the underlying businesses and are dependent upon regulation to realize the full benefits of these options moving on i will touch on our progress in delivering the 80 million in cost synergies we ve identified as part of the tilray aphria business combination in short we are ahead of our original pace having reached 70 million on a run rate basis to date with actual cash savings close to 36 million carl will speak in more detail on our progress against the synergy goals in a minute in conclusion to sum up before i turn the call over to carl tilray s business model which is based on current value we are generating from our business in canada international and u s plus the upside that comes with legalization is the backbone of our strategic plan and we remain on track despite headwinds our strategy and team are in place and executing and we are leading and differentiating our market position and we are looking at all ongoing opportunities to drive synergies reduce production costs and a strong pipeline of transaction and growth opportunities worldwide at the same time we are cognizant of the near term challenges facing our business and the current pressure on our shares and that of our industry and the global economy in general omicron is likely to exasperate these challenges while unfortunate neither to tear us from executing on our mission to further build our position in the global cannabis industry in fact they enable us to make investments and adjustments now that we ll pay even bigger dividends when the market and the global economy normalizes we have the brands we have the team we have the plan in place all to drive consumer demand and we will reward our shareholders and allow us to win and with that carl will now discuss our financials in greater detail carl carl merton chief financial officer thank you irwin let s now discuss our relative strength during q2 the synergies we are successfully building into our business model as well as our cash and liquidity position at the highest level the quarter was unquestionably impacted by a variety of factors including as blair mentioned marketplace saturation in canada and the impact of covid on our operations importantly we are confident that the medium to long term implications of these challenges play to our favor particularly in terms of our ability to implement strategy that will ensure we win market share we are therefore more confident than ever concerning our organizational objective to emerge from these short term market challenges stronger more diversified and more profitable through our execution of our key competitive differentiators as with prior quarters i want to remind everyone that as a result of the arrangement between aphria and tilray our results in the prior fiscal quarter are based on aphria s financial statements but have since been adjusted to follow u s gaap and are presented in u s dollars additionally recall that in july 2021 we published an appendix to our investor deck located on our website that contains an unaudited analyst primer which breaks down aphria s u s gaap financial statements for fiscal 2020 and 2021 by quarter please also note that throughout our call today we will reference both our financial results in accordance with gaap as well as our non gaap adjusted financial results our earnings press release contains a reconciliation of our reported financial results under gaap to the non gaap financial measures identified during our remarks starting with the topline despite a challenging environment our q2 net revenue grew 20 compared to q2 last year although the comparison itself is not apples to apples because the year ago quarter does not include any contributions from legacy tilray we achieved our 11th straight quarter of positive adjusted ebitda particularly in a market where revenue was a challenge speaks volumes to our relentless focus on operational and cost efficiencies our overall planning capabilities and the success in integration and executing on the synergies we identified in the tilray aphria combination over the past year we have continually challenged market expectations on profitability and delivered superior results each time from a medical standpoint there was similar downward pressure caused by covid from patients unable or unwilling to see a doctor as well as increased competition from adult rec and related price compression ultimately we believe that consumer demand for higher quality brands will rise once the pandemic wanes and budtenders are able to more positively influence purchasing decisions and then we will be best positioned to capitalize on that opportunity similar to how consumers behave with regards to other products such as alcohol turning to our beverage business sweetwater on premise demand remains impacted by covid off premise channels look to be stronger in the future with our new innovation pipeline and increased distribution points new leadership product innovation and operating improvements have stabilized manitoba harvest with its revenue contribution relatively flat from the sequential quarter and margins basically unchanged after managing through the changes associated with moving from branded product at a big box retailer to a white label product we are pleased with its revenue contribution in q2 finally while cc pharma experienced a decline in net revenue a major part of the decline was tied to the strengthening of the u s dollar and the inherent weakening of the euro versus the prior year period more specifically if the euro u s dollar exchange rate had been the same in the current quarter as it was a year ago cc pharma would have reported an additional 5 3 million of revenue before we turn to profitability it is important to note we performed a detailed review of our inventory as part of the quarter as part of our review we identified an adjustment of 8 million in the value we originally described to inventory and 6 million in the value we originally ascribed to prepaids and other current assets as part of our reverse purchase of tilray during the current quarter and prior to having finalized the purchase price accounting for the transaction we reduced the inventory in prepaids and other current assets on the transaction date by 14 million and correspondingly adjusted deferred taxes in goodwill these adjustments did not flow through the income statement at the same time and as part of the inventory review we identified inventory acquired in the transaction whose cost due to price compression in the market was now higher than our expected selling price for the inventory accordingly we recorded an inventory impairment of 12 million in the quarter with the vast majority of the write down reflecting this higher priced inherited inventory from the transaction in a challenging revenue environment operating excellence can play an outsized role and that s certainly true as we turn to bottom line performance despite the headwinds we ve all discussed here today our team worked hard to optimize performance and as a result we increased net income by almost 96 million to 6 billion from the prior year quarter as well as improved our adjusted gross margin to 29 from 27 in the quarter on a year over year basis further we reported our 11th consecutive quarter of positive adjusted ebitda which increased to 13 8 million from 10 1 million a year ago importantly we are confident our profitability will increase as more of our operating synergies become embedded within the platform particularly by converting the legacy tilray brands to aphria s cost structure on a pro forma basis for example if aphria s cost structure had been applied to the legacy tilray brands in canada during q2 we believe that our adjusted gross profit would have been 3 8 million higher recall that aphria has been a low cost producer with strong cultivation processing and manufacturing facility and we are now pulling additional costs out of that structure to gain further efficiencies while improving product potency and quality to meet market demand adjusted free cash flow improved to negative 16 million from negative 53 million last quarter as we said last quarter we believe that our first few quarters as a combined entity would likely see negative cash flows however as we achieved our synergies we would be working toward sustaining free cash flow generation which we believe will generate sustainable shareholder value turning now to the business integration we are making meaningful progress optimizing operations and as we focus on reaching at least 80 million of synergies within the first 18 months post transaction to date synergies achieved have reached 70 million on a run rate basis and 36 million of actual cash savings further we are pleased to announce that we now anticipate reaching our 80 million synergy target within a little over 12 months of closing the transaction or by our current year end on may 31 additionally we are pleased to announce that we anticipate generating an additional 20 million in synergies from the transaction that will be achieved during our fiscal 2023 year now let s discuss q2 in greater detail within cannabis our medical business grew primarily due to contributions from the legacy tilray an innovative new products including the june launch of our new brand symbios which addresses unmet medical needs and provides patients with more choices in managing their health conditions with medical products still we experienced a lower number of existing patient renewals and lower numbers of new patients in both independent and clinic patients because they were unable or unwilling to see a doctor our adult use business on a net basis declined year over year despite contributions from the business combination because of the move to price based brands more competition and more aggressive price discounting during covid and while we took the proactive measures to adjust our pricing and rationalize some skus during q2 as discussed earlier our cannabis gross margin fell as a result of the price protection provided to our customers as part of our pricing adjustments as a result of our pricing changes we anticipate a minor fall in our cannabis gross margins going forward but we believe we will remain industry leading while our adult use business experienced a revenue decline the strong performer of the quarter was our international cannabis business where we reported a 227 increase in revenues from the prior year net cannabis revenue rose 7 to 58 7 million for the quarter net distribution revenue fell 7 to 68 9 million for the quarter net revenues at sweetwater were 13 7 million slightly down from the prior quarter net revenues from our wellness business in manitoba harvest were 13 8 million which was relatively flat sequentially and for which there is no comparable to the previous year we view this business as largely stabilized at this point under the leadership of jared simon all of this led to net revenue increasing 20 to 155 2 million in q2 over the prior year period with the increase primarily driven by the contributions from legacy tilray for which there was no comparable in the prior year and sweetwater for which the comparable was only five days in the same period adjusted cannabis gross profit remained flat at 25 5 million in q2 while adjusted cannabis gross margin remained strong but fell to 43 from 46 this reflects in part our proactive and decisive steps to adjust our cost structure and reduced production costs through the integration process leading to some temporary inefficiencies during this transitional phase but ultimately this hard work now will yield greater efficiencies going forward distribution gross profit decreased to 7 6 million in q2 while distribution gross margin declined to 11 as a result of the impacts of covid on cc pharma sales mix beverage alcohol gross profit was 7 8 million in q2 and there was no meaningful comparable in the prior year as the acquisition was completed last november beverage alcohol gross margin was 57 which was on par with the sequential quarter despite the drop in revenue up below the 60 we achieved in the prior year wellness gross profit was 3 8 million and gross margin was 28 which was in line with our expectations and for which there were no comparables last year in aggregate adjusted gross margin increased slightly to 29 compared to the prior year while adjusted gross profit rose 27 to 44 8 million as we continue to achieve our synergy plan over the coming quarters and as our nondistribution revenues increased their share of our total revenues we expect to see continued improvement in this metric for the quarter we reported net income of approximately 6 million compared to a net loss of 89 million in q2 last year turning to cash flow and liquidity adjusted free cash flow was negative 16 million during q2 and reflected 17 million of net cash used for operations 7 million in investments in capital and intangible assets offset by 8 1 million of cash expended related to our acquisitions again as i said earlier we view achieving free cash flow on a consistent basis as a priority for this business while we certainly fell short in q2 the negative adjusted free cash flow was within expectations given the integration of the tilray assets and represents a substantial improvement of over 37 million from the prior quarter we also still maintain a strong cash position of 332 million as of november 30 to both support our existing working capital requirements and our business plan as we look forward and get beyond the near term challenges due to covid and the omicron variant we see good reason for optimism first there will likely be a rightsizing of the canadian market that candidly will be accelerated as the dramatic impact of omicron variant impacts consumer behavior across the board further continued pricing levels below cost levels for the vast majority of our competitors are not sustainable through the benefit of time we believe those pressures will be removed second the movement toward legalization is continuing with the anticipated legalization of recreational cannabis in germany we believe other eu countries will follow suit moreover we are continuing to invest in our u s assets including sweetwater and manitoba harvest which are already cash flow and ebitda positive earnings accretive and will be leveraged for cannabis along with other recent acquisitions such as breckenridge alpine beer and green flash brewing that will be accretive to our portfolio across all markets and geographies we are expanding our energies and resources on executing on our highest return priorities actualizing our business integration to better manage costs and capturing and delivering value for our shareholders this concludes our prepared remarks thank you for your interest in tilray we ll now begin the question segment of our call starting with questions from our covering analysts which will be followed by a few questions from our retail shareholders from the say platform operator what s the first question questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen please proceed with your question vivien azer cowen and company analyst hi good morning and happy new year irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer happy new year vivien vivien azer cowen and company analyst so you guys have been active from an m a standpoint in the alcoholic beverage market makes good sense irwin as you articulated in terms of the long term leverage ability of those assets but in the near term it is a bit of a different network so i d be curious just to hear your thoughts on any kind of synergy opportunities you see across those assets any incremental m a kind of build more alcohol assets in the u s thanks irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer hey vivien we have a little technical problem so i m going to have to pause it we re going to have to talk over a fire alarm that just went off anyway just in regards to that listen i think what we saw with sweetwater brewery number one very quickly we rolled out our riff brand and we rolled out our broken coast brand and i think beverage is a major major part of the whole cannabis industry the second thing is this year i think one day when this does happen that the opportunity replace alcohol with thc and i ve said this before the brands that are out there today whether it s sweetwater whether it s breckenridge are brands that consumers know and we will have the opportunity to get into the markets with thc products i come back and i look at the whole bourbon category is such a fast growing category and one day to be able to come out with a bourbon that s infused with thc under the breckenridge name which we would have an alcohol business we d have a thc business the third part is listen as you come back today to look to build brands out there and you saw we changed the name of the company the tilray brand company and you look at valuations multiples the spirit industry is similar to the cannabis industry in many ways and there s many crossovers our study shows that consumers who consume alcohol are also cannabis users so a lot of synergies and listen our partner in canada southern glazer in regards to our distribution piece of the business that s the opportunity here in the u s so i see a tremendous amount of synergies and these deals a are accretive and there s good growth in these industries for us and one of the big things vivien you can t do is just wait for the u s to legalize and i think what the important thing is us being in adjacency categories that got growth that got accretion and that give us opportunities in the marketplace vivien azer cowen and company analyst understood thank you very much irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes through the line of andrew carter with stifel please proceed with your question andrew carter stifel financial corp analyst hey thanks good morning i guess i want to step back and think through the canadian adult use business i think first off kind of the pressure on your market share actually post integration of tilray is could you diagnose is it all a function of the pricing and now that you re putting some price investments in place do you think you ll be able to grow revenue at a level to where your actual canadian profitability will grow from here thanks irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer good morning andrew so i m going to start it and then i m going to turn it over to blair macneil who is newly appointed president of canada but yeah i think i came back for a second as this year number one the canadian market is continuously going through its challenges there s more stores opening up there s more lps out there and also there s pricing and i come back and i look at here we have 12 brands we re going through sku rationalization we re going through brand rationalization and also if you come back to the liquor control boards they re also going through sku and brand rationalization and i think what s important is what tilray has we re going to have brands we re going to have innovation we re going to have products that consumers want because we re going to build our brands and that s why we changed the name to the tilray branded company the other thing is andrew i think what s important is our products are growing in our leamington facility our broken coast facility that s going to be consistent with quality going to be consistent with regulatory and going to be able to deliver potency so with that yes we have lost share in the marketplace some of it was self inflicted on ourselves but the easiest thing is just go drop price and great share but we re here to build something for a long term blair do you want to add something to that blair macneil president canadian business yeah well thanks irwin i would say first of all on the diagnosis side it s very clear the inventory levels and a lot of lps are unsustainable and to get rid of those inventories they re doing two things one is they are compressing prices and if you look in the last year we ve come down in price 1 7 while the market has come down 22 6 so we have definitely protected our margins on the way down and i think as an lp we have more room than a lot of our competitors do to be able to take some smart pricing so that s number one i d say the other form of this new of this oversupply of inventory is meant new brands 157 new brands were launched in the last year so the market is getting very dilutive and we are going to ramp up our innovation in a big way to fight that so we will take some strategic price but we will also do it with an industry leading innovation portfolio behind our big brands which irwin just talked about and i think the most important thing and final part of your question is can we do it profitably and yes we think we can we have big scale we have some cost opportunities that we realized through the synergies but we have further costs that we can take out of this business to make sure we can do this and grow our gross margins it s going to be a little bit of a bumpy ride over the next couple of quarters but certainly we re in a i would say the best position to be able to weather it irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer andrew i think the big thing is listen one of the things we re dealing with is a world called covid we re also dealing with supply chain issues and products and stuff like that and at the end as we brought these two companies together and took out 70 million of cost and look at more opportunities i think that s what the important part here is and there s a big opportunity in the canadian market right now 50 of the market going through the legal market where there s additional illicit market you heard carl talk about the opportunities for us in the medical market so the industry is three years old in canada i think there s lots of opportunities and yes there could be additional m a opportunities for us in the canadian market andrew carter stifel financial corp analyst thanks will pass it on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald please proceed with your question pablo zuanic cantor fitzgerald analyst good morning thank you irwin can i ask about the jv with anheuser busch just if you can give some back on about the termination jv and if i like to put a positive twist on it does that give you more flexibility in pursuing partnerships with other cbg companies or that was never an issue and if i may add one for denise and thank you for all that color denise that was very helpful so a big jump sequentially about 40 sequential growth in exports is that a normalized run rate that we should think about for the next few quarters if you can give more color there would help denise thank you irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you pablo and good morning and happy new year i think listen the opportunity with abi and i think very early on even before the transaction closed we had discussions with abi and it made sense to terminate this deal it was not a great deal for tilray number one number two in the canadian market abi just did not want to do thc products and number three it was a major money losing relationship there and with that with our own infrastructure and our own distributor base with distributors in the beer business us knowing that business and with no growth but big losses it just made sense and it was mutually for both of us to terminate we still have a relationship with them in regards to a co pack relationship in doing a cbd product for them but that s ultimately it was not any type of a hostile issue it just made sense economically it made sense for us and it made sense for them and listen it can create there s a lot of other beverage companies out there we have a lot of other relationships in the beer distribution business and one of the big things we acquired was a facility and we re the ones that have the facility in regards to producing and manufactured drinks today whether it s cbd or thc so that s the whole thing with abi and part of our synergies came from closing down this joint venture denise denise faltischek president international business and chief strategy officer thanks irwin pablo nice to hear from you just in terms of your question in terms of run rate for europe so we are looking at a 37 run rate for the rest of the year now just as a note of like sort of caution in our numbers are oftentimes shipments into other countries and as you know with regulatory framework sometimes that s the timing of that doesn t always work out the way we want to with import and export permits but there were there was a shipment into luxembourg there was our first shipment into the u k and so just but cautioning just said with a 37 there could be some changes in the other quarters irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer and i think pablo the thing is this year we re excited about the european market today and i ve said it how do we get to 1 billion in europe it s got to depend upon legalization in certain countries but you ve heard germany talk about it and we are working with the german government right now in ways that this is going to happen it s probably going to get announced soon it will probably take maybe 12 to 18 months before it can happen and you will see potentially portugal and other countries go ahead because of the tax you even see mark holm talking about it in france in regards to his election in may that is something that he will have on his election platform and with our facility in portugal with our facility in germany and with our cc pharma we re well positioned for that marketplace and as denise said i mean right now there s 20 plus countries in europe today that do sell medical cannabis and we look to enhance those sales pablo zuanic cantor fitzgerald analyst great thank you irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rupesh parikh with oppenheimer please proceed with your question rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst good morning thanks for taking our questions also happy new year so i guess i just wanted to just touch on the covid backdrop in canada if you guys can just help us understand what you re seeing right now in canada and then as we look at the business in the current quarter would you expect the cannabis part of it to take a step back versus what you just did in q2 irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer so canada and ontario and a lot of the different provinces are shut down blair i ll let you go ahead and take that since you re in ontario right now and you re the one dealing with the offices closed and restaurants closed but cannabis stores are still open which is the good news the only thing you have to show your vaccine card before you can enter and that s the same with the control boards the other good news is people are staying home so hopefully they re consuming more alcohol and consuming more cannabis blair blair macneil president canadian business yeah thank you irwin yeah in terms of the covid effect i think over the last almost two years we ve seen the similar issues so the ability to get capacity limits in store which making sure our distribution team can get out there and talk about tenders and be in stores so that is a little slower than what we d like some of the supply chain things that irwin mentioned earlier similar and but we are seeing on the opportunity for consumption we are seeing increases on that side so i d say the covid is nothing unexpected to what we ve seen so far in response to your question about the q3 numbers we are forecasting in our q3 business so we definitely think that our pipeline of innovation some of the strategic pricing moves we ve made will result in increased revenue versus q2 balance of year irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer and rupesh i think the big thing is this year covid is something that s been around for two years and the bad news is still around for two years the good news is we re getting used to dealing with it and how to deal with it and with that we have made a tremendous amount of improvements to our business keeping our employees safe keeping our offices open doing things online and making sure we sell into the budtenders and that s where our partnership with southern glazer that has the boots on the street to get into the stores and market to these budtenders the other thing is working with the liquor control boards to make sure we have inventories in regards to being able to ship to them and in the last quarter because of labor not having labor we lost multiple sales on pre rolls some of the control boards took down their inventories because of concerns of covid and that s already gone through our numbers so there s lots of things that have happened and there s lots of things that reflect in our numbers because of covid but i think as blair said we re in a good place and having blair on board today who came through the spirits industry with five years with bacardi knowing how to work with the control boards knowing how to work with an alcohol product and he today is totally responsible for the p l of canada and runs all sales and marketing operations in canada so it s great to have someone of blair s caliber running canada for us today rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john zamparino with cibc please proceed with your question unknown speaker thanks good morning i know we re past the hour so just one question i want to get your thoughts on cannabis m a you mentioned a 30 domestic share in the past it does look like that will require acquisitions so what are some attractive characteristics of a target that you might look for in canada and what have you learned from either the tilray aphria merger or deals outside the cannabis space in forming your future m a plan irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer it s like every one of them are something different and there is a lot and i ve always said this in my prior days every deal i ve done i ve learned something different from and what we have done differently i think the big thing which again we learned from tilray and the aphria coming together do we need 12 brands you can t support all 12 brands and one of the things and as you look at some of our revenue we re down because we have 12 brands out there not being able to support 12 brands the second is bringing the cultures together and bringing the people together and that s something why blair is here today is really to bring the cultures together and bring the businesses together it s how we what brands are we going to spend on the innovation part of the business and then it s we closed two facilities enniskillen nanaimo because of cost out those facilities to produce and that s sort of as blair talked about before is us being that low cost producer and that us being the quality producer another big thing is how do you bring more and more consumers over from the illicit market you ve got to offer innovation you ve got to offer new products you got to offer potency out there so there s a lot we ll learn in regards to future acquisitions i come back and say there s some great lps in canada that would add additional uniqueness in brands that would add additional capacity and bring them into our aphria tilray facility and there has to be consolidation there s close to 700 plus lps in canada today you re seeing in regards to just in ontario it s gone from 600 to 1 200 stores so the cannibalization happen in that marketplace so yes we re looking at acquisitions in canada and as you can see today listen if you look at the top four or five companies did we all lose share but is it profitable share is it sustainable share and ultimately what happens to it and you just can t look at it quarter to quarter unknown speaker understood appreciate the color thank you very much irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next comes from the line of gaurav jain with barclays please proceed with your question gaurav jain barclays analyst good morning thanks a lot for taking my question just on the comments that have been made around the canadian market that next quarter revenue will be more than this quarter and clearly most producers are losing money right now and there is overcapacity so what is your best estimate when the industry turns is it later this year q3 q4 or is it more of a 2023 phenomena when we actually see an upturn in the industry and if you could think or talk about what could be your potential margins at that time i think that would help us really understand the opportunity here irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer ok i think number one we re not ready to give guidance here but i think the thing is this here but blair said and i ll let blair speak for himself where i ll let carl what s important is as we brought these two businesses together in may june of last year and taking the cost out of these businesses and setting the floor for the brands the products what s our sku rationalization and i hear from people you re down quarter over quarter well there s seasonality there s holidays there are certain stores that were closed during covid there s a lot of factors out there but i come back and say this year the canadian market is a 9 billion market today at retail and that s only for 50 that s only for 50 of the market the other market is the illicit market there s ultimately sales and there s consumers to bring over from that in regards to bringing new users into the marketplace i think that s going to continue bringing more and more users into the marketplace the other and i ve talked about it before is the category in regards to the medical cannabis industry which is tremendous size and opportunity for us you saw our margins improved somewhat in the quarter but i think the big thing blair mentioned is this here while the industry was down on price 22 we re only down on 1 7 and yes we lost two or three share points but i think as we build out the core brands within tilray as we build out the innovation within tilray we build out the potency within tilray and we have the boots on the street which we have to get in there to educate the budtenders which are key ultimately and i think it s also important is to have that consistent low cost producer out there coming out of facilities blair you want to add anything blair macneil president canadian business no we re not you went exactly where i was going to go which is there s so much runway on the illicit market we re still only at 50 of that so certainly we see the opportunity for growth in the next two quarters notwithstanding some of the issues there but we re building up capacity on pre rolls we re building up capacity on flower we re building out our innovation pipeline over the 12 to 24 months to have more robust launches into the marketplace so there s a lot of runway for growth in canada and as we said in our statement i think the bottom line is we see some of this compression in the short term how short term we don t know but as irwin mentioned there are a lot of lps who are either buying product third party which makes their margin compression much much worse than ours and there s a lot of lps who are burning through cash trying to compete right now and some of that consolidation will ease inventory and we see the opportunity to optimize revenue from that point forward the timing isn t exactly clear but we think it s not going to be long lived irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer and gaurav you might see margins go down but because of price compression and we out there are dropping some price whether it s vapes or some other things but on the other side where we have the opportunity and you heard let me say today we are increasing our cost savings and the costs that we re taking out of the combination of tilray and aphria going to 100 million and that s ultimately how we re going to support that and that s what s important is here we can afford to be able to go out there and do it and we re not going to do it recklessly by no means at the same time the products are going to be grown in our facilities which are going to bring our overall cost down as we bring in the enniskillen and we bring in the nanaimo production into our facilities in leamington gaurav jain barclays analyst blair thanks a lot irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tamy chen with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question tamy chen bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning just a quick question on the u s strategy so when you talked quite a bit the cbd beverages personal care which is that what we see right now in the u s market is that like canada flower and pre rolls really dominate so i was wondering if you could talk about how you intend to build that aspect of your u s strategy because my sense is that i think medmen is primarily a retailer not as much a flower producer per se irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer so in the u s tamy we re seeing demand out there for other products and ancillary products whether it s in drinks whether it s in edibles whether it s in moisturizers whether it s in type of personal care products but with that we have formed tilray wellness run by jared and his team that is doing running manitoba harvest today so with that you re going to see us coming out with cbd drinks soon you re going to see us coming out with other cbd products you re also going to see us focusing on hemp and taking a big position in the whole hemp market and what are the standards there i think we ve done a great job in regards to improving the hemp quality and the taste of hemp what we ve done with sweetwater have taken the riff brand and the broken coast brand and coming out with seltzer products and coming out with ipas in that market to introduce our brand names so the u s market is the focus is to grow brands both in spirits beer and cbd and wellness until legalization does happen here at least that gives us good adjacency products and as i was telling someone the other day in regards to regulatory ultimately regulatory will change in regulations will change in the u s and i think at that time we ll have a good sized business that we will be able to participate in the thc market whether it will be flower whether it will be pre rolls and with that having the knowledge in the business that we have in the canadian market we ll be able to translate a lot of that expertise into the u s market tamy chen bmo capital markets analyst ok thank you irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of aaron grey with alliance global partners please proceed with your question aaron grey alliance global partners analyst hi good morning and thank you for the question so i just want to touch on manitoba harvest so you spoke to some stabilization that you had seen prior to the merger but wanted to touch more on the margin side so continue to see in the mid to high 20s past few quarters now below the 40 levels we had seen in the past so i just want to know if you could provide some color in terms of the gross margin profile whether or not we should expect it to see now in this range with more of the shift to the branded the white label versus branded prior or if you see some margin opportunity there thank you irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer aaron good morning good question and i m really excited about manitoba harvest and i know quarter over quarter it was down a bit but if you look at manitoba harvest the brand itself it was flat quarter over quarter and this is a brand that until we acquired it i think they had lots of plans for it i m not sure it got the plans and attention the other thing is everybody thought hemp what do we do with this the team that is working on this worked with me at hain i introduced numerous new products i ve seen the new product plan i ve seen what they re doing in regards to distribution also i ve seen what they ve done in regards to taking costs out of this business we did have a lot of private label business that was not profitable and we have now discontinued that or given it up and some of that was costco business that was manitoba harvest where they have converted it to their kirkland brand and coming back and sort of saying did the manitoba harvest brand ultimately sell better so number one is i come back and say we are going to focus on the manitoba harvest brand we are going to come out there and legitimize hemp foods in regards to the quality of the product the taste of the product some of the products just did not taste good so we pulled them off the marketplace in regards to the benefit of hemp and educating consumers why hemp is good why it s good in regards to smoothies why it s good in yogurt why it s a keto diet food and i think there is a big opportunity to really grow this business to a 100 million business or do add on acquisitions we have not in the snack business we plan to enter the snack business we ve planned to enter other product lines and ingredients in this business ultimately will the margins grow yes because we re going to take costs out of the facilities that are going to be much more efficient and a lot of products that were co packed and third parties were going to move back into our facilities today manitoba harvest has sold in over 17 000 stores so looking to expand that and the key thing is there s a team in place that has done that before on the snack product on other grocery products and know how to do that aaron grey alliance global partners analyst all right great thanks for the answer to that and i ll jump back in the queue irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of doug meehan with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question unknown speaker yeah good morning this question is for denise i just wanted to review what specifically the german timeline would look like in terms of receiving approval on a broader basis what the risk might be and then maybe you could just talk to us a little bit about your facility in germany and how do you be able to supply that if we did see the approval in 12 to 18 months and i ll leave it there thanks denise faltischek president international business and chief strategy officer yup thanks doug for the question so in terms of the legalization timeline as you know the coalition has already talked about the approval of medical sorry adult use cannabis into the german marketplace and are working on a framework a regulatory framework in order to execute on that i mean as irwin mentioned we are offering up our support and help to the extent necessary to help frame and provide some information in order to allow for the development of that framework rather quickly we believe it will be a 12 to 24 month framework for the basically the adoption of new regulations as well as the execution implementation of those regulations so in essence because of the fact that a whole framework has to be developed it has to go through various government channels and then it has to be ultimately approved and rolled out so we believe that that timeline is probably around 12 to 24 months for full execution implementation and commercialization of adult use cannabis you asked about the germany facility in neumunster so we believe that this uniquely positions us and provides us with great advantage in the german market one of the things that the german government has talked about is trying to eliminate the overall requirement that they have to rely on basically cannabis is imported into germany and as we all know that there s not enough cannabis that s actually being produced in germany to actually support that however we are the only facility today that is supplying the german government with medical cannabis there is room for expansion within this facility and we believe that we can very quickly expand and also provide for the adult use market so we believe it s a great advantage for ourselves irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer and just to add on to that we re really excited about europe and i wouldn t want to be starting from scratch in europe today and i think that s the big thing we ve made the financial commitment we dealt with the financial burns we dealt with being limited to medical cannabis and i think it s important today of where we are and what ultimately that could be worth one day i mean the german market alone and again it s got a legalized or a lot got to be done is a 2 billion to 3 billion market within itself canada is 33 million people germany is 80 million and there s so much and that s what s why the canadian market is so important for us number one both adult use and medical is legal but there is so much perfection that we have learned from the canadian market and knowledge that we re taking to europe today and at the same time we will take that to the u s once legalization happens here unknown speaker thank you both operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gordon johnson with glj research please proceed with your question gordon johnson glj research analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question just a quick question when i look at your sales on a like for like basis is it fair to say if i look at the sales for tilray aphria combined in the fiscal second quarter they were down 13 9 year over year irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer so sales quarter over quarter on a combined were down but gordon johnson glj research analyst year over year so no no year over year so in one of the presentations you guys gave you gave pro forma results for aphria tilray sales in the fiscal second quarter of last year and that number was around 180 million so using that number in the sales you reported today of 155 on a year over year basis looking at pro forma numbers on an apples to apples basis is it correct the sales actually fell 13 9 year over year carl merton chief financial officer so gordon if you go to the analyst primer which is i think the document you re referring to and you look at the pro forma number on a pure dollars for dollars basis you re correct but i think you also have to go back and look at what was in those numbers for legacy tilray in the prior year so in the prior year they had their one big shipment for the entire year that was to the israel in the international market aphria had his one big shipment in the year in that period and you also had tilray working toward it s achievement of ebitda positive by the end of that calendar year and so there s a few things that are in there that are that drove that number up that may not be comparable in future periods irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer and i think gordon the other thing is to look at in this quarter close to 7 million of inventories were taken out of ocs and as we ve gone through sku rationalization and we ve gone through product rationalization but your number quarter year over year as the combined is absolutely correct but there s factors that add into that also you heard carl talk about currency in regards to this quarter 5 million in currency were down so absolutely right but there s other conditions as we look at quarter over quarter and year on year when companies come together carl merton chief financial officer it s also the last period that sorry go ahead gordon johnson glj research analyst i was going to say that s really helpful yeah no that was really helpful i appreciate that i was a little confused last quarter as well because it was a similar dynamic where the like for like numbers were flat but the number at the top of the press release is much higher so separately it s encouraging that you guys are entering new geographies new market etc can you tell us what you expect to be your biggest opportunity over the next three to six months from a geography perspective and it seems like there s some opportunities clearly in the u s can you give us your outlook on excuse me if you guys already said this but can you give us your outlook on national legalization irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer so number one i come back and with blair in charge in canada today and he s got a real good strategic plan you heard him come back and say about growth in the third quarter and all the things that we ve been working on so i feel good about the opportunities in the canadian market you heard what denise laid out in regards to europe and with that it s not going to happen in the next three to six months but there s going to be plans in place in regards to us really growing in the european market there s 20 markets today that has cannabis medical in europe the big thing for us in the u s right now is i come back and i say this here is growing manitoba harvest it s breckenridge has tremendous tremendous growth opportunities it s in 50 states the majority of the product today is sold in colorado but we look to roll that out we look to roll out breckenrich in cans expanding sweetwater into additional states going into the west coast with the fort collins facility with our green flash our alpine products so there s lots of opportunities for us both in the u s canada and europe gordon and last but not least there s additional costs to come out of this business and i think that s what s important for us in the next two quarters that were free cash flow positive here and we really manage those costs and that we are able to get share back from a profitable standpoint just not get share back for the sake of getting share back gordon johnson glj research analyst thanks again guys operator ladies and gentlemen that concludes our questions via the telephone i ll now turn the floor back to ms noorata berrin noorata chief corporate affairs officer thank you operator and now we ll turn to questions from the say technologies platform from our retail shareholders group our first question is regarding the stock price what are you doing to increase the share price and to perhaps reassure stockholders irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer so great question and listen it s something that i get asked all the time and my first and foremost is our focus remains on executing on our global growth strategy and i hope we discussed a lot of that with you today we ll not be distracted by short term market volatility and we ll not go out there and do short term pricing and strategies we will defend competition absolutely but we re here to build a strong consumer packaged goods company that s why we changed the name to tilray brands cannabis is still a nascent industry and shareholder value is our foremost priority when i went back to our shareholders and looked for additional shares i said we would not go out there and use these shares for dilutive deals and so far we have not and that is a big part of our plans i think what s important too is our focus is executing and driving top and bottom line performance but profitable one and delivering sustainable value and just like gordon asked me the question before it s very easy to go there and do private label business it s very easy to keep sales in place that are not profitable for topline growth but that s not something we re going to do as we bring these two companies together how do we build a base for the future growth and listen there s lots that changes out there yes i ve come out and said 4 billion it s contingent upon legalization in the u s it continues upon legalization in europe i come out and said i d like to get to 1 billion in canada there s lots of wood to chop to get there and i think a year from today there ll be lots of changes in the marketplace this is a 3 year old industry and if you look at most companies today in most categories they are a lot older than three years so we re out there redefining the category and trying to get it right did we get everything right no do we make mistakes along the way yes but we realize it and try to correct it berrin noorata chief corporate affairs officer thank you and the second and last question is what are the plans to enter the u s market in 2022 and how does performance look over the balance of 2022 irwin irwin simon chairman and chief executive officer so the plan to enter the u s market as i ve been clear about it is this year with our breckenridge brand our sweetwater brand our green flash or alpine our manitoba harvest we really have a good stable consumer products we ll look at other acquisitions in that marketplace but one of the things we re not going to do is do deals where there is no sales no revenue no ebitda and it s going to be dilutive to our shareholders and just to be clear the shares that our shareholders have proved us to use they re not dilutive today if we don t use them and i do not see legalization happening in the u s for at least the next two years you get an election coming up in november of this year i don t think it s going to happen after that depending upon how the house and the senate goes i m not sure if it s going to happen in the first year of that the biden administration can t get they re built through on infrastructure right now so i don t think cannabis

film has experienced a bit of a resurgence in the past decade and we ve seen a proliferation of never before made film stocks and even brought some back from the dead but if you want to get started in film photography now you ll need a camera so where should you start as a life long avid shooter of film from 35mm to 4 5 and experience with thousands of camera models i have created this guide to point out some of the best 35mm camera models at various prices each pick is based on user experience and naturally my personal preferences there are obviously hundreds if not thousands of options that others may prefer so before you ask what about such and such please keep in mind that i probably already considered it i probably love the camera and my decision to choose something else isn t a slight against it but for the sake of this guide some choices had to be made we ll be looking at three categories 35mm slr cameras 35mm compact cameras and 35mm rangefinder cameras within each of those they are broken down into four pricing brackets ultra bargain bargain mid range and premium while used cameras can come from a variety of sources quality can vary in our opinion the best u s based sources for vintage cameras are robert s camera usedphotopro in indianapolis indiana and keh camera in smyrna georgia both offer six month warranties and free shipping on a majority of products at a glance the best 35mm film slrs ultra bargain slr yashica fx 103 program this is one of my favorite hidden gems of the film world and can routinely be found with a yashica 50mm lens for 100 or less it uses the contax yashica c y bayonet mount which means it can utilize all of the extremely excellent contax zeiss lenses many of which still hold their own even on high resolution digital cameras in fact some of the lenses were so good that their designs exist to this day in the zeiss classic and subsequently the zeiss milvus series the fx 103 program has four modes p program hp high speed program a aperture priority and m manual that s far more than most cameras in this price range plus it has an unusually extensive asa range from 12 to 3200 there really isn t anything to complain about here similar alternatives include the yashica fx 3 and yashica fx 3 super 2000 the best bargain slr minolta x 570 or x 700 there are a number of great options i considered here nikon fe nikon fm pentax k2 or mx but ultimately settled on minolta because the x 570 was one of my first cameras and they re powerhouses loaded with features and compared to the nikons or pentaxes the glass is a great deal more affordable the x 700 has program aperture priority and manual modes the x 570 lacks program which is honestly not a mode i ever use with 35mm cameras anyway otherwise the bodies and features are nearly identical there are a plethora of great minolta lenses available at very reasonable prices there is also the renowned 58mm f 1 2 rokkor which is a nice chunk of glass that produces nice dreamy images wide open even that lens can be found at a modest cost your regular 50mm f 1 8 or 50mm f 1 7 minolta lenses are dirt cheap and 50mm f 1 4 or 55mm f 1 4 lenses are incredibly affordable as well make sure to check compatibility between lens types md versus mc if you intend to use the x 700 s program auto mode mc lenses are aperture priority or manual only robert s camera is rarely without several x 700 bodies in stock the best mid range slr nikon f3 f3hp the nikon f3 is one of the finest cameras ever made it is nothing short of perfect it has a rock solid build amazing ergonomics and is one of the most dependable cameras i ve ever come across the f3 is unsurprisingly the successor to the legendary nikon f2 but now with a built in light meter no clunky finder necessary and aperture priority automation like nikon s fe fe2 fa models the f3 has an electronically controlled shutter so it will not function without batteries on a personal note in my experience with thousands of cameras there is no correlation regarding longevity or reliability and whether the camera is mechanical or electronic the f3hp is simply the f3 with a high eyepoint finder very nice for those of us who wear glasses since the finders are interchangeable a regular f3 can become an f3hp by swapping in the de 3 finder and an f3hp can use one of the many other finders available including the basic de 2 finder there s even a very cool waist level finder available dw 3 focusing screens are also easily interchangeable the best premium slr canon eos 1v or nikon f6 i was tempted to put the nikon f2 titan here but i set aside my personal bias that sees the titan as my white whale of cameras to instead choose not one but two of the best and last 35mm cameras ever made why two because they are both excellent can t go wrong options and the only thing that separates them is the lenses if you already have ef mount lenses you should go with the canon and if you have f mount glass you should choose the nikon the canon eos 1v released in 2000 was the fifth generation of canon s top of the line professional series which started with the f 1 capable of an astonishing 10 frames per second it was the fastest moving mirror film camera ever made at the time only fixed pellicle mirror cameras like the nikon f3h capable of 13 frames per second when used with the mn 2 battery were faster with five metering modes evaluative spot center spot partial multi spot and focusing point linked spot and 45 zone ttl through the lens phase detection autofocus the eos 1v was a powerhouse piece of technology it can use any canon ef lens made since the introduction of the mount in 1987 though you may encounter issues with various third party lenses most however work just fine so capable and tech filled was the eos 1v canon would continue to manufacture it for another 18 years until they ended production of all non digital bodies in 2018 the nikon f6 unsurprisingly the sixth model in nikon s highest tier of professional models that began with the nikon f in 1959 was released in 2004 supplanting the also excellent nikon f5 while the f5 sported an integrated vertical grip nikon opted for a smaller traditional body with optional vertical grip in the f6 a design choice i personally prefer over the f5 for its versatility smaller footprint and 225 gram weight difference the f6 is fully compatible including metering with almost all f mount lenses since 1977 non ai lenses unless they have been modified and the newer e series lenses with an electronically controlled aperture are not compatible and as with the canon you may encounter issues with some third party lenses like all nikon autofocus slrs and dslrs the f6 s crowning achievements were its remarkable focus tracking abilities via the multi cam 2000 autofocus sensor module and its 3d color matrix metering mode like the canon the f6 would remain in production for over a decade until its discontinuation in 2020 at which time it was the last remaining film slr still being manufactured the best 35mm film compact cameras the best ultra bargain compact film camera minox 35 gl or gt these little fellas are such gems they re possibly the smallest 35mm camera ever made i believe that was the company s claim at the time though others come close it is by no means perfect the exposure control is limited the film advance can be finicky likely due to how tiny and cramped everything is it s zone focus only and the leaf shutter is prone to failure at a higher rate than others no camera ever made is more deserving of the adjective discreet than these cameras zone focus only and the limitation of aperture priority only metering system means you really only need to raise the camera to your eye for framing the leaf shutter and manual film advance mean you ll never hear the camera in action unless you happen to be alone in a padded isolation room there were 18 models released over 24 years from 1974 to 1998 starting with the minox 35 el aside from the fixed focus minox 35 al all models were fitted with one of two tessar type lenses the 35 2 8 color minotar and the later 35 2 8 mc minoxar while the minox 35 gt x or gt s may be the best of them all the earlier gl and gt both of which can be identified by their orange shutter release button are the best value options i also have a personal preference for the color minotar over the mc minoxar the only difference between the two is the addition of an electronic self timer in the gt as well as the relocation of the cable release socket to a position less likely to result in accidental triggering best bargain compact film camera olympus xa series the minox 35 is just about the only discreet pocketable 35mm camera out there that comes in at an affordable price designed by yoshihisa maitani chief camera designer of olympus optical co ltd and the man behind the pen om and mju series of cameras the olympus xa line comprised five distinct models the first model the olympus xa is a tiny rangefinder coupled aperture priority with 1 5 backlight compensation compact fitted with a sterling six element 35 2 8 f zuiko lens and a leaf shutter up to 1 500 of a second the following model the xa1 is a fixed focus point and shoot with a 35mm f 4 lens programmed auto exposure limited film speed settings of asa 100 and 400 and maximum 1 250th of a second shutter the xa2 uses a four element tessar variant 35 3 5 d zuiko lens leaf shutter up to 1 750th of a second programmed auto exposure asa from 25 to 800 and a 3 position zone focus mechanism the xa3 retained identical features as the xa2 but added automatic dx coding asa 1600 support and the backlight compensation feature from the original xa finally the xa4 pivoted to a new five element 28mm f 3 5 zuiko macro lens programmed auto exposure maximum 1 750th shutter speed and a new scale focus mechanism unlike the xa2 and xa3 which only gave users the choice of one of three focus positions 1 2 1 8m 1 8m 6 3m and 6 3m to infinity the xa4 s sliding scale allowed for incremental positioning anywhere between infinity and the camera s 0 3m minimum focus distance all of the olympus xa models remain quite affordable and can usually be found for under 200 your choice will depend on the features you want the faster 35 2 8 lens and rangefinder coupling of the original xa along with aperture priority allows for a bit more versatility and control compared to the xa2 and xa3 it also commands the highest prices of the bunch if you prefer a wider 28mm lens the xa4 is the way to go the xa1 in my opinion is a poor choice with no clear benefits but many deficiencies over the other models the best mid range compact film camera rollei 35s in 1966 dhw fototechnik successor of franke heidecke of rolleiflex and rolleicord fame introduced the rollei 35 at photokina the camera at the time the smallest 35mm ever made was designed by heinz waaske chief design engineer of wirgin and featured a somewhat odd boxy design with a battery powered cds light meter and a fantastic collapsible carl zeiss tessar 40mm f 3 5 lens later models transitioned to a 40 3 5 rollei hft tessar lens and marked made by rollei but the optics are identical to the original zeiss furthermore from 1972 to 1973 some rollei 35 cameras featured a 40 3 5 s xenar lens made by schneider because of the rollei 35 s success in 1967 a higher end variant was planned for market but due to the production s shift from germany to singapore it would be a number of years before it saw an audience eventually the rollei 35s now the most desirable of rollei 35 models debuted with a new faster 40mm f 2 8 zeiss designed and licensed sonnar lens like the tessar focus was controlled via a ring at the end of the lens while the aperture and shutter speed were set via dials positioned to the right and left of the lens respectively as with all rollei 35 models the rollei 35s featured a large bright viewfinder without focusing aids which meant the camera was like the minox 35 zone focus only with a match needle metering system while the design of the camera from its left handed shutter advance to its quirky controls can be off putting to some there s a lot of logic and charm that begins to click once you use the camera shutter speed aperture and light meter values can be easily seen and adjusted while looking down at the camera and the quality of the zeiss designed 40mm sonnar lens speaks for itself the best premium compact film camera konica hexar af or nikon 28 35ti i m including two options here because they are both exceptional and about the same price yet one or the other may better suit your personal preferences there are a lot of options when it comes to premium compacts and plenty of other articles written about them i absolutely love the nikon ti series in either 28mm or 35mm flavors they re fitted with utterly fantastic lenses and the at first odd and potentially off putting dials on top are one of my favorite points of design in any camera they re the only autofocus point and shoot camera i can think of that allows you to see your aperture exposure compensation focus distance and the number of exposures remaining without raising it to your eye shutter speed however is only displayed in the viewfinder my personal choice favorite however is the hexar af because it s the only autofocus auto advance point and shoot that is quiet enough unbelievably so in this case for me to describe it as inconspicuous the nikons the minolta tc 1 the contax t2 t3 all are fantastic cameras with top notch optics but they re stripped of discretion by their loud whirring film advance motors the hexar af is a bit larger than others due to its significantly larger and magnificent lens but none of these cameras will comfortably fit in a jeans pocket or shirt pocket anyway after you cross that point the differences become academic in my opinion all of them will do just fine in a jacket pocket or dangling from a wrist or neck strap yet still the hexar is undeniably larger however the weight is similar to the others because of their titanium bodied construction the hexar also excels in several other ways due to its larger construction there is actually a slight grip rather than the flat fronted boxy designs of the others and the viewfinder is of significantly higher magnification closer to an actual rangefinder than a point and shoot many compacts have let s face it abysmal viewfinders with the leica minilux being a particularly notable offender this is an inherent trade off in return for their diminutive size of course if size is a priority the nikons with their smaller bodies and fully retractable lenses are going to win out you absolutely won t lose anything to the hexar in terms of sheer image quality though the hexar s lens is a full stop faster and there s one notable advantage in favor of the nikons matrix metering first introduced in the nikon fa and later the f4 nikon created what is today the most commonly used exposure mode other cameras of the time had a spot or center weighted meter which can be tricky to use under some circumstances matrix metering also known as evaluative multi et cetera uses a microprocessor to analyze a scene compare it to similar scenes in its library of computer knowledge and choose an exposure based on what it believes is best for that scenario taken for granted today it was incredibly remarkable technology when first introduced and only improved over time the best 35mm film rangefinder cameras the best ultra bargain rangefinder camera canon p canon 7 when we think of rangefinders our first thoughts drift to those of leica and zeiss ikon the two earliest and most highly regarded rangefinder camera manufacturers but the market landscape particularly in the 1950s looked quite a bit different numerous japanese manufacturers offered options more accessible to those without deep pockets nippon kogaku later nikon chiyoda kogaku seiko later minolta tanaka kogaku showa kogaku there was no shortage of options many of which used leica s m39 thread mount the first rangefinder to hit the market from the canon camera company was the hansa canon in 1936 which was fitted with a nikkor bayonet focusing mount at the time canon did not have the means to manufacturer its own lenses so it turned to nippon kogaku nikon for help this cooperation continued for about a decade until canon began manufacturing its own serenar branded lenses in 1952 the company released the canon iiia with its standard leica m39 pitch thread subsequent canon lenses were now compatible on leica thread mount bodies leica s release of the revolutionary m3 in 1954 presented a challenge for other manufacturers its huge bright viewfinder simpler film loading and move from a film advance knob to a lever winder all made for a significantly improved user experience canon responded with the canon vt in 1956 but it wasn t until the release of the canon p often referred to as the populaire in 1958 that the company saw truly huge success the canon p bundled already existing features from other companies the integrated rangefinder viewfinder and non rotating shutter speed dial from contax the lever advance from leica the huge 1 1 viewfinder from nikon to name a few and presented them in an affordable and very dependable body there were also some improvements a hinged door which would eventually become the standard camera design 35mm framelines and parallax correction in the viewfinder and metal shutter curtains preventing burning the result was the most popular camera the company had ever made with nearly twice as many sales as any previous model three years later canon would release the canon 7 whose biggest design change was the addition of a selenium exposure meter into the camera s top the canon 7 was also coupled both literally and figuratively with the fastest lens ever made at the time the canon dreamer 50mm f 0 95 both the canon p and canon 7 are very desirable rangefinder options with a plethora of affordable m39 lenses to choose from the canon p despite being the less advanced of the two commands higher prices but can often be found for under 225 though prices have been on the rise a working canon 7 can be sourced for under 150 though if you intend to use the light meter be sure to check its accuracy as selenium meters often didn t stand the test of time the best bargain rangefinder camera contax g1 contax again pioneering some of the most innovative technology surprised the camera world in 1994 when it released an autofocus rangefinder that camera was the g1 a titanium clad body with electronically controlled exposure autofocus and rangefinder system lenses are screw driven via an in body motor that turns a pin on the lens mount driving the helicoid back and forth unlike every other rangefinder camera to that point and since then the viewfinder field of view changes depending on the lens being used instead of relying on a small box in the middle of the finder for a 90mm lens for example the viewfinder zooms to fill the entire frame no matter your chosen focal length the entire viewfinder will be used none of this itself is a reason to add it to your bag but the lenses are what clinch the deal like most contax lenses g mount glass was made by carl zeiss and they are some of the company s finest work ranging from a 16mm hologon to a 90mm sonnar all of the lenses are optical works of art in my opinion the 2 8 90 sonnar and 2 45 planar stand out as the crown jewels the 90 sonnar can be found for very reasonable prices and is a must have lens for any g1 or g2 owner it also adapts easily to most mirrorless systems as well though due to the lack of a focus ring on g lenses focus must be controlled by a ring on the adapter which is not as bad as it sounds in practice i recommend either the metabones or the fotodiox pro with an edge to the metabones there are even autofocus adapters available the techart tzg 01 for nikon z mount and the shoten gte adapter for sony e mount the 28mm and wider lenses don t perform as well on most digital bodies but the 45 and 90 lenses sing if you search for contax g1 bodies you may find some described as green label these are updated versions with modified rom and will have a literal green label inside where the film canister sits the upgrade allows these bodies to use the 21mm and 35mm lenses regular g1 s can only use the 16mm 28mm 45mm and 90mm lenses only the g2 can use the 35 70mm zoom which happens to be the only rangefinder zoom lens ever made the best mid range rangefinder camera minolta cle when it comes to rangefinders the minolta cle is one of the best deals on the market its predecessor the leica cl sometimes labeled leitz minolta cl was designed in concert with minolta and released in 1973 unlike many other m mount rangefinders the cl has framelines for 40mm lenses in addition to 50 and 90mm leica and minolta designed and released the leica 40 2 summicron with the camera as well as the leica elmar c 90 4 like the m5 that was released one year prior the cl uses a cds meter on a pivoting arm in front of the shutter that drops down just before the moment of exposure because of this certain lenses cannot be mounted without damaging the arm those with excessively protruding rear elements often super wide angle and some collapsible lenses which can be used if you don t fully collapse them seven years later minolta introduced the very similar minolta cle one of the most advanced rangefinders of its time due to the inclusion of aperture priority autoexposure something leica wouldn t accomplish until the release of the m7 decades later unlike the cl the cle utilized a silicon photodiode meter that measured the light reflected off the unique spotted patterning of the shutter curtain protruding rear elements or collapsible lenses were no longer an issue the cle also added a frame line for 28mm lenses in addition to 40 and 90mm lenses the former was paired with the release of minolta s new m rokkor 28 2 8 minolta also released the m rokkor 40 2 and m rokkor 90 4 identical to the previous leica versions optically though the leica variants are single coated while the minoltas are multi coated the minolta cle is not only superior to the leica cl by every metric but usually not much more expensive and the m rokkor lenses are decidedly cheaper than their single coated leica counterparts the best premium rangefinder camera leica m4 2 or m4 p there are legitimate reasons to choose just about any leica rangefinder here the m3 m2 m4 m5 m6 m7 m a and mp are all worthy for their own reasons the m3 may be my personal favorite because of my love for 50mm lenses and that gorgeous bright 0 91x viewfinder but if i had to pick the best all arounder it would be either the m4 2 or m4 p the production of the leica m4 stopped in 1972 and its successor the leica m5 was released to a very lukewarm reception and poor sales ironically the m5 has risen in value more than any other model over the past few years it has at least doubled in four or five years in response to the m5 s market failure leica restarted production of the m4 and in 1977 released the m4 2 using a streamlined production process the m4 2 saw the cold shoe swapped for a hot shoe the removal of the self timer and motor drive compatibility like the m4 it had framelines for 35 50 90 135mm lenses with a 0 72 magnification viewfinder four years later the m4 p was launched which added framelines for 28 75mm lenses and the trademark leica red dot on the front of the camera while the later m6 and m7 cameras were fitted with a built in light meter they also come at a significantly higher cost and the m7 is entirely dependent on its electronics for me the m4 2 and m4 p hit the sweet spot of versatility build quality aesthetics and price if you prefer chrome over black you ll have better luck with the original m4 though most m4 2 and m4 p bodies are black image credits header photo by mia

the company only went public in september 2021 toast tost 3 01 has been in business for nearly a decade and just became publicly traded in late 2021 in this segment of backstage pass recorded on dec 13 fool contributor danny vena explains the company s core business model and recent financial performance 10 stocks we like better than toast inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and toast inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 16 2021 danny vena i m going to start off by the company i m going to talk about is one that intrigues me a little bit that is a company called toast ticker t o s t for those who may not yet be familiar with toast this is not what i was trying to do trying to get to the present button here and hit the wrong one toast is a company that has created a cloud based system for the restaurant industry if you ve ever worked in a restaurant you probably are aware that they have one software system for scheduling their employees they have another software system for ordering items for inventory they have another system for digital ordering from customers they have another system if they for marketing or for team management any restaurant really has a cluster of different softwares that they have to deal with and none of them talk to each other that s where toast comes in toast has created this cloud based software system that really handles all of the disparate parts of the restaurant industry it handles guest orders and payment processing and coordinating kitchen and operations and managing employees it can also do marketing and loyalty and team management this is really an opportunity to grow within the restaurant industry another thing that s interesting about it is that it integrates with companies like doordash that handle the food delivery for them these restaurants now one of the things that i found really compelling about this is by the time they went ipo which was just back in september toast had become the leading platform serving the restaurant industry yet it only serves about 6 of the more than 860 000 restaurants in the united states that gives you an idea of just how fragmented the market is i want to look at a couple of the metrics here now i want you to notice look how far down toast has gone since its ipo really doesn t appear to be doing that well and if you base your investment decision on the stock price you d go look how far that stock is down i m certainly not investing in that but if you look at their revenue growth revenue is up a 105 year over year in the third quarter annual recurring revenue 544 million up 77 gross profit 83 million up 72 so it looks like all of the financial metrics are headed in the right direction now of course you get to a company that is a software as a service platform net loss 253 million not surprising that a software as a service business is not yet profitable now the company is currently serving roughly 48 000 restaurant locations and 56 of those locations are using four or more of their products they start off with the toast payment processing system that s really what put this on my radar my wife and i went to comic con here a couple of weekends back and it seemed like every restaurant that we went to when they would bring over the payment device i saw toast at the bottom of it and it happened more times than not probably i would say five out of six times that we were at a restaurant they were using the toast operating systems so that really piqued my interest they use the payment processing is example of one of the segments but then if you want to use the back office part of it for scheduling your employees that s another piece of the product if you want to use it to control your inventory that s another piece of the product there are many different segments that restaurant owners can choose from and they are getting the foot in the door with the payment processing

this basket of industrial and ev stocks has room to run market volatility can be unnerving for folks looking for a calm way to accomplish their 2022 financial goals but growth stocks have long been one of the best ways to compound wealth over time even though they tend to be more volatile than say blue chip dividend aristocrats ford f 3 30 textron txt 0 70 and wallbox wbx 2 06 are three growth stocks that could continue to crush the market in 2022 here s what makes each a great buy now from stalwart to growth spurt daniel foelber ford lucid group lcid 0 40 and rivian automotive rivn 4 60 captured the auto industry s spotlight in 2021 after both electric vehicle ev newcomers went public and promised big plans for 2022 and beyond lucid and rivian finished the year with expensive valuations of 62 6 billion and 93 4 billion respectively compared to just 83 billion for legacy automaker ford and that s after share prices of ford gained over 136 in 2021 long time industry watchers may be scratching their heads and wondering how a stalwart like ford can be classified as a growth stock make no mistake ford is a bulky business with a massive workforce and manufacturing footprint but it s also one of the most aggressive ev investors arguably ahead of its electric truck competitors like rivian or general motors demand for ford s f 150 lightning electric pickup is so strong that ford had to stop taking reservations after they passed 200 000 in december on jan 4 it said it was increasing its f 150 lightning capacity to 150 000 units per year in response to the better than expected demand the lightning gets a lot of attention deservingly so but the ford mustang mach e and e transit electric van shouldn t go unnoticed ford sold over 27 000 mach es in 2021 more evs than lucid plans to sell in all of 2022 given its strong brand and exciting new products ford stands out as a top automaker to buy in 2022 and hold for years to come textron will have another strong year in 2022 lee samaha textron the company s performance in 2021 up nearly 60 could be the subject of a trivia question in the future it was a challenging year for the aviation and defense industries let alone for companies exposed to vehicle production but textron bucked the trend the reason it comes down to its business jets and aircraft in its key textron aviation segment business jet departures are significantly up from 2019 even with a slowdown in 2020 as such strength in textron aviation through the year encouraged management to raise its full year earnings and cash flow expectations in every quarter in 2021 moreover there are three reasons why textron can have another strong year in 2022 first the covid 19 pandemic resurgence is putting more pressure on commercial aviation and that s something likely to encourage more spending on business jets that s excellent news for textron s cessna business jets second textron systems military hardware robotic land vehicles general aviation engines air support to the u s military took a hit in 2021 from the u s army s withdrawal from afghanistan that should create an easier hurdle for the business to overcome in 2022 third textron s industrial segment generates 55 to 60 of its revenue from fuel systems and functional components businesses which should benefit from an increase in vehicle production in 2022 as the industry recovers from the semiconductor shortage that limited production in 2021 all told textron is set for another excellent year in 2022 trading on just 17 times its expected free cash flow in 2021 the stock remains a good value a growth stock to get charged up about scott levine wallbox granted wallbox doesn t have a long trading history in 2021 the stock went public after merging with a special purpose acquisition company spac in october the electric vehicle charging stock provided electric returns for investors during its time on the market from its debut on the public markets on oct 4 through the end of the year shares of wallbox skyrocketed more than 102 and while it s clear that plenty of bulls plugged into wallbox last year there s reason to believe that this under the radar play has additional room to run in 2022 there s no argument that ev makers have received the lion s share of attention over the past couple of years but the importance of ev chargers can t be overlooked in business since 2015 wallbox is already experiencing steep growth in its ev charging offerings for example the company has reported revenue of 55 million through the first three quarters of 2021 representing over 280 growth over the same period in 2020 should the company achieve its sales forecast for the final quarter of the year and report 24 million on the top line it will result in the company booking revenue of 79 million or a 230 increase over the 24 million that it reported in 2020 although wallbox has a stronger presence in europe the company is making inroads in the u s market representing another significant avenue of growth in the third quarter of 2021 wallbox announced the development of a 120 000 square foot manufacturing facility in texas management expects production at the lone star state facility to begin in the second half of 2022 and eventually achieve annual manufacturing capacity of 290 000 and 500 000 by 2027 and 2030 respectfully should the company proceed with the development of its manufacturing facility on schedule and on budget as well as achieve its revenue projections it s likely that the market will sit up and take notice
inflation expectations the pace of price changes that people anticipate in the future affect households desire to consume firms incentives to revise prices and policymakers willingness to change policies expectations of negative inflation i e deflation increase the perceived real interest rate and according to a conventional macroeconomic view become contractionary when the central bank nominal interest rate is at its effective lower bounds elb such a contraction can further depress inflation expectations and lead to a deflationary spiral the great depression and the almost three decade long liquidity trap episode in japan are often used to exemplify this intuition and had a profound impact on policymakers around the world this experience may potentially rationalise why the central bankers used everything at their disposal including unconventional policies such as quantitative easing forward guidance and negative nominal interest rates to prevent deflationary spirals during the global recession and the covid 19 crisis these policies have strong support in standard macroeconomic models with full information rational expectations fire krugman 1998 eggertsson and woodford 2003 eggertsson 2008 however recent evidence points that people s beliefs violate the fire assumption coibion and gorodnichenko 2012 bordalo et al 2020 hence one might ask whether policymakers should fear deflationary expectations as much as the standard models imply deflation expectations in the data in our recent paper gorodnichenko and sergeyev 2021 we document a new fact households and tentatively firms unlike professional forecasters and financial markets do not expect deflation even when deflation is a clear possibility we call this observation a zero lower bound zlb on inflation expectations figure 1 realised inflation and inflation expectations notes the top panel is the histogram of realised consumer price index cpi inflation in red and the michigan survey of consumers inflation expectations in grey between 2008 01 and 2020 04 the bottom panel shows the histogram of realised inflation and inflation expectations in japan to illustrate this fact the top panel of figure 1 plots the histogram of realised us inflation a red line and expected inflation from the michigan survey of consumers grey bars between january 2008 and march 2020 a period with several deflationary episodes in the us two observations stand out the inflation expectations distribution is skewed to the right and virtually nobody expects negative inflation during this period despite a significant fraction of respondents expecting near zero inflation the bottom panel of figure 1 demonstrates an even more striking example of japan where inflation was negative in more than 40 of quarters between 2004 and 2020 even in this deflationary environment virtually no consumers expect deflation and a significant fraction has zero inflation expectations consistent with the zero lower bound on inflation expectations while figure 1 is informative it masks the evolution of the inflation expectations distribution over time to uncover these dynamics figure 2 plots the time series of the inflation rate top panel and the fraction of consumers who expect deflation zero inflation and positive inflation over time in japan one can see that both consumer price index cpi and core cpi inflation were often negative between 2003 and 2020 nevertheless this inflation evolution has been primarily reflected in the variation of the number of people who expect positive and zero inflation in the bottom panel of figure 2 which often mirror each other the fraction of consumers who expect negative inflation is relatively stable the only exception was during the global crisis when additional factors such as a sharp decline in oil prices and a rapid appreciation of the yen may have affected the expectations figure 2 realised inflation and expectations of positive zero and negative inflation notes the top panel of the figure shows japanese realised inflation bold black line japanese realised core inflation dashed black line the bottom panel presents shares of bank of japan s opinion survey participants who expect positive inflation green line zero inflation yellow line and negative inflation red line with the zero lower bound on inflation expectations assumption consumers expecting zero inflation can only revise their beliefs up while those with positive initial inflation forecasts can lower them figure 3 demonstrates that this is indeed the case in the michigan survey of consumers the figure plots five histograms of changes in inflation expectations for five values of initial inflation forecasts for example the red histogram demonstrates that the consumers who expected zero inflation revise their beliefs almost only upwards the yellow histogram represents consumers who initially believed that inflation would be 5 these consumers lower their forecasts downward up to 5 but no more figure 3 inflation expectations revisions notes the figure plots five histograms of inflation expectations revisions conditional on five values of the initial inflation expectations 0 1 2 3 5 the horizontal axis is the size of the revision the data are from the michigan survey of consumers the sample period is january 1978 december 2019 our paper gorodnichenko and sergeyev 2021 presents more evidence using alternative surveys of consumers e g the ny fed survey of consumers expectations the european commission business and consumer survey the dutch national bank household survey surveys of professional forecasters and firms and forecasts of other variables these additional pieces of evidence reveal that the zero lower bound applies only to inflation expectations of households and firms implications of the zero lower bound on inflation expectations what are the macroeconomic implications of the zero lower bound on inflation expectations while remaining agnostic about the source of this constraint which can be due to for example experience based learning or ambiguity aversion we explore the implications of the zlb on inflation expectations in a standard new keynesian model the constraint qualitatively changes the model s predictions here are some of them first following a negative aggregate demand shock that leads to a severe deflation due to the deflationary spiral mechanism under the fire assumption deflation is limited in our model because inflation expectations do not fall below zero it can potentially explain a missing deflation during the great recession in the us and the lack of significant deflation in japan second unconventional policies such as forward guidance that aim at lifting inflation expectations during liquidity traps are less effective intuitively policies that would increase full information rational expectations fire inflation expectations are infra marginal when expectations are stuck at the zero lower bound third in liquidity traps negative aggregate supply shocks are no longer expansionary and fiscal multipliers do not become infinite when inflation expectations are stuck at zero which is consistent with recent empirical evidence miyamoto et al 2018 wieland 2019 conclusion in contrast to professional forecasters households and firms do not anticipate deflation in the future even when deflation is likely households inflation expectations with a floor at zero affect macroeconomic dynamics and the effectiveness of unconventional policy tools that rely on the management of

our securities litigation and securities groups take a closer look at a technical fact specific decision addressing claims brought in connection with a special purpose acquisition company s de spac merger transaction the decision could provide a roadmap for future challenges to de spac transactions claims being asserted against the spac were direct rather than derivative in nature the applicable standard of review for this particular de spac transaction was entire fairness not business judgment spacs and their operators should consider adopting safety measures to reduce potential exposure to entire fairness review earlier this week the delaware court of chancery released a highly anticipated decision in in re multiplan corp stockholders litigation c a no 2021 0300 lww addressing the viability of fiduciary duty claims brought against special purpose acquisition company spac directors and organizers in connection with de spac merger transactions the decision from vice chancellor lori will marks the first time the chancery court has examined fiduciary duty claims in this context in the 61 page opinion vice chancellor will held that claims being asserted by the spac s stockholders were direct rather than derivative in nature preempting the defendants demand futility arguments and that the entire fairness standard of review governed the court s analysis of those claims the court also weighed in on the plaintiffs aiding and abetting claim against the spac s financial advisor holding that the complaint adequately alleged knowing participation on behalf of the advisor all claims except one against the spac s cfo were upheld although spac related litigation was already expected to increase in 2022 the multiplan decision is likely to further embolden the plaintiffs bar the multiplan lawsuit challenges spac churchill capital s october 2020 acquisition of multiplan inc a health care data analytics and cost management company shortly after the transaction closed news of a competing data analytics cost management offering from one of multiplan s largest customers caused the company s stock price to decline by nearly 50 percent claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the spac s directors and organizers were brought shortly thereafter the lawsuit alleges that churchill s financial structure which purportedly allowed the spac s organizers to profit immensely upon completion of a business combination through super equity founder shares even if the deal resulted in a loss for the spac s public stockholders incentivized the organizers to withhold material information from churchill s stockholders and push forward with the unfair multiplan deal according to the plaintiffs this not only impaired the stockholders ability to vote against the deal and redeem their shares but also led to economic damages stemming from multiplan s subsequent stock price drop the plaintiffs also claim that churchill s financial advisor aided and abetted these fiduciary breaches through its preparation of multiplan valuation analyses and its knowledge of various alleged conflicts of interest in their motion to dismiss the defendants pushed two primary arguments 1 that the plaintiffs were asserting improper derivative claims that were preempted due to a failure to allege demand futility and 2 that the claims were barred by delaware s business judgment rule the court examined both issues extensively on the first issue the court found that the plaintiffs fiduciary claims were properly pleaded as direct rather than derivative claims the court reasoned that while overpayment claims such as those asserted here typically would be viewed as exclusively derivative the plaintiffs disclosure based claims would if proven result in a personal injury to the spac s stockholders and were therefore direct in nature consistent with this the court also noted that any recovery from the claims would go directly to the stockholders themselves rather than to the company on the second issue the court found that the plaintiffs had successfully rebutted the presumption that business judgment review should apply the court confirmed that entire fairness instead applied for two independent reasons 1 churchill s purported financial structure allowed the spac s organizers to receive unique benefits from the transaction not shared by the spac s public stockholders and 2 churchill s directors were self interested due to the material benefits they stood to receive from the transaction having concluded that the plaintiffs claims were direct in nature and subject to entire fairness review the court next turned to the viability of the claims themselves confirming in short order that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged through purported conflicts of interest and disclosure violations reasonably conceivable non exculpated claims against all but one of the defendants finally on the aiding and abetting claim the court found that allegations of a close alignment between churchill and its financial advisor supported a finding that the advisor knowingly participated in the fiduciary breach while the standard imposed by the chancery court in multiplan is certainly an onerous one it is too soon to tell how this might impact de spac deals challenged in the future i e whether absent modifications in typical spac governance and or structure this will result in virtually all de spac transactions being subject to entire fairness review since the legal analysis in multiplan is highly fact specific and based heavily on churchill s alleged disclosure violations vice chancellor will confirmed this early on in the ruling emphasizing that many of her conclusions stem from the fact that a reasonably conceivable impairment of public stockholders redemption rights in the form of materially misleading disclosures ha been pleaded nevertheless the decision creates a potential roadmap for plaintiffs moving forward particularly for those targeting spacs with financial structures similar to churchill s which are not uncommon as the court cautioned that this structure has been utilized by other spacs does not cure it of conflicts future lawsuits are likely to target spacs with these types of purported structural conflicts and focus on material disclosure violations which with 20 20 hindsight are relatively easy to manufacture in the wake of a stock price drop although the multiplan decision may have come too late for spacs that have already completed a de spac transaction spacs looking to avoid entire fairness review in the future should if feasible and not offset by negative variables such as increased deal uncertainty consider adopting procedural deal process safeguards that have long been used in the traditional merger context including independent special committees independent financial and legal advisors and majority of the minority votes beyond that spacs and their sponsors should take extra care to avoid any disclosure slipups though difficult to adjust to on the fly well advised spacs might be able to adopt sufficient processes and safety measures to reduce exposure and stave off entire fairness review for de spac deals going forward download pdf of advisory

expand that location is seeing very very high numbers and i think we re at thpointe now where we ve outgrown the venue there in nashua and we are currently working with our partners at dhhs and st joseph s hospital to work on a more appropriate venue alissa sicard says one challenge is ensuring that there is enough staff at ehac location since theyay m see 200 to 300 people in a day he says the

the biden administration announced the change monday as it looks to lower costs and make testing for the virus more convenient amid rising frustrations under the new policy first detailed to the ap americans will be able to either purchase home testing kits for free under their insurance or submit receipts for the tests for reimbursement up to the monthly per person limit a family of four for instance could be reimbursed for up to 32 tests per month pcr tests and rapid tests ordered or administered by a health provider will continue to be fully covered by insurance with no limit president joe biden faced criticism over the holiday season for a shortage of at home rapid tests as americans traveled to see family amid the surge in cases from the more transmissible omicron variant now the administration is working to make covid 19 home tests more accessible both by increasing supply and bringing down costs later this month the federal government will launch a website to begin making 500 million at home covid 19 tests available via mail the administration also is scaling up emergency rapid testing sites in areas experiencing the greatest surges in cases the insurer covered testing would dramatically reduce costs for many americans and the administration hopes that by easing a barrier to more regular at home testing it can help slow the spread of the virus get kids back into school more quickly and help people gather safely this is all part of our overall strategy to ramp up access to easy to use at home tests at no cost health and human services secretary xavier becerra said in a statement by requiring private health plans to cover people s at home tests we are further expanding americans ability to get tests for free when they need them biden announced the federal requirement late last year and it kicks in on jan 15 but the administration had been silent until now on details of the plan the administration is trying to incentivize private insurers to cover the tests up front and without a cumbersome reimbursement process insurance plans that work with pharmacies and retailers to cover the up front costs of the tests will be required to reimburse only up to 12 per test if purchased through an out of network retailer plans that don t move proactively to set up a network of pharmacies would have to cover the full retail price that the customer paid which could be more than 12 per test there was no immediate reaction from insurers or details yet on potential insurer and retailer partnerships ahead of saturday s effective date only tests purchased on or

medieval battle scenes in movies or television shows usually feature heavily armed warriors mounted on huge horses thundering across the plains to attack their cowering and quivering enemies while it is common knowledge that film producers will distort or exaggerate reality for dramatic effect few would have suspected just how much this particular type of portrayal has been exaggerated a new study on the medieval horse i e medieval warhorses has now brought this misconception to light interestingly the distortions in this case don t have anything to do with how they portray the warriors or the warfare the exaggeration comes on the equine side as the medieval horses used in battles were nowhere near as large and intimidating as they are made out to be in popular culture real medieval horses were solid sturdy and durable animals that were bred for dependability in fact they weren t very tall or long at all believe it or not the medieval horse was more or less the same size as modern ponies this surprising truth has now been clearly revealed thanks to new research carried out by a team of archaeologists and historians from five british universities who have just published the results of their study in the international journal of osteoarchaeology fierce warriors on smaller than you think medieval horses the actual research involved with this project was not complex and involved no additional fieldwork archaeological excavations at 171 sites across the united kingdom have produced intact horse bones dating from the years 300 through 1650 ad giving the archaeologists and historians involved in this new study a good sized database from which to make comparisons in the movies and tv the typical medieval warhorse might be as much as 17 or 18 hands high the equivalent of 68 to 72 inches or 173 to 183 centimeters but the evidence analyzed in the english study showed that horses in the middle ages were much shorter than this horses over 15 hands were very rare indeed say the researchers and most were one or two hands less than this king offa of mercia 8th century in procession on a moderately sized horse source matthew paris public domain medieval horses were clearly much smaller than we might expect for equivalent functions today university of exeter archaeologist alan outram said in a press release issued by his university selection and breeding practices in the royal studs may have focused as much on temperament and the correct physical characteristics for warfare as they did on raw size the tallest horse from the norman era 11th and 12th centuries identified from the archaeological records was found at trowbridge castle in wiltshire this horse was only 15 hands high which puts it on a par with small light riding horses in the present day only during the high medieval period 1200 1350 ad did horses begin to reach the 16 hand mark and that would remain the peak of horse size until they began to get bigger in the post medieval period after the year 1500 in this reconstruction of armor for knights and horses 16th century in the metropolitan museum of art new york city the horses can be seen to be average sized cc by sa 2 0 it should be noted that medieval horse riders and trainers were not working exclusively with what nature provided knowledge of horse breeding practices was widespread and significant investments of time and money were expended in the attempt to breed the perfect animals for warfare tournaments hunting and other activities that required the use of horses the characteristics of horses during that period emerged from sophisticated breeding practices and if they were smaller than expected it s because greater size wouldn t have offered riders any advantage historic records don t give the specific criteria which defined a warhorse said helene benkert a university of exeter archaeologist it is much more likely that throughout the medieval period at different times different conformations of horses were desirable in response to changing battlefield tactics and cultural preferences medieval warriors thundering across the battlefield toward enemy lines may not have looked as imposing or intimidating as imagined by modern filmmakers but those individuals would have been every bit as lethal and dangerous as such portrayals suggest riding on horses that were carefully and precisely bred for optimal performance in real world battlefield conditions a young medieval warrior reenactor in knightly armor rides across the field on what is likely an oversized horse to be historically correct kozlik_mozlik adobe stock the medieval warhorse in english society and culture horses deployed in warfare during the middle ages would have been used differently than in the past during this time mounted cavalries were transformed into more potent and deadly forces in the form of heavily armed and armored european knights who arrived on horseback ready to fight any type of battle tactics employed by these so called heavy cavalry generally involved quick strikes backed by manpower advantages and the use of overwhelming force this strategy was designed to put the enemy on their heels from the outset forcing them to flee while creating disorganization and chaos in their ranks once the enemy forces had reorganized and begun to fight back knights would usually dismount and engage them in hand to hand combat presumably having the advantage because of enemy losses that occurred during the initial strike there were variations on this theme but for the most part medieval warhorses were required to carry heavier weights on their back than warhorses would have been the case in the past consequently they would have been bred primarily for strength and endurance more so than great size regardless of the height of the medieval horse its importance during that time period cannot be overstated the warhorse is central to our understanding of medieval english society and culture as both a symbol of status closely associated with the development of aristocratic identity and as a weapon of war famed for its mobility and shock value changing the face of battle explained university of exeter archaeologist oliver creighton the lead investigator of the new study horses were valuable and highly valued in medieval england offering the only viable alternative to travel on foot the horse became essential in warfare and that reality took horse breeding in a direction that made sense for the times top image the medieval horse it turns out based on a recent research study was a lot smaller than we thought source snowshill adobe stock by nathan falde

on its website the atlanta opera includes an opera 101 area designed to explain opera to the uninitiated the site boldly proclaims opera is a dramatic story told through song it s true that when most people think of opera they imagine a huge lengthy spectacle with elaborate sets and costumes and people dancing and singing in a foreign language with orchestra accompaniment but grand opera is but one type of opera the opera 101 site notes that bel canto opera focuses on music and there is opera buffa which is comic opera sung in italian similar to opera buffa are operettas such as those written by gilbert and sullivan operettas are light amusing and usually shorter than grand opera opera also isn t always what one might expect in 1922 george gershwin and buddy desylva s blue monday a one act jazz opera first was performed nearly a century later in 2021 the metropolitan opera performed its first work by a black composer fire shut up in my bones by jazz trumpeter terence blanchard in the 1960s rock bands created a new genre rock opera nirvana tried its hand at rock opera in 1967 but the who s 1969 album tommy is commonly thought to be the first rock opera pink floyd s 1979 album the wall is also a rock opera as is andrew lloyd webber s and tim rice s jesus christ superstar which opened on broadway in 1971 just as there are different types of operas there are different types of securities subject to securities and exchange commission sec regulation and like opera securities aren t always what one might expect it s not surprising that notes stock bonds debentures and options are securities security based swaps evidences of indebtedness collateral trust certificates voting trust certificates and certificates of deposit are also securities and investment contracts also are securities investment contract has become a catch all term that brings diverse categories of investments many of which may seem to have nothing to do with securities law under the sec s jurisdiction for example when a start up raises funds from friends and family it frequently is selling securities and many real estate sponsors investors and professionals are surprised to learn that their real estate investments are governed by securities laws this article discusses when an investment is and is not an investment contract governed by securities laws the sec regulations the sale of orange groves in 1946 the supreme court held in sec v w j howey co that the sale of the florida orange groves with an optional management agreement is an investment contract investment contracts are a catch all category in the definition of security in the federal securities laws the court s howey test to decide if an investment is a security remains in effect today 1 there is an investment of money or other assets 2 the investment is in a common enterprise generally this means pooling of assets 3 there is an expectation of a profit 4 the profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or a third party pay phones atms fine art collections and real estate investments are securities under the howey test courts have found a diverse group of financial ventures to be investment contracts for example whiskey warehouse receipts commercial real estate funds payphones and atms with placement contracts interests in a lumber mill fine art collections and timeshare arrangements all can be investment contracts an enterprise need not be profitable to be an investment contract the howey test looks at the intention when investing not whether the investment makes money so a poor investment that loses money can still be an investment contract further the expectation of a profit refers to any financial benefit for example an enterprise expecting a loss to provide tax benefits to the investor can be an investment contract not all investments are investment contracts many people believe that every investment is an investment contract not so some investments in a common enterprise aren t investment contracts in united housing foundation inc v forman the supreme court held that investments in a cooperative housing project were not investment contracts despite investors expecting a profit the supreme court noted that the investors primary motivation for buying into the housing cooperative was to obtain housing that they might also expect a profit didn t convert their acquisition of housing into an investment contract other types of real estate investments won t be investment contracts for example a group of siblings who buy a vacation home to use during the summer but hire a property manager to rent the home when they aren t using it aren t investing in a security their primary purpose for investing is to obtain a vacation property likewise three friends who jointly buy an apartment building and rent the entire building to tenants won t be investing in a security if they self manage the property with each contributing effort to the project the friends primary purpose in investing is to make a profit but they are expecting that profit to come from their own hard work rather than the efforts of others and investment into a common enterprise with an expectation of benefits that aren t financial probably isn t an investment contract suppose a running group collects money from members to rent an industrial space and buy treadmills so members have somewhere to run in the winter if the members invest so they can maintain running skills despite snowy weather their goal is fitness rather than financial benefits and their investments might not be investment contracts suppose on the other hand the club encourages members to invest in the club s treadmills to save money on a winter gym membership then the members motivation might be deemed financial and the investments might be investment contracts when are small business and real estate investments are investment contracts suppose three friends an accountant a real estate broker and a construction contractor put together a real estate investment they believe that between them they have the skills to identify a good real estate investment supervise renovations maintain financial records and manage the real estate the investment requires 1 5m in equity so each friend contributes 500 000 they buy the property make renovations increase revenues and sell the property for a profit during their ownership the construction contractor supervises renovations and maintenance the real estate broker identifies the property manages the property and arranges for the sale and the accountant develops the financial plan keeps the books and oversees the tax returns this real estate investment has three of the four elements of an investment contract the friends are 1 investing money 2 into a common enterprise 3 with the expectation of a profit but since each friend contributes significantly to the success of the enterprise the profit comes from their own efforts not the efforts of others this arrangement isn t an investment contract let s change the facts a little the same three friends participate in the same real estate investment each with the same roles in its success however the friends only contribute 100 000 each into the enterprise this time they go to friends and family to raise the remaining 1 2m in equity promising those friends a share of the profits from the property in exchange for their investments the friends and family are passive investors depending on the three friends efforts for a profit their investments are an investment contract and are subject to securities laws compliance requirements for investment contracts so what does it mean when an investment is subject to securities laws registration or exemption federal securities laws require that all securities offerings be registered with the sec or exempt from registration it s costly and time consuming to file a registration statement with the sec so smaller investments usually are offered under an exemption from registration but the sec isn t the only securities regulator each state has its own securities laws and regulators and securities offerings also must either be qualified or exempt under state securities laws that means the offering must comply with two sets of securities laws two of the most popular federal exemptions are under rule 506 b and 506 c the requirements to qualify for those exemptions are beyond the scope of this article but they include restrictions on who can buy the securities however rule 506 exemptions are popular because they preempt substantive state securities regulation so there s only one set of securities laws to comply with most states require that the issuer file a notice after the sale of a rule 506 offering in their state sales compensation securities laws also restrict who can sell securities generally only licensed broker dealers can be paid or given something of value for selling securities so if an investment is an investment contract the issuer can t pay an unlicensed individual a success fee for bringing investors into the deal compensation includes giving anything of value so giving someone free shares of stock or another non cash item of value for successfully finding investors for an offering isn t allowed unless the recipient is a licensed securities professional there are limited exceptions for funds raised by issuer principals still compensation based on the successful recruitment of investors is risky looking for investment contracts although not all investments are securities most passive investments have the potential to be securities that doesn t mean that the investment can t be sold to friends and family just that the sales process disclosure and sales compensation must comply with securities laws therefore before contacting their friends and family for investment in their latest business or real estate venture everyone should consult with a securities attorney to evaluate whether they are selling securities and if so to ensure compliance with securities laws this series draws from elizabeth whitman s background in and passion for classical music to illustrate creative solutions for legal challenges experienced by businesses and real estate investors

joe and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call and thank you for joining us this morning we continue to gain momentum in the third quarter and completed our fifth consecutive quarter of solid performance after the disruption from covid in the first half of last year i especially want to thank our employees who show up every day and do their job well their perseverance continues to allow us to achieve these kinds of results consolidated sales of almost 232 million improved 2 3 versus the prior year or 4 1 when adjusted for the divestiture of sms last year metal coatings generated another excellent quarter with sales up 15 4 to over 133 million and infrastructure solutions sales down 11 at about 99 million sales in ais were impacted by labor constraints covid related material shortages and covid issues at some customer sites which i will describe further during this call we are pleased to have completed another strong quarter of performance we continue to generate solid cash flow and returned capital to our shareholders during the third quarter we generated net income of over 21 million and eps of 0 85 per diluted share reflecting the resiliency of our businesses and the dedication of our people our businesses leverage the realignment actions taken last year to improve profitability while maintaining their focus on providing outstanding quality and service to our customers we also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower tax rate of 22 for the third quarter in line with our strategic commitment to value creation we repurchased over 148 000 shares for 7 6 million and distributed 4 2 million in dividends in metal coatings we achieved 24 5 in operating margins on sales of 133 million this resulted in operating income being up over 14 from the previous year the margin improvement was primarily due to driving operating efficiencies and productivity while realizing improved pricing in the face of rapidly rising zinc labor and energy costs in spite of the ongoing challenges of covid our team succeeded in completing the acquisition of steel creek galvanizing in south carolina this site was completed in 2019 and includes a lot of automation making it the newest and most modern in our fleet our team is excited about the growth opportunity it presents in a region we were not present in our metal coatings team continues to demonstrate their ability to perform and deliver great results while managing labor shortages and the increasing costs our infrastructure solutions segment demonstrated continued profitability improvement in the quarter leveraging the cost reduction actions that they took last year we were down about 8 when considering the impact of the sms divestiture the infrastructure solutions segment delivered operating income of over 9 million with operating margins improved 140 basis points to 9 3 as compared to the prior year the segment did face growing labor constraints and delays in materials due to supply chain disruptions resulting from covid including components from customers one wsi international project was significantly impacted by covid outbreak which was managed well that resulted in lower profitability we remain focused on strategic selling initiatives across both the electrical and industrial platforms and we believe we are well positioned to finish this fiscal year well for fiscal year 2022 while covid continues to generate some uncertainty in many sectors given our strong performance in the first three quarters and due to seeing more opportunities than risks the balance of this year we are tightening our eps guidance we anticipate annual sales to be in the range of 865 million to 925 million and eps at 3 to 3 20 per diluted share we do not anticipate any material impact in the fourth quarter from the recently announced acquisition as we re focused on integration these first couple of months metal coatings is continuing to focus on sales growth including leveraging our spin galvanizing operations at several sites operational execution and customer service as labor and operating expenses increase due to inflation our infrastructure solutions segment is cautiously optimistic as it enters the fourth quarter with some momentum in bookings activity particularly in the electrical platform our wsi business is seeing good results from the expanded poland facility although internationally the business continues to experience some intermittent project delays due to covid outbreaks at some customer sites as we noted on the last call some of the fall season projects will now be completed in the fourth quarter we also have some spring projects that look to kick off a little earlier than normal the electrical platform is focused on operational execution and growing its e house and switchgear businesses due to the project extensions from the third quarter we expect a better than normal performance in the fourth quarter i will note that our outlook for the spring turnaround season is quite good based upon the level of quotations but we remain cautious due to the ongoing battles with covid outbreaks at customer sites for the balance of fiscal year 2022 azz will continue to execute on our strategic growth initiatives to drive shareholder value while positioning for a strong start to fiscal 2023 our commitment to superior customer service is unwavering our ability to generate strong cash flow is based on initiatives that drive operational excellence tightly manage costs ensure pricing discipline and emphasis on receivables collection within our operating platforms we are confident that our businesses remain vital to improving and sustaining infrastructure so we continue to drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value with that said i ll turn it over to philip philip schlom chief financial officer thanks tom bookings or incoming orders in the third quarter were 248 million a 53 6 million or 28 increase over the third quarter of the prior year our bookings to sale ratio remained consistent with last quarter 107 and well above the book to sales ratio of 0 86 for the same quarter last year as tom had alluded to we have seen consistently strong markets for our metal coatings segment and continue to experience improving markets in our infrastructure solutions segment third quarter fiscal 2022 sales were 231 7 million 5 1 million or 2 3 higher than the prior year third quarter sales of 226 6 million year over year for the third quarter metal coatings segment sales were up 17 8 million and were partially offset by lower sales in the infrastructure solutions segment mostly in the industrial segment where we took significant actions to restructure the business in the middle of last year the business generated gross profit of 57 million compared with gross profit of 54 7 million in the third quarter of the prior year our gross margin was 24 6 for the third quarter compared with gross margin of 24 1 in the third quarter of last year as business in both the segments continue to improve operating income for the quarter was 30 1 million compared with 27 9 million in the third quarter of the prior year a 2 2 million or 8 improvement year over year our earnings per share was 0 85 or 0 09 higher than last year s third quarter reported eps of 0 76 and adjusted eps of 0 80 in the prior year third quarter the prior year was impacted by our loss on the divestiture of southern mechanical services or sms third quarter ebitda of 39 8 million was flat compared with ebitda in the third quarter of the prior year year to date sales through the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were 678 million a 5 4 increase from last year s third quarter year to date sales from last year s third quarter year to date sales of 643 million excluding the impact of sms divestitures sales would have increased 8 6 year over year on a pro forma basis fiscal 2022 year to date net income of 62 4 million was 38 9 million or 166 above the prior year to date reported net income of 23 5 million and 23 1 million or 58 9 above the adjusted net income from the prior year to date period wherein the company had recorded impairment and restructuring charges net of tax of 15 8 million eps on a year to date diluted share basis is 2 48 compared with 0 90 reported in the prior year and 1 50 on an adjusted basis current year to date eps improved 0 98 or 65 3 over the year to date 2021 results while we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases our balance sheet remains strong the following are capital allocation highlights for the year on a gross basis outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was 192 million consisting of 150 million on our 7 and 12 year senior notes and 42 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility this reflects a 13 million increase in borrowings from the end of the last fiscal year borrowings have increased primarily as a result of our continued share repurchase activity higher receivables and higher inventories as the business volumes improve year to date we have deployed 19 1 million in capital investments and anticipate capital investments of roughly 32 million this year slightly below our previous estimate of 35 million supply chain constraints have continued to impact and delay the timing of spending on our planned capital expenditures we repurchased 7 6 million in outstanding stock during the quarter and year to date have repurchased 712 000 shares or 28 9 million we declared and continue to make quarterly dividend payments through the nine months ended november 30 2021 cash flows generated from operations was 49 7 million down 9 7 million or 16 4 from the same period in the prior year operating cash flows were positively impacted by the higher earnings but were more than offset by higher receivables on increased sales and increased inventories primarily as a result of higher zinc costs in our metal coatings we continue to remain active on the merger and acquisition front and completed the acquisition of the galvanizing operation in south carolina that will expand our southeast footprint and should be accretive during the first year of operation as tom had noted earlier i ll now turn it back to tom for his final thoughts tom ferguson chief executive officer thank you philip here are some key indicators that we are paying particular attention to for the metal coating segment s galvanizing business we are carefully tracking fabrication and construction activity and material and labor cost inflation as well as osha s covid vaccine mandate for the surface technologies platform we are primarily focused on expanding our customer base and benefiting from improved operational performance for infrastructure solutions domestic turnaround and outage activity has returned to a normal level the spring season is currently looking to be good although we remain cautious due to covid particularly for international customers the electrical platform is benefiting from transmission distribution and utility spending and growing data center and battery energy storage activity in regards to the strategic review of infrastructure solutions and stated desire to become predominantly a metal coatings company we have meaningfully advanced our work on a couple of strategic options that are designed to achieve this commitment unfortunately due to related ndas we are not able to comment further at this time we remain committed to our growth strategy around metal coatings and achieving 21 to 23 operating margins with galvanizing performance being quite steady while we continue to improve surface technologies we will remain acquisitive particularly in metal coatings and hope to complete one more acquisition before the end of this fiscal year for infrastructure solutions we are focused on profitability and cash flow this segment s business unit should benefit from more normalized turnaround outage seasons and a solid market for renewables transmission and distribution utility battery energy storage data center e houses and switchgear we did issue our first esg report this past quarter and we ll continue to pursue improvement in these areas and finally our normal cadence would be to issue guidance for fiscal year 2023 later this month but we will not be doing so while we are committed to providing sales and eps guidance we may not be in a position to do so until our work on the strategic options can be factored in with that we ll open it up for questions questions answers operator today s first question comes from john franzreb with sidoti and company please go ahead john franzreb sidoti and company analyst good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions tom ferguson chief executive officer hi john john franzreb sidoti and company analyst first i d like to start with the zinc prices in the quarter if i look noticed it properly it looks like zinc spiked to a five year high but you were able to realize some pricing maybe it d be helpful to just kind of review when does that higher price roll through your p l or how are you able to realize pricing in such a difficult operating environment tom ferguson chief executive officer yeah a couple of things john one we normally have about six months of inventory in our kettle so and we had we were probably at a relative high inventory level as we came into the last fiscal year so as we re now in the part of the year where those zinc costs are increasing every month rising toward current lme so yes that will just continue every month and we naturally we adjust prices we do surcharges we ve got a variety of tools we attempt to use to offset that john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok got it so you ll be absorbing some of the higher pricing in coming months you didn t hit the full impact in the third quarter right philip schlom chief financial officer no john franzreb sidoti and company analyst is that fair philip schlom chief financial officer yes it rises over the 6 month period and it depends kettle to kettle location to location john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok got it and how much of revenue was deferred in the infrastructure solutions business from 3q into 4q tom ferguson chief executive officer i don t know that we have a real specific number on that because it s project related and some of these turnarounds just extended but it s a few million john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok all right and just sticking with you said turnaround the spring turnaround season you said is looking promising how does it compare on a year over year basis as opposed to on a sequential basis how is it looking in that regard tom ferguson chief executive officer yes it looks nicely improved over last spring john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok great and i guess just one last question on the acquisition steel creek how much in revenue that business do annually tom ferguson chief executive officer it was it s only a couple of years old so it was still ramping up when you figure new facilities take three to four years to ramp it s about 50 60 of where it should be and we but it s a big facility so we would anticipate it becoming more than our average it will be on the higher end of our normal scale john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok and can you remember what that scale is tom ferguson chief executive officer well you think you take our revenue divided by about 40 and those will be on the higher end of that so because it is a big facility with the largest kettle in the region john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok all right guys thanks i ll get back in the queue operator and our next question today comes from noelle dilts with stifel please go ahead noelle dilts stifel financial corp analyst hi guys thanks for taking my questions first i was hoping you could kind of walk through the end market trends that you re seeing for metal coating utility solar industrial infrastructure etc just to help give us a feel for how things are trending here in the late part of the fiscal year and into next year thanks david nark senior vice president marketing communications and investor relations yes noelle this is dave i ll take that one and we certainly continue to see strong indicators from the renewables market particularly the solar market a lot of work going on there our oem market remains strong and we also continue to see good growth from the overall construction market so those are all doing quite well and then last but not least of course the utility segment particularly the transmission poles and such continue to remain strong and we look for continued strength into the next fiscal year noelle dilts stifel financial corp analyst ok great and then you re seeing some of the steel producers talk about putting new mills in the u s do you think that will have any impact on the addressable market for you or because of the aftermarket aspect of your galvanizing not so much just curious how you re thinking about that tom ferguson chief executive officer yeah i think i d say that we still view that as a positive because the more steel that s produced locally and used locally and fabricated locally the better it is for us and shortens lead times and cycle times and gives access to what currently is a constrained market for steel and so i think we generally view it as a positive but obviously these things take a while to build so we don t anticipate much benefit anytime real soon so we don t have that factored into next year noelle dilts stifel financial corp analyst ok great and then last question maybe you could i m not sure if you could talk about this by segment or overall but do you have any do you have a sense of if you looked at just kind of the covid related inefficiencies is there do you have a rough estimate of how much that might be impacting your margins at this point or for the quarter david nark senior vice president marketing communications and investor relations yeah i think when we look at metal coatings they ve got a lot of i want to be careful how i say this but they do a nice job of managing their labor force they can use temps and probably more readily than where we need skilled craft so i think they flexed but it still had a headwind just because on any given day right now with omicron you can have sites with a 75 80 person site with five people out so we re having to work extra overtime i hesitate to put how many basis points of margin but generally it s probably 50 to 100 basis points of headwinds that the guys have that the team has managed through and continues to hit us on the infrastructure solutions side it s more they tend to be bigger sites and also with wsi deploying to customer sites it s slowed projects and so a lot of the stuff that s going on now we re pushing things from third quarter into fourth quarter well as those things extend it s a lot of labor that s got to be moved and on the one project we had the international project with the issues in q3 was really we had to bring in a lot of extra craft to be able to finish the project because we had a lot of craft sitting in the hotel quarantine so i d say for them i m going to go with probably 100 basis points of headwinds that they were challenged with in the quarter noelle dilts stifel financial corp analyst ok perfect that helps a lot thank you operator today s next question comes from brett kearney at gabelli funds please go ahead brett kearney gabelli funds analyst hi guys good morning thanks for taking my question tom ferguson chief executive officer good morning brett brett kearney gabelli funds analyst i was curious on the steel creek acquisition if you could talk about just geographically the opportunity set that opens up for the company in the southeast region and then also how obviously at a high level that state among many others its very hot labor market curious how the labor dynamic sets up at the newly acquired facility given the potential ramp and positive growth outlook you are seeing in that region tom ferguson chief executive officer yeah brett it s on the border of south carolina and north carolina so we re looking at that entire market our closest facilities are up in bristol virginia and then down in nashville so we ve this gives us a nice facility kind of between so that opens up another we typically look at these things as a 150 200 mile radius in an area that we didn t serve and while it is a hot labor market it s we re going after mostly unskilled material handling semi skilled and the azz are we ve got a lot of recruiting resources that we deploy that a one off facility doesn t have access to so and we continually hit the job boards really hard so and we ve got sales in the region so looking to access additional opportunities on both sides both improving the capabilities and leveraging that ramping it up with manpower and we can share resources to some extent not that we d like to do it too much but we can bring in at least office manager support things that we can do to help get that facility fully functioning quickly and generating what we would typically want out of a facility of that size brett kearney gabelli funds analyst terrific thank you so much operator and ladies and gentlemen our next question is a follow up from john franzreb of sidoti company please go ahead tom ferguson chief executive officer hi john john franzreb sidoti and company analyst just regarding a potential divestiture is that still on target to be done by the end of this fiscal year i guess that s the first thing i was curious about tom ferguson chief executive officer john i ve proven terrible at handicapping these kinds of things so i m going to stick with my no comment but and then just refer back to that s we re not comfortable giving guidance for next year for that reason john franzreb sidoti and company analyst right how about is there any potential that you retain some of these businesses maybe it s just better to keep it in house for now tom ferguson chief executive officer boy that s a tough one i think there s we have multiple options but i think these businesses need to be invested in and so as i look at that and are we the best ones to be able to invest in the long term to give both people and investors opportunities to benefit from that and i still have to say we re probably not the best owner if you will but do we like these businesses we really do like these businesses and we like what their potential is going forward so i m going to give you kind of a half answer a noncommittal answer on that one john franzreb sidoti and company analyst no i was just curious and regarding the backlog and the relative strength what s the duration of the backlog right now is it falling into the first half of fiscal 23 or is it extending beyond that philip schlom chief financial officer our typical lead time if you re just talking about our electrical platform side of our business tends to be kind of the three to six months period it has extended out a little bit with supply chain but what you re seeing is a nice increase in our backlog in both our enclosures and our switchgear business and even our smaller businesses on the electrical side are up marginally or i shouldn t say marginally but they re up they re just smaller businesses and that s somewhat offset when you look at our backlog because if you go back just real quickly we had over 100 million in backlog in china back in q1 of 20 and that backlog is sitting at about 16 million right now so we ve kind of if you look at our total backlog number you re seeing a nice increase in the electrical platform offset by the decrease that we ve talked about quarter over quarter in china tom ferguson chief executive officer but john i will add that while the lead times are less than what they were for china they re probably 25 longer due to availability of materials including customer supplied stuff so that s impacting our enclosures and our switchgear probably more so than the other business units within the electrical platform john franzreb sidoti and company analyst got it got it thanks for the color guys i appreciate that thank you tom ferguson chief executive officer all right thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks tom ferguson chief executive officer all right well thank you all for joining us this morning we look forward to talking to you in april and reporting on the full year in the fourth quarter so once again we anticipate hitting our guidance and thank you for joining us operator duration 31 minutes call participants joe dorame investor relations tom

communications and investor relations brett kearney gabelli funds analyst more azz analysis all earnings call transcripts
we started fiscal 2022 with continued momentum in our land and water segments as well as the official launch of our fully operational single family home rental business we are under construction on our next 229 lots at sky ranch and continue to add customers to our utility segment each month as well as having completed construction on the first three homes and we could not be happier with the results our strategy and planning resulted in the successful launch of this new line of business which brings confidence to our team as we look forward to the continued growth of this new business commented mark w harding ceo of pure cycle highlights revenues of 4 3 million for the three months ended november 30 2021 received the second progress payment for phase 2 lda lots of sky ranch 479 or 94 of lots in the initial phase of sky ranch have purchased water and wastewater taps totaling 14 2 million in tap fees to date completed construction of the first three single family rental homes and rented the homes within ten days of completing construction at rates higher than we budgeted denver co accesswire january 10 2022 pure cycle corporation nasdaq capital market pcyo is reporting net income of 1 5 million for the three months ended november 30 2021 on revenues of 4 3 million pure cycle continues construction on the first subphase of the second development phase of the sky ranch master planned community which is just over 43 complete we made great progress on the next phase of sky ranch commented mr harding we saw increases in the cost of raw materials in this next phase which increases our overall budget in the first subphase fortunately these increases are mostly attributable to public improvements that are reimbursable to pure cycle our margin on the lots stayed roughly the same when compared to the direct non reimbursable costs of land development continued mr harding financial summary revenue our utility customer base continues to grow as occupancy in the first phase of sky ranch increases resulting in a steady growth in our recurring revenue from residential water and wastewater usage total revenues decreased for q1 2022 compared to q1 2021 due to the decrease in tap sales after the near completion of sky ranch phase 1 we anticipate tap fee applications to accelerate in subsequent quarters as the second phase of sky ranch delivers profitability we continue to be profitable quarter over quarter with net income increasing to 1 5 million in q1 2022 compared to 0 8 million in q1 2021 the growth in net income was positively impacted by increased lot sales due to the continued construction of the second phase for which our margins increased substantially as we are no longer recognizing reimbursable public improvements as part of the cost of development instead they are now recorded as receivable from the sky ranch cab working capital as of november 30 2021 our working capital was 22 4 million which includes cash of 12 9 million the second development phase continues to progress driving our lot sales revenue which we anticipate continuing to grow through fiscal 2022 commented mr kevin mcneill cfo of pure cycle adding our single family rentals to our operations is another great revenue driver and we are excited to grow this business in the coming years concluded mr mcneill operational summary water and wastewater resource development municipal water usage increased in q1 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to new sky ranch customers in our water and wastewater resource development segment as well as increased water usage due to landscaping and irrigation usage we delivered 17 3 million gallons of water to sky ranch customers in q1 2022 compared to 12 2 million gallons in q1 2021 which the increase is due to new homes being occupied at sky ranch and the delivery of water to irrigate parks and outdoor landscaping at sky ranch water and wastewater tap sales declined in q1 2022 as compared to q1 2021 due to timing of closings at sky ranch tap sales are driven by building permit applications and are not contractually established with the builders and no building permits have been issued for the second development phase as of november 30 2021 and two of the three builders are sold out in the first phase land development lot sales revenue increased in q1 2022 as compared to q1 2021 due to the progress made on the second development phase at sky ranch additionally the price per lot for delivered lots in the second development phase increased on average 40 over the first phase revenue for three of the four builder contracts in the second development phase are recognized over time with progress measured under the percent of completion method therefore revenue will fluctuate due to timing of construction activities throughout the second phase single family rentals in fiscal 2021 we began construction on three homes that were completed and put into service on november 1 2021 all three homes were rented effective november 1 2021 under one year lease agreements the revenues presented in the consolidated financial statements are for the first month of rent on all three homes which will be recorded monthly throughout the terms of the leases the costs reflected as cost of sales for the rental units includes a pro rata share of the annual property taxes and insurance related specifically to the rental units as well as immaterial fees related to the operations and maintenance assessments from the sky ranch cab which are assessed to all homes in sky ranch during q1 2022 we contracted for the construction of the fourth rental home which we anticipate being completed and ready for rental near the end of our fiscal 2022 the following table presents our unaudited results of

and wait times are long health professionals say if you are able to do a test at home you can trust a positive results i know some people are doing at home testing and are looking for confirmatory pcr testing and i think that s a lot of wheer we re seeing some of the increase in volume any positive test done thwi an antigen test at homise considered reliable there is the ability to report that to the state through eth state website alis sa joseph sicard with clrea choice m d says the surge in testing especially for their nashua location which canet g up to 500 patients a day is rcfoing them to expand that location is seeing very very high numbers and i think we re at thpointe now where we ve outgrown the venue there in nashua and we are currently working with our partners at dhhs and st joseph s hospital to work on a more appropriate venue alissa sicard says one challenge is ensuring that there is enough staff at ehac location since theyay m see 200 to 300 people in a day he says the

joe biden faced criticism over the holiday season for a shortage of at home rapid tests as americans traveled to see family amid the surge in cases from the more transmissible omicron variant now the administration is working to make covid 19 home tests more accessible both by increasing supply and bringing down costs later this month the federal government will launch a website to begin making 500 million at home covid 19 tests available via mail the administration also is scaling up emergency rapid testing sites in areas experiencing the greatest surges in cases the insurer covered testing would dramatically reduce costs for many americans and the administration hopes that by easing a barrier to more regular at home testing it can help slow the spread of the virus get kids back into

defined measures the ifrs measurement most comparable to ffo is profit loss we define ffo as income before fair value adjustments distributions on the lp class b units gains or losses on the sale of the trust s investment properties depreciation deferred income tax and certain other non cash adjustments if any but after deducting the principal portion of lease liabilities and adding the principal

joe biden faced criticism over the holiday season for a shortage of at home rapid tests as americans traveled to see family amid the surge in cases from the more transmissible omicron variant now the

500 million at home covid 19 tests available via mail the administration also is scaling up emergency rapid testing sites in areas experiencing the greatest surges in cases the insurer covered testing would dramatically reduce costs for many americans and the administration hopes that by easing a barrier to more regular at home testing it can help slow the spread of the virus get kids back into

in a just universe someone would find jesse watters in his saddest moment a time of crisis and sorrow and mock him on camera before broadcasting the footage millions of giggling viewers an indignity the longtime fox news host once foisted upon homeless people living in new york s penn station in this universe however watters is getting promoted the network announced on monday that it is giving watters his own 7 p m show to lead into tucker carlson sean hannity and laura ingraham respectively the show will be called jesse watters primetime and if the host s career thus far is any indication it will be a reliable cesspool of bigotry misinformation and more than anything the smug self satisfied air of someone who has been able to parlay a total and utter lack of shame into millions the 7 p m slot had previously been occupied by martha maccallum one of the few actual news anchors employed by the network maccallum s relative adherence to reality didn t go over very well with viewers following the 2020 election though and so she was moved to the afternoon the network had been experimenting with the time slot ever since the decision to hand it watters permanently means the network is heaping on yet another scoop of propaganda into its primetime lineup to pair with what carlson hannity and ingraham spew every night here s a taste of some of the controversy watters has courted over the course of his time at the network watters takes aim at dr fauci watters latest controversy came just a few weeks ago when at at turning point usa s americafest he urged people to ambush dr anthony fauci watters said people should be respectful when questioning the nation s top infectious disease expert and then described the potential confrontation via a cascade of violent cliches now you go in for the kill shot he said the kill shot with an ambush deadly because he doesn t see it coming this is when you say dr fauci you funded risky research at a sloppy chinese lab the same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world you know why people don t trust you don t you boom he is dead he is dead he s done now you do that 30 seconds it s all you need now you get that footage to us you get it to fox editor s picks the comments weren t as shocking as they should have been watters has been dutifully bashing dr fauci for most of the pandemic he even suggested in october that disney s documentary on the national institute of health chief was produced as a way for disney to pay fauci back for spreading enough fear about covid 19 to lock the nation down which caused people to stay at home and watch disney which caused the company s stock to climb they got all those beijing profits coming in because tony ran interference for the lab leak he added again referencing the theory that the disease was manufactured by chinese scientists fauci responded to watters imploring people to ambush him by calling the comments horrible and arguing that watters should be fired on the spot he rightly predicted that the network wouldn t take any action he s gonna go very likely unaccountable fauci said i mean whatever network he s on is not going to do anything for him fox news did indeed defend watters it s more than clear that jesse watters was using a metaphor for asking hard hitting questions to dr fauci about gain of function research and his words have been twisted completely out of context the network said in a statement less than three weeks later they promoted him watters shatters record for most racist asian american tropes in single visit to chinatown watters got his start as a henchman for longtime fox news stalwart bill o reilly taking a camera crew into the streets of new york and elsewhere for a series of racist segments teeing off on the city s demographically diverse population the most notorious installment of watters world as the bit was called may have taken place ahead of the 2016 election in lower manhattan s chinatown it took watters a scant five minutes to fill up a bingo card s worth of asian american stereotypes he mockingly bowed to people asked if residents knew karate and more all over clips of bruce lee and the karate kid you can watch the original video here but we suggest watching the daily show s ronny chieng break it down in full that last guy hated you o reilly told watters back in the studio he did watters replied as they both laughed one of many related stories watters then joked about how the residents he interviewed just stood there and absorbed his abuse because they are a polite people watters demonizes the homeless in penn station o reilly sent watters to penn station in 2015 to examine homelessness under new mayor bill de blasio whom o reilly described as uber liberal watters interviewed passersby about how uncomfortable the homeless made them feel and even put the microphone in front of actual homeless people he asked how they made money whether they slept in the station and what kind of drugs they liked back in the studio watters and o reilly discussed the danger of homeless over footage of the desperate people he interviewed watters implies something about ivanka trump watters led the roundtable show the five for most of former president trump s time in office in april 2017 he made a very strange very suggestive comment about ivanka trump while the panel was discussing remarks she made while overseas i really like the way she was holding that microphone he said while trying to stifle a giggle after calling democrats are hypocrites for talking about respecting women while at the same time disagreeing with trump s daughter watch jesse watters on fox news re ivanka trump i really like how she was speaking into that microphone pic twitter com hojhlpmtq1 yashar ali yashar april 26 2017 watters received blowback for the apparent blowjob joke he claimed it wasn t sexual though insisting he was talking about how ivanka sounded like a smooth jazz radio dj soon thereafter he did what many fox news hosts have done after they find themselves in the middle of a controversy he announced he was going on vacation watters goes to philadelphia to prove racism is a hoax watters went to philadelphia ahead of the 2016 election to ask a bunch of people about racism it quickly became clear that he was trying to demonstrate it was overblown and not really that big of a deal he asked one man if racism was thrown around too much in america yes the man said what s that about responded watters he then asked the same question of a woman of color who said it wasn t talked about enough watters challenged her we don t talk about racism enough it s all we talk about in this country it went on like this with watters taking people who downplayed racism in stride while trying to poke holes in the arguments of anyone who took it seriously he made fun of a woman for thinking that trump explicitly asking black people to vote for him was racist he wondered how someone could argue trump wanting to construct a border wall was racist he teased someone who admitted he was undocumented welcome to america watters said you can stay for now one through line through watters career is the shit eating grin that s perpetually plastered across his face it s very clearly all a joke to him he even titled his 2021 book how i saved the world watters new weeknight counterparts may take the implications of information war a little more seriously but watters seems to view his place at the feet of the former president strictly as a ticket to money and fame as cnn s brian stelter pointed out after the promotion announcement more than anything watters seems amused that it s all as easy as loving trump taking it to the libs and pushing a few cultural hot buttons here and there sadly it is that easy and watters has something new to smile about on monday

the biden administration on monday issued rules requiring private health insurers to cover the cost of at home covid 19 tests starting jan 15 amid pressure to make testing more available under the policy insurers will be required to cover the cost of eight at home covid 19 tests per person each month the broad outlines of the policy were first announced by president biden in early december but the new rules provide details such as the number of tests that will be covered for the first time the steps come as the biden administration has faced intense pressure to do more to increase availability amid reports of long lines for pcr tests and pharmacies selling out of rapid at home tests experts criticized the announcement when biden made it last month for relying on consumers to pay for the tests upfront at a pharmacy or other retailer and then get a reimbursement from their insurer after the fact a cumbersome process that could discourage people from seeking tests the administration took some steps to try to address that issue in monday s rules by incentivizing insurers to cover the cost of tests upfront if insurers establish a network of preferred pharmacies or retailers where they pay upfront for the tests then they could cap their costs at 12 per test at pharmacies outside that network the biden administration s testing guidance protects insurers against price gouging by unscrupulous retailers but only if the insurance company provides a way for consumers to get at home tests for free at pharmacies with no upfront payment tweeted larry levitt a health policy expert at the kaiser family foundation despite the new rules there is still the issue of whether at home rapid tests will be in stock and on store shelves for people to buy in the first place given that finding the tests has often been difficult amid the omicron wave the success of the biden administration s requirement that insurers pay for at home covid tests will depend of course on being able to snag those valuable tests to begin with levitt added the rules also do not apply to people who get insurance through medicare or who are uninsured following pressure to do more to make tests free the administration is also moving forward with plans to distribute 500 million free tests starting this month experts have praised that move as a step but noted that far more than 500 million tests will be necessary given the u s population of about 330 million people under president biden s leadership we are requiring insurers and group health plans to make tests free for millions of americans said health and human services secretary xavier becerra this is all part of our overall strategy to ramp up access to easy to use at home tests at no cost

the tutoring sector is also prohibited from doing initial public offerings ipos but even if the ipos were allowed it seems unlikely that investors would put their money into firms that are barred from earning a profit the chinese stock market reflects the general loss of confidence in the economy in 2021 the golden dragon index which tracks mid and large cap chinese stocks plummeted by roughly 49 percent the hang seng index declined by roughly 15 percent wiping about 600 billion in market capitalization in the united states chinese stocks lost approximately 1 trillion in value over fears of delisting a girl carrying a schoolbag stands near an outlet of private educational services provider new oriental education and technology group in beijing china on july 26 2021 tingshu wang reuters the u s securities and exchange commission sec said in july 2021 that it will no longer process ipo listings for chinese companies that fail to meet transparency requirements consequently the chinese listings and ipos are being shifted to hong kong as a result of increasing uncertainty in china some fund managers are considering removing chinese investments from their emerging markets portfolios regina chi vice president and portfolio manager at agf investments said in a recent commentary that the msci china index which monitors large and mid cap stocks had declined by 14 percent for the year 2021 up to oct 31 while other emerging markets were up for example msci india increased by 25 percent and msci argentina increased by 34 percent over the same period chi blames the ccp s hardline on economic issues she said that by selling off china assets cash could be reallocated into other economies that are performing better last year s tight economic controls caused a rise in defaults increased market risk aversion as well as increased risk of defaults according to chi lo senior market strategist at bnp paribas he predicts that maintaining economic growth will be a priority for the ccp this year the proceeds from last year s local government bond quotas will be used to expand the economy that means that reducing debt stabilizing the economy and hitting pollution targets will all take a backseat last year covid 19 restrictions in the rest of the world made it difficult to manufacture products locally which increased china s exports this year the situation is reversed as other countries allow their factories to get back to work demand for chinese products will decrease meanwhile the ccp s strict zero covid policy is hamstringing china s manufacturing sector constant interruptions and repeated factory and shipping closures are going to eat into china s gdp as consumers in other countries complain about supply chain disruptions and shortages of goods local manufacturers will begin picking up the slack many of the world s leading financial institutions anticipate weak gdp growth in china bnp paribas and dws see china struggling to hit 5 3 percent growth in 2022 hsbc predicts china s growth will be at 5 percent or below bank of america is expecting china to be an outlier with slower growth than other countries credit suisse s forecast is for an economic slowdown in china and hsbc asset management says that the world could experience a negative shock caused by a covid 19 resurgence or a hard landing in china and china s hard landing could easily come from its covid lockdown regimen the zero covid policy is just one more example of the draconian control the ccp has over the economy the stroke of a pen can force chinese companies to delist from foreign exchanges a government whim can decimate an entire industry like private tutoring or big tech and beijing s insistence on zero covid can shut down factories and seaports accelerating the shift of global supply chains away from china in short the fluctuations of chinese stocks as well as the ups and downs of the general economy are not predicated on free market forces but rather on ccp mandates this suggests that china is not a market economy additionally the risks of investing in china are neither predictable nor calculable because they are predicated on decisions

joe biden faced criticism over the holiday season for a shortage of at home rapid tests as americans traveled to see family amid the surge in cases from the more transmissible omicron variant now the administration is working to make covid 19 home tests more accessible both by increasing supply and bringing down costs later this month the federal government will launch a website to begin making 500 million at home covid 19 tests available via mail the administration also is scaling up emergency rapid testing sites in areas experiencing the greatest surges in cases the insurer covered testing

tests up front and without a cumbersome reimbursement process insurance plans that work with pharmacies and retailers to cover the up front costs of the tests will be required to reimburse only up to 12 per test if purchased through an out of network retailer plans that don t move proactively to set up a network of pharmacies would have to cover the full retail price that the customer paid which could be more than 12 per test there was no immediate reaction from insurers or details yet on potential insurer and retailer partnerships ahead of saturday s effective date only tests purchased on or after jan 15 will be required to be reimbursed the administration said some insurers may choose to cover the costs of at home tests purchased earlier but they won t have to mina bressler a mother of

available really shone a light on the inequity of what s going on in this pandemic i think testing is the new flashlight for that because who s going online stalking walmart it s not the most vulnerable people bressler added americans on medicare won t be able to get tests reimbursed through the federal insurance plan but medicaid and children s health insurance program plans are required to cover the cost of at home tests fully those who are not on a covered insurance plan can receive free tests through the forthcoming federal website or from some local community centers and

photo credit minerva studio shutterstock throughout the second half of 2021 economic observers have expressed concerns that the u s economy is in the midst of an inflationary period ongoing supply challenges due to the covid 19 pandemic have driven up costs in many key consumer spending categories aggressive federal stimulus measures have pumped more money into the economy throughout the pandemic workers wages are rising particularly at the lower end of the wage scale as many businesses continue to struggle to attract and retain labor these factors have created inflationary conditions where the amount of money available in the economy is exceeding the availability of goods on which to spend the result as of late has been successive months of higher than usual increases in consumer prices as measured year over year from 2020 to 2021 5 4 in september 6 2 in october and 6 9 in november earlier in 2021 some economic experts including the u s federal reserve called this period of inflation a transitory one that would be corrected as supply chain issues worked themselves out the consensus now is that this period of inflation is likely to have a long lasting effect on prices that will raise americans cost of living and the federal reserve recently shifted away from the use of the term transitory current levels of inflation have raised alarm in part because the pace of price increases is much greater than it has been in recent years the federal reserve typically sets monetary policy in the u s to target an annual inflation rate of 2 and for most of the decade since the last recession inflation has remained below that level but beginning in june 2021 the rate of year over year price increases has topped 5 each month and the rate of month to month increases has shown little sign of slowing down the recent inflationary period also looks different from recent years in terms of the spending categories that have been driving inflation overall from 2010 to 2020 housing and food and beverage saw the greatest increases in cost with increases of 25 7 and 21 2 respectively while transportation had a much lower 4 1 increase and energy saw a decrease of 6 8 over the same period but in recent months transportation and energy have seen some of the fastest increases the transportation sector has been hard hit by supply chain issues which has raised the cost of new and used vehicles while volatility in supply and demand throughout the pandemic has contributed to the recent spike in energy prices one other difference between the current period of price increases and recent years is the locations where price increases are taking place over the last decade many of the places where the cost of living grew the most were economically prosperous states that have seen growth in high paying jobs and attracted more residents to their major metros like washington seattle oregon portland and massachusetts boston price increases now however appear to be a nationwide phenomenon and for areas where the rate of job and wage growth is slower household expenses may take up an increasingly large share of workers earnings the data used in this analysis is from the most recent u s bureau of economic analysis regional price parities dataset rpp released in december 2021 to determine the locations with the largest increases in living cost over the past
