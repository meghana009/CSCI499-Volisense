one of the big reasons you re giving 110 of your talent and effort to your private company is because you re hoping to eventually cash in on all those vested incentive stock options isos that have been sitting in some account waiting for the day your company goes public there s nothing wrong with that who doesn t dream of reaping an options windfall and using it to retire early buy a house pay off their college loans travel around the world or become a full time philanthropist unfortunately when it comes to figuring out how to cash in their stock awards most employees are on their own their employers can t always provide the answers they need especially when the questions relate to personal finances most companies admit they need to be better at explaining how isos work in general but they can t legally work one on one with employees to help them exercise and sell shares the right way most companies admit they need to be better at explaining how isos work in general but they can t legally work one on one with employees to help them exercise and sell shares the right way that s why when the time is right many employees actively look for help from a qualified fiduciary financial adviser who can walk these could be options millionaires through various cash in scenarios here s a real life example using a pseudonym kurt is a 50 year old vp of product management at a healthcare startup that just went public over his three years with the company kurt had amassed 350 000 isos worth approximately 6 million unlike many options millionaires he didn t intend to cash in everything and retire early he planned to stay with the firm but wanted to liquidate enough isos to pay for a vacation home and add greater diversification to his investment portfolio this presented significant tax risks that kurt wasn t aware of if kurt exercised his isos and sold the shares before a year had passed his profits would be characterized as short term capital gains which are taxed as ordinary income to illustrate the potential tax implications of this action we created a hypothetical scenario that showed if kurt exercised all of his isos and sold the shares immediately he would incur approximately 6 million in ordinary income which would push him into the top tax bracket and put him on the hook for almost 3 million in combined federal and state taxes on the other hand we created another hypothetical scenario showing kurt that if he designed a strategy for staggering his options exercise over a few years and waited to sell his shares at least one year after exercise he might incur substantially less in taxes and potentially save up to 1 5 million compared to the exercise and sell strategy the reason for this is because isos have a unique feature that allows you to pay long term capital gains rates when you sell the stock which is often a lower rate than ordinary income rates still not cheap but a lot better than 3 million these two scenarios were purely hypothetical and the actual results could be different when kurt actually took action depending on the market price of the shares when he sold them if the price fell his windfall could shrink but on the plus side this could also reduce his capital gains tax hit in the end kurt agreed that it was better to adopt this less taxing exercise and hold strategy and only liquidate a portion of his isos each year rather than all at once in year one with the right financial plan kurt was able to sell enough to pay for his vacation home next up kurt wants to invest the proceeds from future sales to save more for retirement and other financial goals maybe a decade ago kurt s situation would have seemed unique but with global ipos hitting record levels in 2020 and expected to increase this year you could be closer to cashing in your vested isos than you think and if you re not there are other options for example if you re thinking about leaving your firm before it goes public you may be able to exercise your vested isos using private shares the value of your shares will be determined by its irs section 409a valuation which is calculated at least once a year the same tax implications and timing choices apply even with private shares so if you re facing this dilemma and aren t sure how to move forward your first step may be to meet with a qualified fiduciary financial adviser regardless of whether you work with a professional or cash in your isos on your own it s important to assess how your actions could impact your entire financial picture especially your potential tax liability when the stakes are this high it s never advisable to make decisions in a vacuum disclaimer worthpointe llc is an investment adviser registered with the u s securities and exchange

and solitude and it s understandable serious elevation gain length and the ferry ride required for access keep the crowds away for those willing to brave the hurdles though greenstone ridge is a life list worthy trek after the seven hour ferry ride bring a book or maybe a pillow most hikers start from the east end of the island following the rocky spine of isle royale through thick forests and grassy meadows remote little visited lakes dot the crest perfect for a quick dip on a hot summer day in late summer and fall berries line the trail providing snacks by the handful on the trail s high points you can take in panoramic views of lake superior and the isle itself with sightlines stretching unimpeded to the lakeshore 50 miles away one of the best parts of the greenstone ridge hiking experience though is the wildlife a pack of wolves roams from one end of the island to another their eerie howls rising to greet the moon on many nights and lucky hikers can spot moose feeding at inland lakes with the wolves as their only predator the moose population is mostly controlled by winter vegetation scarcity keep an eye out for one or more as you hike past ponds below the ridge crest the trail from rock harbor the ferry stops here start your climb in boreal forest on the way up the ridge which dips from 280 to 800 feet above the waters of lake superior as it crosses over six different peaks nine different campgrounds along the route offer an array of possible stopping points for each day depending on how much daily mileage you want to cover many hikers finish a short 3 mile day 1 at three mile campground where you can pitch your tent right on the shore of lake superior eleven miles from three mile campground is chickenbone lake another great camping spot for hiking days that max out just over 10 miles lane cove hatchet creek and island mine make good nightly stopping spots make sure to check the ferry schedule and time your arrival at windigo the western terminus to coincide with the ferry you want to catch royale resupply if there s anything more chilling than showing up at the trailhead and realizing you forgot something important it s doing the same thing on an island wilderness luckily for those of us who are prone to lapses of memory at the worst time the rock harbor store open from may 22 to september 11 carries a small variety of grocieries freeze dried food camping supplies and various sundries as well as offering showers and laundry what is greenstone anyway the eponymous ridge is made of basalt erupted from a series of rifts in the earth s crust 1 2 billion years ago the ridge of isle royale was forced upward by a later fault system pushing the old volcanic rock above the deep basin of lake superior the distinctive pattern of parallel ridges seen in the basalt today was further exposed by repeated glaciation between 1 million and 10 500 years ago which also left the striation marks that hikers can now see on

on fs road 39 just past the town of glacier the road to skyline divide gets bumpy take a left on fr 37 for just under 13 miles of dirt road often with large potholes and washboard sections two wheel drive cars can make the trip but it may get dicey from the trailhead climb 2 miles and 1 500 feet to the ridgeline through a forest of mixed hemlock and silver fir pass treeline and continue onto the ridgetop then continue tracing the 6 000 foot crest over six knolls and 2 5 more miles smaller trails branching off from the ridgeline lead towards spurs or campsites spend a weekend on skyline to explore them all the trail is popular during summer months and reservations aren t available permits aren t required either so plan to head up on a weekday for an overnight stay only camp in established sites even though the meadows are mostly flat and look like a great spot for a tent they are fragile and your one night backpacking trip could set the alpine plant growth back years

past 7 acre butler lake climbing and descending the rolling hills of wisconsin s picturesque kettle moraine state forest but this unassuming ridgeline is hiding an intense geologic history parnell esker formed during the last ice age which ended roughly 11 000 years ago when a series of massive ice sheets shaped the soil and stone of the midwest before melting away under the strain of rising temperatures but their legacy remains this particular esker a ridged geologic feature formed in the hollow where a stream flowed underneath a glacier is now one of the most notable sights along the 1 200 mile ice age national scenic trail which wends through wisconsin from interstate state park on the minnesota border to the shores of lake michigan hikers who tackle this daylong trek can sightsee features uncovered by the glaciers retreat like conelike kames hills formed from sediments that collected in depressions on melting glaciers the trail this 9 mile out and back begins at the parking area for butler lake and dead ends at an observation tower which makes a good turnaround point for a day of exploration from the trailhead the path skirts butler lake and heads around a bog after crossing highway v the trail begins its roller coaster ride along the spine of the esker passing into a dense forest with stands of sugar maple and red oak at mile 4 take a right onto the parnell

ridgeline trail prehistoric trackways national monument nm distance 2 miles time half day elevation gain 572 feet when you set out for a hike on this trail in the high desert of new mexico s far south you re following a historic path prehistoric actually this monument preserves fossilized tracks from a wide variety of paleozoic animals ranging from diminutive creatures like gastropods and amphibians to the toothy fan backed proto dinosaurs dimetrodon and edaphosaurus while some of the fossils are still visible in the park many have been excavated and are preserved in museums in nearby las cruces and around the us the monument itself is relatively new dating back to just 2009 when then president obama designated it by proclamation fossils or no fossils this desert path shows off the sweeping vistas and sometimes harsh beauty that makes hiking in the desert such a memorable experience there are few tourists here and fewer facilities no visitor center or gift shops in this national monument instead you ll wend your way through arroyos and patches of spiky desert plants like ocotillo agave and yucca on your way to a desert peak with views of the dona ana and san andres mountains the trail the ridgeline trail is more or less the only established hiking in prehistoric trackways it s well marked so as long as you don t stray from it finding your way won t be much of a challenge from the lower parking lot on permian road follow the trail through open scrubland and past dry creek beds keep an eye out for rattlesnakes in the area after about a half mile the trail begins to steepen climbing gradually to the broad top of a mountain where you can soak in views of the rio grande below retrace your steps or continue on to link the ridgeline trail to the discovery trail for a 3 mile lollipop loop photo preshistoric trackways national monument new mexico by mypubliclands is licensed under cc by 2 0 ancient history you might not be able to tell from looking at it today but new mexico wasn t always such an arid landscape until about 70 million years ago the eastern and southern parts of the state including prehistoric trackways were covered by what paleontologists now call the western interior seaway a shallow warm sea that was home to everything from long necked plesiosaurs to giant sharks to ancestors of today s mussels and clams today fossils from some of these creatures are regular finds around new mexico other notable species first discovered in the state include alamosaurus the largest dinosaur ever discovered in the united states and the state fossil coelophysis a diminutive raptor that weighed about 40 pounds heat like other desert destinations prehistoric trackways can be challenging in the summer there s little shade and less reliable water and the monument s rugged backcountry character means that if you do get into trouble you may not be able to easily summon help even on hikes that are relatively close to the trailhead make sure you re

distance 6 7 miles 6 7 miles time 1 day 1 day elevation gain 3 253 feet the 14ers are colorado s jewels and quandary is one of the most beautiful its broad snow streaked pyramid rising high above the tenmile range unfortunately we re not the only ones who think so as of 2020 quandary is the most popular 14er in colorado drawing an incredible 50 000 hikers from around the state and beyond if you re doing the math that s an average of 136 people per day and far more during the summer when conditions are ideal on the busiest mornings the trail to the top looks more like a conga line than a hike so should you steer clear we don t think so hiking up quandary s east ridge the classic route to the summit is like climbing a catwalk into the sky a broad ridgeline that treats climbers to the snow capped peaks surrounding breckenridge the entire way up the best part this is one of the easiest 14ers to climb not counting drive ups like pike s peak or mt evans making it an ideal place to start your journey up the state s highest summits the trail the 6 7 mile out and back trip starts at the quandary trailhead from the lot follow the path as it steadily climbs the ridge through thinning trees eventually erupting out onto a broad shoulder below the ridgeline keep an eye out for herds of mountain goats which like to congregate here about a mile in the slope steepens substantially climbing up the rocky ridge before reaching another wide shoulder at mile 1 3 catch your breath and make the final push up to the wide summit where you ll bask in views of the mosquito and gore ranges before turning around for the downhill a mother and her kid take in the sights photo sparty1711 istock via getty images reservations crowds are always inconvenient but sometimes they can pose a genuine danger that s what happened on quandary where the glut of visitors often fills parking lots by the wee hours of the morning and has led some people to park illegally along the roadside potentially delaying emergency response when hikers get in trouble the government of summit county where the peak is located responded by instituting a reservation only parking system the fees which begin on july 30 2021 are astronomical peaking at 50 for an all day pass a cheaper alternative take the shuttle bus which leaves from breckenridge s airport road parking lot winter hikes colorado s 14ers are just as spectacular in winter if not more but avalanche danger and harsh weather keep all but a relatively few hardy hikers from heading for the peak if you have a good grasp of avalanche safety a calm weather forecast and a reasonable tolerance for the cold quandary is among the easier 14ers to summit in the snowy season since the easy to follow ridge keeps visitors away from slide prone slopes bonus pack skis and avalanche gear for the ride down which is mellow enough for less experienced backcountry skiers to tackle in good conditions boulder ridge trail mt hood national

particularly speedy hikers even a weekday morning the path winds through some of the best the pacific northwest has to offer hikers start in thick valley forest where evergreens sway over wildflowers on the forest floor the highlight of this section is the multiple stream crossings and accompanying miniature waterfalls trickling down thick cushions of bright green moss at the trailside from the forest the climb heads quickly upward with occasional glimpses of mt hood between the trees at the top though you ll get more than a glimpse the whole of the salmon river valley and the volcano opposite spread out beneath the trail and on a clear day mt st helens is visible to the far north it s not just the stratovolcano views and pleasant path that draw hikers here from the coastal cities though with a moderate grade and a relatively short round trip distance this hike is easy enough for kids dogs and new to hiking friends with plenty of rewards for their efforts the trail start from the blm managed wildwood recreation site follow signs just under a mile to the wetlands boardwalk trail then ollow the boardwalk trail across the salmon river 5 mile from the trailhead where the boulder ridge trail starts the first stretch of trail is flat crossing damp terrain near the river but the climb soon begins the grade stays moderate throughout but scattered viewpoints of mt hood make good rest points or snack stops when needed these viewpoints are also great turnaround spots for those looking for a shorter hike climb 2 7 miles and 2 294 vertical feet to the ridgeline where the plaza trail offers an optional continuation for those who want to head deeper into the salmon huckleberry wilderness the salmon of salmon river it s the power of love cojo salmon defy the laws of gravity to reach their spawning area the salmon river is a recognized wild and scenic river from its headwaters to where it meets the sandy river over 30 miles later part of this status comes from its

the content of this article was relevant at the time of publishing circumstances change continuously and caution should therefore be exercised when relying upon any content contained within this article i made a small loss on the premier oil share price when i sold but how is the renewed company doing since it relaunched as harbour energy the content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be nor does it constitute any form of personal advice investments in a currency other than sterling are exposed to currency exchange risk currency exchange rates are constantly changing which may affect the value of the investment in sterling terms you could lose money in sterling even if the stock price rises in the currency of origin stocks listed on overseas exchanges may be subject to additional dealing and exchange rate charges and may have other tax implications and may not provide the same or any regulatory protection as in the uk when investing your capital is at risk the value of your investments can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you put in you re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from the motley fool s premium investing services become a motley fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations in depth research investing resources and more learn more i dumped premier oil shares in december 2019 and i got 89p per share for them that was 10p less than i paid back in 2015 but i reckoned i d had a lucky escape at the time the premier oil share price did climb to 120p not long after i sold and i put that down to my bad timing again but then when the covid 19 crisis sent premier shares crashing as low as 10p i decided i d been a clever chap after all and i turned my attention to other investments determined never to invest in a risky oil stock again but i ve recently been wondering what happened to the premier oil share price since i turned my back on it when i last examined premier i suggested either the company will collapse under the weight of its debt and the price will drop to zero or it will survive will get back to chipping away at that debt and the pmo share price will climb over the long term the end for the premier oil share price as it turned out a third thing happened in 2021 premier entered into an all share merger with chrysaor holdings limited in a deal that included debt restructuring and cross currency swaps a merged entity named harbour energy lse hbr started trading on the london stock exchange on 1 april that s a date that might well appeal to any of us here at the motley fool so what s this renewed company looking like the harbour energy share price has not exactly been a roaring success so far from a high of 454p on opening day the price was steady for a while but has plunged since mid june at 335 5p as i write we re looking at a 26 loss saying that the shares have been picking up a little in the past week or so oil is back up around 75 per barrel and that s the kind of level that in the past i ve thought should provide a decent safety buffer so should i think the unthinkable and get back into premier oil albeit in the guise of harbour energy now full year guidance looking good harbour released an operations update on 21 july due to electrical system problems at its tolmount platform first gas will be delayed probably until close to year end omitting that the company said harbour s 2021 production guidance is now 185 to 195 kboepd on a proforma basis and 170 to 180 kboepd on a reported basis harbour puts its estimated operating costs at 15 16 per barrel of oil equivalent and when i read that i perked up does it fit with my idea of a safety margin i d need to work out full cash costs per barrel i can t quite get my head around a valuation for the harbour energy share price in terms of the old premier oil share price some fuller figures would help and first half results are due on 23 september i know i probably shouldn t be considering it but i ll at least watch where the oil price goes between now and then

the quarter ended june 30 2021 financial review total revenues were 21 5 million for the quarter ended june 30 2021 which was an increase of 146 compared to the second quarter of 2020 this increase reflected higher product sales and services volumes in all geographic areas except for international services partially offset by lower pricing for certain products and services we believe the increase resulted from higher drilling and completion activity in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to 2020 particularly in north america as oil demand and prices in the second quarter of 2021 were higher than the second quarter of 2020 which was more significantly impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic our canadian revenue also benefited from warmer temperatures which reduced the duration of the normal seasonal spring break up total revenues decreased by 25 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 with a decrease of 55 in canada partially offset by increases of 18

revenues in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2 3 million or 27 of total revenues in the second quarter of 2020 cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues declined due to an increase in

scrap expense and inventory reserves at repeat precision llc repeat precision related to product design changes selling general and administrative sg a expenses totaled 11 8 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 3 7 million compared to the same period in 2020 this overall decrease in expense reflects the timing of severance costs incurred primarily during 2020 and lower share based compensation insurance research and development and bad debt expenses this overall decrease was partially offset by higher professional fees related to litigation matters net loss was 5 8

higher than the same period of 2020 led by a strong performance in canada and a recovery in our activity in international markets in addition our u s revenue of 9 2 million increased by 18 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 our gross margin of 35 during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to 36 in the first quarter of 2021 demonstrated our ability to maintain margin even with the impact of

activity in the u s primarily led by private exploration and production companies warm and dry weather resulted in an early end to spring break up in canada which has led to a rapid increase in the canadian rig count with activity levels currently tracking closely with the third quarter of 2019 we therefore expect a meaningful increase in our canadian revenue both in comparison to the third quarter of 2020 and on a sequential basis as compared to the second quarter of 2021 the international rig count continues to improve gradually with differences across regions our international activity recovered in the second quarter of 2021 driven by activity in the north sea we currently expect that our international activity in the second half of 2021 will exceed our activity during the

new phishing campaign that targets zoom users in order to deliver the icedid malware this malware is a banking trojan that can be used to steal user credentials though its mainly used to target businesses in order to steal payment information through their phishing site the attackers behind this campaign trick users into thinking they are downloading the legitimate zoom client for windows however the executable is actually the icedid malware to avoid falling victim to this campaign and others like it you should only download zoom as well as updates for the video conferencing app from zoom s official website or use the software s auto update functionality fortunately the site hosting this fake zoom client has now been taken down september 19 2022 cert in warns about multiple zoom vulnerabilities cert in the indian computer emergency response team has identified several vulnerabilities in zoom while one of the vulnerabilities can allow an unauthorized remote attacker to join a

such as requiring passwords or making attendees stew in waiting rooms often won t work that s because many attacks are carried out by insiders who are already authorized to be in the meetings our findings indicate that the vast majority of calls for zoom bombing are not made by attackers stumbling upon meeting invitations or brute forcing their meeting id but rather by insiders who have legitimate access to these meetings particularly students in high school and college classes states the paper entitled a first look at zoombombing the only effective defense against such insider attacks the paper argues is to create unique join links for each participant jan 29 2021 city works to outlaw zoom bombing plagued by an epidemic of zoom bombing during city assembly meetings the city of juneau alaska is exploring ways to outlaw the practice we ve had a few at the assembly level we ve had a few at the school board level we ve had a few in some committee board time meetings city attorney rob palmer said according to the website of radio station ktoo police in alaska s capital have had a hard time tracking down the zoom bombers the city hopes that by making the practice illegal it can compel zoom to turn over information identifying the digital miscreants dec 21 2020 zoom executive accused of being chinese spy in a bombshell announcement the u s department of justice said it had issued an arrest warrant for former zoom executive jin xinjiang aka julien jin who until recently had served as the liaison between zoom and the chinese government the u s accused jin of using his position to disrupt and terminate zoom meetings among u s based zoom users commemorating the anniversary of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre and to provide information to the chinese government about zoom users and zoom meetings jin is thought to be residing in china jin allegedly had help from unnamed co conspirators who created fake email accounts and zoom accounts in the names of known chinese dissidents to fabricate evidence that the hosts of and participants in the meetings to commemorate the tiananmen square massacre were supporting terrorist organizations inciting violence or distributing child pornography the dept of justice said the chinese government used information provided by jin to retaliate against zoom users in china or the chinese resident families of zoom users outside china the doj announcement and arrest warrant refer only to an unnamed company 1 as jin s employer but in a blog post zoom admitted that it was the company and that it had been conducting its own investigation after it received a subpoena from the u s government in june 2020 the post further explained that jin had been hired by zoom in october 2019 as part of an agreement with the chinese government which in september 2019 had turned off our service in china without warning the price of getting zoom turned back on in china was to hire an in house contact for law enforcement requests i e jin and to move data on chinese users to servers in china zoom service was restored in china in november 2019 and the dept of justice s arrest warrant for jin was issued a year later we learned during the course of our investigation that this former employee violated zoom s policies by among other things attempting to circumvent certain internal access controls zoom said we have terminated this individual s employment zoom admitted that jin shared or directed the sharing of a limited amount of individual user data with chinese authorities and that the information of fewer than ten non china based users had also been provided to china dec 7 2020 zoom phishing scams the better business bureau is warning zoom users that scammers are trying to steal their usernames and passwords via phishing emails and text messages reports threatpost the messages tell you that your zoom account has been suspended or that you missed a meeting and offer a helpful link to log back in but don t fall for the bait the login page is really a trap to capture your zoom user credentials with which the crooks can use or even steal your zoom account nov 16 2020 zoom finally busts zoom bombing one of the biggest problems with zoom has been zoom bombing in which uninvited participants crash a zoom meeting and disrupt it over the weekend zoom released two new features to combat this one suspend participant activities lets the meeting host pause the meeting kick out disruptive participants and then resume the meeting the other report by participants extends to meeting participants the ability to report disruptive participants a remedy that previously had been given only to meeting hosts nov 10 2020 ftc says zoom lied about security the federal trade commission announced that zoom misled users and engaged in a series of deceptive and unfair practices regarding its own security the ftc cited the fake end to end encryption uncovered in march and software that zoom installed on macs without authorization in 2018 and 2019 zoom must agree to yearly internal security reviews and external security reviews every other year and must implement a vulnerability management program another stipulation was that zoom offer customers multi factor authentication which it has already implemented nov 6 2020 zoom keystroke snooping researchers in texas and oklahoma discovered that it s possible to tell what someone is typing during a zoom call just by watching their shoulders and arms using a computer the research team was able to figure out people s passwords up to 75 of the time depending on camera resolution and whether the subject was wearing a sleeved shirt or had long hair any kind of video conferencing platform could be used for this the researchers said as could youtube videos or streaming platforms like twitch oct 27 2020 end to end encryption goes live zoom s end to end encryption feature finally went live except on ios where it had to wait for apple s approval we ve got instructions on how to enable zoom s end to end encryption oct 15 2020 end to end encryption is coming soon after a long period of time with no zoom news the company announced that the end to end encryption it had been working on for many months would soon be available for beta testing users will have to wait for a zoom client software update in the third week of october meeting hosts will be deciding whether to make a zoom meeting end to end encrypted those meetings will not work for now for users trying to join via the web browser interface or over the telephone july 31 2020 security flaw would have allowed anyone to join a public meeting if you recall that the zoom web interface was out of commission for a few days back in april 2020 now we know why the company was fixing a very serious security flaw that could have let anyone join a private zoom meeting british security researcher tom anthony detailed on his blog this week how he found that he could make endless random guesses on the 6 digit pins zoom assigns to private meetings that s a million possibilities to go through which might be tough for a human but isn t hard for a decently powered pc running multiple threads anthony found he could break into zoom meetings in about half an hour give or take that s long before many meetings are over the flaw is fixed now so you don t need to worry about that particular avenue of zoom bombing status fixed july 10 2020 remote takeover flaw an unnamed security researcher found a critical flaw in the zoom meetings client software for windows that would let a hacker remotely take over any pc running windows 7 or earlier zoom fixed the flaw with a software update soon after the flaw became public knowledge status fixed june 17 2020 zoom caves to critics will offer end to end encryption to everyone backing down after sustained criticism from privacy advocates zoom announced in a blog posting june 17 that its upcoming end to end encryption e2e wouldn t just be for paid users any more the millions of people who use zoom for free for school socializing and work would get end to end encryption too we have identified a path forward that balances the legitimate right of all users to privacy and the safety of users on our platform ceo eric s yuan wrote this will enable us to offer e2ee as an advanced add on feature for all of our users around the globe free and paid while maintaining the ability to prevent and fight abuse on our platform but if you re a free user who wants e2e you ll first have to verify your identity to zoom via a one time password or similar service this will make it harder to zoom bomb meetings the e2e encryption will remain an optional feature yuan reminded because when it s activated no one can join a meeting over the phone or with certain office teleconferencing equipment it ll be up to meeting hosts whether to activate e2e june 12 2020 censorship zoom s in hot water in the u s over free speech and censorship after bowing to chinese government demands it temporarily suspended the accounts of three chinese dissidents who were hosting open meetings commemorating the june 4 anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre the company apologized for the actions in a blog post june 11 and said it would develop a way to block meeting participants from certain locations i e china without shutting down meetings entirely that wasn t enough to satisfy more than a dozen u s congressmen and senators from both parties who wrote letters to chinese born zoom ceo eric s yuan demanding to know how cozy his company was with the beijing government june 4 2020 cisco talos reveals two serious zoom flaws talos an information security research firm owned by cisco revealed june 3 that it had found two serious flaws in zoom client applications both of which have now been patched the first flaw would have let an attacker use a specially created animated gif placed in a zoom meeting chat to hack zoom client software on other people s machines to force the installation of malware or as talos put it achieve arbitrary code execution the second flaw also involves the chat function in zoom meeting client software with similarly serious potential consequences the problem was that zoom did not validate the contents of shared compressed files such as zip files an attacker could have sent malware in the form of a compressed file to a user via zoom meeting chat and the user s zoom client would have saved and opened the malware within the zoom application s directory even worse if the user were to save the zoom compressed file elsewhere on the pc such as on the desktop then the attacked could send an altered version of the first file with the same name zoom would open the second version but not the first automatically permitting the malware to plant binaries at almost arbitrary paths and potentially overwrite important files and lead to arbitrary code execution status fixed monday june 1 2020 end to end encryption may be limited to paid users zoom s upcoming end to end encryption is mainly for paid users as zoom itself stated back on may 7 but alex stamos a well known information security expert who is consulting zoom on security matters told reuters last week that schools and other non profit enterprises might be able to also get the end to end encryption for their accounts the ceo is looking at different arguments stamos told reuters the current plan is paid customers plus enterprise accounts where the company knows who they are all administrators of zoom rooms need to update their software by may 30 zoom said in a blog posting may 26 the update to zoom 5 0 will provide greater security and privacy host controls zoom said but also meet the minimum requirements of version 5 0 or greater for gcm encryption which will be enabled and required for all meetings on may 30 more information about updating zoom rooms is here the 5 0 updates for zoom client software were pushed out to windows mac android ios chrome os amazon fire and linux users at the end of april may 21 2020 corrupted zoom installers two more instances of corrupted zoom installers were found by trend micro researchers the first opens up a backdoor on a pc the second spies on the pc s owner with screenshots keylogging and webcam hijacking and drafts the pc into the devil shadow botnet both installers do install the zoom software client so victims may be none the wiser as always get your zoom software straight from the zoom website at zoom us or join a zoom meeting straight from your web browser zoom suffered an unexplained outage sunday may 17 rendering it unavailable to thousands of users in the u s and u k the outage which began sunday morning u k time lasted several hours and affected online church services in both countries even the british government s daily coronavirus briefing was affected knocking out the ability of journalists to ask questions over zoom some users reported on twitter that logging out of zoom accounts then logging back in seemed to solve the issue zoom s status page noted that a backend update had taken place earlier sunday morning but there didn t seem to be any linkage between that update and the outage that began a few hours later the zoom status page said at the time that the outages appear to be limited to a subset of users and that zoom was working to identify the root cause and scope of this issue a few hours later the problem was declared resolved without further details may 12 2020 domain impersonation cybercriminals may have registered hundreds of new zoom related website addresses in the past few weeks according to researchers at israeli security firm check point many of these sites are being used in phishing attacks to grab victims zoom usernames and passwords and similar scams are leveraging rival video conferencing platforms such as google meet and microsoft teams over the weekend online vandals hijacked the graduation ceremony at oklahoma city university replacing the zoom video feed with racist language and symbols it wasn t immediately clear whether this was a result of regular zoom bombing or if the attackers used less well known methods to disrupt the video feed may 8 2020 zoom bans free users from tech support calls zoom announced may 7 that due to its technical support staff being overwhelmed with calls it would be able to give personal technical assistance only to owners and administrators of paid accounts in other words any user owner or administrator of a free zoom account and end users of paid accounts won t be entitled to human help instead they ll have to rely on the faqs and how to s list on the zoom online resources page for now this provision applies only to may and june 2020 if the coronavirus lockdown last longer than that zoom may have to hire more tech support staffers may 7 2020 zoom promises to beef up security in agreement with n y attorney general new york state attorney general letitia james office reached an agreement with zoom may 7 following an investigation into zoom s security and privacy practices there isn t a lot of new stuff in the agreement most of the nyag s complaints with zoom involved issues discussed in this story you re reading most of the stipulations zoom agreed to are things the company is already doing including making passwords mandatory and using better encryption in the long term zoom has to conduct regular code reviews and conduct yearly penetration testing exercises in which paid hackers try to break through the company s defenses only two new things will directly affect consumers zoom has to beef up password security by preventing automated password stuffing attacks such as by adding captchas to login pages and must automatically reset compromised passwords it also has to update its acceptable use policies to ban abusive conduct include hatred against others based on race religion ethnicity national origin gender or sexual orientation frankly these are longstanding standard policies at many other online companies so we re a little surprised that they weren t already zoom policies may 7 2020 zoom buys encryption startup zoom is buying the small new york city startup keybase in a bid to quickly implement true end to end encryption for zoom meetings zoom ceo eric s yuan announced the purchase price or other terms of the deal were not disclosed keybase makes user friendly software to easily and securely encrypt messaging and social media posts in march zoom had to admit that its touted end to end encryption was not the real thing because zoom s own servers are always able to access the contents of meetings once keybase s technology is incorporated that will no longer always be the case may 6 2020 meeting passwords and waiting rooms enabled by default meeting passwords and waiting rooms will be required by default for all zoom meetings free or paid beginning may 9 zoom announced only hosts will be able to share their screens by default but like the other settings that can be changed may 5 zoom ceo yuan addresses security nationality issues in a company blog post zoom ceo eric s yuan said the massive increase in zoom usage since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown had been challenging but also provided opportunities for us to drive meaningful change and improvement yuan admitted that we failed to set pre configured security features for our new customers especially for schools referring to meeting passwords and waiting rooms instead we assumed they would understand our platform like our business customers understand our platform and customize these features themselves that resulted in uninvited offensive and sometimes even truly evil people disrupting meetings yuan wrote such a person disrupted a zoom meeting on sexual violence in the bay area last week yuan also addressed rumors about his own and zoom s ties to china he said he had lived in the u s since 1997 and had become a u s citizen in 2007 and that zoom is a fully american company similar to many multinational technology companies zoom has operations and employees in china operated by subsidiaries of the u s parent company yuan wrote our operations in china are materially similar to our u s peers who also operate and have employees there we have 1 one co located data center in china run by a leading australian company and is geofenced yuan added it exists primarily to satisfy our fortune 500 customers that have operations or customers in china and want to use our platform to connect with them may 4 2020 eavesdropping on zoom meetings a reporter for london s financial times resigned after he was caught crashing internal zoom meetings at rival london newspapers mark di stefano announced his resignation on twitter after the independent documented how di stefano had last week joined an independent staff meeting regarding pay cuts and furloughs first under his own name then anonymously shortly thereafter the financial times ran a story by di stefano about the independent making cutbacks di stefano cited his sources as people on the call the independent said the independent also found that di stefano s cellphone had earlier been used to access a zoom meeting at the evening standard another london newspaper that meeting was followed by a financial times piece about evening standard furloughs and pay cuts may 1 2020 security flaws in other videoconferencing software zoom isn t the only video conferencing platform to have questionable privacy policies consumer reports said in a blog post cisco webex microsoft s teams and skype and google s duo meet and hangouts do too all three companies can collect data while you re in a videoconference combine it with information from data brokers and other sources to build consumer profiles and potentially tap into the videos for purposes like training facial recognition systems consumer reports said consumer reports said you should know that everything in a video meeting may be recorded either by the host or another participant it also recommended dialing into video conference meetings over the phone not creating accounts with the services if possible and using burner email addresses otherwise april 30 2020 zoom caught fibbing again zoom stock shares dipped nearly 9 thursday april 30 the day the company joined the nasdaq 100 stock index after prodding from reporters at the verge zoom admitted that it did not in fact have a recent peak of 300 million daily users as stated in a blog post last week rather zoom had a peak of 300 million daily participants if you attend more than one zoom meeting per day then you re counted as a separate participant each time we unintentionally referred to these participants as users and people zoom said in a statement to the verge this was a genuine oversight on our part so how many daily users does zoom now have the company hasn t said april 30 2020 more malware embedded zoom installers researchers at trend micro spotted another zoom installer file that had been corrupted with malware in this case it s spyware that can turn on the webcam take screenshots and log keystrkes as well as collecting diagnostic data about the system it s running on it also installs a fully working version of the zoom desktop client since the system downloaded a legitimate zoom application version 4 6 it won t make the users suspicious the trend micro team noted in a blog post however the system has already been compromised at this point you don t need to install any software on your desktop to run zoom but if you must then get that software only from the official website at april 29 2020 zoom a target for foreign hackers zoom is a prime target for foreign spies especially chinese intelligence operatives the department of homeland security has warned u s government agencies and law enforcement agencies according to abc news zoom s sudden immense growth and use across both public and private sector entities in combination with its highly publicized cybersecurity issues creates a vulnerable target rich environment the dhs intelligence analysis purportedly says any organization currently using or considering using zoom should evaluate the risk of its use foreign spies would be interested in any internet based communications medium that saw such a steep increase in growth but the dhs report singled out china as a likely meddler in zoom security because zoom has a substantial number of staffers in that country china s access to zoom servers makes beijing uniquely positioned to target u s public and private sector users abc news quoted the dhs report as stating however zoom in the past week has given paid meeting hosts the option of avoiding zoom servers in specific regions including china and north america unpaid zoom hosts will by default use only servers in their home regions a zoom spokesperson told abc news that the dhs report was heavily misinformed and included blatant inaccuracies april 28 2020 zoom safer to use than apple s facetime a new report from mozilla the non profit maker of the firefox web browser says that zoom s privacy and security policies and practices are better than those of apple facetime zoom scores 5 5 on encryption password strength updates bug reporting and privacy the report says matching skype signal bluejeans and google s trio of duo hangouts and meet facetime got only 4 5 5 because the apple video call service doesn t require the user to log into the app independently april 28 2020 zoom phishing scam preys on work from home fears a new zoom phishing scam is sure to get the attention of anyone working from home during the coronavirus lockdown it seems to come from your employer s hr department and invites you to join a zoom meeting starting in a few minutes to discuss possible termination of your employment if you click on the link in the email to join the meeting you re taken to a very real looking zoom login page it s fake if you enter your credentials then the crooks can take over your zoom account april 27 2020 zoom 5 0 has been released zoom has finally updated its meeting client software to version 5 0 announced last week here s our guide on how to update to zoom 5 0 the update is not yet available for ios as apple has to vet the software before the new version of the app can be pushed out we also couldn t see in the google play app store as of monday afternoon eastern time april 27 but odds are it will appear soon april 24 2020 zoom announces it will join the nasdaq 100 index zoom company stock rose again friday after the nasdaq stock exchange announced that zoom would join the nasdaq 100 index thursday april 30 no other company may have benefited more from the stay at home orders during the coronavirus crisis it s hard to imagine that zoom would be joining the nasdaq 100 if its daily traffic had not soared from 10 million users in december 2019 to 300 million in mid april april 23 2020 zoom s stock surges despite all the bad news about zoom the company s stock price surged on thursday gaining 9 after the announcement that the number of daily users had risen to 300 million to put that in perspective daily usage peaked at 200 million people per day in march the company said on april 1 in december 2019 zoom usage peaked at 10 million daily users april 22 2020 zoom 5 0 announced in a somewhat misleading press announcement blog post zoom trumpeted the arrival of version 5 0 of its desktop software for windows mac and linux the new version will include many of the security fixes we ve recently seen for the zoom web interface including the abilities to kick out zoom bombers from meetings make sure meeting data doesn t go through china and put everyone waiting for a meeting in a waiting room it also adds a security icon to the host screen and better encryption to zoom meetings we checked the zoom changelogs and discovered that the update won t be available until sunday april 26 april 22 2020 information scraping with fake zoom client software cisco talos researchers said zoom s meeting chat function made it too easy for outsiders to find all zoom users in an particular organization if you had a valid zoom account cisco talos explained in a blog post you could pretend that you worked at any organization and get the full names and chat ids of every registered zoom user whose email address used that organization s email domain you would not have to verify that you worked there and you wouldn t even need to be in a zoom meeting to get the information that information could be leveraged to disclose further contact information including the user s email address phone number and any other information that is present in their vcard or digital business card cisco talos wrote this vulnerability could be exploited by a spear phishing attack against known individuals with an organization in order to dump the email addresses of all the zoom users within the organization the cisco talos post said users who have recently had to install new software in order to set up remote working may be particularly susceptible to socially engineered emails that purport to instruct users to install a new or updated trojan horse zoom client fortunately zoom has fixed this issue which lay entirely on the server side status fixed in a blog post april 20 zoom said the option of excluding certain countries from call routing was now live this will let zoom meeting administrators avoid having meeting data routed through zoom servers in china the u s or seven other regions and countries new updates to the zoom platform for the web interface rolled out april 19 include masking some participant personal information such as email addresses or phone numbers during meetings another change is that users who share the same email domain will no longer be able to search for each other by name april 20 2020 dropbox created its own bug bounty program for zoom the new york times reported that dropbox executives were so concerned about security flaws in zoom that in 2018 dropbox created its own secret bug bounty program for zoom flaws in other words dropbox would pay hackers for security vulnerabilities they found in zoom dropbox staffers used zoom regularly and dropbox was an investor in zoom the times reported that dropbox would confirm the flaws then pass them along to zoom so that zoom could fix them april 17 2020 finding zoom meeting recordings online is easy part 2 zoom meeting video recordings saved on zoom s cloud servers can be easily discovered and often viewed a security researcher told cnet phil guimond noticed that online recordings of zoom meetings have a predictable url structure and are thus easy to find the washington post reported last week on a similar issue with zoom recordings that had been uploaded by users to third party cloud servers in those cases the file names of meeting recordings followed a predictable pattern until zoom pushed out a series of updates this past tuesday zoom meeting recordings were not required to be password protected guimond built a simple tool that automatically searches for zoom meeting recordings and tries to open them if a meeting has a password his tool tries to brute force access by running through millions of possible passwords if a meeting recording is viewable so is the zoom meeting id and the attacker might be able to access future recurring meetings to defeat guimond s automated tool zoom added a captcha challenge which forces the would be meeting recording watcher to prove they re a human but guimond said the url pattern is still the same and attackers could still try to open each generated result manually status mitigated with additional obstacles against attack but not really fixed april 16 2020 zoom revamps its bug bounty program zoom announced it was hiring luta security a consulting firm headed by katie moussouris to revamp zoom s bug bounty program which pays hackers to find software flaws moussouris set up the first bug bounty programs at microsoft and the pentagon in her own blog post she announced that zoom was bringing in other well regarded information security firms and researchers to improve its security in its weekly webinar according to zdnet zoom also said it would also let meeting hosts report abusive users and newly hired security consultant alex stamos said zoom would be switching to a more robust encryption standard after zoom s existing encryption was found to be lacking in other news a congressman has complained that a congressional briefing held over zoom on april 3 was zoom bombed at least three times april 15 2020 bank official warns against the dangers of remote meetings the head of standard chartered a london based multinational bank has warned employees to not use zoom or google hangouts for remote meetings citing security concerns according to reuters standard chartered primarily uses the rival blue jeans video conferencing platform according to two bank staffers who spoke anonymously last year standard chartered agreed to pay british and american regulators 1 1 billion after admitting the bank violated trade sanctions on iran april 15 2020 zoom zero day exploits on sale for 500 000 hackers are apparently offering to sell two zero day exploits in zoom to the highest bidder vice reports zero days are hacks that take advantage of vulnerabilities the software maker doesn t know about and which users have little or no defense against sources who told vice about the zero days said one exploit is for windows and lets a remote attacker get full control of a target s computer the catch is that the attacker and the target have to be on the same zoom call its asking price is 500 000 i think it s just kids who hope to make a bang one unnamed source told vice the other zero day is said to be for macos and to be less serious status apparently unfixed april 14 2020 paid users can choose their data region zoom announced april 13 that users of paid zoom accounts would be able to choose through which region of the world their data would be routed australia canada china europe india japan hong kong latin america or the united states this is a reaction to the discovery earlier in april that many zoom meetings hosted by and involving u s residents had been routed through servers based in china a country that retains the right to see anything happening on a domestically located server without a warrant users of zoom s free service will have their data handled only by servers in their regions status this option is now available for paid zoom users who use the web interface rather than the desktop software the zoom desktop software for windows mac and linux will be getting this april 26 open unresolved issues more than 500 000 zoom accounts up for grabs usernames and passwords for more than 500 000 zoom accounts are being sold or given away in criminal marketplaces these accounts were not compromised as the result of a zoom data breach but instead through credential stuffing that s when criminals try to unlock accounts by re using credentials from accounts compromised in previous data breaches it works only if an account holder uses the same password for more than one account status unknown but this isn t zoom s fault 2 300 sets of zoom login credentials found online researchers from ingsights discovered a set of 2 300 zoom login credentials being shared in a criminal online forum aside from personal accounts there were many corporate accounts belonging to banks consultancy companies educational facilities healthcare providers and software vendors amongst others intsight s etay maor wrote in a blog post april 10 while some of the accounts only included an email and password others included meeting ids names and host keys maor wrote maor told threatpost it didn t seem like the credentials came from a zoom data breach given their relatively small number he theorized that they came from small lists and databases kept by other companies agencies it s also possible that some of the credentials were the result of credential stuffing that s the largely automated process by which criminals try to log into websites by cycling through likely email addresses and likely passwords and then harvest whatever yields a positive result status unknown this likely isn t a zoom issue per se zoom zero day exploits information security researchers know of several zoom zero day exploits according to vice zero days are exploits for software vulnerabilities that the software maker doesn t know about and hasn t fixed and hence has zero days to prepare before the exploits appear however one vice source implied that other video conferencing solutions also had security flaws another source said that zoom zero days weren t selling for much money due to lack of demand status unresolved until some of these flaws come to light zoom compromised accounts traded online criminals are trading compromised zoom accounts on the dark web yahoo news reported this information apparently came from israeli cybersecurity firm sixgill which specializes in monitoring underground online criminal activity we weren t able to find any mention of the findings on the sixgill website sixgill told yahoo it had spotted 352 compromised zoom accounts that included meeting ids email addresses passwords and host keys some of the accounts belonged to schools and one each to a small business and a large healthcare provider but most were personal status not really a bug but definitely worth worrying about if you have a zoom account make sure its password isn t the same as the password for any other account you have zoom installer bundled with malware researchers at trend micro discovered a version of the zoom installer that has been bundled with cryptocurrency mining malware i e a coin miner the zoom installer will put zoom version 4 4 0 0 on your windows pc but it comes with a coin miner that trend micro has given the catchy name trojan win32 mooz thccabo by the way the latest zoom client software for windows is up to version 4 6 9 and you should get it only from here the coin miner will ramp up your pc s central processor unit and its graphics card if there is one to solve mathematical problems in order to generate new units of cryptocurrency you ll notice this if you fans suddenly speed up or if windows task manager hit ctrl shift esc shows unexpectedly heavy cpu gpu use to avoid getting hit with this malware make sure you re running one of the best antivirus programs and don t click on any links in emails social media posts or pop up messages that promise to install zoom on your machine status open but this isn t zoom s problem to fix it can t stop other people from copying and redistributing its installation software zoom encryption not what it claims to be not only does zoom mislead users about its end to end encryption see further down but its seems to be flat out um not telling the truth about the quality of its encryption algorithm zoom says it use aes 256 encryption to encode video and audio data traveling between zoom servers and zoom clients i e you and me but researchers at the citizen lab at the university of toronto in a report posted april 3 found that zoom actually uses the somewhat weaker aes 128 algorithm even worse zoom uses an in house implementation of encryption algorithm that preserves patterns from the original file it s as if someone drew a red circle on a gray wall and then a censor painted over the red circle with a while circle you re not seeing the original message but the shape is still there we discourage the use of zoom at this time for use cases that require strong privacy and confidentiality the citizen lab report says such as governments worried about espionage businesses concerned about cybercrime and industrial espionage healthcare providers handling sensitive patient information and activists lawyers and journalists working on sensitive topics status unresolved in a blog post april 3 zoom ceo eric s yuan acknowledged the encryption issue but said only that we recognize that we can do better with our encryption design and we expect to have more to share on this front in the coming days in zoom s announcement of the upcoming april 26 desktop software update zoom said it would be upgrading the encryption implementation to a better format for all users by may 30 zoom software can be easily corrupted good software has built in anti tampering mechanisms to make sure that applications don t run code that s been altered by a third party zoom has such anti tampering mechanisms in place which is good but those anti tampering mechanisms themselves are not protected from tampering said a british computer student who calls himself lloyd in a blog post april 3 needless to say that s bad lloyd showed how zoom s anti tampering mechanism can easily be disabled or even replaced with a malicious version that hijacks the application if you re reading this with a working knowledge of how windows software works this is a pretty damning passage this dll can be trivially unloaded rendering the anti tampering mechanism null and void the dll is not pinned meaning an attacker from a 3rd party process could simply inject a remote thread in other words malware already present on a computer could use zoom s own anti tampering mechanism to tamper with zoom criminals could also create fully working versions of zoom that have been altered to perform malicious acts status unresolved zoom bombing anyone can bomb a public zoom meeting if they know the meeting number and then use the file share photo to post shocking images or make annoying sounds in the audio the fbi even warned about it a few days ago the host of the zoom meeting can mute or even kick out troublemakers but they can come right back with new user ids the best way to avoid zoom bombing is to not share zoom meeting numbers with anyone but the intended participants you can also require participants to use a password to log into the meeting on april 3 the u s attorney s office for the eastern district of michigan said that anyone who hacks into a teleconference can be charged with state or federal crimes it s not clear whether that applies only to eastern michigan status there are easy ways to avoid zoom bombing which we go through here leaks of email addresses and profile photos zoom automatically puts everyone sharing the same email domain into a company folder where they can see each other s information exceptions are made for people using large webmail clients such as gmail yahoo hotmail or outlook com but not apparently for smaller webmail providers that zoom might not know about several dutch zoom users who use isp provided email addresses suddenly found that they were in the same company with dozens of strangers and could see their email addresses user names and user photos status unresolved but an april 19 zoom software update for zoom web interface users makes sure users on the same email domain can no longer automatically search for each other by name the zoom desktop client software will get similar fixes april 26 sharing of personal data with advertisers several privacy experts some working for consumer reports pored over zoom s privacy policy and found that it apparently gave zoom the right to use zoom users personal data and to share it with third party marketers following a consumer reports blog post zoom quickly rewrote its privacy policy stripping out the most disturbing passages and asserting that we do not sell your personal data status unknown we don t know the details of zoom s business dealings with third party advertisers you can war drive to find open zoom meetings you can find open zoom meetings by rapidly cycling through possible zoom meeting ids a security researcher told independent security blogger brian krebs the researcher got past zoom s meeting scan blocker by running queries through tor which randomized his ip address it s a variation on war driving by randomly dialing telephone numbers to find open modems in the dial up days the researcher told krebs that he could find about 100 open zoom meetings every hour with the tool and that having a password enabled on the meeting is the only thing that defeats it status unknown zoom meeting chats don t stay private two twitter users pointed out that if you re in a zoom meeting and use a private window in the meeting s chat app to communicate privately with another person in the meeting that conversation will be visible in the end of meeting transcript the host receives status unknown resolved fixed issues zoom flaw allowed account hijacking a kurdish security researcher said zoom paid him a bug bounty a reward for finding a serious flaw for finding how to hijack a zoom account if the account holder s email address was known or guessed the researcher who calls himself s3c but whose real name may be yusuf abdulla said if he tried to log into zoom with a facebook account zoom would ask for the email address associated with that facebook account then zoom would open a new webpage notifying him that a confirmation email message had been sent to that email address the url of the notification webpage would have a unique identification tag in the address bar as an example that s much shorter than the real thing let s say it s zoom com signup 123456xyz when s3c received and opened the confirmation email message sent by zoom he clicked on the confirmation button in the body of the message this took him to yet another webpage that confirmed his email address was now associated with a new account so far so good but then s3c noticed that the unique identification tag in the zoom confirmation webpage s url was identical to the first id tag let s use the example zoom com confirmation 123456xyz the matching id tags one used before confirmation and the other after confirmation meant that s3c could have avoided receiving the confirmation email and clicking on the confirmation button altogether in fact he could have entered any email address yours mine or billgates gmail com into the original signup form then he could have copied the id tag from the resulting zoom notification page and pasted the id tag into an already existing zoom account confirmation page boom he d have access to any zoom account created using the targeted email address even if you already linked your account with a facebook account zoom automatically unlink it and link it with the attacker facebook account s3c wrote in his imperfect english and because zoom lets anyone using a company email address view all other users signed up with the same email domain e g company com s3c could have leveraged this method to steal all of a given company s zoom accounts so if an attacker create an account with email address attacker companyname com and verify it with this bug s3c wrote the attacker can view all emails that created with companyname com in zoom app in company contacts so that means the attacker can hack all accounts of the company zoom is fortunate that s3c is one of the good guys and didn t disclose this flaw publicly before zoom could fix it but it s such a simple flaw that it s hard to imagine no one else noticed it before status fixed thank god zoom removes meeting ids from screens zoom has released updates for its windows macos and linux desktop client software so that meeting ids will not display onscreen during meetings british prime minister boris johnson accidentally displayed a zoom meeting id in a tweet and the belgian cabinet made a similar mistake potential security vulnerability with zoom file sharing in an ask me anything webinar in early april zoom ceo eric s yuan said that zoom had discovered a potential security vulnerability with file sharing so we disabled that feature until this week participants in a zoom meeting could share files with each other using the meeting s chat function status fixed zoom cryptographic keys issued by chinese servers those aes128 encryption keys are issued to zoom clients by zoom servers which is all well and good except that the citizen lab found several zoom servers in china issuing keys to zoom users even when all participants in a meeting were in north america since zoom servers can decrypt zoom meetings and chinese authorities can compel operators of chinese servers to hand over data the implication is that the chinese government might be able to see your zoom meetings that s got to be bad news for the british government which has held at least one cabinet meeting over zoom status apparently fixed in a blog post april 3 zoom ceo eric s yuan responded to the citizen lab report by saying that it is possible certain meetings were allowed to connect to systems in china where they should not have been able to connect we have since corrected this security flaw with zoom meeting waiting rooms zoom advises meeting hosts to set up waiting rooms to avoid zoom bombing a waiting room essentially keeps participants on hold until a host lets them in either all at once or one at a time the citizen lab said it found a serious security issue with zoom waiting rooms and advised hosts and participants to not use them for now the citizen lab is not disclosing the details yet but has told zoom of the flaw we advise zoom users who desire confidentiality to not use zoom waiting rooms the citizen lab said in its report instead we encourage users to use zoom s password feature status fixed in a follow up to their initial report the citizen lab researchers disclosed that uninvited attendees to a meeting could nonetheless get the meeting s encryption key from the waiting room on april 7 zoom reported to us that they had implemented a server side fix for the issue the researchers said windows password stealing zoom meetings have side chats in which participants can sent text based messages and post web links but according to twitter user _g0dmode and anglo american cybersecurity training firm hacker house zoom until the end of march made no distinction between regular web addresses and a different kind of remote networking link called a universal naming convention unc path that left zoom chats vulnerable to attack if a malicious zoom bomber slipped a unc path to a remote server that he controlled into a zoom meeting chat an unwitting participant could click on it the participant s windows computer would then try to reach out to the hacker s remote server specified in the path and automatically try to log into it using the user s windows username and password the hacker could capture the password hash and decrypt it giving him access to the zoom user s windows account status yuan s blog post says zoom has now fixed this problem windows malware injection mohamed a baset of security firm seekurity said on twitter that the same filepath flaw also would let a hacker insert a unc path to a remote executable file into a zoom meeting chatroom if a zoom user running windows clicked on it a video posted by baset showed the user s computer would try to load and run the software the victim would be prompted to authorize the software to run which will stop some hacking attempts but not all status if the unc filepath issue is fixed then this should be as well ios profile sharing until late march zoom sent ios user profiles to facebook as part of the log in with facebook feature in the iphone and ipad zoom apps after vice news exposed the practice zoom said it hadn t been aware of the profile sharing and updated the ios apps to fix this status fixed malware like behavior on macs we learned last summer that zoom used hacker like methods to bypass normal macos security precautions we thought that problem had been fixed then along with the security flaw it created but a series of tweets march 30 from security researcher felix seele who noticed that zoom installed itself on his mac without the usual user authorizations revealed that there was still an issue ever wondered how the zoom_us macos installer does it s job without you ever clicking install turns out they ab use preinstallation scripts manually unpack the app using a bundled 7zip and install it to applications if the current user is in the admin group no root needed pic twitter com qgq1xdu11mmarch 30 2020 see more they ab use preinstallation scripts manually unpack the app using a bundled 7zip and install it to applications if the current user is in the admin group no root needed seele wrote the application is installed without the user giving his final consent and a highly misleading prompt is used to gain root privileges the same tricks that are being used by macos malware seele elaborated in a more user friendly blog post here zoom founder and ceo eric s yuan tweeted a friendly response to join a meeting from a mac is not easy that is why this method is used by zoom and others yuan wrote your point is well taken and we will continue to improve update in a new tweet april 2 seele said zoom had released a new version of the zoom client for macos that completely removes the questionable preinstall technique and the faked password prompt i must say that i am impressed that was a swift and comprehensive reaction good work zoom_us seele added zoom just released an update for the macos installer which completely removes the questionable preinstall technique and the faked password prompt i must say that i am impressed that was a swift and comprehensive reaction good work zoom_us pic twitter com vau556tyaaapril 2 2020 see more status fixed a backdoor for mac malware other people could use zoom s dodgy mac installation methods renowned mac hacker patrick wardle said in a blog post march 30 wardle demonstrated how a local attacker such as a malicious human or already installed malware could use zoom s formerly magical powers of unauthorized installation to escalate privileges and gain total control over the machine without knowing the administrator password wardle also showed that a malicious script installed into the zoom mac client could give any piece of malware zoom s webcam and microphone privileges which do not prompt the user for authorization and could turn any mac with zoom installed into a potential spying device this affords malware the ability to record all zoom meetings or simply spawn zoom in the background to access the mic and webcam at arbitrary times wardle wrote status yuan s blog post says zoom has fixed these flaws other issues zoom pledges to fix flaws in a blog post april 1 zoom ceo and founder eric s yuan acknowledged zoom s growing pains and pledged that regular development of the zoom platform would be put on hold while the company worked to fix security and privacy issues we recognize that we have fallen short of the community s and our own privacy and security expectations yuan wrote explaining that zoom had been developed for large businesses with in house it staffers who could set up and run the software we now have a much broader set of users who are utilizing our product in a myriad of unexpected ways presenting us with challenges we did not anticipate when the platform was conceived he said these new mostly consumer use cases have helped us uncover unforeseen issues with our platform dedicated journalists and security researchers have also helped to identify pre existing ones to deal with these issues yuan wrote zoom would be enacting a feature freeze effectively immediately and shifting all our engineering resources to focus on our biggest trust safety and privacy issues among other things zoom would also be conducting a comprehensive review with third party experts and representative users to understand and ensure the security of all of our new consumer use cases zoom now requires passwords by default for most zoom meetings although meetings hosts can turn that feature off passwords are the easiest way to stop zoom bombing and on april 8 former facebook and yahoo chief security officer alex stamos said he would be working with zoom to improve its security and privacy stamos is now an adjunct professor at stanford and is highly regarded within the information security community phony end to end encryption zoom claims its meetings use end to end encryption if every participant calls in from a computer or a zoom mobile app instead of over the phone but under pressure from the intercept a zoom representative admitted that zoom s definitions of end to end and endpoint are not the same as everyone else s when we use the phrase end to end a zoom spokeperson told the intercept it is in reference to the connection being encrypted from zoom end point to zoom end point sound good but the spokesperson clarified that he counted a zoom server as an endpoint every other company considers an endpoint to be a user device a desktop laptop smartphone or tablet but not a server and every other company takes end to end encryption to mean that servers that relay messages from one endpoint to another can t decrypt the messages when you send an apple message from your iphone to another iphone user apple s servers help the message get from one place to another but they can t read the content not so with zoom it can see whatever is going on in its meetings and sometimes it may have to in order to make sure everything works properly just don t believe the implication that it can t update in a blog post april 1 zoom chief product officer oded gal wrote that we want to start by apologizing for the confusion we have caused by incorrectly suggesting that zoom meetings were capable of using end to end encryption we recognize that there is a discrepancy between the commonly accepted definition of end to end encryption and how we were using it he wrote gal assured users that all data sent and received by zoom client applications but not regular phone lines business conferencing systems or presumably browser interfaces is indeed encrypted and that zoom servers or staffers do not decrypt it at any point before it reaches the receiving clients however gal added zoom currently maintains the key management system for these systems in the cloud but has implemented robust and validated internal controls to prevent unauthorized access to any content that users share during meetings the implication is that zoom doesn t decrypt user transmissions by choice but because it holds the encryption keys zoom could if it had to such as if it were presented with a warrant or a u s national security letter essentially a secret warrant for those worried about government snooping gal wrote that zoom has never built a mechanism to decrypt live meetings for lawful intercept purposes nor do we have means to insert our employees or others into meetings without being reflected in the participant list he added that companies and other enterprises would soon be able to handle their own encryption process a solution will be available later this year to allow organizations to leverage zoom s cloud infrastructure but host the key management system within their environment status this is an issue of misleading advertising rather than an actual software flaw we hope zoom stops using the term end to end encryption incorrectly but just keep in mind that you won t be getting the real thing with zoom until it fully implements the technology it s buying with keybase zoom meeting recordings can be found online privacy researcher patrick jackson noticed that zoom meeting recordings saved to the host s computer generally get a certain type of file name so he searched unprotected cloud servers to see if anyone had uploaded zoom recordings and found more than 15 000 unprotected examples according to the washington post jackson also found some recorded zoom meetings on youtube and vimeo this isn t really zoom s fault it s up to the host to decide whether to record a meeting and zoom gives paying customers the option to store recordings on zoom s own servers it s also up to the host to decide to change the recording s file name if you host a zoom meeting and decide to record it then make sure you change the default file name after you re done status this is not really zoom s problem to be honest

888 203 1112 passcode 5310073 non gaap information one gas has disclosed net margin in this news release which is considered a non gaap financial metric used to measure the company s financial performance net margin is comprised of total revenues less cost of natural gas cost of natural gas includes commodity purchases fuel storage transportation and other gas purchase costs recovered through our cost of natural gas regulatory mechanisms and does not include an allocation of general operating costs or depreciation and amortization in addition these regulatory mechanisms provide a method of recovering natural gas costs on an ongoing basis without a profit therefore although our revenues will fluctuate with the cost of natural gas that we pass through to our customers net margin is not affected by fluctuations in the cost of natural gas accordingly we routinely use net margin in the analysis of our financial performance we believe that net margin provides investors a more relevant and useful measure to analyze our financial performance as a 100 regulated natural gas utility than total revenues because the change in the cost of natural gas from period to period does not impact our operating income a reconciliation of net margin to the most directly comparable gaap measure is included as a table at the end of the earnings tables accompanying this release one gas inc nyse ogs is a 100 regulated natural gas utility and trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol ogs one gas is included in the s p midcap 400 index and is one of the largest natural gas

the s p 500 dow jones industrial average and nasdaq 100 fell from earlier highs as investors considered the impact of the 10 year treasury yield hitting as low as 1 15 on monday putting concerns about growth in focus i think people are looking at the sharp drop in long rates and flattening of the yield curve and they are getting worried about economic growth said peter boockvar chief investment officer for bleakley advisory group that growth concern comes from the inflation driven slowdown we re seeing in some sectors in addition to delta variant worries in emerging markets u s equities initially followed stocks in europe and asia higher amid upbeat earnings and a surge in corporate dealmaking which had offset concerns over the spread of the delta virus variant and china s regulatory crackdown square inc s 29 billion deal for afterpay ltd has put global dealmakers on course for the busiest ever summer meanwhile china s market regulator has called for more cooperation with the u s on initial public offerings the unsteady moves at the start of the month come as august has historically been a month that starts off weak especially if the s p 500 is already up over 10 according to bespoke investment group llc maybe in a year in which the s p 500 performs so strongly heading into august a pause is just what it needs before finishing off the year strong the harrison new york based firm wrote in a note monday but while august may be weaker stock market bulls can claim to have history on their side the s p 500 rose for a sixth straight month in july the longest such streak since 2018 and the average 12 month return after similar runs in the past half century is 8 3 according to data compiled by bloomberg many risks remain however a surge in the covid 19 delta variant could harm the u s recovery and keep some americans from looking for work minneapolis fed president neel kashkari said ahead of friday s u s jobs report unexpectedly weak growth in manufacturing could also add to expectations for a steadier recovery after a key factory reading from china also slipped meanwhile tensions with iran over a deadly attack on a tanker could also weigh on markets crude oil was lower on monday after the u s israel and the u k vowed to respond to the attack matt maley chief market strategist for miller tabak co said monday s performance could be attributed to bond yields and the drop in oil prices facing lower demand if that is signaling lower growth that could be a problem for stocks he said
over the campaign the inquiry was phenomenal i was losing sundays just to keep abreast of it and that inquiry was coming from interstate overseas and local mr tewhata said the ocean views from 8 stevens street sunshine beach on the day bidding started at 6 5 million and there was a gasp from the crowd i think in the end it was down to two bidders and they were battling it out for the right of ownership and they were both interstate buyers but they were also familiar with the noosa property market the owners actually bought the land through me about four years ago and i think it did blow their minds the home which features exquisite indoor outdoor spaces a pool and ocean views is one of a handful of multimillion dollar properties to transact in the region over the past few months mr tewhata attributed the seaside hot spot s relaxed allure particularly during the pandemic as a key contributor to the real estate boom in sydney a family who had held onto their acreage home in horsley park for 40 years discovered they had been sitting on a little pile of gold after it sold under the hammer for 4 305 million an incredible 1 3 million above the reserve advertisement sprawling over five acres and featuring a cosy three bedroom cottage the tightly held piece of real estate at 30 40 truman road sent the eyebrows of the vendors and the selling agent into their hairlines when bidding quickly blew past the price guide 30 40 truman road horsley park sold for 1 3 million above the reserve eva frketic of the agency inner west managed the sale and said it was one of the most incredible auctions she had witnessed with 11 registered bidders vying for the home in front of an online crowd of almost 100 we were all a bit caught off guard i mean bidding started at 2 8 million and we were ecstatic with that we thought it was a great start but then it just went up from there ms frketic said we just didn t go into this auction expecting it to be the outcome that we had the successful bidder was from just outside the lga and when he won the winning bid he was ecstatic he quite openly admitted that he had exceeded what he was prepared to pay but he just thought it was too good an opportunity to give up advertisement although the sale left a lot of jaws on the floor ms frketic said it was a result of australian buyers pumping more money into bricks and mortar than ever in a trend that was directly linked to the pandemic and the global uncertainty it fostered 58 bilyana street balmoral in brisbane the flawless queenslander of freelancing gems chief executive fleur madden fetched 2 095 million under the hammer collecting the city s top sale at auction on saturday sitting on just a 439 square metre block and boasting five bedrooms and a hamptons inspired design 58 bilyana street in balmoral garnered 70 inspections over a short two week campaign before a sydney buyer landed the winning bid in a post auction instagram post ms madden said she had modelled the dream home on properties she had seen in the hamptons while living in new york as she and her family accumulated countless special memories there including an engagement and the arrival of two babies only good things have happened under this roof and now another lovely family will make beautiful memories here she said advertisement selling agent brandon wortley of ray white bulimba said on the day multiple registered buyers flocked to the home with frenzied bidding opening at 1 65 million there were 50 000 rises until 1 9 million and it was called on the market so it sold for over the reserve mr wortley said i think it s the start of a new era in property in brisbane and on the coal face we ve seen it coming for six to 12 months nearby at 31 eric crescent annerley a modest queenslander on a 653 square metre block sold for 265 000 above the reserve price after 16 registered bidders fought it out to 1 19 million selling agent and ray white principal annerley geoff sellars said the buyers were a young couple who were renting nearby and saw the immense value in the area thanks to its transport infrastructure and prime positioning to the gabba which will be refurbished in time to host the olympics back in sydney mcgrath hunters hill agent john paranchi collected 4 126 million for a five bedroom home on an 859 square metre block at 51 batemans road gladesville after a young family from rozelle beat seven registered bidders for the charming property advertisement mr paranchi said the sheer level of genuine buyer interest inspired the team to bring the auction forward to saturday 51 batemans road gladesville i think it was the great location close to all the schools and the beautiful garden and big family home mr paranchi said homes are also tightly held here and it sold above expectations and the vendor was over the moon i ve been selling in gladesville for 30 years and in the past 20 years the migration from the inner west with character homes it s a trend that has been going for a while but right now the market is strong and there s not a lot of stock in victoria a fixer upper on the mornington peninsula sold under the hammer for 2 215 million as seven registered buyers bidded for the home on a big block advertisement the holiday shack at 6 parkside street sorrento featuring a 962 square metre parcel of land had been tightly held for two decades but needed a big makeover 6 parkside street sorrento selling agent clayton smith of rt edgar portsea said the buyers were planning to spend some time and money restoring the cottage which they plan to keep as a holiday shack it was a great auction and actually while the forecast wasn t looking great on the day it turned out to be lovely so there was definitely a good crowd and it was nice for everyone to get out of lockdown mr smith said there s always interest in this area and we are thrilled of course for the new owners who are a young family in cheltenham a spotless three bedroom home at 9 fairview avenue collected 275 000 more than the reserve on saturday after a couple paid a potentially record breaking price of 1 4 million advertisement selling agent angela limanis of ray white cheltenham said four active bidders turned up for the auction which led to some pretty insane bidding i think it s the highest price for a three bedroom house of its kind on 585 square metres in that area ms limanis said it wasn t your typical cheltenham floor plan it had a few quirks but it was in the middle of the suburb close to everything which was a real drawcard bought the house for their parents to

remarked we are pleased with the momentum in our business as acadia delivered a strong financial and operating performance in the second quarter of 2021 these results reflect increased demand for our behavioral health services and our continued focus on driving efficiencies across our operations we experienced favorable volume trends demonstrating the strength of our proven operating model and successful execution of our growth strategy across our service lines all of which provide exceptional patient care importantly the growing acceptance surrounding mental health and substance abuse issues and the more favorable reimbursement environment for treatment have also been key drivers of demand we commend the hard work of acadia s dedicated employees and clinicians who have continued to support more patients who need our help with high quality care in a safe and accessible manner strategic investments in long term growth our growth strategy is centered around four distinct pathways that will allow acadia to reach more patients in both new and existing markets we are pleased with the progress we have made this year on our strategy as we have continued to make strategic investments designed to support long term growth across our service lines facility expansions continue to be a key driver of our growth and the best return on investment accordingly we added 86 beds to our operations in the second quarter which included 72 incremental beds from the opening of a 260 bed state of the art replacement facility for belmont behavioral hospital this facility will help meet the growing demand for behavioral health services in the philadelphia pennsylvania market and surrounding communities with the opening of the new facility we recorded a non cash property impairment of approximately 23 2 million for the existing facility we expect to meet our goal of adding approximately 300 beds to existing facilities by the end of the year another important growth opportunity for acadia is the development of wholly owned de novo facilities especially in markets with a shortage of beds for behavioral health treatment on may 24 2021 we opened glenwood behavioral health hospital an 80 bed hospital in cincinnati ohio this facility provides inpatient psychiatric treatment for those who are struggling with a mental health or a co occurring substance use disorder we also opened one comprehensive treatment center ctc in the second quarter of 2021 we continue to identify underserved markets for the treatment of patients with opioid use disorder and expect to open eight more ctcs this year as health systems across the country look for ways to integrate behavioral health care and expand treatment options acadia has developed a favorable reputation as a preferred partner for many leading providers in attractive markets and establishing new joint venture partnerships remains an important pathway for growth we recently announced a joint venture with bronson healthcare one of michigan s leading integrated healthcare systems to build a new 96 bed facility in battle creek michigan with this addition we now have 13 joint venture partnerships in place with premier health systems to expand our treatment network and improve access to care in more communities around the country we also have continued to identify acquisitions as another important opportunity to extend our market reach following regulatory approval we expect to soon complete the acquisition of vallejo behavioral a 61 bed psychiatric hospital in vallejo california from adventist health at the end of the third quarter we believe the fragmented behavioral healthcare industry offers additional prospects for acquisitions and we are well positioned with the financial strength to capitalize on these opportunities we believe acadia has the right strategy in place to continue to expand our network and meet the needs of more patients as we look ahead to the remainder of 2021 and

during the quarters ended june 30 2021 and march 31 2021 was 18 0 million and 16 7 million respectively the quarter over quarter increase was primarily due to a 3 3 million increase in interest income

e term preferred stock non gaap financial measure adjusted net investment income on a supplemental basis the company discloses adjusted net investment income including on a per share basis which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with u s gaap non gaap adjusted net investment income represents net investment income excluding capital gains based incentive fees the company uses this non gaap financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that this non gaap financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the company the company s investment advisory agreement provides that a capital gains based incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains but not unrealized appreciation to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation on investments for such year however under u s gaap a capital gains based incentive fee is accrued if realized capital gains and unrealized appreciation of investments exceed realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation of investments refer to note 4 related party transactions in our quarterly report on form 10 q for further discussion the company believes that adjusted net investment income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any capital gains based incentive fees as net investment income does not include realized or unrealized investment activity associated with the capital gains based incentive fee the following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income the most comparable u s gaap measure to adjusted net investment income for the periods presented dollars in

q3 2021 guidance metrics once we ve completed these remarks we ll open up the call for questions and with that i d now like to turn the call over to david deno david deno chief executive officer thanks mark and welcome to everyone listening today we are very pleased with the second quarter sales and profit performance our strategies are working and setting the company up for even more sustainable growth the success is directly tied to the planning and hard work that has taken place in our company over the last few years in 2019 we presented a comprehensive plan to build a stronger leaner operation centered company one focused on providing even better service and food to customer this plan was designed to significantly improve total shareholder return before we get into the details of the second quarter i want to take a few minutes to discuss the progress against the key five initiatives that underpin our 2019 plan first grow in restaurant sales by improving service levels and food offerings in the restaurants over the last few years we ve made investments in these areas to elevate the customer experience across the portfolio especially at outback as a result we are taking market share versus the industry in the second quarter u s same store sales were up 12 1 on a two year basis versus 2019 this was 890 basis points ahead of the industry we also made significant investments in our people since the start of the pandemic we have not furloughed any employees this decision contributed to retention and employee engagement scores that are among the best in the industry with sales volumes exceeding 2019 levels these actions provide a competitive advantage in retaining talent in this challenging environment maintaining a motivated and well trained employee base is critical to our long term success second through our leading off premises business we continue to capitalize on our strong off premises capabilities during the pandemic and the high off premises retention levels in 2021 are contributing to sales outperformance during the second quarter the company generated over 275 million in off premises sales representing approximately 28 of total revenue importantly profit margins in the off premises channel are approaching the margins of the in restaurant business this is the result of initiatives that were completed in the past few quarters we expect off premises to remain a large and growing part of the business going forward third rapidly improve operating margins by growing sales and reducing costs our goal is to grow operating margins by nearly 300 basis points to 7 5 of revenue margins in the second quarter were well ahead of this long range goal chris will provide additional detail regarding future margin targets we will leverage learnings from the pandemic including efforts to further optimize how to run and support restaurants importantly a number of technological and equipment innovations are in test that we hope to roll out in restaurants in the coming quarters these innovations should improve customer service and reduce costs fourth become an even more digitally savvy company in q2 digital sales represent approximately 20 of u s sales a 318 increase over 2019 levels we have made several investments to grow digital volumes and increase our capabilities throughout all aspects of the company recently we rolled out a new and improved outback app that has significantly improved the off premises ordering process early data and consumer feedback has been very positive the app will later showcase substantial investments we made to digitize and streamline the carryout experience these new app features will be rolling out in the coming quarters and we expect them to accelerate our very attractive carryout channel and finally build a much stronger balance sheet given our very good year to date results we generated a great deal of free cash flow and are paying down debt our credit metrics are improving each quarter and our goal is to be at three times lease adjusted leverage by early next year this will give us the liquidity to withstand unforeseen shocks a strong balance sheet also provides great flexibility to pursue business opportunities that will enhance shareholder value all of the initiatives above played a major part in producing an excellent second quarter importantly the sales momentum has carried forward into the third quarter through the first four weeks of q3 two year u s comp sales versus 2019 are up 15 2 these results would not have been possible without the talented and dedicated employees throughout the company i would like to thank the hard working team members in the restaurants and at the restaurant support center your commitment to serving guests with the highest levels of service hospitality and experience is what makes our restaurants so successful we intend to build on the progress we ve made against these major priorities and are excited about the potential ahead before concluding i would just like to add a couple of other priorities that you ll be hearing more about in the future first we believe there s an opportunity to accelerate new unit growth at outback and fleming s outback is a leading brand with substantial headroom for unit growth the success of the outback relocation program is a clear indicator of this demand in the past five years we ve relocated approximately 50 restaurants with sales lifts of 35 and average unit volumes of 4 6 million we recently developed a new less expensive prototype that will enable meaningful restaurant growth with healthy returns we also have the opportunity to open additional fleming s in california and florida our best performing markets fleming s is a proven category leader by any measure and will be a source of growth for our company second continue to grow brazil as it manages through the pandemic and resumes expansion sales in brazil are bouncing back quickly case counts from the virus are dropping rapidly and there s a strong adoption of the vaccine in the country we ve already had category leading brands in brazil and the company will be in even better position as we emerge from the pandemic as a reminder brazil is funding its own growth through internally generated cash in summary q2 was another terrific quarter we remain very focused on executing against our key initiatives we are optimistic that we will capture these opportunities and drive total shareholder return and with that i ll turn the call over to chris chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave and good morning everyone i would like to start by providing a recap of our financial performance for the fiscal second quarter of 2021 given the significant impact of covid on q2 2020 results most of our discussion today will compare against the second quarter of 2019 which we believe provides better context to our underlying performance total revenues in q2 were 1 08 billion which was up 5 from 2019 driven by an improved sales environment in the u s total revenues in the u s segment were up 10 versus 2019 this increase was fueled by additional in restaurant volume a high level of off premises retention and increases in average check total revenues in our international segment were down 37 on a two year basis the decline in international revenues was driven by brazil which had a significant headwind from covid related capacity constraints in q2 as i will discuss in a moment the sales trajectory for brazil is much improved thus far in q3 q2 u s comp sales finished up 12 1 on a two year basis average unit volumes were 75 000 per week in q2 geographically states in the southeast such as texas georgia and tennessee continued to post outsized sales gains while florida posted a 14 increase over 2019 importantly states in the northeast and midwest have reopened and nearly every state within our portfolio posted positive comp sales gains relative to 2019 q2 sales gains were driven by a healthy combination of traffic and average check both of which were up 6 versus 2019 our increases in check average relative to 2019 were driven by a 21 reduction in discounts increased menu mix and to a lesser degree 2019 pricing actions as a reminder we made menu price reductions at outback in late 2020 to make some of our more indulgent menu items more accessible from a price point perspective the trade into these higher priced items has validated our strategy and been a key contributor to the increases in average check importantly we have seen our sales momentum carry forward into the third quarter through the first four weeks of q3 our two year u s comp sales have been plus 15 2 and we have maintained nearly 71 000 in weekly average unit volumes in what is traditionally a slower time of the year turning to off premises this business has proven to be very sticky even as in restaurant volumes have improved in q2 we averaged 21 000 per restaurant per week in off premises sales off premises volumes were only down 2 000 per week in q2 from q1 despite significantly higher in restaurant volumes in q2 off premises is a large part of our ongoing success and will remain a key part of our growth strategy moving forward in terms of brand performance outback q2 comp sales were up 11 3 and carrabba s comp sales were up 16 7 on a two year basis the two year sales results at both brands were well ahead of major competitive benchmarks in restaurant sales are building as we emerge from the pandemic and the continued high levels of off premises retention have enabled these brands to surpass 2019 volumes total q2 off premises sales were 31 of revenues at outback and 36 of revenue at carrabba s at bonefish grill comp sales were up 4 2 in q2 on a two year basis the in restaurant experience and bar centric culture of bonefish was more impacted by capacity restrictions than our other casual dining brands despite this we have built an impressive off premises business at bonefish and it represented 19 of their sales in q2 fleming s comp sales were up 24 4 in q2 on a two year basis and was nearly 1 400 basis points above the knapp high end steakhouse category fleming s is differentiating itself in this competitive segment and is capitalizing on the reopening of california to drive outsized comp sales performance brazil comp sales were down 36 versus 2019 brazil covid cases increased significantly in early march which was the start of brazil s second quarter the corresponding restrictions on restaurant capacity had a large impact on brazil sales over the first two months of q2 comp sales versus 2019 were down 58 in march and 41 in april as the vaccination rate in brazil increased and case counts began to moderate we saw an immediate increase in sales comp sales in may were only down 9 versus 2019 this building momentum has continued into the third quarter despite ongoing capacity restrictions currently sao paulo and rio are operating at 60 capacity and 40 capacity respectively sales however are now approaching 2019 levels with the most recent three weeks down 5 on average versus 2019 our team in brazil continues to execute at an extremely high level and we are confident in their ability to navigate the current environment as it relates to other aspects of our q2 financial performance gaap diluted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 75 versus 1 05 of diluted loss per share in 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 81 versus 0 74 of adjusted diluted loss per share last year adjusted operating income from the quarter was 118 million this result exceeded our adjusted operating income from 2019 of 47 million this level of adjusted operating income is the highest in bloomin brands history adjusted operating income margin was 11 in q2 versus 4 6 in 2019 this improvement is driven by our strong sales recovery ongoing efforts to drive efficiency into our business and lower marketing expenses in terms of our q2 adjusted performance by cost category cogs was 150 basis points favorable to 2019 driven primarily by waste reduction and increases in average check the labor line was 200 basis points favorable to 2019 the large change in average unit volumes from 2019 drove significant leverage on labor in q2 in addition we also benefited from simplification efforts this showed up in a permanent reduction in food prep hours operating expenses were 180 basis points favorable to 2019 due primarily to a 20 million reduction in marketing expense and higher average unit volumes this favorability was offset by increases in to go supplies and third party delivery fees related to the growth in off premises on the g a front q2 was down 4 4 million from 2019 net of adjustments this includes the ongoing benefit of cost savings initiatives that we have detailed on prior calls in addition q2 contains additional incentive compensation given our strong performance expectations for 2021 on the franchise front over the last several weeks our california market has been averaging close to 21 comp sales on a two year basis we are collecting current royalties and have begun collecting on past due amounts as well our non california franchise locations both domestically and internationally also continue to perform well turning to our capital structure our total debt at the end of the second quarter was 850 million our trailing 12 month lease adjusted leverage ratio is 3 8 times we are making significant progress toward our targeted leverage ratio of 3x net debt to adjusted ebitdar once we reach our targeted ratio we will evaluate further debt paydown or other uses of cash to enhance shareholder value turning to our q3 guidance we expect q3 total revenues to be at least 1 015 billion this outcome for total revenues assumes a weekly average sales volume of approximately 69 000 for the in the u s for the remaining nine weeks of the quarter this is a slight decrease from current q3 volumes on the assumption that some traditional seasonality will resume as we move throughout the quarter should this seasonality not materialize there will be upside to this outlook for perspective total revenues in the third quarter of 2019 were 967 million we expect adjusted ebitda to be at least 115 million and we expect gaap eps to be at least 0 45 with adjusted eps of at least 0 50 these profitability measures for ebitda and eps would represent the highest levels our company has ever attained in a third quarter for perspective in 2019 our third quarter adjusted eps was 0 10 we believe our q3 guidance reflects continued optimism for our current performance in the u s and a more bullish outlook on brazil as they finish out their quarter in terms of full year 2021 guidance we do have a few items that need to be updated first we now expect commodity inflation to be approximately 1 versus our previous guidance of flat although we are locked on our largest commodities for the year such as beef our heavy sales volumes have required us to secure additional chicken and seafood supply outside of our contracted terms most of this inflation will impact the back half of the year and has been incorporated into our q3 guidance second g a is now expected to be between 240 million and 245 million for the year on an adjusted basis our prior guidance was g a of between 225 million and 230 million this increase is largely driven by a change in incentive compensation expectations for the year given our strong performance half of this increase was embedded into our q2 results the remainder will be spread equally across q3 and q4 despite this increase we are still on track to achieve the 40 million of transformational savings that we committed to in early 2020 finally capex is expected to be between 140 million and 150 million for the year the reduction from our prior guidance of between 170 million and 185 million is driven by shortages in raw materials particularly steel pushing some remodels relocations and new restaurants into 2022 finally i wanted to give a little more perspective on the long term margin framework that we have discussed with investors over the last couple of quarters as a reminder that framework suggested that once sales achieved 2019 levels our adjusted operating margin would be between 6 3 and 6 8 we have also committed to a longer term framework to achieve 7 5 operating margins as sales improved over 2019 levels given our recent performance we are more optimistic about the margins in the off premises business new outback menu and our marketing strategy than we were a few months ago we now believe that we can achieve a longer term operating margin of 8 there are a couple of reasons for this increase first we have continued to improve the efficiency and execution of the off premises business these efforts have resulted in higher off premises profit margins that are now approaching in restaurant margins second we think much of the favorability in average check will stick moving forward the new outback menu is contributing to a more permanent increase in average check than we expected in addition we have found new ways to provide value to consumers beyond traditional discounting although it is too early to discuss where 2022 may land at this point in time we continue to have confidence in our margin improvement efforts the levers i have outlined make us comfortable raising the bar on our long term framework by 50 basis points from 7 5 to 8 in summary this was another successful quarter for bloomin brands and we are well on our way to becoming a better stronger operations focused company and with that we will open up the call for questions questions answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session our first questions come from the line of jeffrey bernstein with barclays please proceed with your question jeff priester barclays analyst hey guys this is actually jeff priester on for jeff bernstein just on the margin front given the commodity environment and given that you guys are going to have to buy more commodities outside of your contract terms on the spot market than you originally anticipated what are your thoughts on the restaurant margin in the second half and also what is your level of pricing in the menu right now and then i have one follow up chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so pricing is relatively benign it s in that low 1 range a lot of the change in average check that you saw in the third quarter is driven by sort of an equal combination of discount reduction as well as menu mix with a less a smaller degree of average menu pricing i would say look we gave guidance for the third quarter so that should give you a pretty good indication of how we re feeling about margins certainly in q3 i think to look beyond that into q4 is probably a bit premature the only dynamics that we ve talked about publicly that we know for sure are going to impact us from a margin perspective in q4 are the commodity guidance that we gave obviously given the guidance being up to 1 we had a relatively benign commodity environment in the front half so the second half that implies somewhat of a 2 or so inflation in q3 probably closer to 3 commodity inflation in q4 and then on the wage front we have talked about the florida minimum wage increase kicking in in september that should cost us about 1 million a month relative to our run rate david deno chief executive officer yes just to add a couple of things this is all in the context of a rapidly improving margin story for the company and chris talked about the long term margin goals so that s really great news and then secondly our supply chain team has done a great job navigating commodities over the years you saw our performance this year you ve seen performance in the past and i m very confident that we will do a good job going forward on managing commodity costs chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes just as a reminder our q3 adjusted operating margins in 2019 were 2 3 our guidance would suggest an op margin closer to 7 5 for q3 and op margins or a 500 basis point improvement relative to 2019 jeff priester barclays analyst gotcha that makes complete sense and then just on the capex guidance you lowered it 30 million to 35 million noting the constraints on raw materials are pushing some units and remodels to 22 but yet your unit guidance is still for 20 to 25 units can you just give us some more color on the moving parts there and kind of where that 30 million to 35 million is actually coming out of chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it really just is a move from the higher end of our new unit guidance to the lower end of our new unit guidance as well there s probably three year or so relocations that got pushed as well as some remodel expense there s also some infrastructure projects shortage of chips and things like that that got pushed into early 2022 jeff priester barclays analyst gotcha and then the last one for me just on off premise i think it s gone down from 35 of sales to about 28 this quarter where do you think that settles long term and then what portion of your customers do you believe use the brand for both off premise and in restaurant dining david deno chief executive officer well i think our long term mix and i think it s important to look at revenue dollars not necessarily mix because as in restaurant dining comes back it s natural that that mix will drop a bit so revenue dollars 275 million in revenue we hope to grow that from there and we also hope that the in restaurant dining continues to improve so we want the off premises volume to be a big part of where we go as a company importantly the third party delivery business is 100 million and that s growing right now incremental that s clearly the incremental business for us so i would just wrap this up by saying we want to look at revenue dollars mix who knows where it s going to end up a lot of that will depend on what happens with in restaurant dining and the most important thing is that we have a multichannel business in restaurant carryout and delivery that s very strong and as chris mentioned the margins in the off premise business is now pretty much equal to our in restaurant dining business which is a very important development jeff priester barclays analyst appreciate it you guys thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of brett levy with mkm partners please proceed with your question brett levy mkm partners analyst great thanks for taking my question you spoke a little bit about some pretty significant market share gains can you give a little bit more granular detail and just you talked about the strength that you re seeing across some of those the southeast regions but how are you seeing your share gains in both the earliest markets and also some of the more recently recovering markets and then just on the labor front you ve obviously done a great job of retention where are you right now in terms of your turnover or what percentage of your system still needs to supplement your labor force thanks david deno chief executive officer yes i think on the labor front i ll turn over to chris on the sales we didn t let anybody go we didn t furlough anybody we didn t let anybody go so our initial starting point was much higher than many others in the industry and then we got tremendous employee engagement and retention so our turnover levels we believe are among the best in the industry so our staffing levels are very strong there are pockets of opportunity no doubt but our staffing levels are very strong and the other thing is we ve done a really good job managing the labor model and we re not at 2019 hour utilization we re not at that level we ve been able to take some efficiencies in the restaurants through some equipment investments and some other things so i think our payroll practices have been extremely important for us our retention and turnover levels are very good and i think we got a good situation with our staffing with some pockets of opportunity but we re in pretty good shape and i ll turn it over to sales i ll turn it over to chris chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes in terms of the regional performance and the relative performance versus the industry i think i don t think it s unique in the industry to have pockets certainly in the southeast where we re seeing outsized same store sales performance i think a lot of companies are also seeing a resurgence in california i think that the relative comparison though in terms of our outperformance for the industry i think that that s pretty across the board i don t think that there are tremendous amount of pockets where maybe we re underperforming relative to where the industry is so i think that s good news for us because it does suggest that our relative strength is pretty widespread brett levy mkm partners analyst and then just if you could talk a little bit about your customer you ve seen some you ve retained strong check what are you seeing in terms of the health of the customer in either states that kept the enhanced unemployment benefits longer or rolled them off earlier are you seeing anything within the consumer cohort that gives you any economic variances out there david deno chief executive officer no we haven t seen any economic variances across the states chris just covered what he s seeing around the country we haven t seen any major economic variances what we re seeing is with the outback menu changes that we made and some of the pricing tweaks that we made and some of the other things that we did people are trading up we re getting a greater share of alcohol with the attachment on the checks we re seeing greater appetizers we re seeing trade up in steaks so it s pretty healthy across the board brett levy mkm partners analyst thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of john ivankoe with jpmorgan please proceed with your question john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst yes hi commodities of up 1 and labor inflation of up 3 to 3 5 seems to be expressing a reality for you which is very different than what the rest of the industry is seeing and i want to go a couple of places with this first in an industry which is seeing according to government data labor inflation somewhere in the high single digits walk through all the different factors of why your costs aren t that high and i guess why they won t be so high going forward is just higher industry wage pressure basically puts pressure on everyone so that s the first point secondly commodities at up 1 i mean do you have some contracts that are so deeply favorable relative to current spot in 21 that you re beginning to be worried or just sensitive at least in terms of what the 22 versus 21 costs are and dave you kind of talked about a number of things that could potentially offset some higher costs to the extent that they come in regarding i think you said tech innovations that are in test that will be rolled out in coming quarters it sounds like you ve decided on the rollout if you could give us more specifics in terms of what that is when the rollout will be and potential operational benefits that you would see from that david deno chief executive officer sure there s quite a bit there john so if we miss something we ll come back to it and just remind us on the commodities front it s very early but i ve learned in my over 30 years in this business john it s very early to make a commodities call on 2022 all you can do is look at our history and what we ve done in the spot market with long term contracts etc has put us in a very favorable position and we think we can handle 2022 but to make a call in july on something that s going to happen in 2022 is premature and we ll just see how it develops but i think our supply chain team is going to do a great job of that and if you look back over time you ve seen us do that that s number one number two on the labor cost and i ll ask chris to add anything else when i finish here number two on the labor cost retention levels and lower turnover really really helps and we ve got people that are engaged in our restaurants we don t have to go out and recruit a whole bunch of people and stuff we ve got pockets of opportunity no doubt we participate in the restaurant industry but the retention and turnover levels are very strong and that helps us in so many ways and if i m missing something else there chris can jump in when i finish on the technology and equipment front i m not going to get into it for competitive reasons but we ve spent an enormous amount of time and effort and capital on equipment opportunities and technology opportunities i think our it and digital teams are doing a great job if you haven t downloaded the outback app i d encourage you to do it because there s more developments coming forward our online ordering system has been very very well received so you can see more technology come into our restaurants and you re going to see some equipment innovation in the back of the house but i want to stop there john if you don t mind because we ve got to compete in an environment so that s what we plan on doing there and i ll turn it over to chris for anything else on labor chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer no nothing really significant to add other than to say one of the things that we are benefiting from that some of our peers may not be able to is that we are seeing a relatively benign inflationary environment in brazil from a labor perspective so that kind of helps the overall number a little bit john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst very helpful guys thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jeff farmer with gordon haskett please proceed with your question jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst hi good morning and thanks a couple of follow ups so just following up on the off premise margins what have you done to improve those to almost it sounds like the in restaurant margin levels what are some of the drivers you guys have pursued to improve the margins of that off premise business david deno chief executive officer the menu offerings that we have the mix of the menu offerings the great relationships we have with our third party users they can provide driver utilization that we cannot so that helps margins as well so i d say it s menu innovation and partnerships with our third party providers are so helpful and the other thing is i think it s a completely underappreciated part of our business and that s carryout i mean it s a gigantic part of our business margins are very high the customers are in control they do some of the work they order up and so it s been and we ve been doing this for a long time and it s a very very important part of our business so that s a very attractive part of our business jeff jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst and then just a follow up on that specific question have you guys i think a lot of your casual dining peers are beginning to do this taking some menu pricing premiums on the delivery part of it has that happened for you guys and to what level david deno chief executive officer we ll mix the third party some on price we ll look into the levels but we will manage our third party delivery some but pricing hasn t been a big part of our success story but we do do some of that yes chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would say too if you look at our curbside and takeout business for example our new online ordering platform is really good and it s led to enhanced add on sales so check average may just be up naturally because of some of the technology enhancements some of the efficiencies that we ve built into that business david deno chief executive officer we try and use price as the last lever let me put it that way jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst and then just final question on brazil so i m just hoping you guys can help me frame out a little bit here with the consolidated restaurant level margin and operating income margin would look like if brazil sort of pick a performance level if we go back to 2019 and brazil was doing well ultimately said more hopefully clearly i m just trying to figure out what magnitude of either eps or ebitda drag you re seeing from brazil on 2021 and what the opportunity is in terms of recapturing that eps or ebitda as we get out into 2022 and 2023 could be so order of magnitude in terms of the brazil economic drag on the business right now chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer well if you go back in history the brazil business was historically 3 to 4 percentage points higher from a restaurant margin standpoint than our u s business there s really no reason to expect or anticipate that they wouldn t be able to continue to get back to those levels of margins that they had prior to the start of the pandemic on a go forward basis so again when you think about the puts and takes of our margins particularly as the balance of the year plays out some of these inflationary pressures that we ve talked about as that brazil business recovers you are going to start to see sort of an improvement in that international margin which can help offset some of the inflationary pressures that you may have in the business david deno chief executive officer yes jeff let s just also just step back and look at the market broadly we are the no 1 restaurant brand before pandemic came in one of the best brands in the country we had a leading market share by a lot we think that about 30 of the restaurants in the not us 30 of the restaurants down there have closed we don t wish any ill will on any restaurant company anywhere but the fact is about 30 of the restaurants have closed down there so we are in a unique position to take a significant amount of share additionally they ve got an economic footprint that works really well we re going to continue to expand down there with their cash flow not ours their cash flow down there that they re generating and lastly they have built an off premise business that didn t exist prior to the pandemic so all these factors coming together lead to a very very attractive business model that had higher margins in the u s and very good volumes jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst thank you operator thank you our next question is come from the line of brian mullan with deutsche bank please proceed with your question brian mullan de hey thank you with the ebitda growth your balance sheet deleveraging is happening pretty quickly you shared a target of three turns lease adjusted early next year chris would be curious updated thoughts on the potential for further deleverage and also dividends versus buybacks how you might incorporate the current valuation of the stock into that thought process and then related in addition is there a scenario where you might look to get acquisitive and you ve got a company doing north of 4 billion of sales and i m wondering if you might view that as a platform for additional brand growth over time chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we feel that long term target of three times leverage on a lease adjusted basis is a good target once we get to that target which is candidly coming faster than i think we would have anticipated it could be early next year we will reevaluate where we go from there we re not going to make any commitment at this time we could decide to keep paying down debt to your point or we could reintroduce a dividend or we could add a share repurchase program we could or we could do some combination of those a little early for us to make that call publicly but what i would say is honestly it s just exciting for our company to be in a position to be able to make those kind of decisions given where we were a year ago david deno chief executive officer yes and just building on that we want to have a fortress balance sheet we want a balance sheet that can withstand shocks chris and team are doing a great job getting us there and then it gives us opportunities going forward brian and when you look at the capability of the company you look at our operations capability you look at the financial muscle we have look at the digital capability and it capability that we re building i talked earlier today about the strength we have in supply chain i mean those are all opportunities for us to potentially look at other things but most importantly most importantly we ve got some fantastic brands in our portfolio we talked about the chance to grow the outback footprint beyond where it stands today through relocations and new you ll hear more of that from us we can expand that footprint by quite a bit and we have a new economic prototype that we think makes a lot of sense that can enable us to do that and then number two the fleming s business is and i hope the investors and analysts pay some attention to it it s crushing it in fine dining the numbers the sales the operations the profitability of that business has been truly remarkable and you look at the quarterly numbers are just great and we ve got opportunities in our strong markets like california and florida and a couple of other places to expand that footprint so we ll be doing that as well so yes there are opportunities maybe to look at other things but boy do we have some great brands that we can grow brian mullan de ok thanks and that s a good segue to the follow up just on the unit growth you spoke to outback and fleming s just as we think about that next phase i m wondering when you think bloomin can be a when you can be a consistent net unit grower in the u s even in something like that 1 to 2 range is that next year and then i m also is carrabba s a part of that calculus too just given all of the auv gains which have been great thanks david deno chief executive officer yes i really believe next year it s too early to lay out targets for 2022 and beyond but i think we ve got some opportunities for unit expansion a lot of opportunity for expansion and we quoted the relocation opportunities we ve had but also just flat out new units of outback and fleming s and then the other piece is carrabba s i mean they have just been a spectacular performer during the pandemic if you look at the off premises gains and everything else that they ve done that that team has done it s just been wonderful and it may be a little bit too early to talk about what we re doing from a standpoint of carrabba s but clearly that s gotten our attention given their performance and we re going to focus now and we have been focusing on building our pipeline our development teams doing that and building our pipeline for new unit development relocations and then lastly in brazil they ve always been a big net unit add they re funding with their own cash flow and we ve got the economic prototype down there that works really well too operator thank you our next questions come from the line of sharon zackfia with william blair please proceed with your question sharon zackfia william blair company analyst hi good morning a couple of questions i guess on the on premises business can you help us calibrate where traffic is now on premises relative to 2019 i m trying to figure out how much more you might be able to get into the restaurants at this point and then secondarily there s a lot going on in cost of sales that s been really great seeing a sub 30 for two quarters in a row it s pretty notable considering it used to be around 31 or 32 can you help us kind of dimensionalize the benefits of reduced discounting versus menu optimization versus waste reduction and help us understand kind of what part of that may be sustainable or what might have some kind of give back as on premises returns david deno chief executive officer yes we re very pleased with the cost management as well product simplification has clearly helped the new outback menu has clearly helped us people have traded up and higher cuts of steak and also added on to the appetizers and things waste management in the restaurants because we re more simple in how we do things that s come way waste has come way down in the restaurants so all of these things are contributing to what we are seeing in the restaurants and we think that s sustainable obviously on the marketing front we ll see where the marketplace goes but we hope that we re not going to certainly lead the way in discounting and things like that we like where we stand as a company and what we re doing on the restaurant side we are seeing restaurant businesses still coming back and improving we still think there is a ways to go and there s an opportunity to go in in restaurant dining and we certainly hope to see that in the coming quarters chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so some specifics so the in restaurant comp sales result in q2 on a two year basis was down about 8 so when you factor in then check average appreciation of about 6 you re down in that 14 or so range in traffic on a blended basis a little bit lower than outback obviously getting supported by resurgent in restaurant business at fleming s so kind of in that mid down 15 or so range in q2 but that actually improved steadily as the quarter progressed david deno chief executive officer and we anticipate as people come back in the restaurants for that to continue to improve which we think could be a potential upside to our business chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s a tailwind david deno chief executive officer yes sharon zackfia william blair company analyst great and i just want to be clear too it sounds like you don t think you re seeing any impact at all from the increased media coverage of the delta variant can you just confirm how the trends were throughout july as you ve seen pretty consistent trends there david deno chief executive officer yes we laid out some very strong q4 or q3 to date results and it s pretty clear that we ve got great trends operator thank you our next questions come from the line of brian vaccaro with raymond james please proceed with your question brian vaccaro raymond james analyst hi thanks and good morning just a few questions on the margins if i could i guess starting with labor in the u s specifically i think you said staffing levels were down versus 19 do you expect to add hours or do you see this as a sustainable level where you can deliver your targeted guest experience and can you help frame or quantify the impact of over time or outsized training costs or other pandemic related costs kind of near term things that went in that item as well and then last one on labor is how do you expect second half labor costs to compare to what we just saw in the second quarter david deno chief executive officer yes i ll take the first piece about staffing and then maybe chris can provide some more details on some of the labor piece on the staffing front brian we ve made some really good equipment investments and some other things in our restaurants we don t anticipate getting back to staffing levels of 2019 and that s been a that s not a knee jerk reaction that s a long planned that s been planned for a long time for us so that is something that we re going to continue to do but we don t anticipate at all coming back to 2019 staff levels chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer and then just on the inflation side and back half front half so we ve been i think at the low end of our inflation guidance through the second quarter we re seeing higher inflation in the u s as i mentioned earlier offset by a relatively benign inflationary environment in brazil so it may tick up a little in q3 and then of course it will be higher in q4 as we have the florida minimum wage increase which starts in september i think we would say we back half we re trending to the higher end of the guidance range but overall we feel really good about where we stand from a labor perspective david deno chief executive officer yes and i think as you look at these kinds of things brian just i know you will just step back and look at our margin performance today in 2021 versus what it was in 2019 and prior years and you re seeing significant significant improvement brian vaccaro raymond james analyst yes yes and circling back on off premise i think you mentioned some changes in third party and i know you were doing some self delivery as well have you stopped doing self delivery in most of your units and now just mostly leveraging third party and then chris what was off premise sales mix sorry if i missed it in the quarter to date period and where is this current split between carryout and third party delivery these days david deno chief executive officer yes and what we will be is on the delivery business we will be continuing to do our own in store business we need to have that capability just to provide some flexibility and we ve got some restaurants that do really well in in store delivery with high volume so we re going to continue to do that but we obviously like the partnership we have with our third party providers and what they can do so we ll continue to have a mix brian chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes quarter to date we re at 25 of sales but most of that change from where we were in q2 is just a trade between the curbside business and the in restaurant as in restaurant recovers interestingly enough the third party business has stayed flat from a percentage of sales basis from q2 even into q3 again just reinforcing the stickiness the incrementality all of that business which is pretty exciting brian vaccaro raymond james analyst ok that s great and then back to the increase in your long term margin framework what does that assume in terms of where your marketing spend settles out chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer well yes so we ve talked about the need to reinvest in marketing dollars from a sales building perspective now obviously if sales stayed exactly where they were today without the need to spend additional marketing expense then our long term framework would probably look a little different but our anticipation is that over time we re going to rebuild that marketing lever we spent 1 3 of sales in marketing in the second quarter so our long term framework that we laid out we talked about in 2019 we spent 3 5 of sales longer term we think we can keep that below 3 but certainly it s going to be elevated from where it is today so somewhere in the 2 5 to 3 range is kind of what we re thinking david deno chief executive officer and brian one of the things that we did that we learned during the pandemic is this the digital marketing the return on investments a different way to go to market to identify customers more granularly all those kind of things we re going to use all of those learnings and i think we re going to get a bigger bank for our marketing buck with less cost and we ll see where we settle in but there has been significant capability digital marketing capability built within the company during the last 18 months brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right that s very helpful and then just lastly on the brazil business great to hear that that s improving where is the potential licensing of that business stand is that still a priority and have those conversations started up again yet and then in your long term framework does it give effect for any potential change in the ownership structure of brazil thank you david deno chief executive officer yes so we re going to enjoy the comeback in brazil it s a tremendous potential tailwind for us in 20 ramp out to 21 and into 22 and then we ll make some decisions after that but it s a great business it could be a significant tailwind for us in the next few quarters they ve come back quickly it was not contemplated in our long term framework that s contemplated to continue to own but that doesn t mean that we won t examine things but the business the team down there has done a fantastic job it s bouncing back very quickly and it could be a significant tailwind for us over the next few quarters brian vaccaro raymond james analyst great thanks very much operator thank you our next questions come from the line of alex slagle with jefferies please proceed with your question alex slagle jefferies analyst thank you good morning you mentioned the improved performance in the california franchise business wondering if you could give some perspective on the expected cadence of the franchise revenues as collection of royalty income comes back chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we re effectively right now collecting current royalties from our franchisees which is fantastic but as you know we have an amount to recoup from past due royalties we are now recouping those as well so i would say of the past due amounts it s probably next 12 to 18 months you ll see those come back into our p l so that does mean that relative to where we were historically you can see upsized revenues out of the franchise the other revenue line moving forward alex slagle jefferies analyst got it and second i just might have missed this but with the confidence to increase the long term margin target from 7 5 to 8 any reason that does not also translate into higher near term outlook on that 6 3 to 6 8 when the volumes get back to 19 levels or is there something different the timing of how that plays out chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer no nothing different it would all they would all a rising tide lifts all boats alex slagle jefferies analyst thanks a lot operator thank you our next question has come from the line of lauren silberman with credit suisse please proceed with your question lauren silberman credit suisse analyst thank you so just a follow up on the margins so you talked about 7 5 operating margins above 2019 sales now at 18 given you re trending above 2019 how are you thinking about the timing to achieve the 8 and then any line items that you can call out on where you re seeing the additional leverage or efficiency or is it across the p l chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s mostly a confidence in our sales story i think if you look at the framework that we laid out a couple of quarters ago all of the key tenets in terms of efficiencies and cost savings are still in place whether it s cogs we talked about upsizing cogs we talked about the labor efficiency we talked about the marketing efficiency we did reference the fact that from an operating expense standpoint we d expect that to be a little higher just because of the increase in off premises business so all that framework still exist this really does change in outlook going from the 7 5 long term to 8 long term is really about the increasing confidence and the stickiness of some of these sales levers particularly what we re seeing with the outback new menu and the sort of the off premises business and the thriving nature of that business so that s the framework that s changed i would say in terms of just short term long term we feel very good about where we think we re going to land in 2021 from a margin perspective obviously we re ahead of schedule in terms of our long term expectations but i think that the framework we re trying to lay out here is that over the long term if we can fundamentally change the business where we now have an 8 long term operating margin framework versus a 4 8 operating margin framework in 2019 the value that that creates for our shareholders is immense and so we are committed to that number and we re going to hopefully take advantage of that in terms of our long term shareholder value lauren silberman credit suisse analyst great and just on dine rewards can you talk about where you are with dine rewards members and how you re thinking about opportunities to leverage that program from here and then just from a brand perspective do you see greater utilization from customers at any of your brands more than others david deno chief executive officer yes dine rewards continues to grow for us we re over 12 million we think there is a tremendous opportunity to leverage that program especially with all of our digital marketing capability i m not going to get into it but watch that space and i m sorry what s the second part of the question again lauren silberman credit suisse analyst do you see any greater utilization of the loyalty program at any one of your brands more than others david deno chief executive officer well just because of its ubiquity it s outback but it s available to all of our customers and we see trade between customers and that s hopefully something that we ll be able to take more advantage of going forward but more news coming on the loyalty program in the coming quarters lauren silberman credit suisse analyst thank you guys operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jon tower with wells fargo please proceed with your question karen holthouse wells fargo securities analyst hi this is actually karen holthouse on for jon and just one quick clarification earlier in the call you had mentioned about a 1 million impact from the florida minimum wage kicking in was that specific to the fourth quarter or how we should think about it on an annual basis chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer it s 1 million a month impact so it s 12 million annually it will be 3 million in q4 1 million in september karen holthouse wells fargo securities analyst and then david deno chief executive officer and that s all baked into our guidance chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer and that was baked into the q3 guidance karen holthouse wells fargo securities analyst ok and then on the capex outlook if we get to 2022 and some of these supply chain issues are kind of worked through is there the potential for sort of catch up capex in 2022 for sort of getting what would have been in the plan for 2022 and then also wrapping up what you were hoping to do in 2021 david deno chief executive officer yes we ve always talked about potentially up to 200 million in capital spending that will ebb and flow depending on timing insights and everything else and as we build that balance sheet i talked about right we could uptick that but our development team is doing a great job building the pipeline and we can move very quickly and we ll just manage it appropriately we think we ve got a significant footprint expansion opportunity and market share opportunity karen holthouse wells fargo securities analyst great thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jared garber with goldman sachs please proceed with your question michael rothstein goldman sachs analyst hi this is michael on for jared a couple of quick ones first we ve noted a little bit of an uptick in the number of limited time offers that you guys have had for outback particularly any particular reason why you guys have started to kind of redeploy these i guess that was more back in march and maybe they ve continued to shift any certain lever you re looking to pull there thanks david deno chief executive officer no we ve had no significant change in our marketing plans like i mentioned earlier we hope to continue this marketing effort as it is and certainly don t want to lead any way in discounting so our sales trends are very strong and there s been no real change in limited time offers or any of that kind of stuff chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we talked about the 20 or so discount reduction relative to where we were in 19 and then i think if anything i think we ve talked about how we can offer more indulgence to the consumer because this is the time when the consumer is looking for that and you saw that show up in our average check increase in q2 because that wasn t driven by menu pricing david deno chief executive officer yes michael rothstein goldman sachs analyst great thanks a lot and then one other quick one any updates on tender shack or aussie grill or any of those initiatives just wondering if you guys have any saw anything particularly in the quarter maybe as reopenings ramped david deno chief executive officer yes no tender shack is not to the levels we want to be quite yet we ve got ways to go in that business and i think it is directly related to the rapid very rapid growth back in the restaurant business this past six months or so so we dedicated our efforts to that but we ve got more work to do on tender shack we re looking at marketing and product opportunities there but that s a business we ll continue to pursue secondly aussie grill we hope to open up three more this year the economics are good the sales are good and i think they re just follow the money if we re opening more that means we like what we see we re spending more capex the team has done a really good job there with that concept and we think it could be a really big opportunity for us as we go forward operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i d like to hand the call back over to management for any closing remarks david deno chief executive officer well we appreciate everybody spending time with us today and we look forward to updating you on the company in october take care everyone operator duration 64 minutes call participants mark graff senior vice

introduction i will turn the call over to bryan fairbanks bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thank you bill and good evening everyone thank you for joining us today to review trex company s second quarter results and year to date performance along with our business outlook this was another very strong quarter with record revenues of 312 million led by 43 sales growth at trex residential demand remains robust across all trex residential outdoor living product lines in both diy and pro channels the success of our 200 million capacity expansion program which became fully operational one month ahead of schedule has enabled us to take advantage of the appeal of trex branded products and increased conversion from the large wood market this expansion is the largest in the company s history and increases our production levels by 70 compared to 2019 year end levels however labor constraints impacted to the extent to which we could utilize this capacity to meet the higher demand our new virginia plant is highly efficient and designed for maximum output with an emphasis on quality control and energy efficient operations with the capacity expansion plan largely behind us we are pivoting our focus to cost reduction projects and continuous improvement opportunities to drive margin improvement these efforts will be focused on automation energy efficiency and raw material processing one such cost reduction project is poised to reduce the processing cost of our plastics by generating higher productivity and allowing for a wider use of low cost recycled material streams in addition thanks to the tireless efforts of our engineering team and their continuous improvement mindset we are pleased to announce that by the end of the year we will install incremental decking capacity within the new virginia facility that will further increase our production capability and improve our cost position as a result of this initiative trex will have even more opportunity to pursue further growth as we ve been unable to fully realize due to capacity constraints we will be positioned to take advantage of the product development work being done by our r d team expand our international sales and penetrate the new home construction market while we continue to make significant strides with our additional capacity we remain pleased with the continued success of our tiered product strategy which supports consumer decision making by providing a range of product aesthetics features and price points that have broad based appeal and distinct competitive advantages over wood the winning mix of products makes it easy for the consumer to choose trex and we see strong growth across all price points like many other companies and industries during the second quarter trex experienced labor challenges and inflationary pressures from higher raw materials and logistics costs as a result of the inflationary pressures trex took a mid single digit price increase on most products effective august 1 with the full impact to be seen later in the third quarter we deliberately chose the timing of our price increase to give ample notice to our channel partners in order to minimize the impact during the peak decking season this action is example of the importance we place on our partnerships with distributors dealers and contractors and doing right by them dennis will provide more detail around our financial results and inflationary impacts but i want to highlight that despite inflationary headwinds ebitda grew by 36 during the second quarter and produced a 29 increase in diluted earnings per share while we focus on profitable company growth expansion and continuous improvement we continue to do so in a sustainable manner sustainability has always been a part of trex s dna since exception trex is and has always been one of north america s largest recyclers of plastic film in 2020 we upcycled more than 900 million pounds of plastic film and reclaimed wood most of which would otherwise be destined for landfills at our plants scrap boards are recycled back into the manufacturing process as well additionally our ongoing efforts to improve energy and resource efficiency in our plants help reduce the company s energy use related to cooling by approximately 40 in 2020 and the addition of closed loop chilled water systems significantly reduced water usage for a more detailed description of our ongoing esg efforts i encourage you to review our third annual 2020 esg report on our website which includes our first disclosure of scope 1 and 2 annual carbon emissions and establishes a baseline for future efforts to reduce carbon emissions the report was issued at the end of june 21 and recaps a year of building a better tomorrow together for our customers employees communities investors and the environment dennis schemm will now share details on our second quarter financial performance dennis dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you bryan i m pleased to highlight the drivers of our strong second quarter results and year to date performance as well as our expectations for the third quarter and full year 2021 consolidated sales were 312 million in the second quarter compared to 221 million in the same quarter last year the 41 increase was driven by substantial volume growth across all trex residential product lines trex residential sales of 299 million outpaced sales of 209 million year over year by 43 resulting from sustained broad based demand and market share gains from wood trex commercial products contributed 13 million to consolidated sales in the second quarter of 2021 consolidated gross margin for the second quarter was 38 after absorbing an approximately 400 basis point impact related to start up costs and inflationary pressures on key raw materials and transportation versus 41 9 in the prior year quarter gross margin was also impacted by increased depreciation expense of 5 million related to the capacity expansion program at trex residential and labor constraints labor constraints resulted in lower sales and margins by under utilizing expanded capacity cost savings initiatives increased production and the impact of the january price increase partially offset the unfavorable impacts gross margins for trex residential and trex commercial were 38 7 and 21 6 respectively compared to 42 5 and 30 7 respectively in the year ago quarter sg a expenses were 36 million an increase of 24 compared to 29 million in the prior year quarter the primary drivers of the increase were personnel related expenses higher branding spending and a resumption of travel and entertainment expenses as covid related impacts eased as a percentage of net sales however sg a decreased by 170 basis points to 11 5 in the second quarter compared to 13 2 in the prior year quarter reflecting disciplined cost management and leverage in our operating model as we rapidly grew our sales despite the inflationary and start up costs we incurred during the quarter we delivered 30 growth in net income to 61 million or 0 53 per diluted share up from the 47 million or 0 41 per diluted share in last year s second quarter the steady focus on our strategic initiatives and our increased production capacity resulted in a 36 growth in ebitda to 92 million and an ebitda margin of 29 4 the continued strength of the repair and remodel sector trex brand leadership and increased capacity drove our impressive year to date performance consolidated net sales year to date increased 32 to 557 million compared to 421 million in the prior year period higher net sales were primarily driven by a 34 increase in trex residential sales to 532 million compared to 396 million in the same period last year net income was 110 million or 0 95 per share compared to 90 million or 0 77 per diluted share year to date in 2020 ebitda grew 29 to 163 million compared to 126 million and ebitda margin remained relatively stable at 29 2 compared to 30 for the same period in 2020 year to date capital expenditures were 95 million with the majority supporting the capacity expansion program completed in may in addition year to date we repurchased 49 million of trex outstanding common stock at an average price of 91 per share under the share buyback program trex has an approved buyback program for up to 8 3 million shares looking ahead we expect third quarter consolidated net sales to range from 320 million to 330 million representing year on year growth of 40 at the midpoint and reflecting continued strong consumer demand from our channel partners we expect continued inflationary pressures in the coming quarter as the tailwind from the august 1 2021 price increase will not take effect until sometime in september as we are fulfilling orders approximately 30 days later than expected because of labor constraints as we navigate these challenges we anticipate incremental ebitda margin will be at the low end of the range of 35 to 40 for the full year we expect to return to more normalized ebitda margins in the first quarter of 2022 as we are past the start up phase of our capacity expansion and as our price increase and strong cost reduction and continuous improvement initiatives take effect our tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 25 depreciation will range from 35 million to 40 million increasing throughout the remainder of the year full year spending on capex is expected to be in the range of 130 million to 150 million which includes the installation of additional decking production lines to further boost our capacity now i will turn the call back to bryan for his closing remarks bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thank you dennis our year to date performance places us firmly on track to achieve our stated expectation for strong double digit growth in 2021 and the success of our capital expansion program along with the additional capacity investments position trex for ongoing growth and enhanced value creation for our stakeholders most importantly i want to recognize the hard work and dedication of the entire trex team as well as the continued support of our dealers retailers distributors and contractors who continue to be great partners and key to our growth trex s extraordinary success is due at large part to all of you operator we can now take questions questions and answers operator thank you and we will now begin the question and answer session our first question today will come from jeff stevenson with loop capital please go ahead jeff stevenson loop capital analyst all right thanks for taking my question my first one is has raw material inflation peaked in the second quarter do you expect any incremental inflation in the back half of the year and then following up on that do you believe the august mid single digit increase will be enough offset these higher inflation pressures or do you think you ll need incremental pricing in the second half bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer well we ve not seen any of the raw material start to come down in the market as of yet we continue to receive new notifications of increases in price so i expect the third quarter to be a higher impact than the second quarter but of course we ve got the pricing coming in as we look forward it s too early to predict what inflation is going to do out in 2022 but in order of priority we will continue to focus on continuous improvement cost reduction and of course we will look at pricing as appropriate to make sure that we re offsetting any new cost that flow through to trex related to inflation jeff stevenson loop capital analyst okay that s helpful and then just on the new virginia capacity addition can you give any more color on how incremental this is the capital investment and potential impact on margin like the prior expansion any more color there would be helpful bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer sure if you compare it to what we provided last time it was 70 increasing capacity this will be approximately 15 additional capacity we haven t been as specific on the actual investment but it is included within the guidance for the capital spending we provided for 2021 jeff stevenson loop capital analyst got it thanks for your help and all the best bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer great thank you operator and our next question will come from keith hughes with truist please go ahead bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer good evening keith keith hughes truist analyst thank you how are you all a couple of questions one you had listed off the drivers of the 400 basis points down in gross margin can you kind of put magnitude on those what was the biggest hit second biggest hit things of that nature dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so if i were to rank order these right so i would first start with inflation clearly that is where most of the margin pressure is coming from then as you walk it down start up costs were clearly pretty significant in the quarter as well as we had april and may with start up cost as we completed the expansion program in late may from there i would look at depreciation expense as well as that had a significant impact to and then we also had labor shortages impact us as well because of the tight labor market we weren t able to run all of our lines as much as we would have liked and as a result we have absorption impact from that if we we want to go back into the inflation for a little bit more detail right i would look at it as raw material inflation and then from a transportation perspective we were hit with higher logistics costs so those would be the two drivers within inflation that were the biggest impact keith hughes truist analyst okay and as you look at the inflation moving into the third kind of calling it to peak in the third is that still a function of transportation costs still moving up and i m referring to translation within raw material getting to your facilities is that what s changing or is that the actual base material itself dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer no what we re actually seeing more is the base material starting to rise on some of the key raw materials and so the transportation market still remains high but it s really on the base level of the materials keith hughes truist analyst okay thank you bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thanks keith operator and our next question will come from ryan merkel with william blair please go ahead ryan merkel william blair analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer hey ryan ryan merkel william blair analyst so i guess first off you mentioned labor constraints hurt production what solutions are you working on and have you seen any improvement bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer yes sure so there has been there have been quite a few things that we have implemented at our manufacturing environments to improve our ability to run all of our lines we have changed the wage structure for a number of the positions that we have it hasn t been across the board but there have been certain areas where we have increased wages second thing as it relates to over time we have put some additional incentive programs in place to encourage more people to work the over time that we need with the additional lines and then the last is a much broader focus on recruiting so getting more people through the doors that we can help run our lines one example is that we ve moved heavily into this year is what we call our level up program for most of trex s history we ve hired people at the entry level and then we train them through all of our manufacturing processes as they move up through manufacturing we recognize there are highly skilled capable people available in our local economies and we ve gone ahead and started recruiting directly for those individuals of course paying about a higher wage rate than just coming into trex as a newer and unfamiliar employee along the way we continue to look for new ideas out there we hope that with the change in government benefits as we move through september the number of people that are coming back into the market increase further from what we ve already seen and of course we operate in states where we continue to pay the higher level of unemployment benefits for the full statutory period of time ryan merkel william blair analyst got it all right that s going to be important given the new capacity and then secondly just how should we think about gross margins in the second half at this point i know you re going to be at the lower end of the incremental margins but it sounds like what s the improvement just a little bit slower than expected and then in the fourth quarter presumably would be kind of the best quarter is that fair dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer i think that s a real fair way to look at it the way i m thinking about this is the gross margin pressures in my mind are more transitory in nature so if you think about these i ll take each one that i talked about earlier inflation we took our price increase with the 90 day advance notice and then on top of that because of labor constraints we re fulfilling july orders essentially in the september timeframe right so this is making it harder for us to get our price increase out there so that s one and more obviously our price increase will take effect more significantly in the september timeframe that will address the inflation the start up costs are behind us at this point so we won t be seeing that recur in q3 labor shortages eventually are going to get rided bryan talked a lot about some of the initiatives that we re working here internally which are seeing positive impact but over the longer term that s going to ride itself as well and then finally depreciation will lap that in q3 of next year so all of these issues are transitory in nature and then as you think about the back half we re going to start pivoting to these cost reduction and continuous improvement projects that will help to elevate our gross margins going forward we re predicting to see trex standard margins right the gross margins that you are all used to back in q1 of 2022 ryan merkel william blair analyst all right very helpful thanks bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thanks ryan operator and our next question will come from michael rehaut with jpmorgan please go ahead hello perhaps your line is muted michael michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst yes sorry about that hi good afternoon everyone bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer hi michael michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst first question just wanted to make sure i understood it right or how to think about it you kind of gave some puts and takes on the gross margins and in terms of maybe expecting a little bit of improvement from the second quarter where you have the 38 am i to kind of take away that you ll see a little bit more material inflation you will see less start up costs i don t know if they would offset each other but then the reason you re seeing you re expecting some improvement off the 38 is that if you have some costs alleviating some cost increasing but then on top of that you have the price increases coming through in september is that the right way to think about it dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i think you ve pretty much hit everything there with the price increase will come through in september that will be a month later than we had originally intended we ll continue to see some of the raw material cost climb throughout the third quarter i hope that third quarter ends up being the peak period and things level out from that perspective the start up costs are behind us in the third quarter so that s a one of the the favorability is that we see on a quarter over quarter basis michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst okay that s great thank you and then just a follow up i guess shifting to the topline you came in a little bit above i believe guidance for this quarter kind of hit our number at least the high end of your range hit our number for the third quarter as we think about the fourth quarter obviously you haven t given guidance yet but how should we think about obviously you have a lot more capacity now it s fully up and running but at the same time i think you talked about maybe eventually taking some of it offline at points which is to do improvements maybe some downtime obviously there is still a very strong demand backdrop and you can operate at a higher sales rate but should we be expecting some type of pullback decline at least sequentially 4q versus 3q just more from either a maintenance or retooling standpoint bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer i would expect a similar production number in the fourth quarter and it s really all dependent upon how much of the channel inventories and our own can get filled during the third quarter we do see some evidence of that at least in certain channels inventory is being filled at this point and then there s other channels where we have quite a few backlogs that still need to be addressed so as we move through the quarter we ll have better visibility on that i would expect that we ll continue running the capacity and build the inventory necessary to give our customers the confidence that we have everything that they need and then we d be in a position to start taking lines down for a little bit longer period if we get out into next year and we ve got the inventory throughout the channel we can do the maintenance that we wanted to do as well as improve some of the assets for improved cost positions michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst great thank you bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question will come from matthew bouley with barclays please go ahead matthew bouley barclays analyst hey good afternoon thanks for taking the questions so on the q3 revenue guide obviously the prior commentary i think was for q3 revenue growth to be i think stronger than that of q2 and correct me if i m wrong obviously q2 came in stronger than the prior guide and you ve been very clear that these labor shortages here are probably another piece but obviously what i m getting at is it kind of begs the question if there is anything in the demand picture that is perhaps any less robust than what you were thinking three months ago anything in diy or retail just help obviously you can clarify some of that commentary thank you bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer yes i think it s a great question our guidance is more based on the labor constraints that we see in the marketplace the base market the consumer demand through all of our channels continues to be very strong we ve got no concerns about changes that are there and i fully expect that i think with the volume we have we are moving through the peak part of the decking season that we will start to see some inventories build but we re not seeing a fall off in consumer demand from a growth perspective matthew bouley barclays analyst okay wonderful thank you for that color second one is you continue to highlight the builder market is not the first time you ve said something along those lines i m just curious as you re now again looking at additional capacity coming online where do you see those opportunities is it geographically production builders nationally versus custom builders how do you kind of dip your toe into that market thank you bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer i would say with the custom builders we already have pretty decent relationships because they tend to be the higher end homes that are already looking for composite decking so i d say this will be mostly focused on the production builders and showing the builders the case for them to earn a higher level of profitability and of course less call backs on a deck most wood decks when their built are going to have a warranty call back within that first 12 months so that small amount of additional costs that they re willing to put it and can then charge the customer for having a trex deck will offset their longer term risk for them we see it as a great opportunity with the new capacity that we have and somewhat of a market that hasn t been tapped to the potential available matthew bouley barclays analyst great well thank you for that color bryan good luck bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thanks matt operator and our next question will come from ketan mamtora with bmo capital please go ahead ketan mamtora bmo capital analyst good afternoon and thanks for taking my question maybe coming back to the discussion around inventory can you give us some sense of where you think channel inventories are at this point i know you ve been trying to rebuild that you think as you exit q3 you would have gotten to a point that you feel more comfortable with where they are bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer i think we will feel more comfortable the question is to what degree of comfort that we ll feel at that point inventories are not where we would like them to be in the channel or on our ground at this point so we have some work to do to get everything back to a normalized environment ketan mamtora bmo capital analyst understood and the other thing you also talked about in your release sort of expanding on the international side maybe talk a little bit about kind of where you see the most opportunity and how you see that kind of playing out over the next two four years bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer we ve seen significant growth in the international markets this year as we ve had the additional capacity available to serve so everything with that strategy continues as we have expected when we look out over the next four to five years and we can supply everything that s needed it s mostly going to be the larger markets with a higher gdp and an interest in outdoor living we have distribution relationships already built in most of these economies and we re still really just very much in the first inning of opportunity in those marketplaces so we re pretty excited about it as another opportunity for growth ketan mamtora bmo capital analyst thank you bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thanks ketan operator and our next question will come from tim wojs with baird please go ahead tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good afternoon bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer good evening how are you tim wojs baird analyst i m good thank you maybe just thinking about 2022 at this point any leading indicators whether it s employing or website traffic or decks com traffic that you could kind of site that gives you confidence into visibility around demand heading into next year bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer yes i wouldn t say that we have necessarily anything within our own systems that indicate 2022 demand but as we look at where the marketplace is consumer confidence continues to be at a high level there is still a lot of capital out in the marketplace even though we ve seen many of our consumers start moving to spending more money on travel really hasn t impacted the spending on repair and remodel so we expect a very robust repair and remodel moving into next year tim wojs baird analyst okay okay and then when you think about price just mathematically given the realizations will you actually have more price from the 21 increases next year than this year dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i would expect that we would given that we will have a delayed impact of our august 1 price increase more hitting that september timeframe so yes that s how i would see it tim wojs baird analyst okay okay great well good luck on the back half of the year guys thanks for everything dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thanks tim operator and our next question will come from stanley elliott with stifel please go ahead stanley elliott stifel analyst hey bryan dennis thank you guys for taking the question as it relates to pricing in the back half i mean you ve got the august price increase is this impacting your thoughts around early order programs in terms of what you want to do there to get product out in the marketplace at higher price points bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer we always look at our year end program in relation to the inventories that are in the market the capacity we have available to serve and the dynamics that are occurring as part of the general marketplace and with the consumer that s something that our sales team spends a lot of time working on generally during the third quarter and that s the effort still to be completed here so i think the answer is yes because it s always part of the impact and how we look at pricing and it might how it might flow into those programs is something that will be considered stanley elliott stifel analyst when we think about kind of margins returning 1q 2022 to kind of some of the more normal margins more incrementals is that really just the pricing kind of catching up i m curious how long it s going to take for some of these cost reduction programs continuous improvement programs to roll through is that going to be more of a benefit into the latter part of the year bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer i see by then we start moving through the noise of the capacity expansion that we ve been experiencing over the last year so we won t have the start up costs moving into beginning of next year we will see some of these cost improvement programs that we re going after come into play and then of course there will be the pricing that dennis talked about stanley elliott stifel analyst great guys thank you very much and best of luck operator and our next question will come from trey grooms with stephens inc please go ahead trey grooms stephens inc analyst hey bryan and dennis hope you re all doing well bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer great thanks trey trey grooms stephens inc analyst so just touching on the cost improvement initiatives you talked about just a minute ago and you kind of lined out or laid out excuse me focus on automation energy efficiency raw material processing is there any way to maybe help us understand what the impact here could be i know this is something you guys are continuously going after so will this be a step function and any comments you could give us on the timing there bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer the size of the trex company is very different from where we were five years ago i see this as a continuous improvement where we will get back to having a pipeline of projects that will drive cost savings to the organization and they will come in over the course of the year trey grooms stephens inc analyst okay the course of 22 primarily bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer we ll start to see them coming in in the back half of this year now that we re through capacity and that additional into next year and more of that cost saving benefits as we will have a full year of anything that comes in this year trey grooms stephens inc analyst perfect perfect thank you for that and then on the labor constraints i know we ve touched on several times on the call but and i know you guys are seeing some of it you mentioned that but as you look across is it is this more than just on your side or this also some labor constraints in the channel or at the installer level or just across the board as far as labor goes and are you hearing if it is outside of just you guys so i assume it is probably are you hearing any improvement out there outside of just trex only but further out into the channel bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer so labor constraints have impacted our suppliers our raw material we ve been able to work through that having appropriate level of safety stocks on the ground the same labor impacts have impacted our contractors where if they can put additional crews on they absolutely would to try to reduce their time to the marketplace but it s very difficult to find those individuals and then train them to appropriately build a deck as i get out and talk with the folks in our selling channel same issues there it s just very difficult to bring new people in and many cases they ve got longtime employees that really know the business very well there hasn t been turnover from that perspective but bringing new individuals in to manage the growth has been a challenge trey grooms stephens inc analyst yes all right understand i ll leave it there thanks guys and good luck bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thanks trey dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks trey operator and our next question will come from phil ng with jefferies please go ahead phil ng jefferies analyst hey guys i guess a question for dennis you mentioned first of all you guys saw a really good sg a leverage in the quarter so curious from a ebitda margin standpoint when do you expect ebitda margins to inflect positively was it tied to that 1q timeframe as well dennis dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer yes it will start to pick up here more in the latter half of the year for sure and then it will follow suit of course with the gross margin improvement so you ll continue to see this leverage story play out in a very significant way i think we have that near term and longer term in play right so near term we re going to see more of a normal spending pattern for sg a right so medical is coming back we have travel and entertainment coming back we re reinvesting in the brand all of which we pulled back in 2020 then longer term as we move into 2021 you re going to see that leverage story really start to play out because we don t have to advertise and brand as much or enhance and as enhance becomes a greater part of our product mix then that leverage really starts to take off phil ng jefferies analyst got it okay that s helpful and then a question for you bryan so in the comments you were talking about in terms of expanding into the new construction side and international with the capacity freeing up any wins that you could call out on the production builder side you don t have to give me the company but any noticable wins and then to kind of really drive growth here are you making any real investments whether it s on the sales force side or anything else that we should be mindful of bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer well from an investment perspective yes we re making investments in a number of different areas within the organization including sales and specifically on the new builder side as it relates to specific wins that are out there probably a bit too early to get into that discussion because we need to make sure that our channels are filled with products so discussions are being had at this point that s really at the early stage of it and as we begin to fill that channel and get back to more normalized operating parameters i think we ll be in a good shape to be able to talk about some of those contract wins phil ng jefferies analyst is it going to be noticable enough that we ll see it in on the volume side in a noticable fashion call it like back half of next year or is going to be really more of a 2023 event bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer difficult to say right now i m not sure that that initiative on its own i ll be in a position to call out here is what the specific growth from it we ll understand as it comes into the our sales opportunities along the way but we ll have to wait as we look at what next year s growth opportunities are and where we stand on inventories coming into the end of the year that will really be a key determinant phil ng jefferies analyst okay great thank you operator and our next question will come from reuben garner with the benchmark company please go ahead reuben garner the benchmark company analyst thanks good evening bryan and dennis bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer hey reuben reuben garner the benchmark company analyst most of my questions have been answered i just have a follow up on the sg a front dennis you mentioned expenses normalize in q2 i think historically it s been kind of a high watermark for sg a dollars are you guys still kind of ramping some of the marketing costs and travel and other things that were taken out temporarily last year and that 36 million roughly that you spent in q2 might not be the high watermark for the year as a result dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer so what we saw last year we had about what 29 million in sg a we ramped it to 6 million here in q2 so 7 million pick up i think it s a pretty high watermark for us yet i still think we re going to see a little more spend here in q3 just because there will be more travel there is we re predicting a little bit more medical and some branding as well so i would expect things to be normalized to rate around this level i don t think it s going to be much higher bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer i think as you look out at next year the percentages by quarter will probably normalize if you go back to pre pandemic timeframe we get back to having builder show we get back to normal advertise timing we get back to having distributor meetings normal travel and entertainment from our sales team so i expect next year to look like a much more normalized environment whereas this year we still have the impacts from the pandemic some things of which we re spending on other things we re not spending as much on but that will build as we go through the year and then normalize for next year reuben garner the benchmark company analyst perfect thank you guys and congrats on the results good luck bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer all right thank you operator our next question will come from alex rygiel with b riley fbr please go ahead alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst thank you bryan can you comment on the significant volatility in lumber prices broadly and how that sort of helped demand and how it might change demand as lumber prices pulled back here and then can you also comment on the higher end wood product sort of marketplace that you compete with and what pricing looks like and availability looks like there as a lot of that product is sourced internationally bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer okay so for the standard lumber business of course the future shot up earlier this year all of those while the futures have come back down again the actual prices in the marketplace have not returned back to those same level let s call it about 0 80 0 85 a linear foot for lumber so it definitely has been a help in this marketplace as people come in and understand that i could spend 1 60 on buying a piece of lumber i can spend 1 60 a foot and by trex or maybe 2 50 and move up to the enhanced product so it s been a bit of a tailwind for us as we look out over the longer term i don t expect lumber from a retail perspective to drop back down to that 0 85 again so there will be a tightened spread between our pricing and where lumber is and we ll continue to pursue the same marketing strategy that we have for the past few years converting those lumber buyers at roughly a 2 times price premium to move up to trex as it relates to the higher end part of the marketplace i m not as familiar with the pricing out there in visiting a few dealers earlier this month i think noted a couple of the species are very difficult to get because they are coming internationally in some cases they are coming from in endangered rainforests so it s more and more difficult to be able to get those types of materials and those consumers often now are looking to do the right thing environmentally and moving over to our trex transcend high product is a pretty easy sale for the dealer or the contractor to make and our product tends to be easier to work with than some of the hardwood the exotic hardwoods as well alex rygiel b riley fbr analyst very helpful thank you bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer yes thanks operator and our next question will come from kurt yinger with d a davidson please go ahead kurt yinger d a davidson analyst great thanks and good afternoon bryan and dennis bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer good afternoon dennis c schemm senior vice president and chief financial officer good afternoon kurt yinger d a davidson analyst i guess ignoring the labor constraints and the channel inventory for a minute it does seem like you re in a pretty good place relative to the rest of the industry in terms of having incremental capacity to respond to demand i m just curious if that plays into your messaging or sales strategy with your channel partners and whether you think that s something that can be a transitory or more lasting advantage in terms of market share bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer we expect that the capacity that we put on and we ll continue to add through the end of this year will give us an advantage and i expect over time we will need additional capacity last we talked i think we said this gives us a couple of years of capacity if the market continues growing at this level it will probably be a little bit shorter of time but these are regular discussions that the management team has with each other as well as our board of directors and we ll ensure that we stay ahead of the market kurt yinger d a davidson analyst got it okay that makes sense and then just going back to the inflation topic i guess on recycled films specifically in the past i think that was pretty correlated with virgin resin prices for the last couple of years it s coupled are we back to the point where those two are moving in the same direction again and any color you could provide in terms of expectations for pricing there bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer yes it s so the answer is yes and no there is more correlation than there has been over the past few years past few years the two markets were completely separate as we ve seen the virgin marketplace go over a 1 a pound we have seen some correlation creep back into the market we ve seen some of the recycled materials price increase has been in the mid teens type level on a year over year basis so when we talked about increasing costs in the third quarter i think that s something that we ll continue to see historically generally the recycled market tends to move six to nine months after the virgin marketplace and that s basically what we re seeing at this point kurt yinger d a davidson analyst got it and just one more quickly i mean is that something where as you consume more recycled material and perhaps has to move out further you would expect pricing generally to increase or do you think you can offset that by expanding some of these lower quality materials that otherwise wouldn t have a home bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer yes i think we ll be able to expand the uses of material and some of these lower priced opportunities that are not being taken advantage of today in the marketplace so we talked i guess it was the end of last year coming into this year that we were going to be going further for that material and with that comes additional logistics cost so we ll continue to see that as we move through this year and into next kurt yinger d a davidson analyst got it ok well appreciate all the color and good luck in the back half bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer thanks kurt operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to bryan fairbanks for any closing remarks bryan h fairbanks president and chief executive officer well thanks everybody for your questions and attendance in today s conference call we look forward to speaking

last wednesday halo had the honour of addressing the un making the case for greater focus on addressing insecure and unsafe arms across the globe halo is a leader in this field providing expert assistance to fragile and conflict affected states but success of these efforts will depend on increased international support and greater priority being given to illicit weapons by states affected by them the explosion of nearly 3 000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate in beirut in late 2020 devastated the city this incident sharpened focus on the importance of effective weapons and ammunition management halo programmes around the globe had national authorities knocking on their doors asking for help with their ageing stockpiles earlier this year the explosion of an ammunition depot in bata equatorial guinea killed dozens of people another tragic reminder of what happens wheen ammunition depots are ignored there is a clear lesson without proper weapons stockpile management across regions incidents like this will continue and there will be further destruction injury and loss of life equally concerning but less visible is the impact of poorly secured stocks of small arms and light weapons these can be easily diverted illicitly traded or otherwise make their way into the hands of insurgent groups and gangs this can destabilise entire regions halo calls on all states to scale up and invest in cooperation on weapons and ammunition management at the national sub regional regional and multilateral levels kristen stevens head of congressional affairs halo last week states met at the un in new york to discuss the programme of action on small arms and light weapons developed twenty years ago the programme of action is the main global agreement on preventing combating and eradicating the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons since the adoption of the poa the sector has developed a body of technical good practice on conventional arms control synergies have appeared across regional and sub regional bodies and progress has been made to address surplus ammunition but despite these positive developments and the generous contributions many nation states global efforts are not operating at the scale needed to protect civilians from unplanned explosions and armed violence halo provided three key recommendations to states at the un weapons and ammunition management must be approached at the national level as a defence and security priority and should be reflected in national strategies and defence budgets international cooperation and assistance is essential but effective weapons and ammunition management strategies must be placed within sustainable national budgets alongside any other critical capability effective and transparent stockpile management must be viewed as a key confidence building measure weapons and ammunition management supports anti corruption is a key step towards legitimacy as an effective and responsible security actor weapons and ammunition management and all other aspects of poa implementation must incorporate women in coordination planning and implementation including in leadership the weapons and ammunition security community must engage the full range of civil society to create national buy in if it is to support sustainable and equitable human security read halo s full statement here

ebitdax 1 195 1 capital expenditures d c 53 8 cash balance as of june 30 2021 190 3 average daily production mboe d 64 9 diluted weighted average total shares outstanding 2 242 2 magnolia reported second quarter 2021 net income attributable to class a common stock of 84 4 million or 0 48 per diluted share second quarter 2021 total net income was 116 2 million and adjusted net income was 135 0 million or 0 56 per diluted share the adjustments to net income primarily reflect the positive impact of one time cash and non cash items associated with the termination of the services agreement with enervest operating l l c adjusted ebitdax for the second quarter of 2021 was 195 1 million a 29 sequential quarterly increase driven by both higher overall production and stronger product prices total capital allocated to drilling and completions d c during the second quarter was 53 8 million or 28 of adjusted ebitdax net cash provided by operating activities was 187 9 million during the second quarter and the company generated free cash flow 1 of 134 0 million during the second quarter of 2021 magnolia generated operating income as a percent of total revenue of 52 total production in the second quarter of 2021 increased 4 sequentially to 64 9 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day mboe d oil production increased 11 sequentially to 31 9 thousand barrels per day mbbls d with both our karnes and giddings assets contributing to the increase total production in giddings increased by 55 compared to last year s second quarter magnolia spent 120 7 million reducing its diluted shares during the second quarter of 2021 as a result the fully diluted share count is expected to decline to 237 million shares in the third quarter of 2021 during the first half of 2021 magnolia has reduced its fully diluted share count by 17 6 million shares or 7 compared to the fourth quarter 2020 levels magnolia ended the second quarter with 10 5 million class a common shares remaining under the current share repurchase authorization magnolia had 190 3 million of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the second quarter and remains undrawn on its 450 0 million revolving credit facility the company has no debt maturities until 2026 and has no plans to increase its debt levels magnolia declared its first partial semi annual dividend of 0 08 per share payable on september 1 2021 1 adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share adjusted ebitdax and free cash flow are non gaap financial measures for reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures please see non gaap financial measures at the end of this press release 2 weighted average total shares outstanding include diluted weighted average shares of class a common stock outstanding during the period and shares of class b common stock which are anti dilutive in the calculation of weighted average number of common shares outstanding we continue to consistently execute on our business plan as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter operating and financial performance said chairman president and ceo steve chazen the business has fundamentally improved resulting from the strong productivity and efficiencies in our giddings asset the quality of our assets and a business unencumbered by large debt allows for moderate production growth with high operating margins while generating significant free cash flow at much lower product prices we now believe this can be achieved by spending within 55 percent of our adjusted ebitdax another of our important corporate objectives was to generate ebit equal to 50 percent or more of our realized price per boe our ability to attain this goal in the second quarter is a direct result of our team s focus on cost control safety and well productivity and i am especially pleased with this achievement our disciplined capital investment provided 4 percent sequential organic volume growth in the second quarter with most of our free cash flow allocated toward repurchasing our shares during the first half of 2021 we spent more than 200 million in reducing our share count by 17 6 million shares or about 7 percent of the total shares outstanding this approach toward allocating our capital and free cash has provided volume growth of 7 percent compared to fourth quarter 2020 levels while enhancing our per share metrics and leaving our cash position unchanged during that period we plan to continue to repurchase at least 1 percent of our shares each quarter i am pleased to declare our first partial semi annual dividend which conveys continued confidence in our business plan and the quality of our assets our differentiated dividend framework is aligned with the principles of our business model and this first interim dividend payment is secure and sustainable at oil prices below 40 a barrel we plan to declare the remaining annual dividend payment next february with the release of our full year 2021 financial results the second payment will be based on our longer term view of product prices or approximately 55 oil and the prior year s results we expect that these regular dividend payments should grow annually based on our ability to execute our business plan which includes moderate production growth and the reduction of our outstanding shares operational update second quarter total company production averaged 64 9 mboe d representing 4 percent sequential growth from first quarter levels and despite spending only 28 percent of our adjusted ebitdax on drilling and completing wells oil production averaged 31 9 mbbl d an 11 percent sequential increase giddings and other production grew 5 percent sequentially averaging 36 2 mboe d during the most recent quarter or a year over year increase of 55 percent production in the karnes area averaged 28 7 mboe d during the second quarter of 2021 a sequential increase of 4 percent and driven by the completion of several ducs we added a second drilling rig at the end of the second quarter which is currently drilling wells in the giddings field we plan to use this rig to drill wells in both the karnes and giddings areas including some appraisal wells in giddings the other rig will continue to drill multi well pads in our giddings area recent giddings wells have averaged approximately 6 million with continued efficiencies offsetting the modest inflation experienced in the field the results of recent wells drilled as part of our early stage giddings development continue to be representative of the strong outcome we previously disclosed as part of this program guidance concurrent with the addition of the second drilling rig we expect our capital spending for drilling and completing wells to be in the range of approximately 150 to 175 million for the back half of the year we expect that most of the impact to production generated from the second rig to be realized in the latter part of this year with the full benefit reflected in 2022 looking at the third quarter of 2021 total production is estimated to be around 67 mboe d representing a 3 percent increase from second quarter levels a portion of our capital and activity will be directed toward drilling and completing some gassier wells in both karnes and giddings and in order to benefit from the recent strength in natural gas prices oil price differentials are anticipated to be approximately a 3 per barrel discount to magellan east houston meh during the third quarter the fully diluted share count for the third quarter of 2021 is expected to be approximately 237 million shares which is 7 percent lower than fourth quarter 2020 levels the enervest operating and other agreements were terminated at the end of the second quarter resulting in several one time cash and non cash charges as a result of the conclusion of the operating services agreement the run rate for our cash g a costs is expected to be approximately 2 00 per boe beginning in the third quarter compared to 2 60 per boe 3 during full year 2020 in addition enervest had 1 6 million time vested contingent shares remaining from the time of magnolia s formation that were settled by the company for cash during the quarter thereby reducing the fully diluted share count quarterly report on form 10 q magnolia s financial statements and related footnotes will be available in its quarterly report on form

corporation non gaap financial measures reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitdax in this press release we refer to adjusted ebitdax a supplemental non gaap financial measure that is used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we define adjusted ebitdax as net income loss before interest expense income taxes depreciation depletion and amortization amortization of intangible assets exploration costs and accretion of asset retirement obligations adjusted to exclude the effect of certain items included in net income loss adjusted ebitdax is not a measure of net income in accordance with gaap our management believes that adjusted ebitdax is useful because it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure we also believe that securities analysts investors and other interested parties may use adjusted ebitdax in the evaluation of our company we exclude the items listed above from net income loss in arriving at adjusted ebitdax because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted ebitdax should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity certain items excluded from adjusted ebitdax are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance such as a

princeton we are approaching the 50th anniversary of the so called nixon shock one the most decisive ruptures in monetary history on august 15 1971 us president richard nixon announced in a televised address that he was closing the gold window by ending the dollar s convertibility into gold at an official rate of 35 per ounce nixon severed the millennia long link between money and precious metals this epochal event has uncanny resonances today for example just as nixon was struggling to extricate the united states from its long costly and unwinnable war in vietnam us president joe biden has now ended america s long costly and unwinnable intervention in afghanistan similarly nixon used his address to announce a policy programme with goals similar to those being pursued by the biden administration we must create more and better jobs he said we must stop the rise in the cost of living we must protect the dollar from the attacks of international money speculators like biden today nixon wanted to increase government spending to improve his party s electoral prospects in a deeply divided country after the bitterly divisive 2020 presidential election the democrats hold the senate by the smallest possible margin and now are worrying about a midterm blowback in 2022 reprising the 2010 shellacking that president barack obama suffered but of course there is a broader objective too biden is aiming for a fundamental social transformation creating jobs is a vital part of eliminating persistent inequalities and owing to the dollar s unique position as the world s main reserve currency the us can pursue both fiscal and monetary stimulus on a scale unprecedented in peacetime despite nixon s decision which inaugurated a new non system and created decades of turbulence in currency markets the dollar never lost its position atop the international monetary system while the fixed currency regime that had been launched at the 1944 bretton woods conference broke down private financial markets power to generate money us dollars made the greenback even more central financial institutions corporations and governments around the world still depended on dollar funding to some optimists in washington dc the persistence of america s centrality to global economic governance may seem inevitable even a resurgence of us inflation would mean at worst dollar depreciation and a moderate global rebalancing as occurred in the late 1970s during jimmy carter s presidency the us would still provide two goods that everyone needs the english language as a common medium of expression and the dollar as a common medium of exchange but for how much longer will this be true can america s unique advantages endure at a time when its relative share in the world economy has shrunk new economic powers are rising the international order has become fragile and domestic us politics is tending toward global disengagement in fact both of america s traditional advantages are already under threat enormous advances in automatic translation in recent years mean that people around the world can now rely on artificial intelligence rather than english new technologies also pose risks to the dollar the lingua franca of exchange some dangers are already visible in the treasury market where there have been liquidity strains in 2020 and a weakening of foreign demand the dollar s long preeminence is being challenged not so much by other currencies though both the euro and the renminbi may aspire to the throne as by new methods of speaking the same cross border monetary language as the dollar as the digital revolution accelerates the national era in money is drawing to a close one consequence of the new technological capabilities is a potential weakening of the historical link between monetary stability and fiscal management central banks have rolled out massive long term stimulus programmes in response to the economic fallout from the covid 19 pandemic raising the risk of inflation and pushing money flows into alternative asset classes at the same time the demand for a monetary revolution is growing that revolution will be driven by digital technologies that enable not only new forms of government issued fiat currencies like the renminbi and the euro but also private currencies generated in innovative ways such as through distributed ledgers this development is as important as the break with specie currency the world is quickly moving to money based on information rather than on the credibility of a particular government new money therefore may be ending the long period of dollar hegemony moreover the covid 19 crisis has hastened this development by ushering in a more digital version of globalisation featuring a greater exchange of data but less movement of people and goods the dollar originally gained preeminence in a context of strong global demand for a deep liquid and safe asset implying that the emergence of alternative safe assets could end the greenback s primacy in the past when precious metals were the basis for currency issuances alternative safe assets were dominant even in the late twentieth century some commentators looked back nostalgically to a time when they could think of a currency as having real collateral but now they can look ahead with digital currencies there is real collateral in the form of information generated by the participants in a wide variety of overlapping communities nixon s closing of the gold window marked the end of a commodity based monetary order and the beginning a new world of fiat currencies not until the 1990s did governments and central banks learn to manage that new world effectively now we are moving toward another new monetary order based on information which is itself a kind of commodity we may learn to manage the new system faster than we did in the aftermath of the nixon shock but the outcome a world in which the dollar has been knocked from its global pedestal could be far more shocking harold james is professor of history and international affairs at princeton university a specialist on german economic history and on

share prices in china s for profit education market plunged last week after officials in beijing announced broad restrictions to its booming private tutoring sector sending shockwaves through an industry that had been riding a wave of demand for digital learning services during the pandemic according to the new regulations companies and institutions that teach school curriculums can no longer be for profit accept foreign investments or offer tutoring services for core subjects outside of school hours and foreign entities can t hold shares in such institutions officials in beijing have indicated the sweeping regulations are meant to relieve pressure on students and help reverse the nation s declining birthrate by reducing the financial burden of tutoring costs on parents and by extension the costs of having children the news threatens china s 120 billion for profit education industry prompting selloffs in koolearn technology holding ltd and new oriental education technology group as well as u s listed stocks such as gaotu techedu and tal education group according to the china s education industry sub index dropped as much as 14 percent last week with stocks falling between 30 and 40 percent according toin a statement last week tal said it would comply with the government s opinions on further alleviating the burden of homework and after school tutoring for students in compulsory education or opinion outlining the restrictions last month the company expects the opinion related rules and regulations and the compliance measures to be taken by the company will have material adverse impact on its after school tutoring services related to academic subjects in china s compulsory education system which in turn may adversely affect the company s results of operations and prospect the statement read though the announcement sent chinese share prices into a tailspin beijing s new edict could have little effect on business related to ed tech in the u s according to john bailey a visiting fellow at the american enterprise institute policy think tank bailey toldthat the american based ed tech industry and investors in for profit educational businesses have put most of their focus on competing with one another leaving little room for chinese and american markets to intermingle during the covid 19 digital surge bailey said american ed tech giants like instructure creator of the canvas learning management system used by millions of u s k 12 students have seen consistent growth and continue to profit from billions in federal relief funds awarded to schools for digital upgrades such as virtual learning products in this context bailey believes beijing s regulations will have a minimal effect on american online learning investments and company profits they re two different markets so in some ways it won t really impact what s going on here in the united states right now bailey said you don t have too many purely international companies he continued most of the u s companies i know of are focused purely on capturing and conserving as many kids as they can in the u s market according to steven gedeon associate professor of entrepreneurship at ryerson university s ted rogers school of management venture capitalists tend to view china as a wealth of investment opportunities partly due to its population size and emerging markets while u s based ed tech investors had once viewed china as a place to look for growth he said those hopes have now been dashed it is certainly true that any u s companies or canadian companies that are offering online tutoring to the chinese marketplace that business opportunity is dead to them gedeon said gedeon said foreign investors might begin to think twice about future investments in china as ed tech companies look to other markets for expansion in the years to come with the stroke of a pen they can erase an entire industry he said anytime you re doing anything in china that s the risk you take you re looking for growth and this is the thing with the stock market it s not about profitability nearly as much as it is about growth rates he added china has again demonstrated itself to be a very dangerous risky place to invest in either as an investor or as a company trying to grow their revenues so you look to other locations bailey and gedeon both said regulations in china will likely shift global digital learning investors elsewhere they may look instead to india s growing ed tech market due to its regulations and size according to gedeon china s regulations could perhaps encourage foreign ed tech companies to expand in the u s instead of china where bailey said there s still demand funding and an easier regulatory environment for online tutoring and ed tech services you have companies in india and some companies in china that don t necessarily serve a lot of kids here in the u s maybe that changes maybe some of those companies now see the u s as the better market to pursue because of all these dollars because of the demand and because we have as of now a better regulatory environment than china bailey noted though such sweeping regulations in other industries could have more drastic implications for u s markets bailey said the education industry is an entirely different story it s mostly more of a china story than it is a u s story he said i don t think it s going to totally disrupt the u s markets

chicago inflation readings in the united states have shot up in recent months labour markets are extremely tight in one recent survey 46 per cent of small business owners said they could not find workers to fill open jobs and a net 39 per cent reported having increased their employees compensation yet at the time of this writing the yield on ten year treasury bonds is 1 24 per cent well below the ten year breakeven inflation rate of 2 4 per cent at the same time stock markets are flirting with all time highs something in all this does not add up perhaps the bond markets believe the us federal reserve fed when it suggests that current inflationary pressures are transitory and that the fed can hold policy interest rates down for an extended period if so growth bolstered by pent up savings and the additional government spending currently being negotiated in congress should be reasonable and inflation should remain around the fed s target the breakeven inflation rate also seems to be pointing to this scenario but that doesn t explain why the ten year treasury rate is so low suggesting negative real rates over the next decade what if it is right perhaps the spread of the covid 19 delta variant will prompt fresh lockdowns in developed countries and damage emerging markets even more perhaps more nasty variants will emerge and perhaps the negotiations in congress will break down with even the bipartisan infrastructure bill failing to pass in this scenario however it would be hard to justify the stock market buoyancy and breakeven inflation rate one common factor driving up both stock and bond prices thus lowering bond yields could be asset managers search for yield owing to the conditions created by extremely accommodative monetary policies this would explain why the prices of stocks including meme stocks bonds cryptocurrencies and housing are all a little frothy at the same time to those who care about sound asset prices fed chair jerome powell s announcement last week that the economy had made progress toward the point where the fed might end its 120 billion monthly bond buying programme was good news phasing out quantitative easing qe is the first step toward monetary policy normalisation which itself is necessary to alleviate the pressure on asset managers to produce impossible returns in a low yield environment the beginning of the end of qe would not please everyone though some economists see a significant downside to withdrawing monetary accommodation before it is clear that inflation has taken off gone is the old received wisdom that if you are staring inflation in the eyeballs it is already too late to beat it down without a costly fight two decades of persistently low inflation have convinced many central bankers that they can wait and yet even if monetary policymakers are not overly concerned about high asset prices or inflation they should be worried about another risk that prolonged qe intensifies the government s fiscal exposure to future interest rate hikes while government debt has soared government interest payments remain low and have even shrunk as a share of gdp in some countries over the last two decades as such many economists are not worried that government debt in advanced economies is approaching its post world war ii high but what if interest rates start moving up as inflation takes hold if government debt is around 125 per cent of gdp every percentage point increase in interest rates translates into a 1 25 percentage point increase in the annual fiscal deficit as a share of gdp that is nothing to shrug at with interest rates normally rising by a few percentage points over the course of a business cycle government debt can quickly become stressful to this thoughtful economists might respond wait a minute not all the debt has to be rolled over quickly just look at the united kingdom where the average term to maturity is about 15 years true if debt maturities were evenly spread out only around one fifteenth of the uk debt would have to be refinanced each year giving the authorities plenty of time to react to rising interest rates but that is no reason for complacency the average maturity for government debt is much lower in other countries not least the us where it is only 5 8 years moreover what matters is not the average debt maturity which can be skewed by a few long dated bonds but rather the amount of debt that will mature quickly and must be rolled over at a higher rate median debt maturity the length of time by which half the existing debt will mature is therefore a better measure of exposure to interest rate rollover risk more to the point one also must account for a major source of effective maturity shortening qe when the central bank hoovers up five year government debt from the market in its monthly bond buying program it finances those purchases by borrowing overnight reserves from commercial banks on which it pays interest also termed interest on excess reserves from the perspective of the consolidated balance sheet of the government and the central bank which remember is a wholly owned subsidiary of the government in many countries the government has essentially swapped five year debt for overnight debt qe thus drives a continuous shortening of effective government debt maturity and a corresponding increase in consolidated government and central bank exposure to rising interest rates does this matter consider the 15 year average maturity of uk government debt the median maturity is shorter at 11 years and falls to just four years when one accounts for the qe driven shortening a one percentage point increase in interest rates would therefore boost the uk government s debt interest payments by about 0 8 per cent of gdp which the uk office for budget responsibility notes is about two thirds of the medium term fiscal tightening proposed over the same period and of course rates could increase much more than one percentage point as for the us not only is the outstanding government debt much shorter in maturity than that of the uk but the fed already owns one quarter of it clearly prolonging qe is not

are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 this video was recorded on july 20 2021 chris hill it s tuesday july 20th welcome to marketfoolery i m chris hill with me today the one and only asit sharma good to see you asit sharma chris good to see you thanks for having me on hill we got an interesting show today we got market news we have banking news we re going to start with the story of the day and that is jeff bezos going to space for a few minutes this morning he and the other folks on board the new shepherd took off shortly after 9 00 am eastern landed safely in the texas desert appropriate because this is the anniversary of the moon landing this is one of those stories that does not appear to have any immediate ripple effects for stock market investing it seems much like the entire venture of going to space it seems like there will be long term ripple effects but i have to say i m not really a space nerd yet i was completely captivated watching this event this morning sharma sure the immediate effects are one of wonder for so many of us i think as it was when richard branson went up just a few days ago literally it s something that we can never stop looking at and awe the idea of going into space it s inspiring we should say that but there are so many other stories rolled up into this there s the personal bucket list for jeff bezos he just crossed one off this morning there s also the question of what do you do with your own capital when you amassed more than you could spend in several lifetimes actually more than probably half the planet could spend in several lifetimes this is one answer to that question but more to the point i think what you re referring to chris this has some long term implications this is the second flight that we ve had that is proving the concept of space tourism jeff bezos and crew actually went a little higher than richard branson and his crew went they exceeded what s called the karman line i hope i pronounced that correctly this is 62 miles above the earth there are competing boundaries of what actually constitutes leaving earth and getting into space jeff bezos has bragging rights temporarily for crossing a slightly higher line than the one recognized by nasa but it s a story of capital allocation in the wider community of course we can t ignore the various types of technologies that get honed when you have a big picture goals like this that we won t see where these applications go but they ll be part of the tech story in the coming years so much that s underneath the surface much above the surface the surface of the atmosphere today hill look i understand that the logical place to go in terms of investing is the whole space tourism thing because that s probably the closest opportunity as opposed to oh we re going to be mining in space the idea of mining asteroids i think anyone who s seen the movie easy for me to say armageddon you can wrap your head around that but that just seems so far off as opposed to space tourism yet it does seem like the opportunities for investors anyway might be more in essentially who s going to be building these ships that are going to take people to space in the same way that you can invest in companies that make automotive components it seems like manufacturing might be an even better opportunity sharma it s a great point and i go back to proof of concept once you can prove that there is a viable market for something and i m not sure that we actually know that there is a viable market for space tourism there s some near term demand we ll have to see how this shakes out over the long term but it does tend to shift lots of money into technologies into products as you say into manufacturing that will end up anointing some winners maybe they re not so visible but fast forward 10 or 15 20 years it ll be commonplace i think chris to be able to invest in companies that just make booster rockets or just make various portions of the navigation system just as today you can invest in all phases of the electrical vehicle market you can choose to buy tesla or you can buy companies that just focus on making batteries so i think yes that is something that we re going to see more and more of in the coming years this is just the beginning of a wide and long term investing opportunity hill nasdaq inc comes out tomorrow morning with their second quarter earnings but they re making headlines today nasdaq inc is teaming up with goldman sachs morgan stanley citigroup and other banks to spin out its marketplace for shares of private companies nasdaq private market is going to become a separate stand alone company it s a trading platform for private companies and i m assuming the goal here is to drive more transactions sharma yeah this is a very interesting business nasdaq of course specializes in the trading of public companies but they ve had this private market division which essentially provides liquidity to companies that are in the pre ipo stage it s really hard to buy and sell blocks of shares within companies that have been growing rapidly but don t get half of the public market nasdaq has been an institutional facilitator if i can throw a lot of syllables together in this space allowing people to trade blocks of shares of course you ve got to be an accredited investor so not just anybody can participate in this private market but it s been a growing business for nasdaq and i think it s one that will flourish with some new money from these partners and also the ability for the management team of this division to allocate its own resources and grow the business they do have some competitors and of course there s a wave of companies that draw individual investors together and now crowdsource investments into private companies but i like this move from nasdaq i ve been a fan of their ceo adena friedman who took over a few years ago chris she s pushed this company from something beyond just a volume business that existed on trading fees and needed volumes of trading to be higher each quarter to win into a company that increasingly is focused on analytics providing data providing software as a service to big institutional companies in data security there are so many things when you look at nasdaq today so many pieces that really weren t as prominent as they were a few years ago i just see this as another savvy move by adena friedman to unlock some value for shareholders i think it s going to be an interesting company i really i think look forward to porting over its financials when that s made available i like the partners svb group that s short for silicon valley bank a player in financial technology and of course citi goldman sachs morgan stanley you ve got some big hitters coming in and participating in this company so it should be a fun one to watch hill well it also speaks to how investing has broadened over the years we ve seen the trend over the past two decades of fewer and fewer public companies in the markets if you go back 20 years there were somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 000 public companies that number is now i think below 8 000 despite the fact that we ve had certainly more ipos and more spacs over the past 15 months than i would have guessed at the beginning of the pandemic but i think this speaks to the opportunity and really the appetite that investors are having in an increasing way for private companies i think you and i were talking recently about the whole notion of the word unicorn because a unicorn used to be a company that in the private markets reached a valuation of 1 billion that s now really very commonplace this move to raise the profile of the nasdaq private market i think speaks to the appetite of people looking for smaller companies that are private and looking for the investing opportunities sharma yeah chris it s only going to increase that trend that you were just mentioning if you re a private company that has a culture management wants to preserve and you d love to stay private if you didn t have to go to the public markets asking for capital this solution is custom built for you you can stay private provide liquidity to key employees who may want to sell some shares or buy some more shares and not have to bear the burden of all the compliance that comes with being a public company or having to follow on secondary offerings of stock when you need to raise some capital you could just do it through this market they are actually furthering that trend i think giving some private companies the choice to stay private i just believe we re going to see fewer and fewer public companies as time goes on of course the ones that remain they ll get bigger and bigger through consolidation i also think that the ability to generate cash flows due to a lot of innovation and technology is going to make the market cap of favorite companies just grow over time it s not that the public markets will disappear but it brings a lot more choice for those who are running these companies and i do think it gives investors choice again before we leave this topic you still have to be an accredited investor and have a certain net worth in most cases and a certain type of income to participate in opportunities like this but i also believe that nasdaq s spinoff of this private market will encourage more of the smaller competitors who don t have the accredited investor requirement to bring small investors into the fold to make investments in private companies that s another evolving space to watch in this never ending game of public and private markets hill before we leave nasdaq incorporated shares up a couple of percent this morning hitting an all time high anything in particular you re going to be watching when they report earnings tomorrow among other things the chart of nasdaq incorporated is just an advertisement for long term investing it s just a slow and steady march up into the right sharma yeah over the last five years on a total return basis nasdaq has returned 193 to investors in a very quiet fashion i think that as long as they continue this strategy of gradually raising their trading volumes while selling to their corporate customers new solutions they re also an acquirer i think they ll continue to have the operations turn out cash flows that push that slow steady move to the right that you re talking about the upward curve on the stock chart what i ll be watching tomorrow is in a really weird quarter where the markets were going up but some growth stocks were having a lot of trouble just to see what those derivative trading volumes look like the nasdaq specializes in those i m also looking to see what the company s listings that is its new issues how that looked compared to the prior quarter i think it ll be healthy i always keep my eye on two segments in particular their investment intelligence segment and their market technology segment these are the two segments i was referring to loosely before the investments the company is making in non trading activities that have great recurring revenue they lock customers in the contracts providing them data and analytics that s a really great part of the business if you re an investor in nasdaq i think you want to be looking at that to make sure that those two segments are growing at a healthy clip because that s the characteristic of this company that allows you to sleep at night collect the dividends and watch the stock just gradually increase as chris was talking about hill shares of ally financial are up this morning second quarter profits came in higher than wall street was expecting anything in particular stands out for you in terms of this quarter sharma yes i never know how to pronounce it chris this is yet another one that we have to figure out the pronunciation too is it ally or allie hill i believe it s ally this is something that i was going to ask you later but i ll just ask you now i believe it s ally because their television commercials i think pronounce it that way i find it interesting that they really position themselves as a consumer finance bank and you know this business much better than i do is that just a part of their business they re trying to grow or is that the most important part of their business because they ve got the whole auto financing part of their business and that s the origin of this company i believe i m assuming the auto financing is still a meaningful part sharma the auto financing part is still huge they had auto originations or new loan originations of almost 13 billion this quarter from records applications that were provided with a decision on 3 5 million decided applications is the term i was reaching for that consumer auto business is really huge but i think you re onto something there chris and that management is watching where the growth is occurring and they re pouring more money into it they re advertising more on that retail bank side on the retail brokerage side and we shouldn t forget that ally also has a mortgage business they don t look a lot different than some community banks if you go to the homepage of your community bank you ll see all these services offered auto loans personal loans banking services mortgages except they do it at a pretty fast scale as i was just mentioning and i think that what is surprising for investors is that the smaller pieces of the company s business such as its insurance its retail brokerage its deposits business just the whole business of getting in customer deposits to grow the banking business almost have really been growing at a double digit pace this quarter through the headline on their earnings report is a 24 return on common equity this is a banking metric 24 is really high they had 900 million bucks in net income you re looking at a company which is taking a consumer facing very simple business model and just blowing it up in all meaningful ways and we should mention here chris this is another company that has very quietly rewarded shareholders i was also looking at the five year chart of ally this morning just a tablet better performance than nasdaq over the past five years 220 total return over the last five years for shareholders do you follow this one at all on shares i don t own shares and kicking myself that i don t hill i don t own shares a few years ago i was looking at the financial industry because it was one of the other things that i just have i wonder if i should have some shares of a bank and i know it s not going to be one of the big wall street banks that depends on institutional trading and that sort of thing i m not knocking those businesses i m just saying my area of expertise doesn t mesh well with that industry i did take a look at ally financial i don t remember why i didn t pull the trigger on it but it was definitely at a time when they were doing a huge push around being a consumer friendly bank you know what it might have been it might have been around the time that wells fargo was having one of their ethical challenges in terms of we re just going to create fake accounts for millions of customers sharma finding a good bank one that you believe in and you believe in management is harder than it looks a few things about ally which really stand out after a few years chris if you were looking for a type of bank to invest in and you re trying to figure out do i invest in really small banks or these big banks there were numerous choices in the middle that is banks that do a little bit of everything ally is one but synchrony financial is an interesting competitor they focus more on the consumer credit side of the equation they provide the nuts and bolts for big companies to have their loyalty credit cards etc that business that synchrony has is just not as diversified and they ve had their struggles when you see ally s earnings this morning you get a sense of how many weapons it has and it s arsenal i also want to talk about this earnings report do you know what i ve been hearing you and i have discussed on marketfoolery how much demand there is for used cars and new cars and why the prices of all cars are going up part of it is due to this computer chip shortage i think these earnings today also speak to that this was the headline the lead of the company s press release it s consumer auto originations loans that i mentioned at the very outset and that record number of applications this whole business is on fire whether you participate in the car selling business or the lending business at some time it s going to return to normal but just now we are still looking at such a big imbalance between supply and demand in both the new and the used car industry a continuing story this year hill definitely awesome to keep watching asit sharma always great talking to you thanks for being here sharma so much fun i really appreciate it chris hill as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear that s going to do it for this edition of marketfoolery this show is mixed by dan

report 2021 in the first half of 2021 senior delivered robust free cash flow generation despite the continued impact of the coronavirus covid 19 pandemic on our markets and customers compared to the first half of 2020 part of which was pre covid 19 sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share all declined in the period in our post close trading update on 9 july 2021 we reported that trading for the six months ended 30 june 2021 was ahead of management s expectations group sales were 13 lower on a constant currency basis than the equivalent period in the prior year part of which was pre covid 19 in aerospace for the six months ended 30 june 2021 sales were 21 lower than h1 2020 on a constant currency basis part of which was pre covid 19 and included senior aerospace connecticut for the full six months excluding senior aerospace connecticut which was divested on 22 april 2021 revenue on an organic basis declined by 19 reflecting the ongoing impact of reduced production rates by the civil aircraft and engine original equipment manufacturers oems and customers rebalancing of inventory throughout the supply chain on an organic basis sales from civil aerospace were down 34 partly offset by 15 growth in sales from defence and other markets on a constant currency basis in flexonics sales in h1 2021 were 6 higher than for the same period in 2020 on a constant currency basis the performance in the first half of the year benefited from the recovery in heavy duty truck and off highway markets partly offset by the ongoing weakness in the oil gas sector and the closure of the senior flexonics business in malaysia we measure group performance on an adjusted basis which excludes items that do not impact the underlying performance see note 4 references below therefore focus on these adjusted measures our restructuring programme is effective and delivering its expected benefits which has helped us to generate an adjusted operating profit

working capital management and controls over capital expenditure gross investment in capital expenditure was 7 9m representing 0 4x depreciation prior to the impact of ifrs 16 and the group generated 5 8m cash inflow from working capital as previously advised following several years of high capital investment to support growth we are now past the peak investment phase and are capitalised and prepared for recovery and growth furthermore the group generated net cash inflow of 60 9m in the six months to june 2021 as free cash inflow of 19 2m coupled with 47 0m net inflow from corporate undertakings was partly offset by 5 3m cash outflows for restructuring and other payments the financial position of the group is strong with 214 7m of headroom on our committed borrowing facilities an improvement of 57 6m from 31 december 2020 the level of net debt at the end of june 2021 was 71 0m excluding capitalised leases of 76 4m a decrease of 58 4m from december 2020 with the successful divestment of senior aerospace connecticut and our diligent cash management we have further strengthened the balance sheet as such the ratio of net debt to ebitda at 30 june 2021 was 2 0x 31 december 2020 2 8x considered and effective capital deployment is a strategic priority for the group and in line with our strategy to review the overall portfolio of our businesses and evaluate their strategic fit within the group on 22 april 2021 we completed the divestiture of our senior aerospace connecticut usa operating business the net proceeds for this divestiture were 49 7m as previously announced our small oil gas operating business in malaysia senior flexonics upeca has now closed and the closure of our senior aerospace bosman operating business in the netherlands is expected to complete in h2 2021 following the transfer of production to our french aerospace sites notwithstanding the clear signs of recovery in our end markets group performance is still impacted by the pandemic and as such the board believes it is not yet appropriate to pay an interim dividend in the current operating environment the board recognises the importance of the dividend for our shareholders and intends to reinstate dividend payments as soon as it is appropriate to do so market overview civil aerospace 36 1 of group 1 this number is excluding senior aerospace connecticut air traffic recovery in the first half of 2021 is evidently underway as travel restrictions continue to ease globally and the covid 19 vaccine rollout gathers pace while long haul international travel remains subdued short haul domestic travel in certain aviation markets for example the us has seen significantly improving trends according to flightaware north american departures have recovered to their highest levels since march 2020 european summer air traffic in the first half of july 2021 was up 75 on 2020 according to eurocontrol an organisation which monitors europe s current air traffic situation in may 2021 the international air transport association iata forecasted that world passenger flows will return to 2019 levels by the end of 2022 and will reach 105 of 2019 levels by 2023 as demand recovers production of new aircraft will be supported by the replacement cycle driven by the retirement of older less efficient aircraft beyond this the drivers supporting air traffic growth over the long term of c 4 per annum remain in place senior has a diversified product portfolio in the aerospace sector including attractive positions across the newest generation of single aisle aircraft platforms and as such is well positioned to benefit from the expected medium term market recovery production rates for single aisle aircraft were significantly cut in 2020 due to the pandemic and have remained at subdued levels in the first half of 2021 nevertheless both airbus and boeing have recently confirmed plans to ramp up single aisle production in the near term airbus confirmed in may 2021 an average a320 family production rate of 45 aircraft per month in q4 2021 up from their announced rate of 40 per month in 2020 they also called on suppliers to prepare for a firm rate of 64 by q2 2023 these production rates compare to the pre pandemic actual levels of 60 per month and an anticipated ramp up to rate 63 per month in 2021 in anticipation of a continued recovering market airbus has also asked suppliers to enable a scenario of rate 70 by q1 2024 and longer term airbus is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 by 2025 for the a320 family similarly boeing stated on 28 july 2021 that the 737 programme is now producing at a rate of approximately 16 per month and reaffirmed their expectation of an increase to 31 per month in early 2022 with further gradual increases to correspond with market demand boeing also stated that since the faa s approval to return the 737 max to operations in november 2020 more than 130 737 max aircraft have been delivered and airlines have returned more than 190 previously grounded airplanes to service while boeing confirmed in their recent earnings call that they have an order backlog of around 3 300 aircraft so we expect this programme to be very successful recovery in the international travel sector which typically uses wide body aircraft is expected to take longer than domestic routes airbus recently announced the a350 family currently at an average production rate of 5 per month is expected to increase to 6 by autumn 2022 this compared to pre pandemic levels of between 9 and 10 per month for the a330 family production remains at an average monthly production rate of 2 per month boeing wide body programmes are continuing at their low production rate boeing announced an average production rate of 5 per month on the 787 platform from a peak rate of 14 per month pre pandemic however boeing have stated that production will be lower than 5 per month temporarily while they complete the inspection and rework before gradually returning to that rate boeing now expects to deliver fewer than half of the 787s currently in inventory in 2021 production of the 767 will continue at a rate of 3 per month the 777 777x combined production rate reduced to 2 per month in h1 2021 with boeing continuing to expect first delivery in late 2023 business jet flight activity in the first half of 2021 has been

half of 2021 but has pushed out the entry of the e175 e2 jet further until 2024 airbus announced that the a220 family which is currently at around rate 5 aircraft per month is confirmed to rise to around 6 per month in early 2022 airbus is also envisaging a monthly production rate of 14 by the middle of the decade defence 19 1 of group 1 this number is excluding senior aerospace connecticut

optimisation the group continuously reviews its overall portfolio of operating businesses and evaluates them in terms of their strategic fit within the group senior has continued its prune to grow strategy of portfolio optimisation by divesting closing or combining non core or performance challenged assets in recent years this has included the disposals of sub scale composites businesses in wichita us and the uk the blois france and brazilian automotive businesses and our small precision machining business senior aerospace absolute in wa usa the closures of our oil and gas machining senior flexonics malaysia facility the south carolina assembly facility and the closure of bosman following the ongoing transfer of production from the netherlands to france combining businesses under strong leadership the aerospace fluid systems and structures divisions the jet and ketema southern california aerospace businesses amt and damar washington state aerospace businesses and the ermeto and calorstat french aerospace businesses and the strategic divestment of the senior aerospace connecticut helicopter structures business which successfully raised 49 7m environmental social and governance esg remains a very high priority for senior we have made good progress in our key metrics which will be reported at the full year results notably in the first half of 2021 in line with our sbti scope 3 commitment we are actively engaging with over 300 of our key suppliers with respect to their targets and commitment to reducing carbon as previously noted senior is the first company in the global aerospace defence sector to have its emissions reduction targets for scope 1 2 and 3 independently verified and approved by the science based targets initiative sbti these targets are consistent with reductions required to limit climate warming to 1 5 c in line with the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd recommendations we have commenced work on scenario analysis to assess potential implications of climate change on the company s strategy to support this process we have undertaken a cross functional materiality exercise relative to climate change and supported by expert external consultants we will finalise the scenario analysis in q3 this year we invited all employees to participate in our global employee opinion survey we had excellent participation and engagement and feedback was very positive valuable and constructive we will use this feedback to help implement specific continuous improvement plans across the business it is our intention to run this global survey annually the senior group code of conduct has been updated in july 2021 to coincide with the launch of our 2021 code of conduct training course as well as being available on line a personal hard copy has been issued to every employee restructuring our restructuring programme which was initiated in 2019 and further adapted through the course of 2020 is effective and delivering ahead of plan with some restructuring activities continuing into 2021 a net charge of 0 1m was incurred in the first half of year with a net cash outflow of 3 0m in the second half of the year we are expecting a further cash outflow of around 6m mainly related to the closure of our senior aerospace bosman operating business which is expected to complete in h2 2021 with our focus on delivering the expected benefits which are tracking ahead of plan we now expect to achieve cumulative annualised savings of around 50m for the full year 2021 2020 36m with savings of 25m already delivered in the first half of 2021 h1 2020 11m the decisive actions which have been taken to insulate the group through the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 including headcount reduction and business closures mean that we are now an even leaner and more efficient business outlook our current market assumptions for the full year 2021 are as follows production volumes for civil aerospace will be lower in 2021 than 2020 based on the production rates that the aircraft and engine oems have announced we also recognise that there are varying levels of inventory in different tiers of the supply chain however based on the most recent public updates from airbus and boeing single aisle production rates are expected to pick up towards the end of 2021 and into 2022 defence markets are anticipated to remain stable based on independent industry forecasts heavy duty truck and passenger vehicle markets are expected to continue to recover in 2021 in power energy markets recovery in the oil gas sector is likely to be at the end of 2021 start of 2022 our outlook for the group for 2021 remains unchanged from the statement we made in our 9 july 2021 post close trading update where we stated that despite the well publicised headwinds associated with freight and commodity costs semiconductor supply chain challenges for our land vehicle customers as well as the divestment of our senior aerospace connecticut business we expect overall group performance for 2021 to be slightly ahead of our previous expectations in relative terms h1 2021 is likely to be slightly stronger than h2 2021 due to reduced defence sales in h2 2021 which based on delivery profiles we expect to pick up again in 2022 looking further ahead our differentiated offering in fluid conveyance and thermal management products our investment in low carbon and advanced manufacturing technology our global footprint our strong track record and commitment to the highest esg standards and our positioning in attractive and diverse end markets means that the board is confident we will make good progress as the recovery continues over the medium term we remain committed to delivering a strong recovery across our divisions driving the group roce to a minimum of 13 5 in line with our previously stated ambition we expect 2022 to show progression towards that medium term goal senior intends to host a capital markets day in october 2021 the theme of which will be our fluid conveyance and thermal management strategy further details will be provided in due course david squires group chief executive

prior year part of which was pre covid 19 and included senior aerospace connecticut for the full six months excluding senior aerospace connecticut which was divested on 22 april 2021 revenue on an organic basis declined by 18 5 reflecting the ongoing impact of the cuts in programme production rates by the civil aircraft and engine original equipment manufacturers oems and customers rebalancing of inventory throughout the supply chain the civil aerospace sector was the most impacted with senior s sales decreasing by 34 4 compared to prior year this was reflective of aircraft production rates remaining lower in h1 2021 compared to pre pandemic levels excluding the divestment of senior aerospace connecticut total revenue from the defence sector increased by 11 1 during the period due to the ramp up of the joint strike fighter and higher demand for other defence products revenue derived from other markets such as space power energy medical and semi conductor equipment where the group manufactures products using very similar technology to that used for certain aerospace products increased by 6 2m largely due to increasing demand in the semi conductor equipment market and growth from the space satellite sector excluding the 1 6m reduction in operating profit from the divestment of senior aerospace connecticut organic adjusted operating profit decreased by 2 8m compared to prior year this reflected the drop through impact of the reduction in revenue mitigated by additional savings delivered from the restructuring programme on an organic basis excluding senior aerospace connecticut the divisional adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 2 0 h1 2020 2 7 in the second half of the year we expect production volumes for civil aerospace to be slightly higher than h1 2021 based on the production rates that the aircraft and engine oems have announced and taking into account varying levels of inventory in different tiers of the supply chain however we expect defence revenue to be lower in h2 compared to h1 due to the divestment of senior aerospace connecticut a timing gap between the completion of deliveries on parts for f 35 lot 14 and the commencement of deliveries on lot 15 and lower military aftermarket sales overall therefore it is likely that divisional revenue will be lower in h2 compared to h1 2021 the benefits from the restructuring programme in h2 are expected to be similar to h1 senior has a diversified product portfolio in the aerospace sector and the potential to add content on existing programmes as our customers recognise and appreciate senior s financial resilience stability and global footprint our businesses are well capitalised with equipment that can be utilised across civil defence and space sectors we have secured new multi year contracts and contract extensions on defence and civil platforms which coupled with increasing production rates will help to underpin our return to growth in our

commodity costs going into the second half of the year the impact of the well publicised headwinds associated with freight and commodity costs and the semiconductor supply chain challenges for our land vehicle customers will require continued intensive management by our operating businesses act research is forecasting a 46 increase in north american heavy duty truck production in 2021 and

projects where contracts have been secured working capital working capital decreased by 12 4m in the first half of the year to 93 6m 31 december 2020 106 0m reflecting our relentless and effective focus on working capital management we have been encouraged by the recent news from boeing and airbus regarding the increase in production rates on single aisle aircraft as a consequence we may see an increase in working capital associated with inventory required to support these higher production rates towards the end of the year additionally having benefitted last year from coronavirus relief measures in some countries allowing for the deferral of indirect taxes normally due in 2020 we anticipate a cash outflow of 3 4m in the second half of this year related to these net debt net debt which includes ifrs 16 lease liabilities decreased by 58 5m to 147 4m at 30 june 2021 31 december 2020 205 9m as noted in the cash flow above the group generated net cash inflow of 60 9m and

these committed facilities during the first half of 2021 the group refinanced its us revolving credit facility of 50 0m 36 2m and extended the maturity to june 2023 accordingly the weighted average maturity of the group s committed facilities is now 3 4 years net debt defined in note 12c was 147 4m including 76 4m of capitalised leases which do not form part of the definition of debt under the committed facilities and do not impact the group s lending covenants the group has two existing covenants existing covenants for committed borrowing facilities which are tested at june and december the group s net debt to ebitda defined in the notes to the financial headlines must not exceed 3 0x and interest cover the ratio of ebitda to interest defined in the notes to the financial headlines must be higher than 3 5x the group s lenders both banks and us private placement investors have been supportive and we agreed covenant relaxations new covenants in relation to the june 2020 december 2020 june 2021 and december 2021 testing periods and agreed an additional september 2021 testing period to provide financial flexibility for the group through this unprecedented period notwithstanding these covenant relaxations for the testing period ended 30 june 2021 the group s net debt to ebitda was 2 0x and interest cover was 5 4x both comfortably within the existing covenants limits the group s liquidity headroom was also comfortably within covenant limits going concern basis the directors have at the time of approving these condensed consolidated interim financial statements a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements having undertaken a rigorous assessment of the financial forecasts further details are provided in note 2 risks and uncertainties during the first half of 2021 the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the group have been reviewed covid 19 continues to impact our business and end markets although there are signs of recovery the following risk has been added to the group s principal risks as a result of the review key skills and talent as demand starts to return recruitment particularly of direct labour will be required mitigating actions have been developed to manage this risk including regular discussion with the operating businesses to implement actions where challenges are arising in addition one risk has been incorporated within two existing risks as follows boeing 737 max the boeing 737 max is now flying again the residual risk will now be considered in the programme and supplier management and customer demand and price down pressures risks the remainder of the principal risks remain unchanged from those set out in detail on pages 34 to 37 of the annual report accounts 2020 available at www seniorplc com the group s principal risks and uncertainties as at 30 june 2021 and for the remaining six months of the financial year are summarised as risks and uncertainties descriptions pandemic this risk materialised in 2020 having a significant impact on the group the measures taken in 2020 to manage these impacts remain in place as global vaccination programmes and other measures enable a return to normality the group will continue to prioritise the health and safety of our employees focus will also be on responding to demand increases in a controlled way to ensure that the cost saving measures introduced in 2020 are not undermined the group remains vigilant to the potential impacts of future waves of the pandemic programme and supplier management the ability to introduce new products in line with customer requirements and to respond appropriately to increases or decreases in demand thereafter is key to achieving the group s strategic objectives there is a risk that the group and or its supply chain is unable to respond quickly enough to changes in demand potentially resulting in excess inventory and or an inability to meet schedule quality and cost requirements resulting in delay cost over runs or asset write downs suppliers may be unable or unwilling to respond to increases or decreases in demand impacting on our ability to supply our customers and or our ability to optimise inventory holdings in extreme cases some suppliers may face financial difficulties and go out of business customer demand and price down pressures customer pricing pressure is an ongoing challenge within our industries driven by the expectations of airlines land vehicle operators and governments seeking to purchase more competitively priced products in the future this may put some pressure on the group s future operating margins strategy and portfolio management an inability to implement the group s strategy and or effectively manage the group s portfolio could have a significant impact on the group s ability to generate long term value for shareholders corporate governance risk corporate governance legislation such as the uk bribery act and the us foreign corrupt practices act regulations and guidance such as the uk corporate governance code and global health and safety regulations are increasingly complex and onerous a serious breach of these rules and regulations could have a significant impact on the group s reputation lead to a loss of confidence on the part of investors customers or other stakeholders and ultimately have a material adverse impact on the group s enterprise value in 2021 we have updated our code of conduct and are providing relevant training to all employees across the group financing and liquidity the group could have insufficient financial resources to fund its growth strategy or meet its financial obligations as they fall due or insufficient liquidity to meet financing covenants at the end of june 2021 the group is in a strong financial position with increased headroom on our committed borrowing facilities there is no long term debt maturing over the next 12 months economic and geopolitical impact there is a risk that there will be a global economic downturn impacting on some or all of the sectors within which the group operates trade relations for example imposing of tariffs in the us and other likely geo political events have created uncertainty over the future impact on international trade and the ability to retain and recruit foreign nationals there are early signs that inflation may be increasing in areas in which we operate there may also be changes to tax regimes around the world to enable recovery of some of the costs governments have incurred in dealing with the covid 19 pandemic there could be a resulting impact on margins cyber information security the risk that the group is subjected to external threats from hackers or viruses potentially causing critical or sensitive data to be lost corrupted made inaccessible or accessed by unauthorised users resulting in financial and or reputational loss innovation and technological change in order to continue to win new business and achieve profitable growth the group must innovate there is a risk that the group does not continue to innovate and implement technological change resulting in its technology becoming

information these condensed consolidated interim financial statements of senior plc the group which were approved by the board of directors on 30 july 2021 have been reviewed by kpmg llp the group s auditor whose report is set out after the directors responsibility statement the comparative figures for the year ended 31 december 2020 do not constitute the group s statutory accounts for 2020 as defined in section 434 3 of the companies act 2006 statutory accounts for 2020 have been delivered to the registrar of companies the auditor s report on those accounts was unqualified did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain statements under sections 498 2 or 3 of the companies act 2006 2 accounting policies basis of preparation these condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure and transparency rules of the financial conduct authority and with ias 34 interim financial reporting as adopted for use by the uk the annual financial statements of the group for the year ended 31 december 2021 will be prepared in accordance with uk adopted international accounting standards as required by the disclosure guidance and transparency rules of the financial conduct authority these condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the published annual financial statements of the group as at and for the year ended 31 december 2020 which were prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrss adopted pursuant to regulation ec no 1606 2002 as it applies in the european union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the companies act 2006 these condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the group as at and for the year ended 31 december 2020 going concern the directors have at the time of approving these condensed consolidated interim financial statements a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future being a period of at least 12 months from this reporting date the going concern period accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements having undertaken a rigorous assessment of the financial forecasts the board has considered projections including severe but plausible downsides covering a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report based on the experiences over recent years including the resilient performance in the first half of 2021 as outlined in the interim management report review while the global pandemic is not over there are clear signs of recovery in the group s end markets this coupled with the continuing impact of the pandemic and the resulting economic uncertainty both in the short and medium term has been factored into the forecasts considered these projections are borne out of extensive scenario testing based on a variety of end market assumptions while taking account of appropriate mitigating actions within the direct control of the group at 30 june 2021 the group held committed borrowing facilities of 285 7m and the group had headroom of 214 7m the group has two existing covenants existing covenants for committed borrowing facilities which are tested at june and december the group s net debt to ebitda defined in the notes to the financial headlines must not exceed 3 0x and interest cover the ratio of ebitda to interest defined in the notes to the financial headlines must be higher than 3 5x the group s lenders both banks and us private placement investors agreed covenant relaxations new covenants in relation to the june 2020 december 2020 june 2021 and december 2021 testing periods and agreed an additional september 2021 testing period for the testing period ended 30 june 2021 the group s net debt to ebitda was 2 0x and interest cover was 5 4x both comfortably within the existing covenants limits the group s liquidity headroom was also comfortably within covenant limits for all testing periods within the going concern period there is sufficient headroom to remain within the relevant covenant limits and the group s committed borrowing facilities even in a severe but plausible downside scenario based on the above assessment the board has concluded that the group will continue to have adequate financial resources to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities as they fall due over the going concern period accordingly the directors have formed the judgement that it is appropriate to prepare these condensed consolidated interim financial statements on the going concern basis new policies and standards the accounting policies presentation and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the group s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2020 which were prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrss adopted pursuant to regulation ec no 1606 2002 as it applies in the european union at the date of authorisation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements several new standards and amendments to existing standards have been issued some of which are effective none of these standards and amendments have a material impact on the group the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities income and expense the resulting accounting estimates will by definition seldom equal the related actual results the group s latest annual financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2020 which are available via senior s website www seniorplc com set out the key sources of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements that were made in preparing those financial statements in light of covid 19 the directors continue to consider additional areas of judgment and estimation around going concern see above 3

people are not taking up the vaccines and therefore what that has done is left a lot of people susceptible dr edwin michael said tampa fla scientists and data modelers tracking covid 19 cases in the tampa bay area predict between 4 300 and 6 000 cases per day by the end of august beginning of september if face masks and social distancing measures are not implemented to control the surge that ll stop the spread in its tracks said dr edwin michael an epidemiologist at the university of south florida who studies global infectious diseases dr michael cited three reasons for the drastic spike in cases that is only forecasted to grow over the next month he said a drop in vaccinations a decline in social measures like masks and social distancing along with the delta variant are causing cases to soar now vaccination rates have dropped about 85 percent from april to what it is currently said dr michael who noted the county is only vaccinating about 1 200 people per day so it has just collapsed people are not taking up the vaccines and therefore what that has done is left a lot of people susceptible according to dr michael while vaccinations do need to increase to achieve herd immunity increasing vaccinations now will not stop the coming wave it s far too late now to ramp up vaccinations he said remember you need to have two doses right three weeks apart we are now already in august and we were saying that was the end of august we re going to get the wave so that so this is not going to be enough time for vaccines to work it s far too late over the weekend florida had a record breaking number of daily covid 19 cases with more than 21 000 reported cases from the state currently account for about 20 percent of all new cases across the country we stand ready and available to provide any assistance that is needed whether that is florida or any other part of the country said white house press secretary jen psaki monday during her daily press briefing she added there are ample resources available and also encouraged social distancing and masks psaki also emphasized the importance of the latter particularly in schools there are steps and precautions that can be taken including encouraging people to get vaccinated encouraging people to wear masks including allowing schools to mandate masks and allowing kids to wear masks which is not the current state of play in florida she said at a certain point leaders are going to have to choose whether they re going to follow public health guidelines or they re going to follow politics and we certainly encourage all governors to follow the public health guidelines governor ron desantis has been resistant to mask mandates especially in schools that s not happening in florida ok we need our children to breathe he said last month dr michael said children will be at risk this coming academic year as schools reopen and increasing vaccinations will help reduce the burden on health care providers and hospitals he also said data predicts hospitalizations will outpace bed capacity in the tampa bay area by about 800 causing delays to other pressing medical procedures

join us our long term test of the new michelin crossclimate2 continues the latest update comes at 3 600 miles on the trip odometer since we changed the tires from the oem ones the vehicle came with at around 34 000 miles this update was prompted by a tpms warning light and tone in our cx 5 as we headed back from a vacation about 80 miles from home see our first long term test story here see the second long term test update here see the fourth update here michelin crossclimate2 tire owner reports outstanding winter traction watch the michelin crossclimate2 tire tackle ice slick roads michelin crossclimate2 tire puncture the alarm caught us off guard since we hadn t driven the vehicle since the prior day we pulled over and our tire pressure gauge read about 25 psi in the driver s rear tire the other three all had about 36 psi we used a portable 12v pump to bring the pressure up a bit and continued on we used google to locate the nearest tire repair shop tire warehouse located in hillsboro new hampshire we phoned ahead and they said come on in which we did tire warehouse could not have been more helpful we were greeted immediately and within minutes a tech had our car jacked up in the parking lot taken the tire off and brought into the shop for analysis related story here s why your tire cannot be repaired it turned out that the tire had a pinhole leak in the tread area closest to the outer sidewall that area of a tire is not repairable for punctures the sr tech said that he felt confident we could make it home easily on the tire and the shop added a bit of extra air to the tire as a buffer our plan was to drive very carefully and if the tpms light returned pull over and make a new plan luckily the mazda cx 5 has a compact spare if need be we would have aaa help us place it on the vehicle one big thank you to tire warehouse which would not accept payment for the evaluation related story tire shortages loom large michelin crossclimate2 tire replacement in stock on the drive back we were lucky it was about 4 45 pm when we were headed home after the pit stop at tire warehouse we called ahead to our trusted local shop located north of boston advanced automotive we love advanced automotive because the owner manager lead mechanic jim lucas wears a headset when he works so that he never misses an incoming call we spoke to jim who was kind enough to put us on hold and call his suppliers to see if the correct size michelin crossclimate2 could be sourced for immediate delivery to his shop we were pleased to hear that two of his suppliers had the tire and that it would be available the next morning by 10 am with the shortage of consumer goods and in particular tires we were thrilled advanced automotive replaced the tire and we were charged 280 including mounting balancing and sales tax jim told us the old tire would head to a quaint country farm to be turned into a tire swing for a child we like to think that s true related story here s why your awd vehicle needs 4 tires when one is damaged all wheel drive and tread depth one thing that owners of vehicles with all wheel drive need to be aware of is that the tire diameters need to be very closely matched to avoid damage to the powertrain of the vehicle having one tire larger due to greater tread depth can cause damage to the differentials in the vehicle again we were lucky the tread depth had barely changed in the 3 600 miles since they were new and mechanic jim used his tread depth tool to verify we were well within the specification michelin crossclimate2 mpg update after 3 600 miles the trip odometer reads an average of 26 7 mpg prior to the new tires being mounted the cx 5 with the oem tires had a 26 8 mpg average so there is no meaningful change in the fuel economy using these new tires compared to the oem tires we ve since driven the vehicle for a few days with no issues the balancing is still perfect and our satisfaction with the michelin crossclimate2 tires continues watch for our next update hopefully this fall as the weather turns colder testing note this story is not a paid promotion the original tires tested were provided at no cost by the manufacturer but mounting was paid for by the author the replacement was paid for by the author john goreham is a long time new england motor press association member and recovering engineer john s interest in evs goes back to 1990 when he designed the thermal control system for an ev battery as part of an academic team after earning his mechanical engineering degree john completed a marketing program at northeastern university and worked with automotive component manufacturers in the semiconductor industry and in biotech in addition to torque news john s work has appeared in print in dozens of american newspapers and he provides reviews to many vehicle shopping sites you can follow john on tiktok tokncars on twitter and view his credentials at linkedin
