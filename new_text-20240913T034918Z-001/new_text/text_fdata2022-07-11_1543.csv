since 2003 our group has worked to understand the structure function relationships of the heart and how disease pathologically compromises these relationships in this case we went back to address a never tested observation about the helical structure of the laminar architecture of the heart fortunately professor sallin published a theoretical prediction more than a half century ago and we were able to build a new manufacturing platform that enabled us to test his hypothesis and address this centuries old question huibin chang qihan liu john f zimmerman keel yong lee qianru jin michael m peters michael rosnach suji choi sean l kim herdeline ann m ardoña luke a macqueen christophe o chantre sarah e motta elizabeth m cordoves kevin kit parker recreating the heart s helical structure function relationship with focused rotary jet spinning science 2022 377 6602 180 doi 10 1126 science abl6395 heart disease the leading cause of death in the u s is so deadly in part because the heart unlike other organs cannot repair itself after injury that is why tissue engineering ultimately including the wholesale fabrication of an entire human heart for transplant is so important for the future of cardiac medicine to build a human heart from the ground up researchers need to replicate the unique structures that make up the heart this includesit s been long theorized that this twisting motion is critical for pumping blood at high volumes but proving that has been difficult in part because creating hearts with different geometries and alignments has been challenging this advancement was made possible using a new method of additive textile manufacturing which enabled the high throughput fabrication of helically aligned fibers with diameters ranging from several micrometers to hundreds of nanometers developed at seas by kit parker s disease biophysics group frjs fibers direct cell alignment allowing for the formation of controlled tissue engineered structures the research is published in science this work is a major step forward for organ biofabrication and brings us closer to our ultimate goal of building a human heart for transplant said parker the tarr family professor of bioengineering and applied physics at seas and senior author of the paper this work has its roots in a centuries old mystery in 1669 english physician richard lower a man who counted john locke among his colleagues and king charles ii among his patients first noted thein his seminal work tractatus de corde over the next three centuries physicians and scientists have built a more comprehensive understanding of the heart s structure but the purpose of those spiraling muscles has remained frustratingly hard to study in 1969 edward sallin former chair of the department of biomathematics at the university of alabama birmingham medical school argued that our goal was to build a model where we could test sallin s hypothesis and study the relative importance of the heart s helical structure said john zimmerman a postdoctoral fellow at seas and co first author of the paper to test sallin s theory the seas researchers used the frjs system to control the alignment of spun fibers on which they could grow cardiac cells the first step of frjs works like a cotton candy machine a liquid polymer solution is loaded into a reservoir and pushed out through a tiny opening by centrifugal force as the device spins as the solution leaves the reservoir the solvent evaporates and the polymers solidify to form fibers then a focused airstream controls the orientation of the fiber as they are deposited on a collector the team found that by angling and rotating the collector the fibers in the stream would align and twist around the collector as it spun mimicking the helical structure of heart muscles the alignment of the fibers can be tuned by changing the angle of the collector the human heart actually has multiple layers of helically aligned muscles with different angles of alignment said huibin chang a postdoctoral fellow at seas and co first author of the paper with frjs we can recreate those complex structures in a really precise way forming single and even four chambered ventricle structures unlike 3d printing which gets slower as features get smaller this is important when it comes to building a heart from scratch take collagen for instance an extracellular matrix protein in the heart which is also a single micron in diameter it would take more than 100 years to 3d print every bit of collagen in the human heart at this resolution frjs can do it in a single day after spinning the beating ventricles mimicked the same twisting or wringing motion present in human hearts the researchers compared the ventricle deformation speed of electrical signaling and ejection fraction between ventricles made from helical aligned fibers and those made from circumferentially aligned fibers they found on every front the helically aligned tissue outperformed the circumferentially aligned tissue parker said the team also demonstrated that the process can be scaled up to the size of an actual human heart and even larger to the size of a minke whale heart they didn t seed the larger models with cells as it would take billions of cardiomyocyte cells besides biofabrication the team also explores other applications for their frjs platform such as food packaging the harvard office of technology development has protected the intellectual property relating to this project and is exploring commercialization opportunities it was supported in

ctech intel and mobileye announced last december the former s plans to take the self driving car unit public in the united states in mid 2022 however after several months without any updates from either company mobileye s ipo now seems set to be postponed with sources at mobileye saying that the company is waiting for markets to stabilize in the hope that it will already happen this year in a letter sent to employees by mobileye founder and ceo amnon shashua he explained the issue is the market condition i do not need to tell you about the status of the stock market you all see it for yourselves the problem with the bad market condition is not valuation but stability regarding valuation we will do our ipo at the valuation which commensurate with the market valuation is not the reason to wait lack of stability or high volatility on the other hand could have a negative affect on the results of any ipo both on the date of the ipo and going forward i believe that achieving the target of a successful ipo and sustaining such success for the long term requires us to wait for the market to stabilize we still hope it will happen during 2022 this is all there is to it in the meantime our business is thriving we are growing on all fronts and the future was never brighter the postponement of the ipo means that mobileye will need to operate based on its own income in the meantime intel which acquired mobileye for 15 3 billion in 2017 announced in april that mobileye s revenue reached 394 million in the first quarter of 2022 up 4 year on year at the time of the announcement last december it was speculated that the israeli unit could be valued at more than 50 billion chip giant intel the largest employer of israel s high tech industry with over 14 000 workers was expected to retain mobileye s executive team and hold on to a majority ownership in the unit in march intel announced that mobileye has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec for its proposed initial public offering the number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering or any other details weren t announced with intel adding that the initial public offering is expected to occur after the sec completes its review process subject to market and other conditions however with the ongoing financial crisis hitting the markets hard especially tech companies it has become clear that taking mobileye public at this time would not be beneficial for either intel or mobileye in an interview with calcalist earlier this year intel ceo pat gelsinger detailed the company s plans for mobileye preparations for the ipo continue at a fast pace everything is done work on the paperwork the prospectus and submitting what is needed when everything is ready then we will make the ipo and it will of course be based to some extent on market conditions at that point in time we have consultants who say when is better and at what price but i tell the team that handles the mobileye issue we do not stop for one second the market may have fluctuated now but who knows what will happen in a few months the value on the day of mobileye s ipo does not worry me galsinger added i want it to be a good ipo but it will not be at the level of let s wait another week and maybe get another 5 we do the ipo because it s the right thing to do for mobileye they will have more visibility to customers more currency to attract talent to work for the company galsinger noted at the time that he is committed to completing mobileye s ipo by the end of 2022 and i see no reason why that should not happen
stocks slumped with traders positioning for a hot inflation reading and the start of a key earnings season that may provide clues on whether the economy is headed toward a recession the dollar climbed

pointed out that there s a strong correlation between the fed s rate trajectory and earnings growth they said it s been common for profits to rise as the fed tightens its policy and to contract when the central bank switches to easing in response to economic weakness that means corporate earnings should remain resilient to surging inflation and slowing growth paving the way for battered us stocks

bloomberg now that elon musk has decided that he doesn t want to buy twitter inc after all he can t just walk away from the 44 billion contract the billionaire co founder of tesla inc will need to make his case before a judge in delaware that twitter failed to uphold its side of a merger deal reached in april if history is a guide his job won t be easy twitter chairman bret taylor vowed friday that the social media platform will fight in the delaware court of chancery to compel musk to follow through on his agreement and the company has lawyered up in a race to sue a filing could come as soon as early this week people familiar with the matter told bloomberg if the judge rules against musk he could be forced to pay twitter shareholders 54 20 a share as he said he would in the accord announced april 25 a ruling in his favor would let musk walk though he d probably have to pay a break up fee initially set at 1 billion there s also the prospect that both sides reach a settlement whereby musk still makes the acquisition potentially at a lower price the judge in this case will zero in closely on the densely worded intricacies of the 73 page purchase agreement and the court has rarely sided with parties who like musk are attempting to bail on acquisition commitments musk s rationale centers on automated user accounts known as bots and how twitter accounts for them he alleges that the social media platform is teeming with spam bots disputing twitter s contention that they make up less than 5 of total users musk said in his friday filing with the us securities and exchange commission that twitter s failure to properly hand over specifics on the number of bots amounts to what s known as a company material adverse effect a judge must decide whether such an event has occurred and whether it justifies musk s cancellation larry hamermesh a university of pennsylvania law professor who specializes in delaware corporate law disputes describes an mae as an unexpected fundamental permanent negative development akin to blowing a hole in the transaction that can t be fixed so far delaware courts have found only one case in which a clear mae emerged fresenius se s 4 3 billion buyout bid in 2018 for rival drugmaker akorn inc a judge blessed fresenius decision to walk away from the deal after finding akorn executives hid an array of problems that cast doubt on the validity of data backing up approval for some drugs and profitability of its operations forcing musk s hand the agreement also gives twitter officials so called specific performance rights which means that if the judge finds musk s complaints about the bots data don t rise to the level of an mae the platform can demand that the judge force musk to consummate the buyout musk s decision to sign the deal without doing due diligence could work against him said robert profusek head of the mergers and acquisitions department at law firm jones day his lawyers argument that you don t do diligence and test things out later simply isn t the way things work in big ticket m a and if accepted would put shareholders at risk he said in an interview delaware chancery court judges are known for their expertise in interpreting what may look and sound to the layperson as a maze of legal jargon that seeks to delineate both sides rights and responsibilities in a merger and acquisition accord in the twitter deal the platform s executives are obligated to promptly furnish musk with all information concerning the business properties and personnel of the company and its subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested musk contends management hasn t met those duties in connection with the details of spam and bot accounts twitter said it has handed over extensive data on its user base executives told media thursday that the company manually reviews thousands of accounts each quarter to determine the 5 spam bot tally and estimates that the actual number is well below the threshold disclosed in filings the company uses internal data such as examining phone numbers or internet protocol addresses the unique set of characters associated with a computer or other device to help determine whether an account is run by a human the agreement also defines a company material adverse effect as any change event effect or circumstance which individually or in the aggregate has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business financial condition or results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries a probable outcome is that the parties reach an out of court settlement musk s effort to pull the plug on the deal is probably nothing more than a negotiating ploy said charles elson a retired university of delaware professor and former head of the school s weinberg center for corporate governance this is not a material adverse change elson said that s just a negotiating position he knows the delaware courts are extremely reluctant to find something like that in these deals to press its case twitter has hired merger law heavyweight wachtell lipton rosen katz according to people familiar with the matter the social media company aims to file suit early this week said the people who declined to be identified because the matter is private by hiring wachtell it gains access to lawyers including bill savitt and leo strine who served as chancellor of the delaware chancery court musk has brought in quinn emanuel urquhart sullivan llp the firm led his successful defense against a defamation claim in 2019 and is representing him as part of an ongoing shareholder lawsuit over his failed attempt to take tesla private in 2018 twitter morale sinks whatever the outcome of legal wrangling the mood among many employees of san francisco based twitter is dour people at or close to the company have told bloomberg amid the uncertainty surrounding a possible sale several employees have lamented what they consider a lack of leadership and vision setting from the top including chief executive officer parag agrawal said the people who requested anonymity discussing internal matters for many twitter staffers neither of the likely outcomes is palatable if twitter prevails in court the company will be run by an unpredictable and reluctant owner while still struggling to meet ambitious growth targets and should musk succeed in ending the deal twitter stock will likely plummet and a staff already dejected by musk s months long public criticism of the site will suffer another emotional blow several people have left or are planning to leave because they simply don t want to work for musk the people said for some the decision to depart was cemented after a june question and answer session during which musk who showed up late told employees that only those who were exceptional would be allowed to continue working from home 2022 bloomberg l p
twitter has retained a prominent new york law firm as it prepares to fight elon musk over his decision to abandon a 44 billion takeover of the social media company twitter executives hired wachtell lipton rosen katz llp which specializes in merger and acquisition law to handle an anticipated lawsuit against musk according to a person familiar with the discussions who was granted anonymity to discuss confidential matters the team plans to file suit in delaware court of chancery where many corporate battles are litigated as soon as this week the person said twitter s hiring of the high profile legal team was first reported by bloomberg within weeks of agreeing to buy twitter in april musk appeared to sour on the deal complaining that the company was failing to provide adequate details of the number of automated phony or spam accounts using the service advertisement twitter insists it has fully complied with the deal s disclosure requirements including by providing musk with a fire hose of data comprising millions of tweets sent in real time musk argues in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that the true size of twitter s user base is a material fact about the company since 90 percent of its revenue comes from advertisements if twitter were not being truthful his legal team believes it gives him a valid reason to get out of a deal he is contractually obligated to close on twitter executives believe they have a strong case that musk has violated the terms of the takeover deal which he signed in april agreeing to pay 54 20 for each share of the company s stock twitter shares closed friday below 37 share this article share but at a minimum the company is likely to face a lengthy courtroom battle with one of the world s richest and most mercurial individuals which could paralyze its ability to launch new initiatives and attract workers advertisement bret taylor the chairman of twitter s board responded to musk s decision to quit the deal by saying in a tweet that the company is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery under the terms of the takeover deal musk could be required to pay a breakup fee of 1 billion twitter s share price slide is part of a broader technology stock slump that has included tesla the electric carmaker that boasts musk as its largest shareholder tesla shares have lost roughly one third of their value since early april twitter s hiring of wachtell lipton comes just days after musk s attorneys said in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that twitter was in breach of the terms of the takeover deal for failing to fully disclose information on its reliance upon false and spam accounts often called bots in its membership claims advertisement musk is represented by the firm of skadden arps slate meagher flom llp on sunday twitter declined to comment wachtell lipton did not respond to emails requesting comment nor did musk who tweeted shortly after midnight they said i couldn t buy twitter then they wouldn t disclose bot info now they want to force me to buy twitter in court now they have to disclose bot info in court

but has not done so since completing the encirclement of the eastern town lysychansk on july 3 the isw said the washington based think tank said the lull in russian ground force movements supports its assessment that russian forces have largely initiated an operational pause the break in operations is not equal to a complete ceasefire however as russian troops still conducted a number of unsuccessful attacks on all frontlines the experts added russian troops are instead trying to set up conditions for a bigger offensive as they rebuild their combat power the isw report said russia has already increased its fleet in the black sea on the shores of ukraine local media reported on wednesday the russian naval presence grew by several missile carriers as well as submarines and an amphibious assault ship ukrainian officials refuted russian claims on wednesday according to which russian troops destroyed two himars multiple launch rocket systems supplied by the u s ukrainian

our partners started working very powerfully zelenskyy said in his wednesday evening address its accuracy is exactly as needed the president added zelenskyy said the western weapons have carried out strikes on depots and areas of logistical importance to russian troops and this significantly reduces the offensive potential of the russian army zelenskyy noted adding that russian losses will only

operation in ukraine will continue until russia achieves its goals of protecting civilians from genocide denazifying and demilitarizing ukraine according to the institute for the study of war isw the russian official added that ukraine must remain permanently neutral between russia and nato petrushev s remarks nearly mirrored the goals russian president vladimir putin announced at the onset of the war to justify the military invasion patrushev a close putin ally repeated the russian president s stated ambitions despite russia s military setbacks in ukraine and previous hints at a reduction in war aims following those defeats the isw pointed out patrushev s explicit restatement of putin s initial objectives strongly indicates that russia does not consider its recent territorial gains in the luhansk region to be sufficient the isw experts said russia has significant territorial aspirations beyond the donbas and is preparing for a protracted war with the intention of taking much larger portions of ukraine the observers added patrushev s comments dampened hopes for a compromise ceasefire or even peace based on limited additional russian territorial gains the experts concluded abc

elon musk may have changed his mind about paying 44 billion for twitter but it s not so easy to walk away the billionaire ceo of tesla and space x struck a deal to buy the social media company back in april but almost immediately he started hinting and then saying outright that he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington postreported the deal is in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team is expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported though its sources did not elaborate what that action might be bots may not be the only factor in musk s apparent change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal twitter shares are now trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced he s even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price but escalating his fight could be costly for musk and the battle would almost certainly wind up in a delaware courtroom that handles corporate disputes musk and his representatives did not respond to requests for comment twitter spokesman brian poliakoff declined to comment he pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it is has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company expects to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august so what are musk s and twitter s options musk signed a merger agreement the two sides have signed a legal agreement that musk will buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side breaks off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party by raising concerns over bots on twitter musk may be trying to lay the groundwork to get out of paying that fee but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter could take musk to court if musk went ahead and terminated the deal anyway twitter would likely sue him for a lot more than the 1 billion breakup fee the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has a strong incentive to see the sale through shareholders are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk might try to get twitter at a discount still some wall street analysts say twitter s board and management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a lengthy legal battle there s no chance it s getting done at 54 20 said angelo zino analyst at cfra research you re either going to see a 15 to 20 drop in the offer price to get elon musk engaged again or he continues to play the bot card taking musk to court could be even more damaging to twitter at a time when uncertainty over the deal and what the billionaire s ownership might mean are weighing heavily on the company morale is already low and some employees are leaving ceo parag agrawal has shaken up his executive ranks and announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts going to court doesn t bode well for the business prospects of your company and it further adds uncertainty to the employee base zino said that s also a risk for musk lipton said what if he has to buy the company and now he s kind of undermined it at the same time ultimately she said the billionaire s antics however chaotic appear to have a single goal i don t think he s committed to winning i think he s committing to not spending 44 billion on twitter copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

it s looking more and more like elon musk is trying to get out of buying twitter recently he announced his intention to buy the company coming up with some 44 billion to do so now business insider reports he s saying that transaction cannot go through that is until the company can provide proof that less than 5 of all of its users are fake musk recently tweeted quote my offer was based on twitter s sec filings being accurate that sec filing indicated the sub 5 fake user base must added 20 fake slash spam accounts while four times what twitter claims could be much higher it s unclear where he came up with 20 figure but reuters reports in study from 2017 an online monitoring firm estimated that number could be between nine and 15 must ask the company to provide random sample of 100 accounts to see whether the 5 number held up twitter responded by explaining why that wouldn t work and that their internal findings including multiple human reviews in replica of thousands of accounts provides more accurate number than 100 random users super genius musk responded with emoji it s worth noting since elon musk announced his twitter takeover the social media company has seen its stock prices plummet around 20 advertisement what s next for twitter now that elon musk wants out share copy link copy after announcing he wants out of his deal to buy twitter elon musk spent the weekend in idaho at the sun valley conference he spoke on stage essentially off the record but a source in the room told cnn s chief media correspondent brian stelter that musk tripled down on his decision to try to back out of the deal and claimed it s all about the bots musk originally said he was going to fix the bot problem stelter said on reliable sources on sunday the same problem that he now says is stopping him from doing the deal new york times reporter lauren hirsch said there has been an interesting confluence of events since news of musk s offer first broke the stock market basically dropped off the cliff including shares of tesla which musk was presumably relying on to fund much of the deal that may be part of the reason musk has seemingly been casting doubt that his purchase offer would come to fruition almost from the moment he made it he would kind of throw daggers out there and then walk away and we never quite knew what his intention was hirsch said at least until friday when musk s lawyer sent twitter a letter saying he is pulling out of the deal because the social media platform is in material breach of multiple provisions of the original agreement twitter is fighting back pledging to take musk to court and some have questioned if musk s concerns about the bots are just an excuse to exit the deal washington post national correspondent philip bump said it s hard to say what his true motives are but did concede that musk is an eccentric character i m sort of fascinated by the repercussions of his announcement that it very quickly became entangled in american politics bump said twitter was perceived by some as a leftist elitist organization that was now going to be taken over and reshaped by a libertarian conservative one potential beneficiary of a musk twitter takeover former president donald trump who was famously banned from the platform following the jan 6 violence at the capitol recently went on stage at an alaska political rally and labeled musk a bull expletive artist calling his decision to withdraw from the twitter deal rotten one of the big questions now is what will happen to twitter from its employees to its advertising revenue to its share price the saga has been going on since april and employees still don t know who their boss is going to be insider s chief media correspondent claire atkinson said if you re considering advertising on the platform you want to know is this product suitable atkinson said and what are their rules stelter said that bots are no doubt a problem for twitter though it s still unclear just how prevalent they are but musk may be more affected by them than the average user i suspect what s going on here is musk has a very different experience on twitter than the average user stelter said he is overwhelmed by bs replies and spam

it s looking more and more like elon musk is trying to get out of buying twitter recently he announced his intention to buy the company coming up with some 44 billion to do so now business insider reports he s saying that transaction cannot go through that is until the company can provide proof that less than 5 of all of its users are fake musk recently tweeted quote my offer was based on twitter s sec filings being accurate that sec filing indicated the sub 5 fake user base must added 20 fake slash spam accounts while four times what twitter claims could be much higher it s unclear where he came up with 20 figure but reuters reports in study from 2017 an online monitoring firm estimated that number could be between nine and 15 must ask the company to provide random sample of 100 accounts to see whether the 5 number held up twitter responded by explaining why that wouldn t work and that their internal findings including multiple human reviews in replica of thousands of accounts provides more accurate number than 100 random users super genius musk responded with emoji it s worth noting since elon musk announced his twitter takeover the social media company has seen its stock prices plummet around 20 advertisement what s next for twitter now that elon musk wants out share copy link copy after announcing he wants out of his deal to buy twitter elon musk spent the weekend in idaho at the sun valley conference he spoke on stage essentially off the record but a source in the room told cnn s chief media correspondent brian stelter that musk tripled down on his decision to try to back out of the deal and claimed it s all about the bots musk originally said he was going to fix the bot problem stelter said on reliable sources on sunday the same problem that he now says is stopping him from doing the deal new york times reporter lauren hirsch said there has been an interesting confluence of events since news of musk s offer first broke the stock market basically dropped off the cliff including shares of tesla which musk was presumably relying on to fund much of the deal that may be part of the reason musk has seemingly been casting doubt that his purchase offer would come to fruition almost from the moment he made it he would kind of throw daggers out there and then walk away and we never quite knew what his intention was hirsch said at least until friday when musk s lawyer sent twitter a letter saying he is pulling out of the deal because the social media platform is in material breach of multiple provisions of the original agreement twitter is fighting back pledging to take musk to court and some have questioned if musk s concerns about the bots are just an excuse to exit the deal washington post national correspondent philip bump said it s hard to say what his true motives are but did concede that musk is an eccentric character i m sort of fascinated by the repercussions of his announcement that it very quickly became entangled in american politics bump said twitter was perceived by some as a leftist elitist organization that was now going to be taken over and reshaped by a libertarian conservative one potential beneficiary of a musk twitter takeover former president donald trump who was famously banned from the platform following the jan 6 violence at the capitol recently went on stage at an alaska political rally and labeled musk a bull expletive artist calling his decision to withdraw from the twitter deal rotten one of the big questions now is what will happen to twitter from its employees to its advertising revenue to its share price the saga has been going on since april and employees still don t know who their boss is going to be insider s chief media correspondent claire atkinson said if you re considering advertising on the platform you want to know is this product suitable atkinson said and what are their rules stelter said that bots are no doubt a problem for twitter though it s still unclear just how prevalent they are but musk may be more affected by them than the average user i suspect what s going on here is musk has a very different experience on twitter than the average user stelter said he is overwhelmed by bs replies and spam
updated july 10 2022 at 5 32 pm et elon musk wants to break off his agreement to buy twitter in a letter to the company filed friday with the securities and exchange commission musk accuses twitter of making false and misleading representations about the prevalence of fake accounts on its platform he says the company has not complied with its obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to evaluate its business sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information musk s lawyer mike ringler wrote legal experts say this may not be sufficient grounds to break off the 44 billion deal without musk being on the hook for a hefty fine in response to musk s letter the chair of twitter s board said it planned to sue the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery said bret taylor in a tweet referring to a delaware court that handles corporate disputes the billionaire ceo of tesla and space x struck a deal to buy the social media company back in april but almost immediately he started hinting and then saying outright that he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington post reported the deal was in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team was expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported bots may not be the only factor in musk s change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal as of the closing bell on friday twitter shares were trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced in may musk even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price on thursday twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august musk signed a merger agreement the two sides signed a legal agreement that musk would buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side broke off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party in his letter on friday musk cites twitter s alleged refusal to turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the deal but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter has a strong case against musk say experts the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has compelling incentives to see the sale through investors are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk might try to get twitter at a discount still some wall street analysts say twitter s board and management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a lengthy legal battle there s no chance it s getting done at 54 20 said angelo zino analyst at cfra research you re either going to see a 15 to 20 drop in the offer price to get elon musk engaged again or he continues to play the bot card taking musk to court could be even more damaging to twitter at a time when uncertainty over the deal and what the billionaire s ownership might mean are weighing heavily on the company morale is already low and some employees are leaving ceo parag agrawal has shaken up his executive ranks and announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts going to court doesn t bode well for the business prospects of your company and it further adds uncertainty to the employee base zino said that s also a risk for musk lipton said what if he has to buy the company and now he s kind of undermined it at the same time ultimately she said the billionaire s antics however chaotic appear to have a single goal i don t think he s committed to winning i think he s committing to not spending 44 billion on

in the past eight months foreign portfolio investors have moved out nearly 40 billion out of india by selling stocks and bonds during this time india s foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 52 billion the rupee has been falling against the american dollar imports are rising faster than exports which means we need many more dollars to pay out than what we receive in our export earnings even in normal times india has a dollar shortage of manageable proportions that is between 1 to 2 percent of gdp typically this is less than 50 billion and arises due to exports exceeding imports this shortage is funded by inflows in the form of stock market investments foreign loans private equity or bond purchases these capital inflows have always exceeded the current account deficit and hence india s balance of payment bop account has been in surplus of course having a bop surplus funded by foreign debt and liabilities alone is not necessarily a good thing especially when there is debt distress all around the world but in normal times foreigners readily giving loans to india s economy is a sign of their confidence all this is about to change sharply and the custodian of india s forex the reserve bank of india has sent out early warning signals with any luck and assuming a robust inflow of 80 billion during this fiscal year our bop account will still be negative by 30 40 billion and our current account deficit might rise dangerously to 3 2 per cent of gdp reaching beyond 100 billion our pile of reserves won t be sufficient to tackle this extra pressure on forex hence the rbi has relaxed some constraints to attract more dollar denominated fixed deposits from non resident indians it has also made foreign borrowing easier and has increased the allowed limit on foreign ownership of indian government bonds all these measures are meant to attract more dollar inflows these proactive measures were needed due to some alarming signs such as the widening trade and current account deficit and increase in the share of foreign debt which is to be repaid this year india s foreign debt is 620 billion of which 267 billion is due to be repaid in the next nine months this ratio of short term debt is 44 per cent and dangerously high to repay this debt the private companies which have taken those foreign loans will need to seek fresh loans to repay old loans or else dip into india s foreign exchange reserves the latter is not desirable since the forex reserves are falling and need to be shored up and the former won t be easy since dollars are flowing toward the us and not toward developing countries in any case the fresh loans will be at much higher interest rates causing a future burden of debt servicing the rbi s precautionary moves came alongside measures taken by the union government to conserve dollars import duty on gold has been hiked to 12 5 per cent to stem the outflow of dollars owing to gold purchases indians have an insatiable demand for gold and hence the country is the highest importer in the world the higher import duty might reduce the demand somewhat but will also induce some smuggling there is also a possibility that other restrictions may be imposed on non essential imports to prevent the dollar outflow management of foreign exchange and the exchange rate is primarily the responsibility of the rbi in the present circumstances apart from pressure due to the flight of stock market investors there is additional pressure due to high oil prices it affects india s total import bill upwards of 150 billion annually and an increase in the subsidy bill since there is less than full pass through of oil prices to the consumers the fertiliser and cooking gas subsidy burden is increased due to higher oil prices so to deal with this additional fiscal burden the government has imposed an export tax on windfall profits on the steel and oil refining companies this is expected to raise more than rs 1 trillion for the exchequer it is an indirect way of dealing with impact of the falling rupee but an export tax is a rare and exceptional measure and justified only because of steep increases in oil prices which is linked to the ukraine war the union government also has the fiscal burden of continuing with the compensation due to the shortfall of gst collection to state governments the latter are saddled with debts of their own with ten states reaching dangerous levels of debt which can lead to default on the external front the pressure on the rupee is not just because of the high import bill caused by oil prices non oil and non gold imports such as electronics chemicals and coal rose by 32 per cent between april to june gold imports during june were 170 per cent higher as compared to a year ago let s see if higher import duty on gold deters imports indians could invest in sovereign gold bonds which are demat substitutes for gold and do not drain precious foreign exchange an aggressive selling effort of gold bonds by the government is needed the coming months will call for deft macroeconomic management of the twin deficits on the external and internal front a higher fiscal deficit invites higher interest rates and a higher trade deficit invites a weaker rupee if these two policy instruments interest rates and the exchange rate are handled diligently in order to gradually reduce both the deficits we can avert a crisis situation weakening rupee is a natural cushion but in the short term can aggravate the trade deficit until exports catch up similarly reducing the fiscal deficit calls for both expenditure control and higher tax revenues the latter requires growth and employment to pick up if oil prices go down due to recessionary winds in the world that would be a boon to india albeit a mixed one since a global recession is bad for india s exports which are crucial for closing the trade deficit gap who said macroeconomic management was easy dr ajit ranade is a noted economist

over the past two years nascar has transformed its schedule by adding new natural terrain road courses a temporary dirt race and even an exhibition inside a stadium but they still have one item left on their checklist a street race downtown in a major american market next year that dream might finally come to fruition nascar has been openly targeting an ambitious plan to race through chicago since march 2021 at one point going as far as to call their shot by building out the proposed street circuit in iracing now a letter obtained by the athletic indicates that the city of chicago endorses the plan with racing starting in 2023 and continuing through at least 2025 all that leaves is a formal deal and final announcement which the athletic reports could be set for july 19 nascar while nascar has not raced on a street circuit in its top level of competition nascar affiliated stock car categories like their canadian series have done so in the past australia s v8 supercars the major inspiration for the construction concepts behind the next gen car the series began racing earlier this season thrive in the tight confines of street races add in the massive crowds a major street circuit event generally pulls in its first year and nascar believes an event like chicago could be an even bigger revelation than their surprise hit at the los angeles coliseum in february there are some related concerns many announced street races from indycar s planned trip to boston in 2016 to indycar s planned trip to qingdao in 2012 are canceled before they ever run many others like the baltimore grand prix and the san jose grand prix are plagued by year one logistical issues and never establish a real foothold before collapsing building a lasting street circuit event is difficult so difficult that it can be argued only long beach monaco and macau have succeeded for long enough to become a lasting tradition if the series can figure this one out completely it could have a new crown jewel for decades to come

is any amount of crypto investment too risky many public pension funds across the u s are underfunded sometimes seriously so which leads them to take risks to try to catch up that doesn t always work out and the risk extends not just to the funds but to taxpayers who might have to bail them out either through higher taxes or diverting spending away from other needs keith brainard research director for the national association of state retirement administrators said he wasn t aware of more than a handful of public pension funds that have invested in crypto there may come a day when crypto

were you at rockefeller wildlife refuge over the weekend if so you may have some information i can use i lost something sentimental at one of the weirs and i was hoping that you might have seen it get our free mobile app get our free mobile app cut to the chase i forgot my tackle box similar to the one pictured above at a weir at rockefeller on saturday it s the first weir on the left as you head out of joseph s harbor by boat via google maps not the weir at the locks it s the next weir the tackle box is a basic black and grey soft sided tackle box with the typical gear stored inside most of it is salt water tackle there s a bottle of sunscreen in one of the pockets with a spool of braided fishing string in another pocket there are a few corks and a couple of batteries for the live well aerator in the main compartment are a pair of yellow fish handling gloves also there are 4 trays with lids that snap shut that hold more gear one for hooks and jig heads one for weights sinkers one for artificial lures and one for mostly fresh water lures in the front pocket there are a variety of wire leaders and more jig heads and plastic bodies and a pair of slightly rusted needle nosed pliers attached to one of the zipper handles is a little snipper on a retractable string what is sentimental about this tackle box bag nothing it s another item that is in that average looking black and grey tackle box my late father s fillet knife similar to the knife in this picture townsquare photo some of my favorite memories as a child are the times that the family spend the day sometimes the whole weekend crabbing and fishing at rockefeller wildlife refuge we would either hit the locks for fishing and crabbing and sometimes a great haul of shrimp in the cast net or we would head to price lake road for more of the same we would go to rockefeller several times every summer to stock the freezer as best as we could it was a great way to keep us busy during the summer months while putting food on the table when we would get home with fish the kids would get the fish cleaning table ready while dad would sharpen up his fillet knife was the knife expensive i have no clue does that knife clean fish better than any other knife i can buy at the sporting goods store probably not but it was my dad s and i have used it every time i clean fish since he passed away so how did i lose my tackle box that s an easy question to answer i just plain forgot to pick it up this is an older satellite photo of the weir where i left the tackle box since this photo was taken the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries built a pair of catwalks that extend north of the control structure the red oval shows where the east catwalk now stands via google maps i had set the tackle box down at the end of the eastern most catwalk that heads north from the control structure there were several people out there crabbing that day so to keep it out of the way i set the tackle box down on one of the crossbeams that support the catwalk it was the last crossbeam the one mounted against the final piling on the catwalk townsquare photo when we packed up to head to a different fishing spot i grabbed the crab nets the fishing poles the bait bucket and the cast net but i forgot my tackle box sitting at the end of the catwalk i didn t realize i had left it there until we had made the hour and a half trip back home and started to empty out the boat upon realizing i had forgotten to pick it up my heart sank i called someone with the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries to see if an agent was maybe in the area and maybe he or she could take a look at the weir for the tackle box but no one was able to do that early this morning i hooked the boat up to head back out there to see if by chance it was still there townsquare photo i got in the water at sunrise and i was the first boat at the weir townsquare photo i tied up the boat hopped on the dock and made my way over the control structure before i even got on the catwalk i could see that the tackle box was gone townsquare photo my heart sank again so here s where i need your help could you ask your friends who went to rockefeller this weekend if they saw that tackle box and if they did and they happened to pick it up can you ask them to return the knife whoever picked up the tackle box can keep everything else that s in it finders keepers right because i can get more leaders and sinkers and corks and braided fishing line and fish handling gloves and tape measure and sunscreen and jig heads and needle nosed pliers but i can t get another fillet knife i inherited from my dad townsquare photo i found a picture of a similar knife the handle on the one in this picture is a little faded but other than that this is pretty much the knife my dad s fillet knife was in a sheath that had a loop for a belt and it would have been sitting at the top of the main compartment right above the plastic trays and the yellow fish handling gloves i know that this is a long shot but with enough people putting the word out the person who picked it up might just see this 10 must drive roads in acadiana

united nations agencies reported last week that global hunger and the chronic inability to access food soared in 2021 a staggering 2 3 billion 30 percent of the world s population were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 with nearly 12 percent facing severe food insecurity millions across the horn of africa the sahel yemen and syria already experiencing severe levels of hunger and poverty face the prospect of mass starvation young girls line up at a feeding centre in mogadishu somalia photo by tobin jones cc by nc nd 4 0 this is set to worsen due to the us nato provoked war in ukraine with executive director of the un s world food program wpf david beasley warning that the food crisis caused by the war would push countries into famine causing global destabilization starvation and mass migration on an unprecedented scale according to the wpf s deputy director for research assessment ronald tran ba huy 135 million people faced acute food insecurity before the pandemic in 2020 that figure had reached 276 million before russia s invasion of ukraine a figure set to increase to 335 million people in 82 countries in 2022 the state of food security and nutrition in the world 2022 published by the food and agriculture organization fao world food programme wfp the international fund for agricultural development ifad the united nations children s fund unicef and world health organization who said that up to 828 million people nearly 11 percent of the world s population faced hunger last year the number has grown by about 140 million since the start of the pandemic undernourishment jumped from 8 percent in 2019 to 9 3 percent in 2020 and 9 8 percent in 2021 this has had a devastating impact on children in 2020 an estimated 22 percent of children under five years of age were stunted 6 7 percent wasted and 5 7 percent overweight the report projects that nearly 670 million will still be undernourished in 2030 almost 3 1 billion people 40 percent of the world s population could not afford a healthy diet in 2020 an increase of 112 million since 2019 because of rising food prices stemming from the pandemic the un agencies expect that nearly 670 million 8 percent of the world s population will still be facing hunger in 2030 the same level as in 2015 when the 2030 agenda was launched with its target of zero hunger by 2030 while the report blamed the war in ukraine for skyrocketing food prices food prices are 34 percent higher than a year ago and have reached their highest level since 1990 it failed to point out that the us government and its imperialist allies provoked the war and are intent on continuing it for as long as it takes to defeat russia they have imposed sanctions on russia that have included banning the country from the swift international money transfer system to destroy russia s economy by blocking its exports of fuel food and fertilizers this has driven up prices that were already soaring due to their failure to pursue a coronavirus elimination policy thereby prolonging the pandemic upending the world economy and disrupting global supply chains it is the world s poorest both within and between countries that bear the heaviest burden with 20 percent of people on the african continent facing hunger in 2021 compared to 9 1 percent in asia 8 6 percent in latin america and the caribbean 5 8 percent in oceania and under 2 5 percent in northern america and europe as oxfam pointed out in a recent report first crisis then catastrophe food accounts for 17 percent of consumer spending in wealthy countries but as much as 40 percent in sub saharan africa but even within the advanced economies inflation is super charging inequality in the us the poorest 20 percent of families spend 27 percent of their incomes on food while the richest 20 percent spend only 7 percent global subsidies to the food and agriculture sector accounted for around 630 billion a year from 2013 to 2018 and are likely to reach 1 8 trillion a year by 2030 it is the giant agribusiness transnationals the 10 largest of which are cargill adm bayer john deere cnh industrial syngenta dupont nutrien yara international and basf that are most able to access subsidies some 70 percent of subsidies and state support go to producers largely in the high income countries for staple foods including cereals roots and tubers and meat and dairy at the expense of healthier nutritious foods such as fruits vegetables pulses and seeds the report pathetically appealed to the advanced countries to consider repurposing current public support to food and agriculture that often distorted market prices did not reach small scale farmers hurt the environment and did not promote nutritious food production this was the nearest it got to pinning responsibility for global hunger on capitalism the economic system of producing food for profit not need and the subsidies provided by the world s wealthiest governments to their own corporations why these same governments which have sent millions to their deaths during the pandemic and are inciting a nuclear war with russia that would kill millions if not billions would repurpose their agricultural support systems to save the world s poorest from starvation the report did not say the un agencies ignored the rampant financial speculation and profit gouging that are driving food prices ever higher to cite one example a lighthouse reports investigation the hunger profiteers concluded that in april speculators were responsible for 72 percent of the buying activity on the paris wheat market up from 25 percent before the pandemic the report also glossed over the rising tide of social inequality and its causes that has made it impossible for so many workers to feed their families thanks to the massive handouts to the corporations as stock markets collapsed around the world at the onset of the pandemic in march 2020 the wealth of the world s richest people soared more than in the previous 14 years combined while global poverty deepened for most workers around the world real terms wages have continued to stagnate or even fall while entire countries are forced ever deeper into poverty the world s poorest countries face defaulting on their debt repayments of 43 billion in 2022 they are being forced to slash public spending including whatever limited social support they provide to pay creditors and import food and fuel last month wealth x reported that there were 3 331 billionaires at the end of last year up from 3 204 in 2020 one third of whom lived in north america their total wealth had surged by 17 8 percent to a record 11 8 trillion a sum equal to 12 percent of global gdp while few governments increased taxes on the richest even a fraction of this enormous wealth would end global hunger with research in 2020 sponsored by the fao and other food agencies estimating the cost of ending hunger by 2030 was 330 billion the un agencies numerous appeals to the world s richest countries for humanitarian aid have fallen on deaf ears as they turn their attention and resources to the war in ukraine they have pledged only about 18 percent of the 1 46 billion needed for the somali people who face mass starvation forcing the un to cut its rations to those in dire need of aid the amount needed pales into insignificance beside the imperialists expenditure on war and militarism that they like to justify in the name of humanitarianism last month the g7 leaders pledged an extra 4 5 billion to tackle the food crisis a fraction of the 28 5 billion needed sending the message that millions must starve world leaders are acutely aware of the repercussions of the spiraling cost of food as workers demand pay increases and take to the streets in protest over their deteriorating living conditions in rich and poor countries alike but the fight for decent wages affordable food basic necessities and a massive increase in wages means that the working class must unite across workplaces industries countries and continents in a global political struggle against the capitalist class and its governments and to put an end to the imperialist war

bloomberg now that elon musk has decided that he doesn t want to buy twitter inc after all he can t just walk away from the 44 billion contract the billionaire co founder of tesla inc will need to make his case before a judge in delaware that twitter failed to uphold its side of a merger deal reached in april if history is a guide his job won t be easy most read from bloomberg twitter chairman bret taylor vowed friday that the social media platform will fight in the delaware court of chancery to compel musk to follow through on his agreement and the company has lawyered up in a race to sue a filing could come as soon as early this week people familiar with the matter told bloomberg if the judge rules against musk he could be forced to pay twitter shareholders 54 20 a share as he said he would in the accord announced april 25 a ruling in his favor would let musk walk though he d probably have to pay a break up fee initially set at 1 billion there s also the prospect that both sides reach a settlement whereby musk still makes the acquisition potentially at a lower price twitter shares slid 6 4 to 34 45 as the market opened on monday in new york the judge in this case will zero in closely on the densely worded intricacies of the 73 page purchase agreement and the court has rarely sided with parties who like musk are attempting to bail on acquisition commitments musk s rationale centers on automated user accounts known as bots and how twitter accounts for them he alleges that the social media platform is teeming with spam bots disputing twitter s contention that they make up less than 5 of total users musk said in his friday filing with the us securities and exchange commission that twitter s failure to properly hand over specifics on the number of bots amounts to what s known as a company material adverse effect a judge must decide whether such an event has occurred and whether it justifies musk s cancellation larry hamermesh a university of pennsylvania law professor who specializes in delaware corporate law disputes describes an mae as an unexpected fundamental permanent negative development akin to blowing a hole in the transaction that can t be fixed so far delaware courts have found only one case in which a clear mae emerged fresenius se s 4 3 billion buyout bid in 2018 for rival drugmaker akorn inc a judge blessed fresenius decision to walk away from the deal after finding akorn executives hid an array of problems that cast doubt on the validity of data backing up approval for some drugs and profitability of its operations story continues forcing musk s hand the agreement also gives twitter officials so called specific performance rights which means that if the judge finds musk s complaints about the bots data don t rise to the level of an mae the platform can demand that the judge force musk to consummate the buyout musk s decision to sign the deal without doing due diligence could work against him said robert profusek head of the mergers and acquisitions department at law firm jones day his lawyers argument that you don t do diligence and test things out later simply isn t the way things work in big ticket m a and if accepted would put shareholders at risk he said in an interview musk is at least publicly laughing off the lawsuit in his characteristic meme fashion he issued a humorous late night response to twitter s plans to sue posting a collection of images on twitter of himself laughing with captions recounting his version of events over the past few months it conveys a lighthearted attitude from the world s richest man to what has been a complex and expensive deal that s weighed on tesla shares and gone through several iterations of provisional funding tesla shares were up less than 1 on monday the billionaire may be taking a dismissive approach but delaware chancery court judges are known for their expertise in interpreting what may look and sound to the layperson as a maze of legal jargon that seeks to delineate both sides rights and responsibilities in a merger and acquisition accord in the twitter deal the platform s executives are obligated to promptly furnish musk with all information concerning the business properties and personnel of the company and its subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested musk contends management hasn t met those duties in connection with the details of spam and bot accounts twitter said it has handed over extensive data on its user base executives told media thursday that the company manually reviews thousands of accounts each quarter to determine the 5 spam bot tally and estimates that the actual number is well below the threshold disclosed in filings the company uses internal data such as examining phone numbers or internet protocol addresses the unique set of characters associated with a computer or other device to help determine whether an account is run by a human the agreement also defines a company material adverse effect as any change event effect or circumstance which individually or in the aggregate has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business financial condition or results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries a probable outcome is that the parties reach an out of court settlement musk s effort to pull the plug on the deal is probably nothing more than a negotiating ploy said charles elson a retired university of delaware professor and former head of the school s weinberg center for corporate governance this is not a material adverse change elson said that s just a negotiating position he knows the delaware courts are extremely reluctant to find something like that in these deals to press its case twitter has hired merger law heavyweight wachtell lipton rosen katz according to people familiar with the matter the social media company aims to file suit early this week said the people who declined to be identified because the matter is private by hiring wachtell it gains access to lawyers including bill savitt and leo strine who served as chancellor of the delaware chancery court musk has brought in quinn emanuel urquhart sullivan llp the firm led his successful defense against a defamation claim in 2019 and is representing him as part of an ongoing shareholder lawsuit over his failed attempt to take tesla private in 2018 twitter morale sinks whatever the outcome of legal wrangling the mood among many employees of san francisco based twitter is dour people at or close to the company have told bloomberg amid the uncertainty surrounding a possible sale several employees have lamented what they consider a lack of leadership and vision setting from the top including chief executive officer parag agrawal said the people who requested anonymity discussing internal matters for many twitter staffers neither of the likely outcomes is palatable if twitter prevails in court the company will be run by an unpredictable and reluctant owner while still struggling to meet ambitious growth targets and should musk succeed in ending the deal twitter stock will likely plummet and a staff already dejected by musk s months long public criticism of the site will suffer another emotional blow several people have left or are planning to leave because they simply don t want to work for musk the people said for some the decision to depart was cemented after a june question and answer session during which musk who showed up late told employees that only those who were exceptional would be allowed to continue working from home updates with musk meme and opening shares most read from bloomberg businessweek 2022 bloomberg l p

blends represents the vast majority of the worldwide market for scotch whisky the world of blended scotch typically offers great value with flavor profiles that by design are seamless smooth and versatile they aren t just for mixing although that s fine too but they are definitely being lost in the mix so why is it that blended scotch whiskies are being overlooked usa vs the world the first place to look is the differing drinking habits of the united states as opposed to the rest of the world when it comes to scotch according to the distilled spirits council of the united states discus 9 585 million 9 liter cases of scotch were sold in the u s in 2015 of that 7 457 million cases or about 77 8 was blended whereas 2 127 million cases or 22 2 was single malt wait doesn t that show that blends dominate the market yes and no let s look beyond the overall numbers to the trends since 2002 blended sales are down 10 6 in the u s when they represented 91 7 of the market with 8 343 million cases single malt sales on the other hand are up a staggering 181 7 in the same timeframe from 755 000 cases which represented just 8 3 of the market here in the u s it s easy to see that new releases and consumer attention all points to the surge of the single malt at the expense of the blend now let s go global and compare how the u s stacks up to the world using the latest export statistics from the scotch whisky association swa referencing the first half of 2016 for the purposes of this discussion we re excluding bulk sales which represents 23 of total scotch export volume comparing just single malts and blends and excluding the u s there were approximately 358 million bottles of scotch exported globally from january to june 2016 single malt exports equaled about 39 million bottles or 10 9 of the total proportionally that means that u s scotch whisky drinkers favor single malts twice as much as our global counterparts as one final point also consider that whether u s scotch drinkers are purchasing single malts or blends we re drinking the good stuff when you factor in volume versus value therefore drinkers here often treat blends like single malts meaning they re drinking them neat or on the rocks as opposed to sticking purely with value brands to mix up a scotch soda and the like to demonstrate that point compare the drinking habits of france to the u s the number 1 and 2 global scotch whisky export markets to see a stark difference according to the swa for the first half of 2016 france maintained its position as by far the largest export market by volume representing 90 9 million bottles the u s was number 2 with 53 1 million now flip that on its head for value the u s is by far the largest export market by value representing 357 4 million france trails at number two with 193 1 million but we owe our single malts to the blend if you re one of the many whisky drinkers in the u s who prefers single malt scotch whisky then you re also one of the lucky benefactors of the quality of our blends says dr nicholas morgan head of whisky outreach at diageo all the single malts wouldn t exist without blends yes even with over 100 distilleries making scotch malt whisky their collective primary purpose is to service the blends again look at those overall export sales and factor in the bulk sales this time now single malt scotch whisky exports represent just over 9 of the global total or 49 million bottles out of 533 million at diageo sales are even more heavily skewed towards blends than the industry as a whole and that s despite

standout single malt such as lagavulin is in the words of dr morgan sort of the grand cru of whisky you owe a major debt of appreciation to the blended behemoths it s not just diageo though look at

bacardi umbrella as one of their five malt distilleries they have production capacity of between 3 5 and 4 million lpa and 92 of it goes straight to the blended dewar s line which is why it s touted as the brand s heart malt beyond the world s top single malts dozens of other distilleries are little known and survive by pushing their production entirely or near entirely into blends even lagavulin that grand cru with its production maxed to the brim and its stock cherished still supplies a bit of its whisky to feed a blend white horse five to try blended scotch whiskies to explore rather than

the pullout marks a dramatic turn in a half year saga that began with musk building up an equity stake lining up an elaborate financing plan and then striking a deal in april throughout musk has accused the company of misleading the public about the number of automated accounts known as spam bots on its platform culminating with a termination letter sent friday elon musk is trying to end an agreement to buy twitter inc for 44 billion and take it private alleging that the company misrepresented user data and setting the stage for an arduous court brawl twitter made misleading representations over the number of spam bots on the social network and hasn t complied with its contractual obligations to provide information about how to assess how prevalent the bots are musk s representatives said in the letter included in a regulatory filing within minutes of the letter going public twitter vowed to fight back in court the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement bret taylor chairman of the board said in a tweet we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery the legal tussle will play out in a court that historically frowns on efforts to scrap merger agreements and could result in a settlement whereby musk is forced to buy twitter possibly under revised terms legal scholars said the entire deal has been a frenzied and untraditional affair largely played out on twitter s own social network musk the billionaire chief executive officer of tesla inc went from being merely a prolific user to revealing a significant stake in twitter and then launching an unsolicited takeover offer without detailed financing plans within a matter of weeks the agreement came together at breakneck speed in part because musk waived the chance to look at twitter s finances beyond what was publicly available shortly after deciding he wanted to own twitter in april musk cooled on the idea meanwhile the agreed upon price of 54 20 a share looked better and better for twitter as the social network started to struggle to sell ads and began a hiring freeze while its shares were pounded by a broader market meltdown the spread between twitter s stock and the deal price has widened in a sign of increasing skepticism that it would go through musk s termination letter torpedoed twitter stock further and threw the company s future into heightened doubt after months of ups and downs mainly based on musk s shifting public statements about the transaction employees on friday were told to refrain from posting on twitter or on slack about the deal as it is now considered an ongoing legal matter according to a person familiar with the situation twitter has denied musk s claims over spam bots saying bots are fewer than 5 of the total users with executives repeating as recently as thursday in a press briefing that their estimates are accurate according to the letter musk and his team have asked twitter for more information regarding bots and not received enough to satisfy his questions the information has come with strings attached use limitations or other artificial formatting features making it minimally useful musk believes the amount of spam bots to be substantially higher than 5 he said in the letter without offering evidence musk also argued that twitter has failed to operate its normal course of business the san francisco based company instituted a hiring freeze fired senior leaders and saw other major departures the company has not received parent s consent for changes in the conduct of its business including for the specific changes listed above musk said in the letter calling it a material breach of the merger agreement musk s deal with twitter had included a provision that if it fell apart the party breaking the agreement would pay a termination fee of 1 billion under certain circumstances legal experts have debated whether the conflict over spam bots is enough to allow musk to walk away from the deal but musk may not be able to walk away simply by paying the termination fee the merger agreement includes a specific performance provision that allows twitter to force musk to consummate the deal according to the original filing that could mean that should the deal end up in court twitter might secure an order obligating musk to complete the merger rather than winning monetary compensation for any violations of it the company has repeatedly said that it will pursue that legal path bob swan the former chief executive officer of intel corp resigned from musk s deal negotiations team last month surprising some who had seen swan as one of the experienced adults in the room working closely with twitter chief financial officer ned segal on the deal according to two people familiar with the process swan the former ceo and cfo of intel is now an operating partner at the venture capital firm andreessen horowitz the vc firm has agreed to help musk finance his twitter deal and earlier committed 400 million to musk s bid andreessen has also been helping on integration work swan and musk didn t respond to requests for comment twitter shares slid about 7 on the news after closing friday at 36 81 in new york the stock has dropped 15 this year and hasn t come close to reaching the 54 20 musk offered in the deal the purchase announced on april 25 could still be one of the biggest leveraged buyouts in history if twitter manages to get a judge to force musk to go through with it musk s initial offer included 25 5 billion of debt and margin loan financing from lenders including morgan stanley as well as a 21 billion equity commitment from the 50 year old billionaire himself that financing has evolved as musk in the weeks that followed with musk bringing on other equity investors and he s taken out a 6 25 billion margin loan against his tesla shares though he had been trying to replace that by bringing in preferred equity investors ___ 2022 bloomberg news visit at bloomberg com distributed by tribune content agency llc

recession wrings out excesses people tend to look to the past to make sense of the present and the future looking at historical patterns can indeed provide a useful roadmap for the future but can sometimes lead to mistaken assumptions during bear markets a wildly overused and i believe dangerous frame of reference is historical drawdowns and their implied assumptions about future market returns for example a widely used formula goes like this recessions last an average of w number of days and equities fall an average of x followed by a recovery of y in z days market commentators use formulas such as these to ease clients mental anguish and imply that better days are ahead better days are ahead however they can take longer than you expect to materialize and may be accompanied by significant financial pain the problem with averages averages tell us the central or typical value in a data series but provide no window into variation for example two cities may share an average annual temperature of 70 f but if one is in a temperate climate where the temperature is quite steady and the other experiences significant seasonality the average doesn t tell you much more data are needed to decide when to visit one city and when to visit the other apart from the problem with simple averages just like the cities referenced above every market drawdown financial crisis and recession is different even if historical market drawdown averages were accompanied with pages of data would that help i don t think so recessions wring out excesses economic and market cycles don t die of old age they end when excesses are corrected due to a financial crisis or a recession these often painfully wring out overinvestment in both the real economy and financial markets the length of the business cycle is irrelevant what matters is the level of excess and the magnitude of the needed rebalancing process that determines how much further we may still have to fall to get a sense of where past excesses lay look no further than to whomever was wall street s favorite client at the time for example in the 1990s it was the dot com companies the street s favorite and most profitable clients were companies with a concept leveraged to the internet seeking capital in the 2000s the preferred clientele was financial institutions looking for enhanced yield without excess risk the street sold them mortgage backed securities consisting of repackaged loans made to american homeowners who were unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations the time required to heal following the internet bubble and housing crisis is unrelated to the next recession different imbalances require different corrective processes the level of the drawdown in the s p 500 or msci eafe back then is no longer the issue what matters today is whether the real economy and financial markets have cleared the excesses built up since the last recession where are today s excesses the policy response to low growth and deflation risks during the 2010s was quantitative easing central bankers expected it to lead to capital creation and corporate borrowing to fund productive activities it didn t because money debasing signaled weak growth prospects to producers borrowed money instead went to pay dividends and repurchase stock quantitative easing turned out to be the problem masquerading as the solution wall street s favorite clients in the post gfc era were non bank companies financial leverage among that group reached new heights before the pandemic and exceeded those highs once central banks turned the lending spigot back on in april 2020 unlocking credit markets as i wrote back in april despite the weakest economic cycle in over a century corporate profit margins reached alltime highs in 2018 only to be surpassed in 2022 due to the lagged effects of an over stimulated world economy how debt is a pull forward of future capacity and companies pulled forward an unsustainable amount of margin and profit looking ahead margins and profits ultimately drive stock and credit prices s p 500 on track for the worst start of the year since 1970 is a dramatic headline but misses the point what will drive future returns is profits currently many companies are telling investors they can sustain all time high post stimulus margins despite rising fears of recession and a step function jump in costs explaining why earnings expectations remain elevated in the face of obvious revenue and input cost pressures but we don t believe them risk is usually hidden in plain sight what do your eyes tell you in brief historical patterns can provide a useful roadmap for the future but can sometimes lead to mistaken assumptions comparing past drawdowns to the present offers little value every episode is unique companies are telling investors they can maintain historically high profit margins despite rising recession risks and rapidly rising costs history suggests otherwise contact us at

3 3 reuters a cluster of young stars resembles an aerial burst surrounded by clouds of interstellar gas and dust in a nebula ngc 3603 located in the constellation carina in this image captured in august 2009 and december 2009 and obtained september 26 2018 nasa 2 3 by steve gorman and joey roulette reuters drawing back the curtain to a photo gallery unlike any other nasa will soon present the first full color images from its james webb space telescope a revolutionary apparatus designed to peer through the cosmos to the dawn of the universe the highly anticipated unveiling this week of pictures and spectroscopic data from the newly operational observatory follows a six month process of remotely unfurling various components aligning its mirrors and calibrating instruments with webb now finely tuned and fully focused astronomers will embark on a competitively selected list of science projects exploring the evolution of galaxies the life cycles of stars the atmospheres of distant exoplanets and the moons of our outer solar system the first batch of photos which have taken weeks to process from raw telescope data are expected to offer a compelling glimpse at what webb will capture on the science missions that lie ahead nasa on friday posted a list of the five celestial subjects chosen for its showcase debut of webb built for the us space agency by aerospace giant northrop grumman corp nyse among them are two nebulae enormous clouds of gas and dust blasted into space by stellar explosions that form nurseries for new stars and two sets of galaxy clusters one of those according to nasa features objects in the foreground so massive that they act as gravitational lenses a visual distortion of space that greatly magnifies the light coming from behind them to expose even fainter objects farther away and further back in time how far back and what showed up on camera remains to be seen nasa will also present webb s first spectrographic analysis of an exoplanet one roughly half the mass of jupiter that lies more than 1 100 light years away revealing the molecular signatures of filtered light passing through its atmosphere moved me as a scientist as a human being all five of webb s introductory targets were previously known to scientists one of them the galaxy group 290 million light years from earth known as stephan s quintet was first discovered in 1877 but nasa officials promise webbs imagery captures its subjects in an entirely new light literally what i have seen moved me as a scientist as an engineer and as a human being nasa deputy administrator pam melroy who has reviewed the images told reporters during a june 29 news briefing one unspecified image from the collection will be unveiled on monday evening by us president joe biden at a white house briefing with nasa chief bill nelson the space agency said on sunday the rest will be released as previously scheduled in a live broadcast and webcast on tuesday from nasa s goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland by nasa and its european and canadian space agency collaborators the 9 billion infrared telescope the largest and most complex astronomical observatory ever sent to space was launched on christmas day from french guiana on the northeastern coast of south america a month later the 14 000 pound 6 350 kg instrument reached its gravitational parking spot in solar orbit circling the sun in tandem with earth nearly 1 million miles from home webb which views its subjects chiefly in the infrared spectrum is about 100 times more sensitive than its 30 year old predecessor the hubble space telescope which orbits earth from 340 miles 547 km away and operates mainly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths the larger light collecting surface of webb s primary mirror an array of 18 hexagonal segments of gold coated beryllium metal enables it to observe objects at greater distances thus further back in time than hubble or any other telescope its infrared sensitivity allows it to detect light sources that would otherwise be hidden in the visible spectrum by dust and gas taken together these features are expected to transform astronomy providing the first glimpse of infant galaxies dating to just 100 million years after the big bang the theoretical flashpoint that set the expansion of the known universe in motion an estimated 13 8 billion years ago webb s instruments also make it ideal to search for signs of potentially life supporting atmospheres around scores of newly documented plants orbiting distant stars and to observe worlds much closer to home such as mars and saturn s icy moon titan besides a host of studies already lined up for webb the telescope s most revolutionary findings may prove to be those that have yet to be anticipated such was the case in hubble s surprising discovery through observations of distant supernovae that the expansion of the universe is accelerating rather than slowing down opening a new field of astrophysics devoted to a mysterious phenomenon scientists call dark energy reporting and writing by steve gorman additional reporting by joey roulette editing by lisa shumaker

from coca cola to major league baseball to disney companies are wading into contentious political debates without fail these corporations align with leftist positions on the issues of our times the primary impetus for this leftward drift of corporate america is the rise of woke capital or investment designed not to maximize financial returns but to impose a leftist social and economic agenda that cannot otherwise be implemented through the ballot box in many cases woke capital is dressed up as so called esg investing a strategy that purports to be concerned with environmental social and governance issues esg supporters argue that their activism does not interfere with making money they are wrong and are deliberately trying to disguise the fact that esg investing is a ploy to subvert the will of the people for the sake of progressive politics right now the pressure of woke capital comes from three main sources asset managers who use their ownership of company stock to push those companies leftward banks and insurance companies that refuse to do business with disfavored industries such as energy or firearms and government regulators imposing esg related legal mandates these efforts are coordinated through standard setting bodies such as the financial stability board or industry coalitions financial industry coalitions such as climate action 100 and the glasgow financial alliance for net zero bring together companies with trillions of investable capital to point them all toward the same goal implementing the left s agenda through coercive financial means asset managers rarely make headlines but they can be very effective in pushing businesses to adopt leftist policies by throwing their ownership weight around most recently many of these asset managers banded together to elect exxonmobil board members who want to get exxon out of the oil and gas business imagine the board of an oil company actively getting it out of the business it was founded to operate the two largest asset managers blackrock and state street are part of a coalition pushing utilities to retire all of their gas and coal plants gas and coal represent over 60 of the u s electricity supply losing this energy would weaken our country drive up the high prices we already pay and produce blackouts threatening our most vulnerable there is no reliable evidence that esg investing produces better returns but there is evidence that esg investing does worse for clients a former blackrock insider recently explained in detail how these investments do little for the environment but they do help blackrock s bottom line even worse while companies like blackrock seek to hamstring the united states s energy producing capabilities they simultaneously invest in china which undercuts our national interests and unleashed the covid 19 pandemic on the world meanwhile companies refusing to do business with others based on their political beliefs are practicing one of the most treacherous forms of esg no one should have to worry that their bank will close their account because they own a gun store or because they tweeted something that was against the left wing orthodoxy of the day esg is even taking over government regulation the securities and exchange commission recently proposed a rule that would require all publicly traded companies to make expensive disclosures related to esg issues this was strongly supported by large asset managers who want to use the power of government to make all companies comply with their esg preferences this rule was proposed despite evidence that its requirements might actually harm ordinary investors and what woke capital wants woke capital gets from the biden administration elected leaders need to fight back and state attorneys general and other elected officials are doing so states are investigating companies for example and passing laws that prohibit state governments from doing business with financial institutions that boycott fossil fuel companies or the gun industry as indiana s attorney general i have joined with my colleagues around the country and helped lead the states to oppose president joe biden s esg efforts if biden doesn t listen we will follow with litigation but others need to take action this means that elections for state treasurer and governor are very important as these officials work closely with the pension board and others making state investment decisions they should not let such funds go to esg based woke companies i am hopeful that companies will return to their noble purpose of serving their customers and their shareholders but the fight is far from over elected officials must remain vigilant to counter the threat to liberty from wall street banks and the biden administration imposing esg policies on hoosiers this is a fight we can win and we must the country depends on it todd rokita is indiana s attorney general
could we have actually seen the bottom for equities rubner certainly sees signs of resilience not least of which is that for all the pain investors have endured this year they continue to hold on to their shares with the tiny equity outflows this year a long way from the investor capitulation that historically signals the end of a bear market that the rally on wall street was not derailed by the strong us employment data released on friday night also speaks to the renewed signs of resilience indeed the idea that bad news is good news that is strong economic data that supports further rounds of aggressive central bank rate rises is actually positive because it will bring on a recession that will lead the federal reserve to start loosening monetary policy again appears to be gaining some acceptance the shift away from cyclical stocks that will do well in an inflationary environment towards stocks that win when inflation is low or even falling speaks to this bank of america data shows material stocks on wall street recorded their biggest outflows ever last week while resources stocks sold off for three weeks and financials which also win when rates are rising have been sold off for 15 straight weeks beaten down tech stocks on the other hand have reported four straight weeks of inflows advertisement eyes on wednesday night of course the narrative that inflation has peaked and central banks could be cutting rates next calendar year will receive a big test this week when us inflation data is released on wednesday night the market knows the number will be big citi is tipping month on month headline inflation to run at 1 2 per cent which will put the annual rate around 8 9 per cent and set the stage for the fed to lift interest rates by 0 75 per cent at its july meeting that s probably priced in but beyond that investors are wrestling with the question of whether signs of cooling inflation in goods prices computer chips used cars commodity prices and shipping rates are all examples and cracks in economic resilience falling consumer confidence and manufacturing activity indices convince the fed that it can pause its rate rise cycle if so the mini rally of the last couple of weeks could gain a bit more momentum but this won t be an easy test to pass citi doubts whether a fed in full inflation fighting mode will get the compelling evidence it needs to suggest inflation is coming back under control or that its previous rate rises have caused major damage to a us economy that while running out of puff will remain in expansionary mode for the rest of this year advertisement citi expects july s super sized rate increase will be followed by 50 basis point increases in september and november and 25 basis point rises in january and march its forecast for the fed s terminal rate sitting at 4 per cent to 4 25 per cent is well above the 3 3 per cent bond markets are predicting bank of america s uber bear michael hartnett says the current rally could run for a few months but it ain t over til the fed lady sings bear markets end with a recession or an event that causes the fed to reverse policy we say the bear market is in summer hiatus and the big low has yet to be reached china and us earnings two other tests for the market s mini rally loom this week advertisement the next most important comes from china where a huge number of data points will be released including trade numbers credit data fiscal income and spending numbers and most importantly gdp growth on friday china s 5 5 per cent growth target for calendar 2022 is looking almost impossible amid reports of fresh covid 19 outbreaks friday s data is tipped to show economic growth of 1 per cent in the june quarter compared to a year ago but the big focus on friday will be on signs the economy started to rebound from lockdowns in june friday also brings a decision on china s official interest rate while most economists expect rates to remain on hold data at the weekend showed inflation rose 2 5 per cent month on month in june thanks to rising pork prices which has raised concerns that it will be harder for china to lower rates and stimulate the economy the third test for investors is the us earnings season that kicks off this week most in the market believe earnings forecasts look optimistic in the face of high inflation and a slowing global economy and earnings downgrades could spark a fresh wave of selling does that downgrade cycle start this week or does us economic resilience shine through there s an awful lot to play for
the biden administration is discussing the possible lifting of its ban on us sales of offensive weapons to saudi arabia but any final decision is expected to hinge on whether riyadh makes progress toward ending the war in neighboring yemen according to four people familiar with the matter senior saudi officials pressed their us counterparts to scrap a policy of selling only defensive arms to its top gulf partner in several meetings in riyadh and washington in recent months three of the sources said ahead of president joe biden s visit to the kingdom this week the internal us deliberations are informal and at an early stage with no decision imminent two sources said and a us official told reuters there were no discussions on offensive weapons underway with the saudis at this time but as biden prepares for a diplomatically sensitive trip he has signaled that he is looking to reset strained relations with saudi arabia at a time when he wants increased gulf oil supplies along with closer arab security ties with israel to counter iran advertisement at home any move to rescind restrictions on offensive weapons is sure to draw opposition in congress including from biden s fellow democrats and opposition republicans who have been vocal critics of saudi arabia congressional aides say saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman shakes hands with then us president donald trump 2019 credit saudi royal court reuters soon after taking office early last year biden adopted a tougher stance over saudi arabia s campaign against the iran aligned houthis in yemen which has inflicted heavy civilian casualties and riyadh s human rights record in particular the 2018 killing of washington post journalist and political opponent jamal khashoggi biden who as a presidential candidate denounced saudi arabia as a pariah declared in february 2021 a halt to us support for offensive operations in yemen including relevant arms sales saudi arabia the biggest us arms customer has chafed under those restrictions which froze the kind of weapons sales that previous us administrations had provided for decades biden s approach has softened since russia s invasion of ukraine in

ministry of agriculture and rural development mard the export value of such products to the eu market is also targeted to increase to 7 5 8 billion by 2030 the ministry has put in place many solutions to achieve these goals such as increasing the connection and participation among ministries sectors and localities it will focus on changing farmers awareness and habits in the production of farming

after the reversal of roe v wade the radical left kicked their histrionic blubbering into high gear all of a sudden the would be court packers became extremely concerned about the harms of judicial overreach leftists unabashedly hypocritical talking points belie their support for a civilization crippling culture of death one which has rendered abortion on demand as its holy sacrament advertisement most of the radical left s points are grotesque nonsense such as their obsession with the infinitesimal percentage of abortions compelled due to rape and incest and their concern about preventing unwanted babies when there is a shortage of babies available for adoption but they do make one key point republicans offer few policy solutions for government at federal state and local levels to help families thrive and prosper republican orthodoxy of the last four decades has been to support big government only when it helps massive corporations dc think tanks fueled by donations from the super wealthy call this free market economics but government intervention touches every aspect of the economy the stock market and the business elite have been well served by these policies but ordinary families have been crushed and this has led to well deserved enmity against the establishment wing of the republican party no better example of this sort of failed leadership within the gop came during the run off elections for u s senate in georgia president trump led the charge to provide relief directly to the people for covid 19 supporting as much as 2 000 per american citizen the government in a bipartisan manner had already given trillions to corporations and well connected firms throughout the pandemic now it was time for the people to get some help they desperately needed advertisement recommended trump pushed hard for the relief the republican senate candidates whose fate was hanging in the balance supported it and the overwhelming majority of the people needed this support there was only one problem senate majority leader mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader put his foot down and cost the gop two senate seats helping the american people was a line in the sand that mcconnell refused to cross subsidies handouts welfare special tax breaks or any sort of benefit for the megacorps who contribute to the senate leadership fund are fine in that respect mcconnell is a big government uber spending socialist when it comes to measures that directly aid the people mcconnell transforms into a fiscally conservative budget hawk mcconnell s performance throughout the georgia senate runoff debacle served as a sad caricature of how the republican party alienates voters and loses elections while the professional class of pundits blamed trump for refusing to falsely assuage voters legitimate concerns about unaddressed election integrity mcconnell blew the easy win by refusing to support a no brainer policy that helped families thankfully the nascent america first wing of the gop has a chance to close the door on that era of blunders once and for all my proposal crafted in the gallant example set by the great hungarian prime minister viktor orban would include at least five months of paid maternal leave a scheme of progressive child tax credits additional funding for and oversight of the foster care system the creation of vouchers to subsidize daycare for working families thousands of dollars in bonus payments to families that incentivize them to have more children and monthly child benefits of at least 500 to families in need the doubters will attack my proposal as they attacked orban s plan but his pro natalism policies are already achieving their intended results advertisement leftists trashed orban s pro family policies they want to see hungarian and european civilization decimated the american right has similarly criticized them because it demands more immigration and less national cohesion as a recipe to increase corporate profit margins however the policies are working and steadily reversing hungary s demographic collapse hungary saw its highest level of new births in over a decade in 2021 even as covid 19 posed major challenges that hurt the overall population rate hungary boosted its national birth rate to 1 59 per couple from 1 2 per couple putting the country on the trajectory to be above replacement level in the decades to come this is what we must emulate in the united states to rebut any conservative critics my policy proposal is far from profligate for example it would cost 18 billion per year to give a child bonus of 5 000 to families in contrast we give 2 billion yearly in sugar subsidies to wealthy corporations we dole out over 40 billion annually in foreign aid most of which goes into the pockets of government leaders who use the loot to fuel their own corrupt dealings all but a handful of america first republicans in congress voted in favor of giving 40 billion to ukraine for a proxy war that could lead to world war 3 because defense contractor lobbyists said it was a priority this money could easily be diverted to assist american families advertisement when crafting pro family policies it is of utmost importance to assure those full working families receive the help such policies must not give more money to single mothers who have become a cause du jour as society has disintegrated benefits should be primarily tied to wedlock status because evidence proves that children have the best chance of success when raised in a nuclear family of course democrats will cry racism and far left subversive groups like the aclu will argue that these policies are unconstitutional we must fight these organizations head on and put them in the unfamiliar role of opposing government support for families which will turn the tables on the media s familiar narrative this is the blueprint to use the end of roe v wade to promote natalism protect america s demographic integrity and enrich the family structure that the left wishes to destroy god is smiling down on our nation for reversing the unconstitutional judicial mandate that enabled the murder of untold millions of unborn americans but it will take far more than one supreme court decision to undo nearly a century of moral decay moving toward a workable nationalism means embracing pro family policy and rejecting the reviled gop dogmas of the past the false idol of free markets must be discarded in the ash heap of history for the republican party to save america

analyst dale gillham gives his insight into what to expect from the australian stock market the australian stock market was up strongly at the start of the week rising over 1 but in the following three days it did not follow suit for the australian stock market to have any chance of being bullish in the coming weeks prices needed to hold and preferably trade higher on friday that said regardless of where the market closed on friday the asx 200 recovered all of thursday s losses with a 1 9 rebound to close at 7 075 1 but it was not enough to prevent it finishing in the red for a fourth week in a row it is still too early to tell if the all ordinaries index has stopped falling what is alarming is that retail investors are ignoring the warning signs and buying stocks hoping and i dare say praying for them to rise as there is movement in many speculative stocks as these investors chase short term returns we are also seeing movement in technology as well as other stocks that have been hard hit by the downturn as investors continue to speculate as we know anything can happen but all too often these investors get burnt while it is possible they are right and the market has bottomed the all ordinaries index is far from convincing which is why it is far better to err on the side of caution given this i am still recommending that investors sit tight and get ready for the next opportunity to buy that will come in the not too distant future us markets are there opportunities global equities boutique manager bell asset management bam believes the drawdown in the united states over the last six months will lead to a favourable environment with the emergence of good buying opportunities bam portfolio manager adrian martuccio said while most us companies were more

to come down this is likely to take another couple of quarters stock prices have factored a lot of this in but it will be hard for companies to rally convincingly in the face of downgrades companies in our portfolios such as jack henry honeywell nyse hon icon and ritchie brothers continue to be optimistic as they have robust balance sheets sustainable franchises and are well positioned to weather a high inflationary environment martuccio said as with all analysts martuccio says inflation will remain a key issue for some time input cost inflation only started in march and april of this year so we believe the full margin effect is unlikely to be seen until closer to the end of this year he noted while the nasdaq had a good week last week tech stocks will still be taken with a cautious approach funding is definitely drying up in the software and biotech space which has flowed through to valuations of listed companies but private companies certainly still have high expectations it s likely this will reduce once these companies do another funding round or when a venture capitalist wants to exit martuccio said he hinted that mergers and acquisitions will increase off the back of falling listed prices and the private market flagging we re likely to see an increase in m as but it will really have to be the right technologies the equation of buy versus build versus time to market will ring true job losses at tech start ups have also accelerated as they try to stop bleeding cash this has resulted in larger more established tech companies becoming more attractive to key talent with all this in mind what can we expect post pandemic pandemic pull forward demand remains the biggest uncertainty especially if the consumer environment is more challenging this doesn t just apply to consumer companies but software as well he said before adding the company pivot is still ongoing with businesses looking to broaden their product reach and addressable markets but it s unlikely to replicate previous growth a risk for big business as well when we look at companies like box and zoom they re now in a position where they have to really focus on corporate customers because the consumer market has faded rapidly he said
the economics profession has long had a vigorous academic argument over natural interest rates what would rates be if we could somehow remove all the subjective actors central banks commercial lenders government agencies that conspire to set them what would nature do if we left it alone it s an academic argument because in the real world we can t do the kind of experiments that would produce a definitive answer guesses are all over the board history however suggests that rates below 2 are neither natural nor sustainable worse bad things happen when they get that low this isn t a new revelation people noticed centuries ago how low interest rates led to speculative bubbles that always ended badly we are at the end stage of one such bubble right now some expect a soft landing i hope they re right but it would be the first time bagehot and bull before reading chancellor you need a little setup much of this passage refers to walter bagehot a 19th century british journalist and editor of the economist his surname incidentally is pronounced badge it one of those delightful english quirks bagehot lived in interesting economic times observing the bank of england develop into what we now know as modern central banking he believed central banks were necessary as lenders of last resort but should lend only to solvent institutions against sound collateral and at high interest rates that advice known today as bagehot s dictum is now widely ignored you ll also see references to john bull this was not an actual person but a colloquialism used to describe everyday englishmen a bit like when modern commentators talk about joe sixpack john bull as used here is an investor whom bagehot said cannot stand two percent earning such a low return was simply unacceptable if that s all he could earn from a bank deposit or government bonds john bull and others far outside england would look elsewhere chancellor describes how this quest for higher returns helped generate some now infamous investment crazes the tulip bubble the south sea bubble and others as you read i think you ll recognize similarities to our own time with years of low rates often well below that 2 level john bull couldn t stand pushing investors to take excessive risk in search of more and higher returns now on with the quote impossible tulips and other manias excerpt from the price of time by edward chancellor as a banker and financial journalist bagehot observed that outbreaks of financial recklessness did not occur at random rather they tended to appear at times when money was easy and interest rates low he expressed this insight in his own inimitable fashion john bull can stand many things but he cannot stand two per cent when interest rates fell to such a low level investors reacted to the loss of income by taking greater risks in modern language they engage in yield chasing john bull that personification of english common sense made his first appearance in bagehot s writings in an article for the inquirer published on 31 july 1852 john bull says someone can stand a great deal but he cannot stand two per cent here the moral obligation arises people won t take 2 per cent they won t bear a loss of income instead of that dreadful event they invest their careful savings in something impossible a canal to kamchatka a railway to watchet a plan for animating the dead sea a corporation for shipping skates to the torrid zone a century or two ago the dutch burgomasters of all people in the world invented the most imaginative occupation they speculated in impossible tulips bagehot s claim that 2 per cent interest represented the tipping point into financial folly was borrowed from john fullarton a former east india company doctor turned banker in his 1844 book on the regulation of currencies fullarton observed that at times of low interest everything in the nature of value puts on an aspect of bloated magnitude and every article becomes an object of speculation long periods of easy money wrote fullarton engender a wild spirit of speculation and adventure fullarton noted that financial euphoria occurred after a period of falling interest rates from the bubble year downwards i question much if an instance could be shown of any great or concurrent speculative movement on the part of capitalists which had not been preceded by a marked decline of the current rate of interest bagehot intuitively understood how people were habituated to a certain return on their investments and how when the accustomed income was not available investors were inclined to take more risk the fact is that the owners of savings not finding in adequate quantities their usual kind of investments rush into anything that promises speciously in the saturday review august 1856 he elaborated on this theme henever money becomes very cheap experience teaches us to expect that it will be misspent john bull as it has been wisely observed can stand a good deal but he cannot stand two per cent the particular form of mania differs in various years but when the common and tried employments of money yield but a low profit recourse will be had to new and untried ones some of which will be unprofitable and a few of which will be absurd it is only at the outset of such manias that warning is of the least use when they attain a certain growth advice is thrown away everybody is seen speculating and what everyone does must be judicious foolish person no ii imitates foolish person no i bagehot himself never made that connection between john law s mississippi bubble and the 2 per cent interest rate that he introduced into france in 1719 nevertheless when we consider the speculative episodes he mentions the link with easy money is soon apparent for instance bagehot was correct to point out that money was plenty in the dutch republic of the mid 1630s when the burgomasters started speculating in impossible tulips earlier in the decade holland experienced large capital inflows from foreigners who found the notes of the bank of amsterdam founded in 1609 most convenient for trade the bank s balance sheet increased by nearly two thirds between 1633 and 1638 dutch interest rates fell from around 8 per cent at the beginning of the century to around half that level by the mid century this was the age when modern easy money was discovered according to sidney homer and richard sylla the search for yield turns out to be as old as capitalism itself later in the century joseph de la vega in his book confusion de confusiones the earliest account of stock market activity reported that very day the revenue from investments at fixed interest becomes less inasmuch as it is difficult to find ways of investing money the rate of interest on ordinary loans amounts to only 2½ per cent therefore even the wealthiest men are forced to buy stocks and there are people who do not sell them when the prices have fallen in order to avoid a loss but they do not sell at rising prices either because they do not know a more secure investment for their capital bagehot s claim that speculation is spurred by low interest rates is confirmed by the second episode that he mentions relisted in chronological order namely a plan for animating the dead sea no such plan ever existed of course bagehot is alluding to the bubble companies that appeared during the south sea bubble of 1720 in his book lombard street he lists both genuine promotions for example insurance of horses and cattle and for improving of malt liquors and several spoofs for example for importing a large number of jack asses from spain for a wheel of perpetual motion and most famously for an undertaking which shall in due time be revealed britain s south sea bubble of 1720 was a shoddy imitation of the mississippi scheme like john law the company s directors sought to lower the cost of government debt then largely consisting of expensive annuities by converting the debt into shares as with law s ill fated project the bubble occurred at a time of easy money the yield on the country s long term government debt fell from 8 per cent in 1710 to around 4 per cent in the early 1720s as in france the decline in interest rates encouraged government creditors to exchange their annuities for south sea shares whose price soared nearly tenfold during the first half of 1720 by the end of that year however the share price had collapsed and nearly all the bubble companies were swept away there never was a canal to kamchatka any more than there was a plan for animating the dead sea a canal construction mania however did take place in england in the early 1790s canals were capital intensive projects that took years to complete and even longer to pay back such long dated investments are inevitably sensitive to changes in the discount rate it is no surprise therefore to discover that canal projecting was most intense when interest rates reached a low point the economist and statistician thomas tooke considered the fall in interest rates which dipped below 3 per cent in the 1790s as both a cause and an effect of the great extension of the country bank system which about that time took place the canal mania ended with a banking crisis in 1793 after war broke out with revolutionary france in february 1797 a small french force landed near fishgard in pembrokeshire wales and immediately surrendered to british troops the main consequence of this invasion of british soil was to trigger a financial panic followed by an order in council permitting the bank of england to suspend gold payments the country s first experience of a pure paper currency was accompanied by another bout of easy money throughout the napoleonic wars the bank s lending rate remained at 5 per cent the maximum level permitted by law the banker henry thornton considered the rate of interest in the early 1800s to be unnaturally low the real post inflation yield on consols turned negative for the first time between 1800 and 1807 the amount of commercial paper discounted by the bank of england more than doubled the commercial world erupted in an almost universal excitement hundreds of banks were established and dozens of stock jobbing speculations came to the market including seven breweries five wine companies four distilleries several insurance companies and miscellaneous trading companies commodities were caught up in the whirlwind shares in the bank of england and the east india company together with consols experienced a sharp speculative advance shut out of the european market by napoleon s continental blockade english merchants turned with an eager eye towards the south american trade according to a contemporary account he exportations consequent on the first opening of the trade to buenos ayres brazil and the caraccas were most extraordinary speculation was then carried beyond the boundaries within which even gambling is usually confined and was pushed to an extent and into channels that could hardly have been deemed practicable we are informed by mr mawe an intelligent traveller resident at rio janeiro at the period in question that more manchester goods were sent out in the course of a few weeks than had been consumed in the twenty years preceding elegant services of cut glass and china were offered to persons whose most splendid drinking vessels consisted of a horn or the shell of a cocoa nut and some speculators actually went so far as to send out skates to rio janeiro the story that ice skates had been shipped south of the equator entered city legend when bagehot alluded to this episode nearly half a century later his readers would have understood the reference the speculative frenzy subsided in the summer of 1810 after which around a third of the country banks failed lord liverpool later reflected on these events in a speech to the house of lords the tendency of an inconvertible paper money is to create fictitious wealth bubbles which by their bursting produce inconvenience the british railway mania of the 1840s took place while the young bagehot was reading mathematics at university college london the whole nation was transfixed by the potential of rail travel and an index of british railway shares more than doubled between 1840 and 1845 among the speculators was the journalist charles mackay an acquaintance of charles dickens and author of extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds the first popular account of early speculative manias published in 1841 the book s warnings about the dangers of speculation were lost not only on the british public but also on mackay himself promoters planned the construction of around 4 500 miles of rail track a greater mileage than britain s existing network of toll roads by october 1845 around 1 200 railways were being promoted at a projected cost of 560 million a sum exceeding the country s national income railways were built or at least proposed to faraway places that could never repay the cost of investment as for a railway to watchet a seaport in somerset not far from bagehot s home town of langport in 1845 there were in fact three different plans on the drawing board the railway mania coincided with yet another period of easy money discount rates on bills of exchange had fallen below 3 per cent by mid 1842 and touched 2 per cent in the following year the bank of england had started to lend at longer maturities and against a broader range of collateral and even dabbled in railway debentures thereby providing a high sanction and an effective stimulus to the stock market boom the times reported on 28 april 1842 that he ill effects of the bank of england lowering the rate of discount to 4 per cent are now universally felt and acknowledged money is so very abundant that dealers in it have literally no employment for it apart from the public securities and shares which in some branches of business would not be a fitting employment of capital by 1844 bank rate was at 2 per cent at which point the banker fullarton warned that such a low rate typically excites speculative spirits the economist founded and edited by james wilson also blamed the mania on easy money there is no doubt that the secondary speculation and the actual railway building were very largely fostered if not literally created by the ease with which accommodation could be obtained at the bank and in lombard street bagehot wilson s future son in law agreed writing several years later some no doubt were required but money was abundant in consequence every place was to have a railway every railway was to pay twenty per cent as safe as the bank of england scrip in schemes as visionary as the most imaginative tulip were daily bought and sold there was no toleration for secure gain for quiet pursuits for ordinary industry people could not stand two per cent end of chancellor excerpt more risk please john here again i think chancellor s core point is spot on low interest rates drive investors into riskier assets than most are prepared to handle but what is low bagehot drew the line at 2 but that was in the context of a specific time and place inflation is a key variable nowadays a 2 real return isn t so bad a patient investor who starts young and saves diligently can build a nice nest egg at that rate but even that has been unattainable for a long time unless one is willing to take substantial risks if taking more risk is the only way to make a real return on your money then most investors will take more risk we see it today in stocks junk bonds real estate private equity venture capital and commodities we have invented entire new asset classes like crypto for the sole purpose of helping people take more risks in search of higher returns none of this is new it s happened many times before going back centuries and never ended well this time is unlikely to be different we will see in future letters how greenspan bernanke yellen and now powell all distorted the markets and created bubbles as did the ecb and other major central banks zero interest rate policies inspired wild speculative bubbles as investors reached for yield dallas puerto rico family and new york i write the end of this letter from an admirals club in dallas before the long 5 hour flight back to puerto rico tomorrow night my twins along with their husbands and more importantly three of my granddaughters show up for a few days where i am sure we will get some water park time this is going to be so much fun i plan to visit nyc july 17 and leave the next thursday lots of meeting and dinners and good time with friends then hopefully some time in cleveland for my long delayed checkup my body is telling me i need it we are making progress on putting together an oil and gas drilling fund with jay young and his team it will be a new way to give investors the full benefit of drilling actually getting a part of the field as the drilling increases its value and with that i will hit the send button have a great week and spend some time with family and friends and follow me on twitter for some fun your really thinking about how this experiment with low rates will end analyst john mauldin
