a billionaire s tax plan here s why it could actually be a way for dems to target your retirement account a so called billionaire s tax a proposal to tax unrealized capital gains on people with 1 billion in assets is circulating in congress while not all democrats support the idea sen joe manchin d wv indicates he could support new ways to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share it s all about funding president biden s 2 trillion social spending plan i m open to any type of thing that makes people pay that s not paying now the moderate democrat senator said people that don t report income like you and i do earned income there has to be a way for them to pay their fair share senate finance committee chairman ron wyden d or is writing up the new billionaire income tax with input from the u s treasury department and the white house according to the sovereign wealth fund institute swfi a global corporation analyzing public asset owners such as sovereign wealth funds and other long term governmental investors under wyden s emerging plan the billionaires tax would hit the wealthiest of americans fewer than 1 000 people it would require those with assets of more than 1 billion or three years consecutive income of 100 million to pay taxes on the gains of stocks and other tradable assets rather than waiting until holdings are sold senate republican leader mitch mcconnell called the billionaire s tax a hare brained scheme and warned of revenue drying up during downturns some republicans indicated such a tax plan could be challenged in court key democrats are also raising concerns about such a tax saying the idea of simply undoing the 2017 tax cuts by hiking top rates was more straightforward and transparent a tax just for billionaires or could it be something else but would the so called billionaire tax just apply to billionaires one report indicates it would just be the starting point and your ira could be the next democrat target as the party looks for a way to fund biden s massive social spending and climate change plan stephen green a columnist for pj media warns biden s real objective by floating the idea of billionaire s tax is your retirement savings and he s not the only one it s not a wealth tax but a tax on unrealized capital gains of exceptionally wealthy individuals u s treasury secretary janet yellen told cnn on sunday green explained yellen s remarks writing that s like saying you have a four legged pet that eats kibble barks fetches and looks exactly like a golden retriever but it isn t a dog yellen told host jake tapper i think what s under consideration is a proposal that senator wyden and the senate finance committee have been looking at that would impose a tax on unrealized capital gains on liquid assets held by extremely wealthy individuals billionaires i wouldn t call that a wealth tax it s a wealth tax green responded in his article worse it s a tax on the investments and productivity gains that make the entire country richer the pj media columnist then uses himself as a pretend example of a business owner whose company went public and virtually overnight owns shares worth a billion dollars in his example green pretends that some wise investors bought a few shares of his ipo and stashed them in their ira i don t actually have a billion dollars i just have these shares that the stock market values at a billion dollars but according to yellen wealth tax proponent elizabeth warren d ma and presidentish joe biden i made a billion dollars yesterday and being a naughty rich person i must pay taxes on that money i don t actually have he writes so what do i do i m forced to sell off enough shares in my own company to pay the tax bill green explains what does that do to you mr or mrs smart investor he asks my big sell off reduces the value of your shares and your retirement account in essence you re paying the billionaire income tax even though you aren t a billionaire and haven t made any income every year around tax day there would be a big sell off green forecasts so not only is yellen lying when she says it isn t a wealth tax she s lying when she says it will fall only on the extremely wealthy he wrote conservative commentator ben shapiro points out that taxes like this one end up morphing to affect the entire country he noted in a tweet tuesday the original 1913 income tax was 1 for people with incomes above 3 000 about 80 000 today and 6 on 500 000 or more 13 million about 3 of the population was taxed just keep that in mind when democrats lie and say the wealth tax will remain targeted at just the top the original 1913 income tax was 1 for people with incomes above 3 000 about 80 000 today and 6 on 500 000 or more 13 million about 3 of the population was taxed just keep that in mind when democrats lie and say the wealth tax will remain targeted at just the top ben shapiro benshapiro october 25 2021 green also noted in his article the income tax was sold by early 20th century progressives as a way to sock it to the rich but progressives made sure it become a way to sock it to everybody you can bet your bottom dollar if congress doesn t confiscate that too that today s billionaire income tax is tomorrow s tax your middle class retirement accounts before you even retire he concluded please sign up for cbn newsletters and download the cbn news

is a clinical stage biotechnology company its lead therapeutic product candidate is called simufilam formerly pti 125 developed as a treatment for alzheimer s disease ad simufilam purportedly targets an altered form of a protein called filamin a flna in the alzheimer s brain and reverts it to its native healthy conformation thereby countering the downstream toxic effects of altered flna on august 24 2021 after the market closed reports emerged about a citizen petition submitted to the u s food and drug administration fda concerning the accuracy and ntegrity of clinical data for simufilam the petition requested that the fda halt cassava s clinical trials pending a thorough audit of the publications and data relied upon by the company among other things the petition stated that the etailed analysis of the western blots shows a series of anomalies that are suggestive of systematic data manipulation and misrepresentation it also stated that the methodology for studies about simufilam s effects in experiments conducted on postmortem human brain tissue defies logic and the data presented again have hallmarks of manipulation the petition further stated that after initial analyses of phase 2b trials found that simufilam was ineffective in improving the primary biomarkers endpoint cassava had these samples analyzed again and this time reported that simufilam rapidly and robustly improved a wide array of biomarkers and the reanalysis shows signs of data anomalies or manipulation on august 25 2021 before the market opened cassava issued a response to the petition claiming that

test results or prepared the data charts for the biomarker analysis for patients treated with simufilam 5 that as a result of the foregoing there was a reasonable likelihood that cassava would face

mort sahl who revolutionized stand up comedy in the mid 1950s with his insightful political and social satire has died at his home in mill valley calif at 94 sahl whose on and off stage preoccupation with a conspiracy theory on the assassination of president john f kennedy slowed his career in the late 1960s died tuesday a family friend overseeing his affairs told the new york times advertisement at a time when brash comics in suits and tuxedos typically were telling jokes about their wives and mothers in law sahl shattered the stand up stereotype beginning at the hungry i a small brick walled basement club in san francisco s north beach district wearing a v neck sweater and an open collared shirt and clutching a rolled up newspaper the dark haired usc graduate with hooded eyes and a wolfish grin fearlessly zeroed in on cold war era targets such as president eisenhower sen joseph mccarthy and the notorious house un american activities committee his casual conversational style would influence a generation of comedians from lenny bruce to dave chappelle advertisement sahl who frequently punctuated his punch lines with a dry staccato laugh spoke in a language that a writer for the new yorker magazine in 1957 described as a unique cross between a philosophy paper and the argot of modern jazz indeed sahl might leaven his monologues with allusions to the oedipus complex or references to monotheism and then preface a new target by saying dig this or more often onward a 1960 new yorker profile of sahl enumerated the persons places objects institutions and ideas he disparaged during a 45 minute monologue beginning with charles de gaulle and followed by eisenhower segregation comedian shelley berman trade unions the film marty jazz new york city berkeley playwright samuel beckett newspapers coffeehouses sandals j d salinger soiled raincoats and 62 other subjects advertisement i don t tell jokes i give little lectures sahl would tell his audiences he d generally conclude his shows by asking are there any groups i haven t offended he was a force of nature a whirlwind whose ideas defined him behind each joke lurked a sharply etched cynical worldview gerald nachman wrote in his 2003 book seriously funny the rebel comedians of the 1950s and 1960s before sahl it was heretical even career suicide for a comedian to discuss politics much less to cut up a sitting president onstage wrote nachman while will rogers and bob hope were comfortable non offensive establishment figures sahl was straight grenade fire advertisement when rogers or hope did political material their jokes weren t meant to wound or to make anyone squirm sahl s were and did nachman said moving on from the hungry i to clubs such as mister kelly s in chicago basin street east in new york and the crescendo in los angeles as well as showrooms in las vegas and miami sahl was in the vanguard of a new generation of comedians he was like charlie parker in jazz said woody allen an early fan there was a need for a revolution everybody was ready for the revolution he totally restructured comedy advertisement sahl was known to devour numerous newspapers and magazines every day to keep his topical act up to date as for his ideological leanings sahl told the associated press in 2007 that he remained what he always was an independent populist radical during his heyday in the 1950s and early 60s sahl recorded several pioneering live stand up comedy albums starred on broadway in a short lived revue the next president and played small roles in several movies and television shows a jazz connoisseur whose friends included stan kenton dave brubeck and paul desmond sahl served as co emcee of the first monterey jazz festival with dizzy gillespie in 1958 and was master of ceremonies of the inaugural playboy jazz festival in chicago in 1959 advertisement he even donned a tuxedo and co hosted the 1959 academy awards show along with laurence olivier jerry lewis david niven tony randall and hope who referred to sahl as the favorite comedian of nuclear physicists everywhere sahl s stock as a political satirist was so high that joseph p kennedy asked him to write jokes for his son s 1960 presidential run which sahl agreed to do while stressing that as a rule he did not endorse candidates indeed the bipartisan sahl joked on television during the race that the senior kennedy had told his son john i m putting you on an allowance you re not allowed one more cent than you need to buy a landslide advertisement sahl didn t waste time targeting the new kennedy white house but joe kennedy viewed the comedian s continued potshots at his son as disloyalty and according to sahl the kennedy patriarch applied pressure to have him silenced and when he didn t sahl wrote in heartland his 1976 memoir the work began to dry up but things grew worse for sahl s career after john f kennedy s assassination in 1963 in 1966 while hosting a talk show on kttv channel 11 in los angeles sahl heard a news report that new orleans dist atty jim garrison claimed to have discovered evidence that kennedy s assassination was the result of a conspiracy contrary to the warren commission s conclusion that lee harvey oswald was the lone assassin sent to new orleans to interview garrison sahl wound up volunteering to help him in his investigation off and on over the next few years sahl worked for free as a deputized member of garrison s assassination investigative team advertisement his association with the controversial group so damaged sahl s reputation that it cost him tv recording and club jobs his gross income he later wrote went from up to 1 million a year to 13 000 when he did perform sahl often generated laughs by reading excerpts of what he considered the more ludicrous aspects of the warren commission report and sometimes brought all 26 volumes of the report onstage with him i had them on the stage so people could see the physical size of the deception he told the rocky mountain news in 2001 a lot of people did not want to hear it but i thought it was the end of the country but you know this country never ends it s like a bad television show that they keep picking up for the next season advertisement the warren commission report nachman wrote in his book so traumatized him that he never recovered his footing and still struggles against an ancient stigma that he s a head case but the nixon administration and ensuing watergate scandal provided a new trove of material and helped turn the tide for sahl when i made fun of eisenhower the college audiences thought that i was making chaos out of order he wrote in his memoir twenty years later the college audiences are asking me to bring order to chaos tell me what it means man advertisement sahl had a stint writing screenplays and contributing to various films and continued to offer his caustic and satiric insights on america in 1987 he returned to broadway for a few weeks in 1987 with a one man show mort sahl on broadway late in life he taught a class in critical thinking at claremont mckenna college an only child born to an american father and a canadian mother sahl was born may 11 1927 in montreal after a series of moves the family settled in los angeles when sahl was 7 and his father became an administrator for the fbi a member of the rotc while a student at belmont high school during world war ii the 15 year old sahl lied about his age and joined the army a patriotic move that ended two weeks later when his mother tracked him down at ft macarthur in san pedro advertisement after graduating from high school sahl enlisted in the army air forces and served with the 93rd air depot group in anchorage where he edited the post newspaper and reportedly spent 83 consecutive days on kp duty for publishing insubordinate comments about his commanding officer a few months under the heel of authority sahl said of his time in the military killed it for me after his discharge in 1947 sahl attended compton college on the gi bill and then transferred to usc he earned a bachelor s degree in public administration in 1950 and was working on a graduate degree when he dropped out advertisement over the next few years he made a number of stabs at show business he and a friend rented a theater where sahl wrote and staged experimental one act plays he also made his first brief foray into stand up comedy in strip clubs under the unlikely name cal southern i did all the stuff other people were doing he recalled in 1989 i got a tie and a coat and i talked about the movies and did imitations of movie stars i didn t dare to talk about what was really on my mind that took a while that takes some trust while working as a used car salesman and a messenger he wrote an unpublished novel and several short stories he also attempted to sell material to other comedians who told him his offerings weren t commercial enough advertisement after his girlfriend sue babior left to attend uc berkeley sahl headed north he and babior married in 1955 and divorced two and a half years later but not before she suggested that he audition at the hungry i the small club featured only singers and musicians at the time but owner enrico banducci agreed to give sahl a shot in late december 1953 although he received the requisite laughs having filled the club with his berkeley friends on his opening night sahl faced a far less accepting crowd the next night the audience booed and yelled and pelted him with peanuts and pennies advertisement but banducci let sahl continue and within a few months the outspoken comic was generating standing room only crowds through the years sahl s brand of humor remained unchanged when george w bush became president sahl pushed eisenhower kennedy and nixon aside and zeroed in on a new target he s born again you know sahl told a crowd in 2007 referring to the president newfound religious fervor which would raise the inevitable question if you were given the unusual opportunity to be born again why would you come back as george bush advertisement sahl was married and divorced three times his only child mort jr died from a drug overdose when he was 19 in 1996

when the covid 19 pandemic hit leo friedman pivoted his corporate gifting company ipromo to help provide his clients with needed products like masks and gloves now that many of those clients have their employees returning to offices companies want to provide them with rapid tests to protect against in office transmission friedman has been trying to fill those rapid test orders but he can t meet demand when he does find a new batch of product prices are inflated because they re being resold most of the time you go on amazon and search binaxnow and there s nothing there friedman told medpage today when there is supply they get bought up by bots and end up being resold for several weeks now rapid tests have been in short supply for several reasons there s new demand from employers returning to in office work at the same time manufacturers bet against the need for testing as cases took a nosedive last spring abbott notably destroyed several batches of its rapid tests over the summer then there are concerns about the fda authorization process being too strict asking manufacturers to meet what some consider an unnecessarily high bar before being allowed on the market experts are saying that the tests can provide a helpful means of controlling spread especially in offices schools long term care facilities prisons and other crowded settings the white house seems to recognize that value as it has recently pumped billions into several initiatives aimed at bolstering rapid testing market analysts have said it will likely be weeks to months before supply can finally catch up with demand and that s worrisome as the cooler weather is already bringing more people indoors the marketplace currently fda has authorized eight over the counter rapid antigen at home tests all are at various stages and levels of production and distribution binaxnow is the market leader with 75 of the market share abbott ceo robert ford said during the company s latest earnings report call ford noted that the company had 90 of market share before dropping to 60 in september which fell just because of supply apparently acknowledging the summer purge abbott recently re opened an illinois manufacturing plant it had shuttered when it bet that demand for rapid testing would fall according to reuters ford said during the earnings call that the company can now make more than 100 million tests per month but still a far cry from what a nation of 330 million people could use while initially governments were its best clients for rapid tests ford pointed out that abbott has now seen a rush of requests from companies and employers in the beginning of the pandemic most of our sales were focused to governments whether international governments federal government here in the u s state governments also and that continues to be pretty strong he said but what we ve seen now grow pretty significantly and i think it s aligned to the screening pieces the private side of the market whether it s otc cash pay whether it s a lot of companies we ve seen a lot of companies in the last couple of months here signed contracts with us to ensure that they ve got rapid testing to be able to give to their employees similarly quidel ceo doug bryant told reuters employer demand has gone crazy we won t be able to meet all the requests that we re having while the supply side struggles to catch up with demand some experts have also raised concerns that fda s regulation of rapid tests may be too stringent in an op ed for stat daniel oran ma of the digital medicine group at scripps research translational institute in la jolla california argued that fda shouldn t classify rapid tests as medical devices instead they should be considered public health screening tools and evaluated on their ability to identify and isolate infectious individuals on a timely basis tinglong dai phd of johns hopkins carey business school in baltimore agreed that fda has been conservative and slow moving in terms of approving rapid tests generally he said rapid tests have to prove their accuracy by being tested against gold standard pcr testing but that s not necessarily the right comparison for tests that aim to pick up the most infectious cases that are most likely to spread pcr on the other hand may turn up positive even when an individual is no longer infectious dai noted that the european union has authorized more than 100 different rapid tests which has helped make them nearly ubiquitous there and allowed them to play a key role in helping to stop the spread of the virus what happened to 5 tests several times in the last week this reporter tried to purchase an abbott binaxnow on amazon in most instances there were none available finally on tuesday morning a positive result a binaxnow was available for 14 the kit which includes two tests was placed into the virtual cart ordered and is supposed to be delivered between october 28 and november 4 a few hours later however no more of the abbott tests were available on amazon in its place a rapid antigen test called on go made by intrivo diagnostics was served up for 34 99 that pricing is more in line with ipromo s pricing which ranges from 26 to 35 for a single box with two tests the result of having to buy from middle men friedman said the tests are supposed to be available at large retailers like cvs and walgreens but they have also been reported to be in short supply in these locations while the binaxnow was on sale at walmart com for 14 it was out of stock it was however available online at both cvs and walgreens but for 23 99 dai noted that these prices are so much higher than what public health experts had initially hoped for originally we thought these tests could cost 5 each we had a lot of hope for that dai told medpage today at cvs and walgreens they cost more than 20 apiece that s crazy dai who reviewed the abbott earnings call lamented its focus on revenue and profit around testing i find it bizarre that there s very little concern for public health kristina fiore leads medpage s enterprise investigative reporting team she s been a medical journalist for more than a decade and her work

is there any group here i haven t offended the political climate of the 1950s should have been ripe for comedy satire president eisenhower the cold war the korean war the beginning of the atomic age the space race these were all perfect comedic targets but then there was also mccarthyism the anti communist pursuit of political dissent which spread rapidly to include anything at all that could be construed as anti american so the comedy of the time established itself as good clean wholesome fun it was the golden age of televised humour which included jack benny lucille ball and the colgate comedy hour live stand ups were kooky knockabout clowns like lewis martin and abbott costello or nightclub comics with one liners about their dumb wives such as henny youngman buddy hackett joey bishop and shecky green nobody rocked the boat it didn t seem the thing to do then on christmas eve 1953 a young comedian gave a performance that was to break the mould forever standing on the folk music stage of the hungry i in san francisco was a young man dressed not in dinner jacket and black tie the comedian s uniform but in a cardigan preppy shirt chinos and loafers for this groundbreaker it was not what you wore that mattered it was what you said maybe the russians will steal our secrets then they ll be three years behind nobody could have been further from the stock comic than mort sahl his act contained no shtick catchphrases or wacky personae he simply played himself a performance characterised by a distinctive delivery that was hip blunt and relaxed shelley berman said at the time comedians told jokes good one line strong jokes with a set up and a slam good punchline he wasn t doing that he was making commentary on our lives on our social lives and on our political thinking making fun of us in some way or showing us our silliness and the lies we were telling since sahl s standpoint has always been so consistently american his parents being native new yorkers it is surprising to discover that he was actually born in montreal canada even at an early age sahl showed a theatrical bent and was encouraged by his mother while his father showed complete contempt for showbusiness harry sahl was a failed playwright and attempted to share his bitterness with his son it s all a fix they don t want anything good was regularly heard in the house the sahl family moved to southern california when mort was seven and the west coast way suited the boy he would hang around local radio stations and rescue discarded scripts from bins re enacting them at home his mother claimed that by the age of ten sahl spoke like a man of thirty he was a patriotic teenager during the second world war and became an amateur marksman with a rifle his father who was now working for the fbi tried to get sahl into west point military academy but instead he was drafted into the 93rd air depot in anchorage alaska it was this posting that caused the birth of the maverick we know service life did not suit sahl at all he grew a beard and long hair refused to wear his uniform and created a garrison newspaper called poop from the group after an edition covering alleged military pay offs he won himself an eighty three day kitchen patrol sentence nearly three years later he was discharged from the army still a private but an emphatic non conformist in 1950 sahl graduated from the university of southern california where he received a bachelor of science degree he then joined a masters program in traffic engineering but did not complete the course he felt that college life was conformity city and preferred to use the time in other ways such as going to all night jazz joints and writing one act plays these were performed with friends in a rented theatre space they called theatre x sahl also tried breaking into the los angeles comedy club scene as an impressionist under the name cal southern but he hated the act even more than the audience did sahl kept testing out his comedy legs wherever he could from coffee shops on university campuses to performing for free between dancers at la strip clubs he was trying to find his voice and style but by his own admission was ignored by managers by the press by everybody while in la he met sue barbior a leftist atheist and jazz lover whose views pretty much ticked all the boxes for sahl he followed her to berkeley where she enrolled into the university of california while sahl hung out with the students debating politics art literature and music it was barbior who suggested sahl tried a spot at the hungry i the owner enrico banducci was known to enjoy taking a gamble on something different but had yet to hire a comic barbior commented to sahl if they understand you you re home free and if they don t they ll pretend it s whimsical humour when sahl went to meet the less than enthusiastic banducci he took along his friend larry tucker to act as his manager playing on the owner s sympathy tucker told him that sahl had just been discharged from the veterans hospital with malnutrition and a ruptured appendix banducci was won over and offered sahl 75 to perform unaware that he d happily have worked for free when he started performing at the hungry i sahl was clearly uncomfortable in suit and tie and the conventionality it represented one night he turned up in denim jeans sweater and button down shirt more freshman then funny man it worked he was more relaxed as was the audience he started to find his stage style as well influenced more by the jazz world and his favourite musician stan kenton than by anyone in the comedy world this showed in his delivery riffing on ideas spontaneously leaving stories and jokes unfinished while branching off onto new ones sahl then added a daily newspaper to his act much more than just a prop it was borne out of necessity being used to note down his set list and key lines eventually the newspaper became a useful authority that he would turn to several times during the performance telling disbelieving audiences that every subject he joked about had to be true because here were the words right in front of him in print this little bohemian stage with 85 chairs facing it was now set to change the face of comedy i m not so much interested in politics as i am in overthrowing the government within a few months sahl was not just winning small local audiences a whole new wave of comics were being captivated by his unique performance style with its free association stream of consciousness one word punchlines and ad libs which could meander but never detracted from a structured routine woody allen said of sahl s comedy at the time everybody was ready for the revolution but some guy had to come and be great mort was the one he changed the rhythm of jokes he had different content but the revolution was in the way he laid down jokes with such guile he totally restructured comedy sahl didn t just inspire allen a body of talent was waiting to be influenced by his comedy dick gregory lily tomlin george carlin richard pryor the smothers brothers and of course lenny bruce without a doubt sahl originated many of the techniques that bruce later used but while bruce was the patient exposing the audience to his problems sahl was the therapist telling the audience their own the two comics once shared the interlude club sahl played the big room upstairs while bruce worked a smaller crowd in the basement one night bruce exhorted his audience to shout lynch mort sahl tthe chanting was loud enough to be heard by sahl s audience through the ventilator system an event shocking for its time but this was anarchy in the making i m for capital punishment you ve got to execute people how else are they going to learn it wasn t long before sahl was in demand opening for some of the biggest jazz musicians in the entertainment industry for such a music fanatic it couldn t get any better performing with the likes of billie holiday duke ellington and his idol stan kenton sahl was the first comedian to cross into the musical arena and as a result was awarded entertainer of the year three years in a row by metronome magazine he even compered the newly established monterey jazz festival in 1955 sahl recorded mort sahl at sunset a performance with dave brubeck this is considered to be the first ever comedy album and is a very rare find for collectors broadway beckoned and although it had a short run the next president firmly put sahl on the map as an important innovative voice it was said that richard burton who was performing in the theatre next door would often miss his entrance cue as a result of listening too intently to the comic from the wings of the adjacent theatre when the show closed sahl went straight to california for a four week engagement at the crescendo in hollywood he stayed for 88 sahl remained edgy never pulled his punches and continually worried the management but people flocked to see him i like to go out with actresses and all other female impersonators during this period sahl became a californian playboy dating many young starlets he was close friends with paul newman steve mcqueen and hugh hefner he had made comedy cool and hip he was branded the rebel without a pause by his peers and became the first comedian ever to appear on the front of time magazine soon he was under contract to both cbs and nbc television companies but neither would actually risk putting him on any of their shows for fear of what he might say during the height of his career sahl was courted by the kennedy administration to write for jfk s presidential campaign he received a phone call that began hello this is ambassador joseph kennedy i want you to write something for johnny sahl was happy to help as long as there was no expectation of candidate endorsement the senior kennedy wasn t worried he just wanted sahl to accept the job soon he was writing lines not only for the future president but also for others members of the campaign entourage including frank sinatra however once jfk took office sahl was quick to publicly lampoon the new president the democrats had assumed that the hippest comedy voice in america was one of theirs but sahl lived by his own code if you were the only person left on the planet i would have to attack you that s my job despite the relative tameness of his presidential jibes they were more than the party could take after kennedy snr made a few calls sahl s club bookings began to dry up one morning banducci went to the hungry i seemingly the only place still booking sahl and found the doors chained and padlocked by the irs in demand of back taxes but everything changed on november 22 1963 the kennedy assassination would affect sahl in a way that no one could have predicted he became completely obsessed with the warren report that controversial 889 page transcript of the murder he quoted huge chunks of it on stage mocked its lack of logic and berated president johnson and chief justice earl warren for their deceit the whole subject consumed sahl and he moved to new orleans to work with district attorney jim garrison discrediting the report over a period of four years this greatly damaged sahl s career progression blacklisted by nearly every club his annual income fell from 800 000 to about 20 000 one tv company completely banned his name from being mentioned in their offices one good thing came out of sahl s relocation while in new orleans he started to perform in the local college and university campuses not simply for the money but also for the access to a student audience who were keen to hear his comedy for its political accusations and tirades consequently he became one of the first comics to play the now enormous us college circuit sahl s diary in the 70s and 80s was filled with cancelled tv appearances collapsed projects and few club bookings his status took a nosedive but his spirit did not performing wherever he could sahl used his own obsession with the warren report to make jokes about himself and the fixations that brought him down this lightning wit combined with political insight can still be seen today when saul performs most thursday nights he is saving america at the throckmorton theatre in mill valley california they used to say that no one is above the law i know a lot of people above the law and almost everybody is above a lawyer but i believe no one is above humour in that sense my work is never done there is an old adage that satirists are like dogs as young pups they sink their teeth into everything and bark constantly as they age they get lazy and lose their bite mort sahl has never stopped howling once his fangs are in place he will not give up his prey this article was

probable mineral reserve and mineral reserves used in this news release are in reference to the mining terms defined in the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum standards the cim

may not be comparable to similar information made public by other u s companies subject to the united states federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral resources will ever be converted into reserves pursuant to cim definition standards inferred mineral resources are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling such geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity an inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve however it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations however the sec normally only permits issuers to report mineralization

frank borek digs way in the back of his gun safe a pulls out a daewoo dr200 rifle that you may grow to like u s a ammoland com with the firearms world still in a state of flux there remains one constant that retro is still in guns that have been forgotten even when they were new have become collector s items bringing high prices in stores and at auction even rifles that were imported during the inane assault weapons ban have seen a rise in prices more and more want to float away from the sea of ars and wind up in a sea of neon from the 80s if that means buying a rifle with an idiotic thumbhole stock and no muzzle device then so be it that s how many are winding up at port of the daewoo dr 200 daewoo dr200 rifle known for their brutal efficiency the south korean soldiers deployed to the vietnam war were sent as a show of anti communist solidarity and so that rok soldiers would gain valuable combat experience when they were first deployed the rok soldiers and marines went with the venerable m1 garand and m1 carbine that had served them well during the korean war but as time passed they began to eventually replace them with american m16 rifles teaching them the value of lightweight rifles firing smaller high velocity bullets the rok began production of the m16a1 after receiving a license from colt though the arrangement wasn t perfect as it was believed that the price was too high for the number of rifles needed the rok government also felt a bit of national pride and wished to become more self reliant in the defense sector and begin manufacturing their own weapons modifying a variety of m16 rifles the decision was made to adopt a rifle that was a marriage of m16 features and a long stroke gas piston this became the daewoo k2 rifle the long stroke gas piston was chosen both for reliability and perceived ease of maintenance an important factor when dealing with a military formed mostly of conscripts the fact that it used 5 56mm ammunition and fed from m16 magazines was a sign of the close ties with the us military and the possibility of having to draw from us supplies if needed in the 1980s daewoo ltd began exporting their firearms to the usa to cash in on what was perceived as a lucrative market but while many today look back at the era as something as a halcyon era of firearms the reality was a bit different violence was rising and the national mood was crumbling described by president jimmy carter as a national malaise there was a burgeoning survivalist movement seen and shunned by many as nothing more than a bunch of crazies hiding in the woods thanks to some well publicized and sensationalized shootings and murders such evil looking firearms such as the daewoo k1 rifle were seen as extremist anti government militia arms many gun owners were more than willing to throw their own kind under the bus to protect their hunting rifle and labeled themselves sportsmen and conservationists who were more interested in the great outdoors than the guns themselves this all culminated in the 1989 import ban which banned the import of firearms that lacked certain sporting features and required to either be neutered for import or have a certain number of domestically made parts installed this would eventually be followed by the infamous 1994 assault weapons ban which is how we wound up with the daewoo k1 turning into the dr200 the lineage of the m16 is present in both the handling and internals of the dr200 disassembly is straightforward there is a latch at the rear of the upper receiver make sure the small toggle on the latch is up and push it forward the upper hinges open like an ar and there is a captive pin upfront if you wish to separate the upper and lower pull out the recoil spring and pull the gas piston to the rear when the charging handle is at the rearmost position pull it out and now you can remove the piston and bolt look familiar the dr200 s bolt carrier should since it features a multi lugged bolt just like the ar but they aren t interchangeable the trigger group however is interchangeable with ar trigger groups an important feature as it makes changing it out to something better far easier sadly the flash hider is simply a fake that is not only soldered or pinned welded in place but lacks the cutouts of an actual flash hider or muzzle brake on top of the upper is a stormwerkz optics rail that had been installed by a previous owner how does the rifle handle well it most likely would handle a lot better if it wasn t for that damnable thumbhole stock first the good the trigger isn t great like any stock ar trigger however it is serviceable for those who decide to bear with it the rear sight is adjustable for windage with an a1 rear sight adjustment dial unlike regular a1 sights it is also elevation adjustable with a dial on the opposite side but there is only one aperture to choose from the charging handle knob is easy to grasp the magazine release button is in the same place as the ar as is the bolt release button as for the bad the thumbhole stock adds quite a bit of length to the length of pull meaning those with smaller arms might have a bit of trouble with handling the rifle the safety is also a bear as though it is located in the same place as an ar safety the thumbhole stock makes it difficult to properly hit in addition the switch must be rotated a full 180 degrees to disengage or engage the weight of the rifle makes it a bit smoother to shoot than what you might expect from a service rifle clone at 50 yards i brought in groups of around 2 inches using steel cased red army standard ammunition as that is what i had on hand to sum it up the daewoo dr200 rifle is much like orson krennic remarking to galen erso at the beginning of rogue one we were on the verge of greatness we were this close the foundations of something great is here with the dr200 however all of the features to neuter a great service rifle into an inoffensive sporting arm have also neutered its handling as well i did not acquire this rifle with plans to keep it in this condition however like many i have purchased this rifle to return it back into a service rifle though i intend to preserve its older appearance about frank borek frank borek is a former us navy sailor and graduate of delaware valley college whose love of firearms comes from his love of historical minutiae and soldier of fortune magazine you can usually find him at gun shops and gun shows digging through racks tables and bins of old guns and gear covered in dust and grease

you can read this story in spanish by clicking here there are two entirely separate elections happening right now both are on nov 2 voters in a special runoff election for a texas house seat around san antonio are having to vote twice in order to participate in both the constitutional amendment election and the runoff for the democrat and republican candidates they re having to first wage an education campaign to explain the unique political process to their voters the first one has amendments to the texas constitution school bonds and some city elections bexar county elections administrator jacque callanen says it was ready to go two months ago that election was called august 16th that s by the code and when it was done so we had programmed everything we d mailed all our mail ballots and that election was good to go she said the other election is the special runoff election for texas house district 118 there are two candidates republican john lujan and democrat frank ramirez they got the most votes in the special election last month to make this runoff the thing about the runoff though when governor greg abbott announced the date about two weeks ago it was too late to be included on the same ballot as the statewide election because the governor did not call it until the monday before early voting started we started early voting on the 18th and the governor called it we got notice at two o clock on tuesday the 12th of october callanen said this was after mail ballots had been sent out and voting machines had been programmed callenen said there wasn t enough time to change everything early voting began on monday oct 18 it would have been impossible to put it on that nov 2nd amendment election she said and so we did it completely it s completely separate to hold the integrity of both elections they are separate databases they are separately programmed house district 118 spreads across the south and east sides of bexar county it includes san antonio universal city elmendorf somerset and other communities people who live in this district are going to have to vote twice once in the big statewide election and then again for the special runoff election they re voting in each separate election because they re two elections she said there are about 40 early voting sites to vote at in bexar county for the general election but only four of those sites are able to be used for the special house district race the four sites that we have the sites the voters voted in in the first election that we had on september 28th callanen said see a map of the four sites here so if someone goes to vote at a site that s not one of those four they can t vote for the district 118 race they can still vote in the general election but they have to make their way to one of the sites in the district the same goes for election day when there are more sites available on election day the joint election which is county wide will have 277 sites and 24 of those sites the voters in the 118th will be able to vote at any of those 24 sites that are in the footprint of the 118th she said the mail in ballot process is mostly the same but there are two separate ballots mailed at two separate times callanen says about 19 000 ballots were sent out for the general election and 1 900 for the house race what we did is we picked a different color envelope she said the amendment election is in gray and we chose yellow for this election because that s what we had on stock the ballots have to be mailed back in the same envelope they came in or they won t count if we open a ballot and it s in a gray envelope and they ve stuck the 118 in there then we cannot count the 118 and vice versa if they use the yellow envelope and they put both ballots in there we won t be able to count the amendment ballot callanen said the opponents in this race agree on one thing this process is confusing and they re having to educate voters on what to do republican john lujan was a previous state representative for the district it s very very difficult you know i wanted to cry foul you know there s people on our team oh it s foul it s the democrats or it s the republicans it s hard for both of us lujan said and with only four voting spots three only in our district it s so challenging for the voters it s disappointing that we have to go through this democrat frank ramirez claims the election was called on this date just to create an environment of confusion i think that it s voter suppression in its purest form you know one confusing people and then two after the confusion has been cleared for some people to go back to the polls and vote again when they should have been able to do it from the first go around he said early voting for both elections will run until friday about 14 000 people have voted so far for the general election and three thousand have voted in the house district election day is next tuesday
in this interview board chairman nigerian bottling company nbc limited amb segun apata speaks on the company s activity in nigeria in 70 years the 1 7 billion investment in nigeria in 10 years by its parent company coca cola hellenic and other topical issues excerpts let s begin by understanding your journey to the nigerian bottling company nbc limited after so many years in the public service could you briefly talk through your switch to the private sector we must view nigeria from two operating sides the private and public sectors which must work together for the prosperity of the country just like the coca cola system in nigeria comprising of nigerian bottling company ltd and coca cola nigeria ltd are working together seamlessly i joined the nigerian foreign service as the first set of the second decade of nigeria s independence and the first set after the nigerian civil war it was an opportunity to interact and interface with actors both in the private and public sectors within and outside the country incidentally my first assignment abroad was in dublin ireland where the charge d affaires assigned me the responsibility of fostering economic relations between ireland and nigeria one of the highlights of my tour of duty in dublin was the visit of a nigerian economic and trade delegation led by the then chairman of the nigerian chamber of commerce and industry the late chief henry fajemirokun a number of investment deals and joint ventures were struck during the visit the goodwill and high regard the irish had for nigeria was manifested in the high level reception accorded the delegation by both irish governmental leaders and the top leaders of the irish private sector the visit was essentially the beginning of rapport between the leadership of irish confederation of industries and the nigerian business community i hope the foundation laid has been sustained over time on leaving the nigerian foreign service i was invited to join the board of nigerian bottling company nbc ltd i saw it as opportunity of continuing the journey of attracting foreign investment into the country and coca cola as perhaps the most recognised brand in the world provides one the platform to interface with existing current and potential investors did i hesitate when invited oh no who wouldn t want to be part of the most famous brands in the world i hope you remember that coca cola is it as an ambassador which other foreign missions did you serve i didn t start out my career as an ambassador i had to climb the ladder just like it obtains in the corporate world as i already mentioned the starting point in terms of foreign assignment was dublin ireland and the last assignment was as one of the representatives of nigeria to the united nations in new york in between i served in a couple of countries including greece and was privileged to serve as nigeria s ambassador to zaire under president mobutu i must acknowledge that the nigerian foreign service at my time had the largest pool of talents in the nigerian public service and i was extremely fortunate to work and interact with many of them including some of the twelve apostles the pioneer of the nigerian foreign service how do you feel being a part of a global brand which with its 70 years of existence in nigeria has built a culture of excellence we are lucky as a company to have travelled this journey of 70 years perhaps we should cast our minds back and ask how many companies whether family founded companies or multinationals which operated in pre independence nigeria are still in existence till today we are one of the very few that have survived different phases of nigeria s political and economic history the credit goes to our founder a g leventis and the leventis family who have consistently and unflinchingly remained committed to the country the journey which ag leventis began in 1951 as the coca cola bottler for nigeria with its first manufacturing plant in the basement of mainland hotel ebute meta is what we are celebrating this year in 70 years we have expanded the business in all facets the product range as well as all packaging types currently we are the only manufacturer with hot fill line in the country what is most impressive is the us 1 7 billion investment that our parent company coca cola hellenic poured into the country in last ten years 2011 2021 before the investment that is in 2010 we produced about 180 million unit cases and nine years later with the investment we closed out 2020 with over 300 million unit cases we will surely celebrate our 70th anniversary with an impressive close out in december 2021 the story is even more impressive than that we have moved away from one line and two lines plants to huge plants in different parts of the country the minister of the federal capital territory has just commissioned the 5th line in our abuja plant which incidentally is both fastest line and the line with biggest capacity in the plant it produces 42 thousand bottles per hour the same achievement has been recorded in benin port harcourt kano owerri and asejire we are expanding our maiduguri plant which we have never closed down in spite of the challenges in that part of the country we celebrate the fact that our ikeja plant is largest coca cola plant in africa we will continue to invest in the country in the coming years i like to emphasize that the investment is not just on machinery and processes but our people the core of our business yes it is not easy doing business in nigeria it is a very tough and challenging environment ye we remain standing despite the turbulence in our macro economic environment our leventis pedigree has a lot to do with our resilience of course government policies impact businesses and the macro economic environment can be very tough sometimes whether in fiscal policies or monetary policies but here we are patient and always engaging because nbc and the leventis family are committed to the country nbc is for ever appreciative of the leventis family without the family the investments that i spoke of would have migrated elsewhere it is important to point out that nbc is just one of the 28 countries in which our parent company coca cola hellenic is doing business all the 28 countries are always competing for investment besides funds could be utilized by our parent company to acquire other businesses or territories within the coca cola system interestingly coca cola hellenic has just acquired the coca cola bottling business in egypt with acquisition egypt joins nigeria as the second african country within the coca cola hellenic group when you came on board one of the targets before you was to make nbc the foremost bottler in africa looking back now how far have you gone with that agenda the transformation of the nbc in the last ten years has been phenomenal the credit goes to the board of directors the management and staff of the company and indeed to all our distributors and outlets credit must equally go to the board and operating committee of our parent company coca cola hellenic with its head office in zug switzerland they have and continue to show robust interest and understanding for the business in nigeria it is important to mention that the origin of coca cola hellenic is nigeria it is from this country that the leventis family expanded the business to 27 other countries and 28 with egypt including greece ireland cyprus russia italy and ukraine etc again we are very proud that our plant in ikeja is the largest coca cola plant in africa and we are not done yet further expansion is on the horizon don t be surprised that in a few years other plants in the country may surpass ikeja as we are currently executing expansion in a number of plants across the country when you talked about the expansion of your production lines that is a reflection of your investment in nigeria nbc has invested heavily in nigeria for the past 70 years let s look at the past 10 to 20 years can you talk us through your investments and the impact over these years as i mentioned previously we are fortunate that our parent company coca cola hellenic bottling company and the leventis family are committed to nigeria we are equally fortunate that the only african on the board of our parent company is a nigerian mrs sola david borha the icing on the cake for us in nbc is that a member of our board in nigeria also serves on the board of our parent company i am referring to mr a i leventis his dual role on both boards provides a veritable platform for the board and the executive leadership of our parent company to have clear understanding of the business in nigeria we are appreciative of his special interest in the country i have already averred to the 1 7 billion united states dollars since i joined the board as well as our commitment to expand our production across the country all range of products water carbonated drinks juices etc in the coming years with logistics being very tough in nigeria we plan to increase the production capacity of our plants in port harcourt benin owerri kano abuja asejire and over time match ikeja as i already mentioned maiduguri is special the expansion of maiduguri commenced three years ago and we are poised to accelerate it we are the only manufacturer in maiduguri which has never closed its operations doesn t nbc honestly deserve special recognition and indeed special award by both the federal government and borno state government we are pleased to hear about your investment plans in nigeria both in logistics and expansion of your manufacturing now the coca cola system expanded by buying into chi limited i e chivita and i know that since you said your manufacturing plant produces the range of products coca cola has more brands globally which it intends to bring into nigeria to commence production here so when you invested into chivita what was the intention and what is the impact now a clarification is necessary here it is not nbc that invested in chivita it is the coca cola company further clarification may be helpful the coca cola system is like a coin with two sides coca cola nigeria ltd is the company that acquired chivita and it is directly operating chivita as a system both nbc and chivita continue to refresh nigeria with its products coca cola five alive sprite fanta all range of schweppes products including the newly introduced zobo and ginger the essence is to give all our consumers choices in talking about investing in logistics and with nigeria being difficult in that area how are you managing security when it comes to your logistics and the roads too in terms of infrastructure problems what we have done in large measures as a business is that we have to view the impact of the business on the whole environment there are many huge businesses that depend on us for survival for instance the trucking business many trucking companies are third party service providers to nbc remember that we manufacture in 8 plants a number of companies some of them with 15 20 tractor tailers cart products from our plants to all parts of the country for example asejire to ilorin asejire to oka abuja to minna abuja to makurdi and jos or kano to sokoto kano etc besides there are major distributors of products across the country with huge warehouses and 2 5 delivery vans delivering products to outlets across the country including the mama selling suya and boli there are many other businesses directly anchored and tied to our coca cola business such as the companies supplying us sugar glass bottles crowns plastic containers etc it is a complete value chain across the country hence when something affects even the woman selling boli along the roadside with a crate of coke by her side it affects us because without such people our products cannot be accessible to everyone in the country undoubtedly the security situation in the country imposes huge challenges on us as a manufacturer and on our distributors and outlets across the country let s touch on the area of csr what has the company done to justify its bond with the society over the years and in recent times csr has been taken to another level people want to be part of brands that contribute to society we are very proud of the way we contribute to our communities our presence in the smallest villages within the country makes a difference because we are very sensitive to the needs of our communities let me cite the lady mechanic initiative i was excited at the idea of the ladies becoming auto mechanics nbc leadership was very passionate in supporting the initiative and with that single project there are now several lady auto mechanics in the country may i suggest that you find some time to have a conversation with sandra the first lady mechanic in nigeria you ll wonder why i am emphasizing the lady mechanic initiative i am passionate about our women as many of our distributors and outlets are women nigerian women are very versatile entrepreneurs they get to their business locations as early as 6am and are there till around 9pm is this not impressive then we had the youth empowerment program across the nation training our youths in different skills we have reached over 30 000 young people in the last 5 years assisting to train them on how to make paint shoe making and simple manufacture of everyday products etc we assisted in the renovation and construction of a number of classrooms across the country the safe birth initiative aimed at reducing the infant and maternal mortality rate in nigeria is another csr we are very proud of all these initiatives are not only making impact in the communities but positively improving the lives of our people does nbc just embark on initiatives as they come up or is it focused on specific areas it is structured in line with the needs of our communities we are sensitive to the women and the youth who are the backbone of the economy our focus on sustainability in our communities includes water and environmental stewardship education health youth and women empowerment when covid 19 struck we were one of the first companies that contributed to the national effort at combating the virus we donated masks and other ppes to our health workers in the covid 19 isolation centres we also took the initiative of reaching out to vulnerable people in our communities with household essentials even when life began to return to normalcy post lockdown we took decisive steps to support many people in our communities to regain their feet our interventions have always been driven by the needs of our communities the beverage industry today is a competitive space and can be a challenging one what is your view we are never afraid of competition in fact we welcome competition but on a level playing field where all of us in the marketplace face the same parameters whether in terms of monetary policy fiscal policy or a question of approvals in a fast tracked manner there should be level playing field to encourage competition nbc is obviously part of a global network of the coca cola system coming home to nigeria how has nbc borrowed from technological advancements abroad in their operations considering that nigeria is underdeveloped in this area the world is changing rapidly it is obvious that innovation adaptability and creativity are what will drive any business comparing the lines we used to manufacture our products 70 years ago with those of today the lines of 70 years ago would only be fit for the museum the machinery and equipment we use to produce our products are not manufactured in nigeria we purchase the lines from abroad we often run into turbulence accessing the foreign exchange to purchase these lines this slows down the pace of our investment and by implication our capacity to employ people it equally impacts others who are dependent on us in our value chain to earn a living yes we have a well established system where the manufacturers of the lines physically train our people in our plants and when necessary we embed our staff members with the manufacturers of the equipment to acquire the skills of maintaining the equipment consequently we have a pool of very knowledgeable and skilful people who manage these equipment we also train our staff in other coca cola hellenic countries some years ago nbc delisted from the nigerian stock exchange nse what informed that decision what was the objective and how has it impacted on operations as i ve mentioned earlier on we are part of a multinational that has operations in 28 countries nigeria was the only subsidiary listed in the local stock exchange at the time the subsidiaries in russia poland greece ukraine switzerland etc were not listed in the local exchanges but our parent company coca cola hellenic is listed in the london exchange the major drawback of local listing was that it was a negative in attracting investment from our parent company essentially the decision of the board to restructure its shareholding was driven by the desire to accelerate investment in our operations in the country the us 1 7 billion we spoke about earlier and our future investment plans validate the decision of the board it s worth recalling that the scheme of arrangement was approved with over 95 at the court ordered meeting let s talk about the environment looking at the products you manufacture how are you involved in sustainability and being eco friendly the coca cola company and all its bottlers have championed and continue to champion sustainability as our overriding objective we need to thrive in a sustainable environment whether in the use of energy and water with regard to plastics we are part of the food beverage recycling alliance fbra where we play a major role there are many companies now collecting these plastics and recycling them for other uses we will continue to use plastics but we are also focused on sustainable use of plastics how do you take consumer health consciousness into consideration in terms of sugar consumption the beauty about the coca cola company is that we have a wide range of products to cater for all sorts of taste we are strong believers that the power of choice belongs to the consumers specifically on sugar the coca cola company has great formulations with low or zero sugar i m sure you have seen many of them for example the coke zero the right of choice absolutely belongs to the consumers to select whatever product they want from the range of products in the marketplace how would you describe your tenure your glorious moments since your chairmanship as well as your challenging times the board is proud of what nbc has been able to achieve in the past 10 years and i stated earlier on the credit goes to the board of directors the management and the leventis family we are extremely fortunate that the current generation third generation of leventis family continues to have an abiding interest in nigeria it will utterly be remiss of me if i do not use this occasion of our 70th anniversary to salute the leventis family on a final note moving forward what do we expect from the nbc family based on the journey which began 70 years in a small plant mainland hotel premises to where we are today with a mega plant in ikeja we ll surely become one of the major coca cola bottlers on continent although south africa has a smaller population than nigeria it produces over a billion unit cases so we still have a journey to travel with the investment we are planning to execute and if there is no tsunami in the macro economic landscape we should move closer to south africa in terms of volume before long we ae lucky to have an awesome management team nigeria and nigerians will remain at the heart of our business and we will continue to invest in our people the environment and the economy

morning yesterday marked the fifth day in a row the index has closed off its highs morning exuberance afternoon hesitance the trend since the september 27 low has been unerringly positive and the index is up 4 from that point but it s been a grind recently and there s still another couple of hundred points to go before we get back to the all time high wall street is back at all time highs but then six stocks on the s p500 are worth a quarter of the index one of those is tesla as i predicted yesterday morning technology was the best performing sector on the asx yesterday in rising 1 3 with next best discretionary on 0 6 news from tesla had driven the nasdaq higher so we had to follow as all of australia s listed ev manufacturers rallied hard to be fair afterpay apt did rise 3 3 following square the tech sector will look a lot different when that stock finally disappears nanosonics nan was the best performing index stock yesterday 9 4 for no reason other than it is a dedicated and often volatile nasdaq follower morgans did upgrade the stock to add but that was a week ago the it s a beautiful world we live story of the day was that of crown resorts cwn which jumped 8 7 after the royal commission found the company to be what any reasonable person would consider a criminal operation but did not revoke the casino s melbourne licence due to the number of people crown employs and the amount of pokie tax it generates star entertainment sgr controls the sydney turf and it rose 4 3 energy fell 0 5 with whitehaven coal whc down 4 2 as beijing announces plans to

close flat given even the gold miners were also weak despite a pop up in the gold price and given another big chinese property developer modern land china failed to repay either the principal or

billionaire to use his personal wealth to prop up the company look out today on fnarena for a feature story on evergrande s demise and potential ramifications for the australian economy and thus share market wall street also suffered late selling last night and also closed flat to that end our futures are up 4 points this morning breather ii the dow was up over a hundred points last night but lost it all in the last half hour wall street too has seen a lot of intraday highs turn into late sell offs recently there might be a clue to this in this morning s aftermarket earnings results microsoft dow google and twitter all reported after the bell all beat and all share prices have done nothing in the aftermarket there have been some big moves on results but mostly down ie snap with the rally back to new highs setting the bar high for positive results to generate strong reactions i noted yesterday that the reason facebook s weaker guidance still led to a 3 share price gain on the day was because the company s various travails were already priced in facebook fell 4 last night by contrast nvidia maker of chips for the metaverse jumped 6 7 not on earnings but on facebook s plan to spend big in the virtual world a flattish close for wall street may also suggest hesitance ahead of next week s fed meeting at which a tapering timeline is expected to be announced although that s still a week away to that point case shiller s 20 city us house price index showed an annual increase of 19 8 in august about the same as it did in july and new home sales jumped 14 year on year in september when house prices go up rents go up and when rents go up the cpi goes up in other news the democrats believe they can get some sort of infrastructure package sorted soon but on the other side of the coin they are still trying to settle on a proposed billionaires tax which would see those worth over a bill paying capital gains tax on unrealised annual profits from listed securities to put that into perspective america s latest richest man elon musk would at this point be up for some us 20bn in tax this year implying he would need to sell quite of few of his tesla shares to raise the cash the same can no doubt be said for the likes of bezos zuckerberg buffett and others what would this do to the market then if said billionaires make a capital loss in the year they just get a tax credit to offset when they next make a capital gain one might suggest it would be a lot simpler just to hit them with a higher income tax rate but the problem is they don t earn any musk is but one who lives

of october 20 2021 james r jaye senior vice president investor relations and corporate communications thank you good morning everyone sherwin williams remained focused in the third quarter on solving customer challenges combating rising costs with pricing and investing for future growth in a difficult and highly fluid environment that is impacting the entire coatings industry demand remained generally robust but raw material inflation remained persistently high and raw material availability failed to improve while these conditions challenged our quarterly results we continued to strengthen our customer relationships and take actions that strongly position us for the long term we re confident in the demand outlook and even more confident in our strategy our people and our position in the market let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers all comparisons in our prepared commentary this morning are to the third quarter of 2020 unless otherwise specified starting with the top line third quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 0 5 to 5 15 billion raw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single digit percentage with about 75 of the impact in the americas group the remaining impact was largely in the consumer brands group with an immaterial impact to performance coatings group consolidated gross margin decreased 630 basis points to 41 6 driven by lower sales volume raw material cost inflation outpacing our price increases near term and supply chain inefficiencies sg a expense decreased 2 7 in dollars and decreased 90 basis points to 26 6 as a percent of sales consolidated profit before tax decreased 264 1 million or 30 2 to 611 5 million the third quarters of 2021 and 2020 included 70 3 million and 76 4 million of acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense respectively excluding these items consolidated profit before tax decreased 28 4 to 681 8 million diluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to 1 88 per share from 2 55 per share a year ago the third quarters of 2021 and 2020 both included acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense of 0 21 per share excluding these items third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 24 3 to 2 09 per share from 2 76 per share ebitda was 834 2 million in the quarter or 16 2 of sales net operating cash grew to 2 1 billion or 13 5 of sales in the first nine months of 2021 moving on to our operating segments despite strong demand sales in the americas group decreased 0 4 as volume and mid single digit selling price increases could not fully offset the decrease related to raw material availability segment margin decreased 3 8 percentage points to 21 3 resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs partially offset by selling price increases segment sg a remained basically flat year over year in dollars and as a percent of sales as we continued investing in strategic growth initiatives sales in the consumer brands group decreased 22 8 against a very strong comparison a year ago the decrease included approximately five percentage points related to the wattyl divestiture lower volume and the negative impact from raw material availability partially offset by selling price increases adjusted segment margin decreased 11 7 percentage points to 14 7 of sales resulting primarily from lower sales volume higher raw material and supply chain inefficiencies partially offset by selling price increases and good sales and marketing cost control sales in the performance coatings group increased 17 4 driven by volume price increases and favorable currency exchange adjusted segment margin decreased 5 5 percentage points to 10 5 of sales as operating leverage from the higher volume selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs where inflation was the highest among the company s three operating segments let me now turn the call over to john morikis for additional commentary on the third quarter and our year to date along with our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 john john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thank you jim and good morning everyone let me begin by reiterating the themes we provided on our september 29 update call first the demand environment remains robust across our pro architectural and industrial end markets many external indicators and more importantly our customers remain highly positive demand is not the issue second we are ready to meet this demand we continue to invest in growth initiatives we have significant production capacity available today and we are bringing 50 million gallons of incremental architectural production capacity online over the next two quarters our capabilities are not the issue the issues that impacted our third quarter and have persisted in october continued to be industrywide raw material availability constraints and inflation let me be very clear on how we are responding nobody has more assets and capabilities than sherwin williams we re employing all of these to keep customers in paint and on the job better than our competitors we will continue to focus on customer solutions we are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses we implemented multiple price increases in the quarter we will continue to do so as necessary we continue to work closely with our suppliers on solutions to improve availability sooner rather than later at the same time we re exploring every avenue to better control our own destiny going forward including our recent announcement to acquire specialty polymers inc there s no shortage of confidence on our team which is deep and experienced my deep thanks goes to all 61 000 members of our global family we fully expect we will emerge from these current challenges a stronger company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders in just a moment i ll add some color to jim s third quarter results summary but first i d like to make a comment on our results year to date while events largely outside of our control it forced us to adjust our expectations we have still delivered a solid performance 2021 year to date consolidated sales were up 9 4 or 1 31 billion despite high teens raw material inflation adjusted pbt increased 1 5 or 33 1 million and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 4 8 to 6 80 per share adjusted ebitda is 2 73 billion or 18 of consolidated sales even in this unusual environment we ve continued to make investments that will drive our momentum over the long term and we are confident we will see significant margin expansion as availability and inflation headwinds eventually subside now returning to segment performance in the third quarter in the americas group raw material availability challenges were a significant drag on sales the good news is that underlying demand remains sound and reported backlogs are strong we expect growth rates will improve significantly commensurate with improvement in the industry supply chain sales growth in the third quarter was led by protective marine which was up by high single digit percentage we re seeing good demand in this business from customers in oil and gas flooring and seal fabrication markets tag s largest business residential repaint grew by a low single digit percentage against a strong double digit comparison as industry supply chain issues are resolved we would expect this business to return to its prior growth levels where we ve delivered double digit growth for the last five years new residential sales increased by a low single digit percentage new housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer and our customers are reporting solid order rates we re seeing a number of projects being pushed out as a variety of building materials beyond paint are in short supply property management was up slightly in the quarter improving apartment turns along with the return to travel the workplace and school are tailwinds that should support higher growth when raw material availability improves our commercial business was down slightly in the quarter similar to new residential projects are taking longer to reach the painting phase due to short supply of multiple building materials and finally as expected our diy business was down double digits versus an extremely difficult comparison which was exacerbated by the raw material availability issues from a product perspective interior paint sales performed better than exterior sales with interior being the larger part of the mix we realized a mid single digit increase in price in the third quarter resulting from our february one and august one price increases and our mid september surcharge we would expect the combination of these pricing actions to result in a high single digit percentage price realization in the fourth quarter putting our full year price realization for tag in the mid single digit range we will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed we ve opened 50 net new stores year to date along with these new stores we continue to make investments in sales reps management trainees innovative new products e commerce and productivity enhancing services we are not taking our foot off the gas on these growth initiatives moving on to our consumer brands group sales decreased by a double digit percentage driven by difficult comparisons to the prior year consumers returning to the workplace raw material availability issues and the divestiture of the wattyl business overall diy demand continued to moderate to more normal levels compared to 2020 this was partially offset by growth in the north american pros who paint category which was up strong double digits in the quarter and year to date while sales are down in all regions sales were less impacted in north america our largest region compared to europe and asia where covid restrictions were more impactful pricing was positive in the quarter though below the level of the americas group as you know our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment this team continues to work with suppliers to navigate the industrywide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by winter storm uri and hurricane ida we stand ready with ample capacity and are adding more to serve customers at a higher level as raw material availability improves last let me comment on the third quarter trends in performance coatings group we continue to see momentum as this is the fifth straight quarter of growth for this business group sales increased by more than 17 in the quarter including a currency translation tailwind of 2 price was in the high single digit range and all regions and all divisions generated growth regionally sales in the quarter grew fastest in europe and latin america followed by north america and asia every division in the group grew the majority by double digits driven by robust underlying demand new customer wins and share of wallet gains i ll start with packaging which generated strong double digit growth against a high single digit comparison last year sales were up double digits in every region demand for food and beverage cans remains robust and our non bpa coatings continue to gain traction within existing and new customers next is general industrial the largest division of the group which posted its third consecutive quarter of strong double digit growth sales were up double digits in every region sales were strong across most of our customer segments led by heavy equipment containers and general finishing our coil coatings business remains a consistent performer sales grew by a double digit percentage for the second consecutive quarter and were positive in all regions this team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions construction and appliances led to growth automotive refinish sales increased by a mid single digit percentage miles driven are nearing pre pandemic levels new installations of our products and systems in north america remained strong the industrial wood division generated low single digit growth growth in north america our largest region was up strong double digits but was offset by asia pacific where covid related shutdowns had a significant negative impact on sales new residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry flooring and furniture applications before moving to our outlook let me speak to capital allocation year to date we ve returned a little over 2 5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks we ve invested 2 1 billion to purchase 8 075 million shares at an average price of 265 88 we distributed 442 9 million in dividends an increase of 20 4 we also invested 248 million in our business through capital expenditures including approximately 36 million for our building our future project we ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 2 5 times we also announced the sika and specialty polymer acquisitions which are expected to close in early 2022 if not sooner turning to our outlook we expect robust demand to continue in north american pro architectural end markets we expect diy demand to continue normalizing as consumers return to the workplace we expect industrial demand to remain strong raw material availability challenges will remain a headwind in the fourth quarter but the situation is improving we believe we have weathered the worst of hurricane ida and supply should continue to come back online we expect to be in a make and ship mode and do not anticipate building any inventory until the first quarter of 2022 on the cost side of the equation our raw material inflation expectations for the year moved up to the low 20 range from the high teens given additional pressure we ve seen since our last guidance we do not see any meaningful improvement until well into 2022 all businesses remain aggressive in implementing price increases as necessary to offset these costs we recognize that the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term and as we ve said many times we expect margin expansion over the long term and maintain our gross margin target in the 45 to 48 range against this backdrop we anticipate fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by a mid to high single digit percentage compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 we expect the americas group sales to be up by a mid to high single digit percentage with pro sales at or above the high end of this range and diy sales returning to a more historic level we expect consumer brands sales to be down by a mid teens percentage including a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points related to the wattyl divestiture and we expect performance coatings sales to be up by a mid teens percentage embedded in our guidance is a similar impact to our architectural businesses as a percent to sales from raw material availability as we experienced in the third quarter for the full year 2021 we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single digit percentage we expect the americas group to be up by a high single digit percentage consumer brands group to be down by a mid teens percentage including a negative impact of approximately four percentage points related to the wattyl divestiture and performance coatings group to be up by a low 20s percentage we expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of 7 16 to 7 36 per share compared to 7 36 per share earned in 2020 full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition related amortization expense of 0 85 per share and a loss on the wattyl divestiture of 0 34 per share on an adjusted basis we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of 8 35 to 8 55 let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for your modeling purposes we expect to see a slightly improved sequential gross margin in our fourth quarter as additional price increases are implemented in the quarter we expect to see contraction in our fourth quarter operating margin due to the contraction in gross margin partially offset by leverage on sg a due to the strong sales growth we will continue making investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers we expect to have around 80 new store openings in the u s and canada in 2021 we ll also be focused on sales reps capacity and productivity improvements as well as systems and product innovation we also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the home center channel these investments are all embedded in our full year guidance we expect foreign currency exchange to be a tailwind of approximately 2 in the fourth quarter we expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be slightly below 20 we expect full year depreciation to be approximately 270 million and amortization to be approximately 310 million we expect full year capex to be approximately 370 million including about 70 million for our building our future project the interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged at approximately 340 million we expect to increase the annual dividend per share by 23 5 per share for the full year we expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases we ll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy we re on track to deliver solid full year results even with the considerable supply chain and inflationary headwinds we are experiencing i remain extremely proud of our team and their focus on providing solutions to our customers demand remains strong our customer relationships have strengthened and we continue to invest in our capabilities we expect to finish the year with significant momentum that will carry us forward in 2022 that concludes our prepared remarks with that i d like to thank you for joining us this morning and we ll be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator and our first question is from the line of john mcnulty with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yes good morning thanks for taking my question so when you look at the impact that you had in terms of raw materials holding back the ability to deliver in some cases and in particular in the tag business i guess can you speak to your confidence that that business comes back versus it moving into other channels whether it s possibly even to your consumer brands group or somewhere else john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes john this is an important area that we really do want to stress and feel very comfortable and confident about this we have tremendous confidence and line of sight quite frankly in the view of the customer and the demand that they have we have great confidence that as we re exiting this chapter that the relationships that we have with our customers are growing deeper and i would point to how we re working through this experience with our customers as kind of the backbone of why we have such confidence we re blessed to have a controlled distribution model it has our stores in the markets that our customers are living in and working in and reps that are partners in their business through this experience those relationships have grown deeper because we re working closer with our customers the line of sight that we have on the projects that they re working and the needs that they have has only increased and so you re right there might be some shifting from here to there and we ve always said that we always expected the diy to normalize and that the business would begin shifting into other segments of the business as people return back to business i m sorry back to work so we always expected that while diy shifted down other areas would go up and we expect that we ve worked hard very hard strategically to position the company to be in a position to be able to capitalize on whichever segment grows in whichever segment the market might turn to so when you look at residential repaint or diy or new residential versus property management we ve worked very hard with products services and quite frankly the people in those markets to be able to capitalize on them so i d say our confidence is probably as high as it s ever been for me i see what s happening with our customers from a net promoter score at a record level our new account activity at record level our share of wallet activity record level every metric that we look at i would describe as almost the coiled spring ready to expand and so we re excited about this chapter as i refer to it as ending because we believe we ll be the ones that are really going to accelerate quickly to take advantage of that allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer het john this is al the other comment i would make is as john talked about as diy normalize if we look at our combined architectural businesses with tag and consumer we were up low double digits in our first half to exclude the raw material availability issues due to the hurricane ida due to the winter storm uri that we talked about being a high single digit impact in our third and a similar impact in our fourth quarter we d be up high single digits on that combined business so to john s point we re going to capture it on either channel of where that customer falls john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it thanks that s helpful color and then maybe just one follow up question just in terms of inflation i know there s been a lot of issues around labor scarcity issues and sherwin has really never had a problem with that in the past it s always been kind of a destination for a lot of employees but i guess can you speak to the environment that you re seeing there how to think about wage inflation for your professionals and also some of the labor efficiency measures that you spoke to that may be helping to offset some of that john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer john i want to make sure i m capturing your question are you talking about wage pressure that we might be experiencing john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst that s right wage pressure and just even the ability to get employees in the store john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer terrific and i ll start with that one we have had to make some wage rate adjustments in some of our factories distribution centers and fleet drivers to i d say attract and retain some of our employees i d say i m really excited about this fact that i point to all our employees is critically important but i would say that those customer facing employees the store manager and the reps that i just spoke about are absolutely critical and both of those employees the turnover rate is in the range between 6 to 8 and i would say that most in our space or that operate 4 700 stores would kill to have a ratio like that so while we ve experienced some pressure in other areas those customer facing employees we ve been able to retain and we believe it speaks to the terrific culture that we have our ability to recruit and retain employees comes down to a number of areas that we consider key to that culture the ability to come in we hired 1 400 college graduates a year we bring people in we give them a career opportunity that they can accelerate in we when you look at the opportunity to come in and run a business out of school within a couple of years and own a p l we think that s a terrific opportunity for these people that have worked hard to come in and really make a difference when i look at the impact of that the 1 400 to 1 500 college graduates that come in and what that means to our company over time we have nearly 10 000 graduates of that mtp program throughout our company and we think i want to spend a little bit of time on this john because i think it s such an important element we call it our secret weapon and that is the fact that we ve got these employees that have come into the organization they understand our culture our strategy they understand our expectations importantly they understand our aggressiveness and when they stick with us which is an important element of that strategy those employees move through the organization and they grow in their experience they grow in their understanding and now when you look at for example our rep force 80 of our reps in tag came through this program and so when you re looking at the opportunity to promote from within and what that means to retention is they re looking up if you will into the organization 70 of the tag field leadership come from our tag i m sorry our mtp program and that drives more and more retention we look at our employee turnover then and what it means to the broader organization 7 000 of our employees are we have greater than 20 years of experience with our company and so when we re in front of customers we re talking about trying to bring solutions to them to make them better these are experienced people that help us differentiate from our competition and so when you look at the external recognition we ve received from forbes the fact that we ve been recognized in the area of diversity and recruitment in internships and places to begin a career all of those are really important to us we don t fight for those awards what we do is fight to make a wonderful culture that people want to be a part of and as a result we re better positioned to take care of our customers so i d say it s working and it s working really well and it s an area we ll continue to be focused on john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color appreciate it john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer you bet james r jaye senior vice president investor relations and corporate communications thank you john operator the next question is from the line of ghansham panjabi with baird please proceed with your question ghansham panjabi baird analyst thank you good morning everybody john i mean supply chain chaos has been persistent along the supply chain including obviously your customers including one that reported this morning on the homebuilding side as you kind of think about the various subverticals within tag how should we kind of think about air pockets of demand just because even if you have raw material accessibility maybe there s other bottlenecks that your customers are cycling through and i guess specifically i m referring to new resi and commercial john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes i d say those are a couple of really interesting examples that you used in new residential and commercial because you re right it s not just paint that those customers are dealing with there s a lot of raw materials or materials that go into those projects that they re impacting the pace of those those two markets though i would say remain very strong permits up in new residential we re expanding the multifamily as well and i would add this it s not just the raw material or the materials ghansham it s also labor that s impacting that so there are some challenges there what i would encourage our shareholders to understand is the commitment that we have not only to grow with our existing customers to begin with but i mentioned just a moment ago about the share of wallet and the new customer activity so we look at this in a number of different fronts we re excited about our penetration there but there is terrific opportunity for growth in there and i d say that as this market begins to recover the position that we have we think not only with those existing customers but with new customers will position us favorably in the market so i feel as though when this customer that has been pushing projects back further and further as a result of some of these supplies first we will out supply we believe our competition but we re also looking at a broader net that we re casting than just our existing customers as well allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer ghansham i d just add to that if you look at our working capital and where we re at today we re significantly below our planned quarter end inventory gallons so as raw material availability improves you can count on us to kind of keep our foot on the gas on building architectural inventory we re going to be in a make and ship mode through the fourth quarter and we plan on building inventory in our first quarter of 2022 if those jobs get pushed back with the additional 50 million gallons of architectural capacity we have coming on by the end of the year we ll convert every pound of raw material we can get to be in a better position to serve those customers when those jobs are ready john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer let me just build on it because it s a great point that al makes and it goes back to the point that i made earlier ghansham we re we don t discriminate to which segment drives our results so if new residential is moving we re going to be there and if it shifts into another segment we ll take those raw materials we ll make the product in there and we ll push it out the fact that we have a leadership position in these segments is something that we ll leverage aggressively to be able to convert every precious ounce of raw material into a sale and profitability for our shareholders ghansham panjabi baird analyst okay and just for my second question can you just give us a characterization of how raw material availability has sort of evolved over the past few months and thus far into the fourth quarter maybe as a measure of force majeures or however you want to define it supplier allocations etc i m just trying to get the cadence just because at the end of september versus now which is just around four weeks later you have raised your guidance i m just curious as to how you re sort of thinking about the velocity of the raw material curve thanks john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes i d say it s improving we d like it to come on faster i d say that we ve had a strategy for many years on not only working with our current suppliers and working to make them as productive as possible when we bought valspar we said all along that there were opportunities for consolidation in raw materials we re working aggressively to accelerate that as that will help us become an efficient customer if you will for our suppliers i d also say that the same strategy that we ve had includes bringing on alternative suppliers and that s a goal of ours to ensure that we have the quality and consistency of our products for our customers through qualified suppliers so i describe it as it s getting better we expect it to continue to get better and we re taking very proactive steps on our side to ensure that we re best in supplying our customers allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer and ghansham i ll just add to that we did take up our raw material cost outlook up from the high teens to low 20 back on september 29 we expected certain things to happen they didn t happen as you can imagine exactly the way we thought so it pressured the raw material costs on our performance coatings business in our other businesses and if you look at our second half our second half increases in raw materials more than double our first half i talked about on the september 29 call that we were going to be chasing raw material costs through the end of this year and into the first half of next year and i want to make sure you understand our commitment to doing that our teams are in third waves fourth waves tag has been out just as a reminder february one of this year with 3 to 4 came back out again august one with 7 and put a surcharge in september 20 at the 4 that we fully expect to convert to a full price increase early in 2022 i could say that at about each of our groups and regions we are committed to offsetting these inflated raw material costs and we re disciplined about our approach as john talked about in the past we re not losing customers over these discussions so we may have to delay a little bit but we are going to get the price increase to offset the raws and as they moderate we ll start seeing our margin improve and as we ve done in the past we ll see expansion above where we came into this cycle when we come out of it ghansham panjabi baird analyst thanks so much allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you ghansham operator our next question is from the line of jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan please proceed with your question jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much john hi your diy volumes were down sharply year over year is the consumer brands volumes today in the third quarter of 2021 pretty similar to what it was in the third quarter of 2019 allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes jeff if you back out the impact of wattyl we d be up low single digits flattish to low single digits you d expect a similar kind of comparison in our fourth quarter jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst right so if you can offset raw material cost inflation with price increase which i think you say that you can like order of magnitude in the third quarter of 2022 should you be earning roughly i don t know 140 million in adjusted operating profit even if you don t grow very much because that s what your returns were like in the third quarter of 2019 and you now will have offset the raw material inflation is that right allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes in the sense that consumer is in a lag so our expectation with our tag group is to be up high single digits in price in the fourth quarter consumer is lagging that and it s just timing so they re going to come back and catch that up the other part is the supply chain efficiencies we do expect to get better as we flow through next year and raw material availability gets better because as you know our global supply chain is embedded in our consumer brands group results and that s having a negative pressure on our margins john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer jeff i d add to the point that al made just a moment ago regarding price it s certainly consistent across all groups and as well in consumer brands we ve gotten some price we need more it s coming we will get it jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst okay great thank you so much john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thank you jeff operator our next question is from the line of chris parkinson with mizuho please proceed with your question chris parkinson mizuho analyst great thank you very much for taking my questions so it s clear your pricing efforts are rolling through as the industry continues to navigate the inflationary environment but can you quickly comment as to the overall competitive landscape perhaps by us region as it stands today and your ability to continue to gain share in pro and trade into 2022 and even 2023 just any comments on what you re hearing from your staff and customer base will be greatly appreciated thank you john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes chris i d say this first i want to reiterate the determination and confidence that we have in getting our price we re not a commodity we bring solutions to customers that help them make more money we re determined to continue to do that across every business that we have so we re not asking for something to get fatter or to take advantage of a situation we re trying to stay consistent in our model which is solutions that help our customers to be profitable and successful if you go back to 2016 i think from an industry perspective when there are some different dynamics in the marketplace and people didn t go out with price sherwin we felt the brunt of that as well and our people i would tell you we talk regularly about the experience and kind of the scar tissue of this leadership team it s a long lasting leadership team has been through a lot and we learned from that and i think i suspect others did as well and what it means is that when the raw material price bucket moves like it does you have to get the pricing or it s brutal and it s brutal for a long time we learned from that and so when you hear the conviction determination and confidence that i hope you hear from me and al on this topic it s exactly that we re going to get this price we re not trying to be arrogant with it we know we have a responsibility to our customers to help make them more money in the process and we will do that but our ability to do that we think is very high as far as what our competitors are doing yes we re hearing about pricing in the marketplace but what we re really focused on is that value proposition to our customers and as long as we re doing our job we expect to continue to grow our business and to do it profitably chris parkinson mizuho analyst that s very helpful and just as a follow up it s a little bit off the radar screen as it relates to some of the headwinds in today s release but when we re taking a step back and thinking about pc margins the 13 to 20 thesis so to speak can you just quickly break down any updated thoughts on the progression back to that goal across perhaps price costs general op improvements and market mix just any color on how you think that s going to evolve across an initial recovery and how to conceptualize the long term opportunity will be greatly appreciated thank you once again allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes chris we still are confident and i ll echo what justin said on our september 29th call justin binns our pcg group president we made good products in 2020 second half operating margin was up 100bps the 15 2 flow through was strong with sales up 4 and our flow through was up over 40 so now we re seeing a stronger volume but the rate of increase of our raw materials has been dramatic and i said it s two times in the second half versus the first half for raw material increases so we re out with third and fourth waves of raw material or price increases on top of that this team is continuing to look for efficiencies on platform consolidation sku rationalizations and they also have a lot of projects to improve our profitability outside the u s and what i would say is depending on the timing of the raw material moderates and our pricing catches up we ll get the operating margin moving positively again and the one piece that we talk about is we still have facility rationalizations in the pipeline we re not going to comment on those until our employees know and we get those public but there s opportunities there and i talked about maybe 100 million incremental margin improvement from facility rationalization sku rationalizations platform consolidations covid set us back a year no doubt and we re fighting through it but in the midterm we expect to see short term improvement midterm longer term get to that high teens low 20s john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer so i think chris adversity brings out the best i ll just mention the facilities and some of the opportunities there but the other point that you mentioned about the platforms and the point that i made earlier about the raw material consolidation there are opportunities there that we ve identified all along the strong proliferation of resins through our organization the opportunity to consolidate those be more efficient all of those will have a significant impact on this march to 20 range of operating margins for this industrial business we re confident in our ability to be able to get there and we re going to do it the right way though we re going to get there with our customers and by bringing them value chris parkinson mizuho analyst thank you john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thanks chris operator our next question is from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks for taking my question i guess my first question is on demand there s obviously been a lot of different dynamics in the market in the last couple of years with covid and diy resurgence now with potentially lost sales because of lack of raw material availability maybe if you could help us maybe in tag and pcg is there a way to kind of quantify what your backlog has kind of grown to or do you have visibility on that and when you do not make a sale because of lack of raw material availability does it go into that backlog or is it just potentially lost maybe you can just comment on that thank you john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yeah arun i d say we re again not to beat a drum here too hard but the fact that we ve got this controlled distribution model gives us insight into a crm system that gives us confidence and insight as to what s happening with our customers and what i would tell you is that across nearly every one of these professional segments that you mentioned about in tag there is a growing backlog the confidence that our customers are working with us and how we approach their business and the collaboration that we have gives us insight i mentioned earlier about the fact that our teams are working closer far closer than we ever have ever experienced and understanding what they have going and when it s going to be so yes we have great confidence we re not going to lay out any kind of numbers with specifics as to what that looks like but i would tell you that if you talk to any painter right now they would probably tell you that the bidding that they re doing is further out now than they probably have ever had in their winning jobs that people are understanding and comfortable with getting in line for next spring next summer and so there is an absolute understanding of what s going on i mean people are turning on the tv and listening to the news and understanding that there are some issues ours is unique from a supply chain perspective when you think about our architectural products since you asked about tag the supply chain issues that we re facing primarily go back to the points that we made earlier about the winter storm uri and the hurricane ida in february and september those are the two issues that impacted us the most and our confidence in getting on top of that as the year progresses and as we begin next year is high and our customers are learning that the fact that they do business with us our people can scramble and get product from different stores or different distribution centers keep them in paint better than most of our competitors so we ll come out of this stronger and with more loyalty and yes there is quite a bit of backlog that we re going to enjoy filling for our customers arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and then if i could just get your thoughts potentially on 22 so it looks like you will have some demand recovery here assuming raw material availability improves especially by the second half of next year you ll have a full year or so of specialty polymers but you also may see some stability in diy is there any kind of initial markers you can give us for 22 on how to think about each segment s growth john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer well i think i d just point back at this point arun that we re very comfortable very confident that there s a growing backlog we re not going to give you any kind of data points right now other than when we re talking with our customers that backlog is longer than it longer deeper and probably growing faster than any rate than they ve seen but i don t think we want to share any kind of numbers yet we ll provide that information at a later date arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thanks arun operator our next question is from the line of vincent andrews with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions steve haynes morgan stanley analyst hi this is steve haynes on for vincent i guess just back to your comment about having to build some inventory in the first quarter and maybe just pairing that with the overall amount of deferred volume that you have i mean how do we think about the phasing of actually playing catch up on some of that deferred volume can it happen in the first half or what are some of the key watch outs there allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i think steven we have to keep an eye on the availability not just of our existing suppliers but we re looking under every rock we can find alternate suppliers to help us meet the significant demand expectations that john talked about so our ability to build that inventory in the first half is going to be somewhat dependent on the increase in raw materials to get to the true forecasted demand which is a lot higher than where it was entering the season this year like john talked about we have the capacity to make the gallons we kept our factories fully staffed that s an investment in our customers to make sure we can convert every raw material as quickly as possible to get it in the field in the fourth quarter and then build inventory both on the tag side and the consumer side to make sure we can meet the demand head on john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer and i think that s an important point that al just made the fact that we made that conscious decision on and it did impact our gross margins keeping the labor in our manufacturing and distribution centers so that we could respond when we re talking about why is it that we have confidence in our price that s a great example our customers we talk openly about that the fact that we re making investments here so that we can supply and as al mentioned as the raw materials become available we ll convert those quickly steve haynes morgan stanley analyst thank you john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thank you steve operator thank you our next question is from the line of truman patterson with wolfe research please proceed with your questions truman patterson wolfe research analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions and john i m sure you were excited that johnson looked like nick chubb out there last week so great performance john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer pretty good truman patterson wolfe research analyst so it sounds like the supply chain is improving modestly recently but you all mentioned that some petrochemical facilities were still shut down from a winter storm in texas on your prior update call could you just compare and contrast hurricane ida are there any major differences that would allow the ida facilities to recover relatively quicker or on the flip side maybe they take a little bit longer to come online than the texas storm john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer well i think the ida situation was a little bit different why don t i have jim talk about that briefly and then i ll come in if there s any gaps there james r jaye senior vice president investor relations and corporate communications yeah good morning truman as we talked about throughout the year here if you look at texas that was more i would say physical damage to facilities based on the freezing of pipes and just all the damage that we ve talked about at length i think ida what was more at play there was a lack of power to facilities which has recovered significantly you also had other utilities that were offline for example water supply steam things like that that are really important in production and even we saw a lack of nitrogen in some of these facilities which nitrogen is a key element of preventing explosions people that produce that nitrogen had diverted to producing oxygen to help out with the covid pandemic so a little bit different dynamics in the two i d say we re still not fully recovered in either of those texas or louisiana but making progress as we go forward john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yeah i think you re exactly right jim the key point here is that there were a couple of key facilities in the paint and coatings space particularly resin manufacturing and other thickeners and rheology products that end up impacting the ability to make paint again not for just the sherwin williams company but for the industry truman patterson wolfe research analyst okay and then in tag you all had sales growth i believe in canada and the southeast divisions but you all had sales declines in the southwest east and midwest divisions i m just trying to unpack this a little bit was it due to regional supply chain differences directing product to more profitable areas i m just trying to understand the dynamics there allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer no i would say truman that it s just the availability issues are across the chain i think what you see going on in canada is a determined team with the right focus on the right segments and really doing a great job of increasing new account activity gaining share of wallet and having a focus on growth and you can say well didn t you have a focus on growth in the past yes we did but i think this team is executing at a higher level than we have in the past i would argue the same thing in southeast i mean different mix of customers impact availability as well but our southeast division has performed well through all cycles and i ll take a shot at our southwest division that will outpace the southwest division and we ll see if the southwest division can pick it up and get back at southeast and outgain them truman patterson wolfe research analyst fair enough thanks guys john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thanks truman operator our next question comes from the line of mike sison with wells fargo please proceed with your question mike sison wells fargo analyst if i did the math right for sort of the sales shortage from raw materials it s coming in maybe somewhere a little over 900 million and if you actually were able to get all the raw materials you need heading into 2022 would you be able to or would your customers be able to do all that work given how strong demand is in other areas allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer so mike just to be clear you re quoting a full year impact on the 900 million mike sison wells fargo analyst for the full year yeah allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah yeah i agree with that john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer well as it relates to so your question is really a labor question and i would say this that there are some challenges there for sure again i keep coming back to this controlled distribution model and our strategy but mike i think these challenges work to our advantage when our customers are challenged with where to be what to do and we re the ones having the stores in the marketplace so that we can be responsive and serve them the fact that we re developing products to help their productivity what we re experiencing right now is a positive mix shift where customers who may have used a middle grade product are stepping up into higher grade available products and you know what they re finding out that they are more productive and they re learning more so and they re earning more i m sorry so i d say that there ll be some challenge but i also think that we re uniquely positioned to be able to capitalize on that again we mentioned new accounts and share of wallet so we re not just i want to be very clear we re not just a retailer that opens doors and hopes people come in i mean we re out aggressively pursuing people every day we re trying to help those customers that are doing business with us to be more productive make more money and we re out attacking other people s hills we re not just trying to protect ours and so the programs that we have everything from the customer programs the incentive programs everything we have is about growing and that s what we re committed to and we have great confidence as these raw materials become more available and they will and they re converted through capacity that we have which is available we ll grow our business and we ll grow it faster than our competitors mike sison wells fargo analyst got it and just a quick follow up just curious how excited you are for a big win on sunday that s not for al thank you allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks mike john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes we have a steelers fan among us i don t know how we let anyone from pittsburgh in here thank you mike next question al operator thanks next question is from the line of p j juvekar with citi please proceed with your question p j juvekar citi analyst yes hi your protective marine business was up high single digits oil prices are approaching what 85 today what do you expect from the energy business how strongly do you think that comes back in terms of coatings demand john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer we think it will be an important part of our future p j we enjoy a very strong position there demand is picking up there we do believe though that it s not just oil and gas we ve been working very hard and we ve been very transparent about the need for that business to further diversify beyond oil and gas so we ve been focusing on some of these other key segments and when you look at the infrastructure opportunities that might be coming down the pipe as well as our penetration into other areas such as flooring such as water wastewater there s a lot of key areas that we have been really working hard on so our position in oil and gas we expect to continue to penetrate but you can rest assured in these adjacent markets other markets in the protective marine business we re focused very hard and we re having very good success there as well p j juvekar citi analyst great great and then different paint companies are expecting to catch up fully with raw materials at different times based on their product mix or raw materials if oil and raw materials were to remain here and not go up from here when do you think you will fully catch up would it be like early 2022 or would it be by mid 2022 allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes p j i talked about on our september 29th call that with the increases we ve seen and plus the additional increase we just updated our guidance with on raw materials that we d be chasing it through the end of the year earlier in the year i thought we d offset it dollar for dollar i think what we would like or plan to do is go out early in 2022 with the idea that if nothing if we saw no other increases we d get on top of it in 2022 early that means you can offset the dollars it s going to take some moderation of raw materials before you start seeing a material change in our improvement on our gross margin but yes you would our expectation is early 2022 p j juvekar citi analyst great thank you john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thanks p j operator thank you the next question is from the line of bob koort with goldman sachs please proceed with your question bob koort goldman sachs analyst hi guys thanks for the question here i m going to i m curious about you guys had to short some customers who didn t have a product available similarly your suppliers on the raw material side i m wondering in both cases do you make that up at the pricing that was there at the time of the order or do you get to sell it in the future to where you might actually have a richer mix on those deferred sales or deferred purchases allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer probably some of both bob i think we try to do the best we can on our quotes that we have in the pipeline it s such a wonky year though that it s hard to completely do that in this environment so we re trying to be as transparent as we can with our customers understanding that some jobs get moved but not just because of the paint side of it but because of the other supply chain issues that some of our customers are having so it s i would say we re transparent and we work closely with our customers to figure out what that pricing looks like bob koort goldman sachs analyst you noted the backlog is quite healthy you re going to build into that is there any anxiety that the labor pool of your customer base won t be there to be able to handle that surge do you fear maybe you re going to have some missed sales because of that john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer well we re going to work with our customers and that s why i think bob it s important to understand that it s not just our existing customers when we talk about working with our customers so it absolutely is incumbent upon us to help them be as efficient as possible that s not just the way in which we run our business it s helping them to run a more efficient business and the products that we sell them to make them more efficient and at the same time we are out there growing the number of accounts that we do business with and growing the share of wallet with new customers so i think we are uniquely positioned in the market and i call it the stickiness if you will these customers that realize that we re working really hard for them right now that s why this net promoter score not just on the diy side but we do a wholesale look at that as well to understand the view from the customer it s actually growing in this market and i think many people might be surprised by that but the loyalty that we have during these challenging times is actually increasing with these customers so we have a lot of customers that we re doing business with some that we re growing and those that we re touching in fact for the first time or maybe we ve had a little bit of their business and we re the ones working with them to get through this we expect that that s going to play favorably to our future and we re going to take every step possible to make sure that happens bob koort goldman sachs analyst terrific and i m not sure what sport people are talking about i m looking over at a baseball stadium where the world series is starting tonight so i m going to root for those astros john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes fair enough bob koort goldman sachs analyst thanks john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thank you bob operator our next question is from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning good afternoon sorry john nippon just bought cromology in france could that be any interest for you guys john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer no david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very clear and just on q4 would you expect tag earnings to be down again or maybe or flat or up in q4 allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes when you look at q4 it s really dependent on the availability issues we are experiencing more of those issues as the quarter starts off we certainly are going up against a tougher comp and our fourth quarter last year was up 9 but based on the current outlook fourth quarter have a similar impact of availability we ll have more price in the fourth quarter so i think what it s going to be hard to get on top of last year s number from a margin standpoint the dollars will probably be close to flat if not up slightly but from a margin percent it s going to be hard to get on top of last year david begleiter deutsche bank analyst understood thank you very much john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thanks david operator our next question is from the line of steve byrne with bank of america please proceed with your question steve byrne bank of america analyst yes thank you i wanted to drill in a little bit on how you drive share gains within tag it would seem that several of those end markets like commercial developers new residential developers property managers these are not customers that are walking into your stores you have commercial relationships that are much higher than that and you and john you talked about driving stickiness with your pro contractors it seems you do a lot of things to make the lives easier for those pro contractors so they don t have to go in your stores to get product so my question for you is one on the value proposition of your stores is it primarily for your homeowners to be able to have a store nearby to maybe select product and then secondly what is the key driver for driving market share gains into these end markets that you really have higher level commercial relationships with john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yeah steve i think maybe a healthy way to look at this is an ecosystem i might take exception to the idea that the stores are simply there for do it yourself they play a very important role in commercial new residential every aspect of our business we leverage that location and we do believe it s a competitive advantage in the marketplace and so let me just give you a little bit of highlights there and then i ll talk about the drivers of the market share gains beyond that i ll give you some of that but i ll tell you that there are a lot more than i m willing to talk about here so let s talk first of all about the stores when you look at any given market you have a store locally there and if you remember that the cost of labor represents roughly 85 of the cost of goods for a painting contractor we have a rep in a store in a market that s responsive to that customer in that market and particularly right now as you look at something like covid where you might have you use commercial as an example you might have a commercial painting contractor on a project who s directed by the general contractor to move from one floor to another because of the number of people in a given area or because of some delay there might not be the product or the substrate to paint because whatever drywall taping wasn t done on time or whatever it might be that painting contractor is turning to our rep and our store manager and he realizes right now he s got men or painters on the project that he s paying a considerable amount of money to and without that local store and the responsiveness that day might be lost the couple of days might be lost whatever situation that they face our store and our people are there to be able to respond and so when a customer calls and says i need something right now and our store is 10 15 minutes away and we can respond that s a significant advantage that we try to leverage with our customers and we try to help them to be more efficient and that goes across every segment and anyone that would believe that you could accomplish what we do with the stickiness and the loyalty that we work so hard to gain without those stores probably doesn t understand what we do yet and when you speak to these customers and the role that we play it goes well beyond just a van showing up with product they re in our stores there s relationships that are built there s questions that are asked there s training that takes place and that s i think a big part of who we are i go back to the secret sauce that i talked about we re recruiting college graduates in many cases to be assistant managers and managers who come in to run these facilities so they can talk intelligently about what it is that these contractors are facing and how to help them through that that local representation is absolutely a key part in our being a part of that customer s business not just a supplier and when we talk about our ability to work with our customers in areas such as the compression of margin short term that s a demonstration of our partnership and how we work with them and as a result of that we do believe that we re blessed to earn more and more loyalty from our customers as it relates to the commercial contractor new residential that you mentioned and how we grow that you re right this ecosystem that i talked about is very broad very broad it s everything from architectural reps color reps it s specifying it s having technical people that can be in the field to help in situations like this one product may not be available but another one is do we have the technical people close to the customer to be able to help them with the application start up so that the project goes smoothly we do very few people if anyone else does in any given market and so when we re talking with a customer we re not just talking about can we deliver a gallon of paint it is an entire ecosystem and when i say we just don t open a door and hope people come in we re very aggressive in getting all the way through the decision making process from owner to architect to specifiers designer applicator all the way through and we re covering each one of those bases in a variety of ways to make sure that those customers know and understand the value that we bring steve byrne bank of america analyst and john you mentioned this example of store being 10 to 15 minutes away i m sure you ve analyzed in excruciating detail whether there is a value to it being five minutes away versus 30 and thus the question is when you look at your footprint of stores how much how many more do you think that you could put in north america and still drive revenue growth before that starts to plateau john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes so we ve you re right we ve looked at that in great depth and i would tell you this we ve not reached saturation in any market yet in these large markets where we have considerable representation if it s cleveland or in atlanta or dallas or some of these markets where we might have 100 stores we re still looking at more and more facilities there and what happens steve is that when we grow these stores and the volume goes through these stores we look at adjacent markets we ll add a store in those markets we ll grow that new market but we ll also take some of those customers out of the existing store and we ll move it over into the new store and as a result the comp store grows faster as well as the new store so when you look at store count we re we can see the next mile marker that i talk about frequently is 5 000 but that s not to signal that we think we have 5 000 stores when we hit 5 000 stores the next mile marker for us will be 5 500 and then 6 000 and we ll continue to add them as long as it makes sense but it s we re decades away from a point of saturation that we re concerned about steve byrne bank of america analyst thank you john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question is from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners please proceed with your question kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good afternoon just wanted to peel the onion maybe one more layer on raw materials i d be interested to hear if you re seeing examples of cost relief here in october across your basket and on the flip side which inputs might be getting worse sequentially into year end and then related to that i was curious as to whether or not you re seeing tightness in specialty chemicals it seems in the wake of uri and ida you had a lot of disruption upstream among commodity chemicals but lately we ve been hearing more examples of specialty categories that have been disrupted and i was curious to know whether you re dealing with that as well james r jaye senior vice president investor relations and corporate communications yes kevin i ll take a shot at that so i ll begin maybe with the third quarter and what we talked about in the third quarter was raws were up over 20 that was a sequential got worse in the third quarter versus the second quarter was really monomer resins solvents packaging materials all of those moved if i fast forward some of the more recent data that we have in terms of prices that have settled if you look through september all the major categories that we look at are still highly elevated year over year if you look at whether it s propylene ethylene epoxy hdpe all these feedstocks well elevated year over year and not a lot of improvement so to speak sequentially i think propylene may have ticked down 0 01 or 0 02 but most of these have not moved sequentially a whole lot we re also seeing steel and tio2 have increased a bit as well i think al might have said earlier in october we ve seen in terms of the availability we ve seen some improvement there but still probably not enough to let us build inventory in the fourth quarter you look to the fourth quarter on inflation again it s going to be a similar type of level 20 plus in the fourth quarter and i don t really see a whole lot of meaningful improvement until we re into 2022 first couple of months of 2022 kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay thanks very much for the color appreciate it james r jaye senior vice president investor relations and corporate communications sure operator our next question is from the line of edlain rodriguez with jefferies please proceed with your question edlain rodriguez jefferies analyst thank you good afternoon guys just wondering like can you talk about the visibility you have for the fourth quarter like you gave the guidance so how much visibility do you have are you more or less set based on your order book or is volume still in flux and can change depending on what happens over the next two months especially in november allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes edlain i think it s dependent on how the quarter improved through the quarter and there s no other disruptions as john and we ve talked about we have the capacity we have the people in place so our capabilities are there the demand is there so we believe every gallon we make will ship to the customer and get so it s just about availability right now edlain rodriguez jefferies analyst okay thank you that s all i had allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks edlain operator our next question is from the line of mike harrison with seaport research partners please proceed with your questions mike harrison seaport research partners analyst hi good afternoon you noted some sales and marketing cost controls that you put in place in your consumer business can you elaborate on that i m assuming that it does not make sense to spend money on advertising when you don t have enough product to sell but maybe help us think about how much higher those sales and marketing costs could be next year if we re assuming normalized product availability allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i would say we consistently look to be more efficient on non customer facing items we did get leverage in the quarter i should say we have reduced spending in the quarter but much of it is volume driven and what our outlook is and you re right if we can t get product doing more advertising marketing and things of that nature you don t have i think just giving you a one off on sg a for 2022 would send a mixed message i think we got to look at the totality of the group how sales and margins progress that really gives us a better idea how we re going to approach our sg a spend for the year john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes we ll invest as it grows and the position in the market and we ll work closely with our customers to do that allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer that being said mike even though our dollars were down we continued to invest in the pros who paint at some of our retail partners to make sure that opportunity is getting off the ground as quickly as we want and needed to mike harrison seaport research partners analyst all right and then my other question was on mix john you mentioned that you re seeing some positive mix shift from some of your pro customers shifting to higher grade products to improve productivity but at the same time lower diy probably hurts mix so as we think about the margin right now and the effective mix within your tag business is it pretty neutral or is there a little bit of a headwind from the diy decline john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer i d say it s neutral mike the takeaway for you on that one should be that you ve got professional contractors that are learning that they can make more money with higher quality products and they re likely to continue to do that and quite honestly that helps we believe the relationship between sherwin williams with these customers because they re more successful more profitable and we are playing a part in that thanks mike operator our next question is from the line of duffy fischer with barclays please proceed with your question duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good afternoon raw materials had a bigger impact on tag and consumer than pc is that because of specific raw materials that go into those types of paints and if so which ones or is it because you prioritize scarce raw materials to go into pc and kind of made a structural decision to grow that business faster allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes duffy it s not because we re prioritizing tag over our other customers it s related to the specific raw materials that were impacted by hurricane ida that impacted that tag more than consumer and pcg i don t think getting into the specifics of what raw materials and what products is appropriate but it did impact us more on tag duffy fischer barclays analyst fair enough and then on the 50 million gallons of new capacity you ve got coming up does that i guess maybe do one or two or maybe one or three things one are you short capacity today so you ll get a nice volume bump as soon as that s running or b does it displace third party product where you ll get a better margin on that or is that really just kind of a multi year grow into project john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer we re growing into and want to fill that as quickly as possible duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst thank you duffy operator our next question is from the line of greg melich with evercore isi please proceed with your questions greg melich evercore isi analyst thanks i really just had a follow up as to the progression of the guidance and the raws availability so it sounds like the headwind you expect in the fourth quarter will be similar to the third quarter from a volume standpoint on raws did i get that right high single digits allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer that s correct greg melich evercore isi analyst and so if i back into the guidance it looks like it could be a 400 or 500 bps acceleration in sales in the fourth quarter year over year so is it fair to say that that s all more of the realized price or a mixture of price and mix combined allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes greg i d see it s a mix of price and volume combined i mean tag will have a full quarter of the surcharge as well as the august one price increase availability impacts are flattish but i do think it s a combination of both greg melich evercore isi analyst okay great and i guess the if we think about the acquisitions you ve made and i know they don t help this year but is this a key part to really getting the capacity or some of the bottlenecks fixed early next year how important i guess are they to getting back to that not having a headwind from raws availability john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer no i don t think it s going to be the magic key to the door here i think it s going to help us we ll bring some best practice if you will to the acquired companies but we re working with our suppliers and we expect that we ll look at this as i mentioned greg during the call it s a holistic view that we have on this we re looking at this specialty polymers as well as the current supply base and it allow us to ensure that we can be as productive as possible while improving the productivity of some of our suppliers that will help us get more raw materials as well we ll add capacity to the specialty polymers asset base and that will allow us on the one side to continue to supply the external customers that they have while continuing to ramp up our supply as well greg melich evercore isi analyst but would it be fair to characterize it as it s less about getting the capacity per se and more about derisking maybe next spring that you have that you need john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer i think in the shorter term it may be a little bit derisking but in the longer term with the capacity expansion that we have it will be relatively inexpensive investment to give us more flexibility and capacity going forward greg melich evercore isi analyst thanks good luck and have a good time guys john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer yes thank you allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks greg operator the next question is from the line of john roberts with ubs please proceed with your question john roberts ubs analyst thank you in tag commercial new construction is a longer cycle business so you usually can see out a lot further there do you think this is the beginning of at least four quarters of down results until we anniversary the drop in new starts in commercial that s at the depth of the pandemic john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer well actually if you look at the architectural billings index john it s been positive for eight straight months you re right that project started in late 2019 or early 2020 are reaching a painting phase now but what we re hearing from our customers is that these projects that were pushed back are starting to see daylight and we have confidence that first we have a terrific position in the commercial front the relationships that we have with our customers and the question earlier about our stores in the right place so we re in the right markets where a great deal of the commercial activity is taking place we think that this will be an area of growth for us and we re excited about capitalizing on that john roberts ubs analyst okay and then in consumer was pros who paint was that up similar to tag s residential repaint and should we think about those tracking together or will pros who paint within consumer grow faster since it s growing from a smaller base john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer it will grow faster it s a smaller base and we re excited about that some terrific partners that we re working with on that segment that we ve been able to ticket that a little bit through our stores but there are customers that prefer that setting home center setting if you will that has a broader offering of products that actually just prefer that setting and we want to make sure our customers are positioned very well to capitalize on those opportunities they have a number of customers in their stores right now maybe for the first time as customers might be looking for product or availability we want to make sure that that experience is a good one and the quality of the product and the services they receive john roberts ubs analyst thank you operator our next question is from the line of garik shmois with loop capital please proceed with your question garik shmois loop capital analyst great thanks for having me my question is on pro and the growth that s expected to be at or above the high end of the tag guidance is the growth more of a function of the covid comp a year ago or are you seeing an accelerated return here allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah our comp last year in our north america paint stores was 9 7 third quarter was 3 5 so i think it s more around just better availability even though the impacts are the same but smaller from a dollar standpoint just because the quarter is smaller and i would say that we typically see a seasonal slowdown in architectural in our fourth quarter coming out of our third quarter i would say based on what we re seeing is you won t see we re not seeing as big of a seasonal slowdown if you will so that s kind of why you see a nice up tick in tag garik shmois loop capital analyst great thank you allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks operator our next question is from the line of eric bosshard with cleveland research please proceed with your question eric bosshard cleveland research analyst two things first of all john you commented about loyalty increasing for your company during this period of time i m curious as you re putting through these price increases in a period of time where service levels are kind of below your standard how are the price increases being received is the uptake are these taking longer to stick or is it following the historic normal path john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer no i d say either historic or maybe even a little bit faster right now eric it does it is odd i could understand a question about the loyalty increasing while prices are going up and availability is challenged but i think it does speak to the point i made earlier there was a question about our store locations and i got to marvel at that question because it does get hard of what we have which is this unique point of differentiation where if we didn t have the stores and you re trying to put pricing through and trying to build loyalty and you don t have product i get it but the fact that you re walking into a store and in many cases these are your friends that you ve now built a terrific relationship with that are working with you i need this product i need it as soon as possible and the person on the other side of the counter is in it with you and we re trying to empower our people to make decisions we re trying to get them product as quickly as possible and as a result the customers are understanding the efforts that our people are putting in and the pricing is the pricing again we re under a lot of pressure from a raw material standpoint we re helping our customers to improve their profitability and we need to stay healthy and that s the discussion that we re having and that healthiness includes a price increase for the products that we re getting you and as a result the metrics and the numbers are all right there i mentioned the net promoter score and people are familiar with that there are a number of other metrics that we look at internally they re all pointing in the right direction so it gives me great confidence that what we re doing is working eric bosshard cleveland research analyst great that s helpful and then secondly al you commented about catching up on raws in early 2022 based on where you are now and you ve obviously within that statement you ve got some visibility on cost and pricing into 2022 is it reasonable from where the world sits now that next year is a year where raws are up 10 and price is up 5 is that the right initial way to think about 2022 kind of linked to that statement that you made on 2022 allen j mistysyn senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah that would be all else being equal eric and we don t see additional increases that would obviously make us go out again like we did this year but you re directionally accurate eric bosshard cleveland research analyst okay that s helpful thank you john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer thanks eric operator our final question today comes from the line of christopher perrella with bloomberg intelligence please proceed with your question christopher perrella bloomberg intelligence analyst good afternoon a quick question on china with the energy issues that are going on over there also issues in the property market have the risk gone up and have you seen any issues getting raw material supply or even on the demand side over in china john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer well i d say china has been a challenge you re right i think the so let s talk first on the demand side on the architectural side we had a decent performance last year and there s a lot of pressure this year it s obviously a very very small percentage of the overall consumer brands group results so it s under pressure but not meaningful in the sense of what it does to our results on the industrial side we ve had some challenges there in not just china but malaysia and vietnam we have our customers as well as our plants have been under pressure as a result of covid we have we believe we re beginning to work through that locally and we re in a position we think to be able to capitalize on that but if you look at our businesses in china specifically we ve had some really strong performances we ve had strong performance in our packaging as we mentioned we had strong double digit growth in every region we continue to grow market share there we re proud of that i think if our president of our general industrial business was in the room we d want to point out the performance they ve had there it s a good strong performance our coil business in fact just about every industrial business we have is doing well in china but there s pressure in that market and again our focus on solutions is what we believe will be the differentiated factor christopher perrella bloomberg intelligence analyst and john real quick the wood coatings business if southeast asia reopens and moves through the lockdown should we expect a sharp uptick in that business in the fourth quarter or is that with seasonality how would that work out john g morikis chairman president and chief executive officer no we would expect an uptick there our plants in malaysia were shut down to only the people that were there they had to be quarantined in a hotel and shipped into the plant in and out so i mean there s a lot of many of our customers were shut down completely vietnam very similar challenges so it has been there has been a lot of pressure there and we would expect that to ramp back up and we re in a position to be able to do that we ve been utilizing inventory having to shift in from other plants nearby plants into malaysia and vietnam to try to make sure that we have the inventory as they ramp up so we ve been thinking ahead about how to best position our customers as they reemerge but it should be good for us christopher perrella bloomberg intelligence analyst all right thank you john i appreciate it operator thank you at this time we ve reached the end of our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to jim jaye for closing remarks james r jaye senior vice president investor relations and corporate communications yes thank you everybody for joining our call today if i had to summarize the key takeaways that i hope you walk away with today is that we remain very confident in our demand environment our pricing initiatives are very well in place continuing to move forward our overall strategy and our people we feel very confident about that as well so we appreciate your interest in sherwin as always we ll be available for your follow ups later today and throughout the week and i hope you have a great rest of your day thank you operator duration 98 minutes call

washington the federal government should re examine its emergency response systems to better assist communities at risk from the growing threats of wildfire state and local wildfire responders told members of congress tuesday wildfires across the united states have become larger more intense and longer lasting this century in part due to changes in the global climate creating more demand for federal aid in response to the fires and for mitigation in fire prone areas climate change dangerous fuel accumulations and increased development in the wildland urban interface has caused a significant increase in catastrophic loss of life property and ecosystems across the united states most dramatically in the western u s kacey kc the nevada state forester firewarden told members of a house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee at a hearing the hearing comes as western states recover from another massive wildfire season in 2021 more than 48 000 wildfires burned over 6 5 million acres in the united states according to the national interagency fire center a government group dedicated to fire management that added to the significant toll of wildfires over the past 15 years as states often see record years for wildfires since nifc started its modern record keeping of wildfires in 1983 there have been 10 years when 8 million acres or more burned all of those records occurred since 2004 all western states have seen record setting wildfires in recent years drought conditions have resulted in forests ready to explode whether from a lightning bolt errant campfire spark utility lines being interrupted by trees or an arsonist s match said rep dina titus d nev who led the hearing the federal emergency management agency the federal government s response arm for disasters issued five major disaster declarations from fires last year the agency also provided 33 fire management assistance grants its major tool to help states manage land to try to mitigate wildfires before they start it is critical for us to ensure fema is positioned to assist those communities to prepare for mitigate against and recover from wildfires and it may be very different than what is needed for floods or hurricanes said rep daniel webster r fla people need to get assistance without costly delays and mountains of paperwork now is the time to learn state wildfire recovery experts say fema s help is increasingly necessary but many of the agency s programs are slow to respond to the immediacy of fire threats for example kc the nevada firewarden said the state has received 8 million in fema wildfire mitigation grants but has not yet been able to start any of the projects due to the lengthy application and environmental review process casey hatcher deputy chief administrative officer of butte county california told the committee her county relied on fema to recover from the devastating camp fire in 2018 the most deadly wildfire in california history but the agency s assistance to victims was slow and sometimes confounding now is the time to learn from recent wildfire disasters and update the federal approach to disaster prevention response and recovery in wildfire prone communities hatcher told the subcommittee the camp fire burned 14 000 residences nearly 14 percent of the county s housing stock but it took nine months for fema to set up the first group housing site according to hatcher once they finally arrived fema s mobile homes did not meet california building codes for fire safety so could not be placed in areas affected by the fire or sold to families as a longer term housing solution the process should not be so difficult for people to get the individual assistance they need said rep peter defazio d ore the director of oregon s state emergency management agency andrew phelps said some problems stem from the many layers of oversight built into fema programs to try to protect against fraudulent claims we need to step away from this notion that when we are trying to offer assistance to survivors the first thing is prevent fraud the second thing is to prevent an ig investigation and the third thing we are trying to do is help survivors phelps said helping survivors needs to be at the front and center of every decision being made votes on wildfire bills several bills bearing on federal wildfire response are up for consideration this week in congressional committees the house transportation infrastructure committee will vote wednesday on two the committee is expected to approve both measures but they could face a bigger hurdle to get onto the calendar for the full house or the senate where partisan gridlock is holding up many legislative proposals the committee will consider the resilient america act a wide ranging disaster relief bill it includes provisions for federal assistance for communities to update building codes install fire resistant building materials or create more defensible space around property that is at risk of wildfire titus defazio webster and rep sam graves r mo sponsored the bill another bill up for a vote the wildfire recovery act would change a cost share cap in one of fema s fire programs it would allow fema to spend more on fire management assistance grants for some devastating fires currently fema has a 75 cost share cap for these grants which help pay for field camp expenses equipment use and repair and other materials and supplies to fight fires rep joe neguse d colo introduced the bill and has 38 cosponsors including four republicans witnesses at the hearing said more flexibility for the grants would help in some fire prone areas neguse also has another bill under consideration that would raise the pay for federal wildland firefighters a panel of the house natural resources committee will hear from wildland firefighters and federal officials at a hearing wednesday to discuss that legislation neguse introduced the bill last week with a republican co sponsor rep liz cheney of wyoming
half its original size president joe biden s big domestic policy plan is being pulled apart and reconfigured as democrats edge closer to satisfying their most reluctant colleagues and finishing what s now about a 1 75 trillion package how to pay for it all remained deeply in flux tuesday with a proposed billionaires tax running into criticism as cumbersome or worse that s forcing difficult reductions if not the outright elimination of policy priorities from paid family leave to child care to dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors the once hefty climate change strategies are losing some punch too focusing away from punitive measures on polluters in a shift toward instead rewarding clean energy incentives all told president biden s package remains a substantial undertaking and could still top 2 trillion in perhaps the largest effort of its kind from congress in decades but it s far slimmer than the president and his party first envisioned house speaker nancy pelosi told lawmakers in a caucus meeting they were on the verge of something major transformative historic and bigger than anything else ever attempted in congress according to a person who requested anonymity to share her private remarks we know that we are close said rep joyce beatty d ohio the chair of the congressional black caucus after a meeting with president biden at the white house and let me be explicitly clear our footprints and fingerprints are on this however vast differences among democrats remain over basic contours of the sweeping proposal and the tax revenue to pay for it as president biden pushes for an agreement before he departs for global summits later this week pressure is mounting on holdout democrats sens joe manchin of west virginia and kyrsten sinema of arizona from the white house press secretary jen psaki said president biden still hoped to have a deal in hand to show foreign leaders the u s government was performing effectively on climate change and other major issues but she acknowledged that might not happen forcing him to keep working on the package from afar she warned about failure as opposed to compromise the alternative to what is being negotiated is not the original package she said it is nothing more lawmakers journeyed to the white house for negotiations tuesday and emerged upbeat that the end product would be substantial despite the changes and reductions being forced on them by manchin and sinema together the two senators have packed a one two punch manchin forcing supporters to pare back health care child care and other spending and sinema causing democrats to reconsider their plans to reverse the trump era tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy resolving the revenue side is key as president biden insists all the new spending will be fully paid for and not piled onto the national debt he vows any new taxes will hit only the wealthy those earning more than 400 000 a year or 450 000 for couples and corporations he says must quit skipping out on taxes and start paying their fair share but the white house had to rethink its tax strategy after sinema objected to her party s initial proposal to raise tax rates on corporations and the wealthy with a 50 50 senate president biden has no votes to spare in his party instead to win over sinema and others the democrats were poised to unveil a new plan for taxing the assets of billionaires and on tuesday they unveiled a proposal to require corporations with more than 1 billion in income to pay a 15 minimum tax winning sinema s backing here s the heart of it americans read over the last few months that billionaires were paying little or no taxes for years on end said sen ron wyden of oregon chairman of the senate finance committee helming the effort under wyden s emerging plan the billionaires tax would hit the wealthiest of americans fewer than 1 000 people it would require those with assets of more than 1 billion or three years consecutive income of 100 million to pay taxes on the gains of stocks and other tradeable assets rather than waiting until holdings are sold a similar billionaire s tax would be applied to nontradeable assets including real estate but it would be deferred with the tax not assessed until the asset was sold overall the billionaires tax rate had not been set but it was expected to be at least the 20 capital gains rate democrats have said it could raise 200 billion in revenue that could help fund president biden s package over 10 years republicans deride the billionaires tax and some have suggested it would face a legal challenge and key fellow democrats were also raising concerns about the billionaires tax saying the idea of simply undoing the 2017 tax cuts by hiking top rates was more straightforward and transparent rep richard neal d mass the chairman of the ways and means committee said our plan looks better every day under the bill approved by neal s panel the top individual income tax rate would rise from 37 to 39 6 on those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for couples the corporate rate would increase from 21 to 26 5 the bill also proposes a 3 surtax on the wealthiest americans with

jea officials say rising natural gas prices will likely result in higher monthly bills for customers over the next year the jea board voted 5 0 on oct 26 to update the utility s fuel charge monthly instead of annually which could result in customer bills rising or falling with fuel prices after the oct 26 meeting jea officials said that an average residential customer using 1 000 kilowatt hours a month can expect the monthly fuel charge to rise from 30 50 to 36 60 in december and the total bill to increase from 123 35 to 129 82 jea estimates the average fuel charge next year will be 40 40 for the typical residential bill according to a chart created for the board meeting the bill total would rise from 123 35 to 133 86 an 8 5 increase jea officials said the bill forecasts are subject to change the board action eliminates jea s fuel stabilization fund used to keep customer fuel charges steady and provide rebates if costs were lower than projected the utility board previously approved keeping the fuel charge stable through august 2022 but jea ceo jay stowe said after the meeting that rising natural gas and coal prices pushed jea to act faster jea bill estimates for this year those have put pressure on us to have a larger increase than we would have liked stowe said jea examined other large utilities and found most did not use a fuel stabilization fund according to utility officials board chair john baker said without the change in fuel charge policy customers could see more expense it looks bad the second we make the change all of a sudden rates go up but that s a function of natural gas and energy costs going up he said at an oct 15 board finance and audit committee meeting jea director of financial planning and analysis juli crawford told board members that jea customers would not see a month over month fuel charge increase greater than 20 crawford and stowe said that cap is a safeguard to protect against sudden spikes in fuel costs caused by weather events like february s extreme cold temperatures that impacted electric and water service in texas any excess cost after the cap would be charged to ratepayers gradually over time she said crawford said that jea s fuel expenses are rapidly outpacing revenue and that the stabilization fund balance would be negative by december if jea s fuel charge remained at 30 50 the money that s left in the fuel stabilization fund will be used to keep fuel charges stable in november she said according to crawford jea s fuel costs for fiscal year 2022 are 40 higher than staff projected when the annual budget was created six months ago board documents show that utility officials now expect to spend about 533 53 million on fuel by september 2022 up from 376 million estimated earlier this year jea would generate about 368 83 million from the current fuel charge jea bill estimates for next year earlier this year the jea board approved eliminating the fuel stabilization fund in mid 2022 but crawford said rising prices require the fund to be eliminated sooner this provides more transparency to the customer and flexibility for jea she said oct 15 when the monthly fuel rate is implemented the customers fuel charge will increase and decrease along with the change in fuel costs each month jea officials attribute multiple factors to the rising cost of fuel prices started a slow upward trend in april and increased significantly after hurricane ida in august jea media relations manager karen mcallister said in an oct 15 email she said the hurricane caused oil and gas production losses mcallister said upcoming colder months also are driving prices higher increasing market volatility jea officials said natural gas drilling activity still is below pre covid levels despite increasing demand and underground storage levels are below the historical average limiting supply mcallister said power purchase prices are highly correlated to natural gas jea will have to rely on more expensive power purchases and natural gas based generation due to the delay of plant vogtle she said nuclear plant vogtle under construction near augusta georgia has had numerous delays and cost overruns jea has an agreement to buy power from the plant jea officials said oct 26 that the utility is hedging natural gas and coal purchases to lock in prices and protect against market fluctuations jea has purchase agreements for two thirds of the natural gas it expects to use in fiscal 2022 and is working to hedge the remainder of its supply according to the utility jea also has contracts in place to buy coal through calendar year 2022 the natural gas supply and price trends are global yahoo finance reported data oct 22 from the chicago mercantile exchange group that gas storage facilities in europe have not been able to replenish their stocks to sufficient levels ahead of the 2021 22 winter season after a colder than average 2020 21 winter as of oct 10 storage levels in

we re going to continue the briefing um thank you jake for joining us um the president will have more members down here today he could certainly have more members down here tomorrow and we will keep you abreast of all of those um but his uh he has flexibility in his schedule to ensure that he can make those calls he can invite people into the oval office and obviously this is a top priority to keep moving his agenda forward in advance of his trip i would also say that there are phones on air force one and also in europe and so he will continue to be engaged even as we move to the trip how is the president gonna go about talking about this it s gonna definitely loom large if uh there isn t a deal by the time he gets on that plane on thursday well i would just echo a little bit of what my colleague jake sullivan said which is these uh these global leaders are sophisticated they re familiar themselves although they all have different systems with how you legislate here in the united states they watch closely they know that it can take some time and what the president is going to go to the g 20 and cop 26 with is either agreements which as he said is his preference or a commitment to continue to press forward on what will be the largest investment in in addressing the climate crisis in u s history six times the size of the recovery act which will be the second largest investment in climate in history and a commitment to do everything he can through executive action and through working with the private sector so global leaders i think the point jake was making is that global leaders want understand that it can be a lengthy and messy process bills becoming a law here in the united states um and also they have seen the president raise up climate as an issue that is a central priority for him and his presidency would it be easier to convince the rest of the world to adopt these aggressive climate change proposal if he went there with the u s having done so already we lead as the president has said it would be his preference yes that s why we re pressing so hard that s why the president has space in his schedule to move forward and move his economic agenda forward but it is also important to note that we have made a significant amount of progress and we are almost there and that the president is on the verge we are all on the verge of passing a bill that is the largest investment in addressing the climate crisis in history and of course global leaders take note of that too advertisement billionaire tax criticized as biden pushes for budget deal share copy link copy the democrats idea for a new billionaires tax to help pay for president joe biden s social services and climate change plan has quickly run into criticism as too cumbersome but party leaders insisted on tuesday that a deal on biden s big agenda was still within reach with the revenue side of the package deeply in flux the democrats continued to press for an agreement to show progress before the president departs later this week to global overseas summits house speaker nancy pelosi told lawmakers during a caucus meeting they were on the verge of something major transformative historic and bigger than anything else ever attempted in congress according to a person who requested anonymity to share the private remarks senate majority leader chuck schumer opened the senate with a simple message we re working to get it done however vast differences among democrats remain over the basic contours of the sweeping proposal and how to pay for it it s now estimated to total at least 1 75 trillion over 10 years and could still be more from the white house press secretary jen psaki said biden s preference was still to have a deal in hand before departing but she acknowledged that might not happen forcing him to keep working on the package from afar there are phones on air force one and also in europe psaki told reporters in the meantime she downplayed the billionaires tax as among several tax and revenue options being discussed more lawmakers journeyed to the white house for negotiations in the afternoon and psaki insisted talks were progressing we are almost there resolving the revenue side is key as the democrats scale back what had been a 3 5 trillion plan insisting all the new spending will be fully paid for and not pile onto the debt biden vows any new taxes would hit only the wealthy those earning more than 400 000 a year or 450 000 for couples the white house had to rethink its tax strategy after one key democrat sen kyrsten sinema d ariz objected to her party s initial proposal to raise tax rates on wealthy americans by undoing the trump era tax cuts on those earning beyond 400 000 sinema also opposed lifting the 21 corporate tax rate with a 50 50 senate biden has no votes to spare in his party instead to win over sinema and others the white house has been floating a new idea of taxing the assets of billionaires and another that would require corporations to pay a 15 minimum tax regardless of if they show any profits those both appear to be gaining traction with another pivotal democrat sen joe manchin of west virginia who told reporters he supported new ways to ensure the wealthy to pay their fair share democrats on the senate finance committee led by sen ron wyden of oregon are prepared to roll out the tax revenue plan in a matter of days it is likely to include other revenue raising tax measures though a plan to beef up the irs to go after tax scofflaws faces new resistance from manchin here s the heart of it americans read over the last few months that billionaires were paying little or no taxes for years on end wyden said at the capitol the billionaires tax is being modeled on a 2019 bill from wyden to treat assets as income another idea up to a 3 ultra rich surtax has been proposed by sen elizabeth warren d mass under wyden s emerging plan the billionaires tax would hit the wealthiest of americans fewer than 1 000 people it would require those with assets of more than 1 billion or three years consecutive income of 100 million to pay taxes on the gains of stocks and other tradeable assets rather than waiting until holdings are sold a similar billionaire s tax would be applied to non tradeable assets including real estate but it would be deferred with the tax not assessed until the asset was sold overall the billionaires tax rate has not been set but it is expected to be at least the 20 capital gains rate democrats have said it could raise 200 billion in revenue that could help fund biden s package over 10 years senate republican leader mitch mcconnell called it a hare brained scheme some republicans indicated such a tax plan could be challenged in court but key fellow democrats are also raising concerns saying the idea of simply undoing the 2017 tax cuts by hiking top rates was more straightforward and transparent under the house s bill from the ways and means committee the top individual income tax rate would rise from 37 to 39 6 on those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for couples the corporate rate would increase from 21 to 26 5 the bill also proposed a 3 surtax on wealthier americans with adjusted income beyond 5 million a year the panel s chairman rep richard neal d mass said that he told wyden that the implementation of the senator s proposed billionaire s plan is a bit more challenging neal suggested that the house s proposal was not off the table in fact he said our plan looks better every day once democrats agree to the tax proposals they can assess how much is funding available for biden s overall package to expand health care child care and other climate change programs democrats were hoping biden could cite major accomplishments to world leaders later this week they are also facing an oct 31 deadline to pass a related 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package of roads broadband and other public works before routine federal transportation funds expire sunday after months of start and stop negotiations disputes remain among the unresolved provisions plans to expand medicare coverage with dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors child care assistance free pre kindergarten a new program of four weeks paid family leave and a more limited plan than envisioned to lower prescription drug costs the climate change provisions may be resolving now that white house floated a new strategy to beef up clean energy incentives after manchin rejected a more punitive approach pelosi said she expected an agreement by week s end paving the way for a house vote on the 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that stalled during deliberations on the broader biden bill but rep pramila jayapal d wash the chair of the congressional progressive caucus whose support will be crucial for both bills said lawmakers want more than just a framework for biden s plan before they give their votes for the smaller infrastructure package we want to vote on both bills at the same time jayapal told the associated press ___associated press writers farnoush amiri hope yen and colleen long contributed to this report

the human rights campaign hosted a panel of lgbtq virginia voters on tuesday that included the lead plaintiffs in a historic virginia marriage equality case the group responded to comments made by virginia gubernatorial candidate glenn youngkin who indicated to the associated press in an interview for a story published last week that he opposes same sex marriage the issue came up according to the story written by ap s sarah rankin in the context of discussing how youngkin had said his faith impresses on him the importance of loving others asked whether his faith shapes his view of same sex marriage youngkin according to rankin was at first vague saying he feels called to love everyone but when pressed on whether he intended with that answer to convey his support for same sex marriage youngkin responded no he then added that same sex marriage is legally acceptable in virginia and that i as governor will support that youngkin s position runs counter to the values of a vast majority of virginians including a majority of independents and republicans who support marriage equality youngkin s statement threatens to make virginia a far less safe and welcoming place for families on saturday former president barack obama panned youngkin s position at a rally in support of terry mcauliffe s campaign saying are we still arguing about gay marriage really i thought that ship had sailed i thought that was pretty clearly the right thing to do what worries me about a potential gov youngkin is that he wouldn t care about our families he would simply tolerate our families said carol schall an lgbtq virginia voter and a plaintiff in the historic case for marriage equality in virginia it really scares me to my bones it makes my hair stand up on edge to think that i might have a governor that doesn t consider me his constituent that doesn t consider our family important that weighs his family as more important than our little family we pay our taxes we work hard we raised a child who s now in graduate school who we re very proud of and who s dependent on us to be legally recognized as her family and the fact that we might have a youngkin administration that would work against that progress really scares me schall said our family is built on love love for each other and love for our community when we pay our taxes we re supporting our community we re supporting the teachers the pta the firefighters the first responders the police officers who work to make our community safe we re speaking today because we believe in community and we believe that everyone has value when we have leaders that have lackluster or hostile views about the role that lgbtq people play in the economy it sends a chilling message in terms of recruiting talent and keeping it said witeck an lgbtq virginia voter and business owner the economy is encouraged or enhanced significantly by policies that recognize all of our families by doing that it s a win win win and if a leader doesn t get it they are not worthy or qualified to lead this economy into the future it s not just the law our leaders set the tone for public discourse and we ve seen how when our leaders express their bigotry it emboldens people said hish an lgbtq virginia voter and business owner even though the law says our relationship is supposed to be recognized we could end up at a hospital or somewhere where someone feels emboldened by our governor s prejudice to deny us access it really is scary to think about

replay will be available through the web this call will include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause ti s results to differ materially from management s current expectations we encourage you to review the notice regarding forward looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as ti s most recent sec filings for a more complete description our chief financial officer rafael lizardi is with me today and we ll provide the following updates first i ll start with a quick overview of the quarter next i ll provide insight into third quarter revenue results with some details of what we re seeing in respect to the customers and markets and i ll also provide details by end market including some sequential performance as we have the last few quarters as sequential data begins to be less insightful we ll move back to reporting only year over year per our normal practice and lastly rafael will cover the financial results an update of our capacity expansion plans and our guidance for fourth quarter of 2021 starting with a quick overview of the quarter revenue in the quarter was 4 6 billion an increase of 1 sequentially and 22 year over year driven by demand in industrial automotive and personal electronics on a sequential basis analog grew 2 and embedded processing declined 5 on a year over year basis analog revenue grew 24 and embedded processing grew 13 our other segment grew 19 from the year ago quarter now let me comment on the current environment to provide some context of what we re seeing with our customers and markets overall the quarter came in generally as we expected across product segments and markets and geographies lead times for the majority of our products remained stable but hot spots continued to exist however customers are becoming more selective in their expedite requests focusing on products that complete a matched set rather than expediting products across the board this behavior is not specific to any product family end market or geography discussions with customers confirm a high level interest and our commitment to expanding our internal manufacturing capacity roadmap including 300 millimeter wafer fabs rfab2 and lehi or what we call lfab and the associated assembly test expansions these investments to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage will provide lower cost and greater control of our supply chain and while there is a growing recognition that the near term supply demand imbalance will end at some point the secular growth of semiconductor content per system will continue to grow and this requires a robust manufacturing capacity roadmap for 2025 and beyond moving on i ll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by end market first the industrial market was down mid single digits sequentially and up about 40 from a year ago the changes both sequentially and from the year ago were generally consistent across the diverse set of sectors the automotive market again grew sequentially and was up more than 20 from the year ago when comparing to pre pandemic levels of q4 2019 revenue is up almost 30 personal electronics grew low double digits sequentially and was up low double digits compared to a year ago the strength sequentially and a year ago was due to mobile phones pcs notebooks and tablets next communications equipment was down mid single digits sequentially and was down upper teens from a year ago enterprise systems grew sequentially and from the year ago quarter rafael will now review profitability capital management and our outlook rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations thanks dave and good afternoon everyone as dave mentioned third quarter revenue was 4 6 billion up 22 from a year ago gross profit in the quarter was 3 2 billion or 68 of revenue from a year ago gross profit margin increased 360 basis points operating expenses in the quarter were 800 million up 1 from a year ago and about as expected on a trailing 12 month basis operating expenses were 18 of revenue over the last 12 months we have invested 1 6 billion in r d acquisition charges and non cash expense were 47 million in the third quarter and will go to zero beginning in fourth quarter of 2021 operating profit was 2 3 billion in the quarter or 50 of revenue operating profit was up 43 from the year ago quarter net income in the third quarter was 1 9 billion or 2 07 per share let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation cash flow from operations was 2 4 billion in the quarter capital expenditures were 486 million in the quarter free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis was 7 1 billion in september we announced we would increase our dividend by 13 effective this month marking our 18th consecutive year of dividend increases in the quarter we paid 942 million in dividends and repurchased 139 million of our stock in total we have returned 4 2 billion in the past 12 months over the same period our dividend represented 53 of free cash flow underscoring its sustainability our balance sheet remained strong with 9 8 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the third quarter in the quarter we issued 1 5 billion of debt in three tranches of 500 million each the first has a coupon of 1 125 which is due in five years the second 1 9 due in 10 years and the last a 2 7 due in 30 years this resulted in total debt of 7 8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2 6 regarding inventory ti inventory dollars were up 7 million from the prior quarter and days were 112 up one day sequentially but still below desired levels for the fourth quarter we expect ti revenue in the range of 4 22 billion to 4 58 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of 1 83 to 2 07 the lehi acquisition closed last friday but the costs are not included in our guidance we will provide those details when we report fourth quarter results just as a reminder the purchase price was about 900 million and we expect ongoing costs of about 75 million per quarter through 2022 we continue to expect our annual operating tax rate for 2021 to be about 14 and our effective tax rate to be about 13 as you are looking at your models for 2022 without any changes to tax law we would expect our annual operating and effective tax rates to remain about what they are this year with a similar quarterly profile of discrete tax benefits that are higher in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year in closing we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger our investments in our long term roadmap for capacity expansion both in lfab and rfab2 are great examples as a reminder our capex will be higher on an absolute level as well as a percentage of revenue as we strengthen this advantage we are working through detailed plans of our long term roadmap and we ll have specifics of timing and capex spending in our capital management call in february we continue to believe owning and controlling our supply chain will be of growing strategic importance with that let me turn it back to dave dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president thanks rafael operator you can now open the lines up for questions in order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question please limit yourself to a single question after our response we ll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up operator questions and answers operator thank you and we will go first to john pitzer of credit suisse john pitzer credit suisse analyst yeah good afternoon guys thanks for letting me ask the question dave i know in this sort of environment seasonality doesn t make a lot of sense but when you look at the september quarter i m just kind of curious the june quarter came in well above your guidance range september was well above the midpoint but still within the guidance range we re hearing of logistical constraints and supply constraints across the economy i m kind of curious when you look at sort of the lower level of upside in the september quarter versus the june quarter to what extent might have that been supply constraints outside of your control to what extent do you think it s customers just being more selective about what they re pulling from you any color there would be helpful dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president sure john and thanks for the question yeah i really think it depends on the customers the bill of material i think that there are supply constraints that are widely reported across different components and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks the behavior that we re seeing that s different our customers are showing up and requesting we have meetings with them rather than showing up with long list of devices they re asking us to expedite they re really just short list so they are looking for particular parts that complete those matched sets so that they can complete those builds for them so it is a different behavior that we re seeing this quarter versus the prior quarters so you have a follow on john pitzer credit suisse analyst yeah just as a follow on i know you re going to give us more color about lfab expenses and rfab expenses as we get into next year but i m wondering if you could just help us set the stage a little bit next year is obviously going to be kind of a capacity build out year for you and i guess all else being equal how should we think about the gross margin impact on calendar year 22 as you layer in these investments rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah i ll take that one first as you know you ve known us for a long time we don t manage the business to gross margins we manage for the long term growth of free cash flow per share and as far as we ve driving the top line and that s why we re making this investments to support revenue growth and as we do that it s extending our low cost manufacturing advantage that gives us the great structural cost advantage with 300 millimeter and in addition to that we are controlling the supply chain and specifically on your question i think rfab2 all in that s about 6 billion expense about 1 billion of that is a building which depreciates over 30 years or so the balance of the rest is equipment and we re going to be putting in that equipment starting next year and over the coming years with lfab obviously a 900 million purchase price and some of that is build and some of that is equipment and then on top of that we ll put about 3 billion of capex over a number of years as we ramp that up so we will give you additional details on that and the bigger longer term picture of how we re going to support that longer term growth we ll give you those details in february at the capital management call john pitzer credit suisse analyst okay thank you dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president thank you john and we ll go to the next caller please operator and we ll go next to timothy arcuri of ubs timothy arcuri ubs analyst hi thanks rafael i was wondering if you can talk about pricing obviously you re seeing some increases in your input costs can you talk about whether you re passing those on to customers and sort of how ubiquitous any price increases on your side might be rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah what i would tell you our strategy on pricing has not changed we regularly monitor that and our goal is to be competitive and it s really frankly independent of the input cost to the largest degree but our goal is to be competitive and if prices move higher we adjust those over time and we have been adjusting those over time dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president you have a follow on tim timothy arcuri ubs analyst i do dave thanks and i guess i ll ask the same question that i ve asked last i think three calls about share repo it was pretty low again i guess is there a sort of can you help us think through maybe what the triggers might be for you to start to buy back more stock is there a target cash level where maybe you would say that the balance sheet is getting a little bit overcapitalized and you d start to buy back more stock i m just kind of obviously you re not buying back much but i m just kind of wondering if you can talk us through what triggers you might be looking forward to start that back again thanks rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah stepping back and just to remind everybody how we think about returns our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company over the long term and we do that through dividends and buybacks you look at our 18 year history on that and it s really consistent in fact we have many years most years we ve averaged well over 100 of return during that time we have i would remind you we have increased the proportion of the return that comes into dividend so that also plays into that but as long as we think the buybacks are accretive to our long term owners we are going to have some buybacks and as you have seen as you pointed out the last three quarters we have in fact i don t think there has been a single quarter in the last 18 years or so that we have not purchased returned cash to the owners through buybacks in one form or another dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president okay thank you tim and we ll go to the next caller please operator we ll go next to harlan sur of j p morgan harlan sur j p morgan analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my question on finished goods inventory most of which i assume is sitting at customer consignment hubs this has come down faster than overall inventories right finished goods dropped 8 sequentially in q3 dropped 9 in q2 they re down 25 from the beginning of this year and down 33 pre covid 19 i assume due to the strong demand profile from your direct customers so how far below normal are consignment inventories relative to your customers target levels and is part of the muted q4 outlook to replenish these very low inventories or the demand profile backlog and forecast actually reflect a sequential decline here in the fourth quarter rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah so i ll start and dave you want to chime in after that but i think where you re going with that let me maybe step back yeah obviously inventory levels are below desired levels right we are at 112 days our target is 130 to 190 days so clearly we re well below where we want to be and inside of that as you pointed out finished goods all finished goods whether it s in consignment or at our product distribution centers are the ones that are decreasing most in fact even though inventory total inventory levels stayed about flat slightly up second to third quarter finished goods decreased and then with and raw materials increased a little bit to offset that so our goal as soon as capacity increases if there is an adjustment in demand we will build those inventory levels back up to be at more healthy levels and given our business model it s just a great bet just given the low obsolescence of our inventory the diversity of positions diversity of products that we can afford not only we can afford it makes sense for us to build that inventory have it ready for the secular growth that we re confident will happen beyond that and i think maybe tactically where you re going on consignment inventory frankly those tend to be pretty lean to begin with that s how that process is designed to just keep a couple of weeks so i wouldn t expect that by itself to build significantly purely consignment what i would expect the build to happen is more in our product distribution centers and that gives us more flexibility to then ship where demand is most needed do you have dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president yeah i think that s well said i think just tactically where we whether we keep it in our hubs where we would prefer it or if we push it out to a consignment center that will just be reflective of our expectation that a customer will pull it so that s just a tactical decision i d also point out that as you said rafael we do plan to bring on more capacity incrementally as we have each quarter through this year and through the middle of next year and in the back half of 2022 rfab2 will come online and then that will be followed by lfab since as rafael pointed out we did close on that factory on friday of last week and so that is on target to come online in early 2023 to support growth in the future so did you have a follow on harlan harlan sur j p morgan analyst yeah thanks i appreciate the insightful answer so exiting last year the direct business which includes consignment that was about 65 of revenues where does that mix roughly sit today and did the team drive a positive book to bill ratio in q3 if you could maybe quantify rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations so on the book to bill we don t think that s relevant frankly as mateo haven t disclosed that in a while and we re not disclosing that anymore on your first question percent i think you asked percent of our revenue from consignment is that right i didn t quite harlan sur j p morgan analyst yeah that s the first part dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president yeah could you just repeat it harlan so we got make sure we got it right what you re asking first question rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations harlan are you there harlan sur j p morgan analyst yeah just percentage of the overall direct business dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president direct business yeah so we left last year with about two thirds of our revenues direct so we expect that that percentage will increase over time we ll provide an update of what we ve done with that this year in our february call capital management call in february of actually what that looks like but just to say over time that we do expect that that will move up slightly over time and just the other color with rafael talking about book to bill as we ve got a lot of our revenue on consignment we ve got ti com the actual backlog isn t quite as meaningful as what it used to be so as he said it s just not a number that we look at or measure or we ve talked about in some time so it isn t quite as helpful is what it used to be so thank you harlan and we ll go to the next caller please operator and we ll go next to stacy rasgon of bernstein research stacy rasgon sanford c bernstein co llc analyst hi guys thanks for taking my questions for the first one i wanted to ask about the near term micron impact i know you said 75 million in cost impact to the model next year those costs don t go away right that 75 million a quarter is people correct and does it include the or anything else or is it just people how to think about that like what that incremental cost long term rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations very good stacy good direct question so yes that 75 million is mainly people and direct costs not depreciation depreciation will not start until about first quarter 23 when we start production just the way the rules work on that front and that 75 million we re still working through the details but we currently believe that the most likely scenario is that most of that cost will go through that restructuring charges less other line until we start production right and then at that point the majority of the cost would go to the cor line now the cost actually do increase over time as we increase production but i think where you re going is that as that happens and those costs are then absorbed by revenue now how quickly those are absorbed beyond utilization on the utilization etc that just depends how quickly we ramp that factory clearly at the beginning there won t be 100 absorption and we ll get to that at some point but we ll we re not going to that s in 2023 so we ll get to that at some point to give you some details and in february at the capital management call i think we ll frame it kind of the bigger picture of that along with our other capex investments and you ll get a better sense of how that s going to play out dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president you have follow on stacy operator and it looks like stacy has disconnected dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president okay if you have a follow on let us know stacy we ll go to the next caller please operator and we ll go next to ross seymore of deutsche bank ross seymore deutsche bank analyst hey guys thanks for letting me ask a question dave and rafael i want to talk about the quarter you reported and get into some of the supply demand dynamics it was the smallest beat to your original revenue guidance you guys have had in a year and i realize that it s been exceedingly volatile in the last year but i wondered was that the demand profile changing from those investors that selectivity changing that you re talking about or did supply play a role in that where you just couldn t meet up to the demand just trying to get what really changed versus whatever level of conservatism you had built into the prior quarters when you beat by bigger deltas dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president yeah i think you said demand from investors i think you meant to say demand from customers right ross ross seymore deutsche bank analyst yes sorry about that dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president no that s ok certainly if any investors want to buy semiconductors from us we ll be happy to sell them but yeah so i d just say that overall the quarter came in as we expected it to and that s a statement as we said in the prepared remarks we looked across geographies and products and product groups and end markets those types of cuts so there wasn t like one area that was underperformed or outperformed what we were expecting but again the main thing what was different this quarter versus last quarter was really where customers are coming in and requesting expedites and upsides from us and those upsides are much much more narrow and focused just on few products so that was really what the difference was if you re looking for what was different this quarter versus last quarter and those types of things that s what i would point you to say what s changed in the last 90 days ross seymore deutsche bank analyst thanks for the help on that i guess as my follow up a similarly toned question you mentioned that lead times remain extended but are stable and then you talked about that whole selectivity dynamic what would you imagine would change the lead times is it going to be your supply incrementally rising or more so with lehi or is the selectivity something as you guys look back and are students of cycles is the demand side and that selectivity side more likely to impact the lead times going forward dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president well as you know you ve been through many cycles with us it s always a combination of both and we will and continue to add incremental capacity as we have planned for some time and certainly as we go out in time as we get the bigger tranches of capacity coming on with rfab2 and then lfab we ll be able to make more progress on that front and at some point we know that things will change from a demand standpoint and so we don t spend time trying to predict that but we ll be ready for it we know what we ll want to do and as rafael talked about one of the top things there is we ll want to rebuild inventory to prepare for the next time that the demand strengthens so we have a long list of things that we re doing to invest in the company to make it stronger so we won t control the timing of that but we ll be ready very for it for sure rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations and just to emphasize that point when that adjustment happens whenever that is we will continue investing in r d focus on the areas auto and industrial for the secular long term growth we ll continue to invest on capex to setup the company for the next 10 to 15 years with a great long term roadmap and we will build inventory as dave mentioned range is 130 to 190 and 90 days frankly we ll probably end up being at the higher end of that range just because we feel so good about the business model and how good that inventory will be and how it sets us up for the next upturn on the other side given the long live nature of that inventory dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president that s right okay thank you ross and we ll go to the next caller please operator we ll go next to vivek arya of bank of america vivek arya bank of america securities analyst thanks for taking my question i just want to get the supply side right are customers not ordering as much from you because they don t have enough from you on the component side or they don t have enough from others that they need to complete their bill of materials dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president it s both of that there is there are instances of both of those and sometimes it s not even semiconductors it s may be other components that they may be missing so yeah it s a combination of those things supply chains are complex depends on the bill of materials in the system that they re building so it depends rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah and vivek the new ones changes 90 days ago 190 days ago they were expediting everything almost regardless of matched set position now they re more selective in what they re expediting dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president you have follow on vivek vivek arya bank of america securities analyst yes thank you could you talk specifically to the automotive market this year it s clear the production has not been that strong but auto semiconductor sales have been pretty strong so as it applies to ti what do you think has been kind of the interplay between content and mix or do you think that there is perhaps inventory stock in the automotive supply chain somewhere that we should watch out for dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president yeah i ll comment on automotive i think i ll even extend it into industrial and those are two markets that we have long talked about that we believe that there is content growth in those markets content per system it s easy to see in cars and well reported on i know vivek in your reports that you ve reported on that the content growth you can see it in automotive it s happening in industrial across 13 different sectors so harder and harder to see and we invest in all the markets but we have a strategic focus on automotive and industrial so you re beginning to see some of the benefits of those that strategic bias that we have our channel advantages the breadth of our products advantages in those markets as well so there is components of that but that said any time that we have supply shortages in the industry customer behavior is always very consistent and that behavior is that they will want to build inventory to protect themselves so whether they ve already begun that or have already done that they certainly will want to do that and at some point they will have too much product and that s what creates the cycles in our industry so it won t surprise us if the cycle comes to an end at some point we ll be prepared for that and we ll know what we want to do with that at that point so thank you for those questions and we ll go to the next caller please operator we ll go to joe moore of morgan stanley joseph moore morgan stanley analyst great thank you i wonder if you could talk to the hot spots is there any particular pattern that s driving which products you have in short supply i mean it seems like we see it most in areas like enterprise and some of the personal electronics higher volume stuff is that something that you guys would agree with and do you think is it is there more foundry versus internal fabs like is there anything in particular driving those hot spots dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president i wouldn t put it down on any one thing joe certainly there is reports of the tightness across foundries so obviously we see that as well so there is tightness in some lead frames so we see that as well other input raw materials more compounds we have testers in some cases some process technologies some particular products themselves that have large number of customers and those hot spots move around as our operations teams will sometimes move capacity from one area to the other so they re not always consistent or persistent sometimes they are but sometimes they re not and there s things that we can do to mitigate those or actually completely alleviate them and that s why as we describe them it s not just one particular product area or one particular product set that or even one particular market or even i d say even one particular customer that would be impacted by that as you may see rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah and just to highlight something for new listeners dave mentioned the foundries only about 20 of our wafers come from foundries the vast majority 80 and growing with our investments in 300 millimeter are internal wafers and that just gives us a much better control of our destiny and for all the reasons dave mentioned and then the low cost structural low cost that we get with 300 millimeter dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president yeah i think that makes it especially clear why we believe that continues to be a strategic advantage for us in times like this so you have a follow on joe joseph moore morgan stanley analyst yeah i wonder also with the hot spots is there a situation where you can t respond to upside in demand and that s why it s tight or are there actual areas where i know there s always a little bit of this but on a broad scale where you re not meeting kind of commitments that you had made because of some of those things that are upstream from you dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president i think there s probably both of those that exist rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations i mean at 112 days of inventory it is harder to respond to upsize than if we were at 150 160 190 days or so dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president yeah yeah for sure so ok well thank you joe we ll go to the next caller please operator and our next question comes from chris danely of citi christopher danely citigroup inc analyst hey thanks guys so dave and rafael you mentioned that the lead times haven t really changed but the expedites are getting better or less bad why do you think that is do you think that your competitors are reducing lead times do you think that the supply chain has had a little bit of a chance to build some buffer inventory why do you think the situation is getting i guess either better or less bad dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president yeah chris i think that s a great question i don t know that we know the answer specifically to that question so i think we re trying to stick to the facts of we can observe that behavior change i think you re offering some good theories of why that behavior may be changing but what we re trying to do is just stick to the facts of what s going on there is multiple reasons why it might be changing and we d rather not venture into guessing or predicting or calling what s driving that behavior so you have a follow on christopher danely citigroup inc analyst yeah i guess you can leave the guessing and predicting up to sell siders since you guys don t talk about gross margin but you do talk about free cash flow margins i think you hit an all time high in free cash flow margin in q3 and it looks like there is some headwinds coming down the pipe in the i guess near to medium term is there any reason for us to believe that you ve seen your all time peak in free cash flow margin or eventually could it get back above where it was in the most recent quarter rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations sure i ll take that chris and chris you know us very well you ve followed us for a long time you know we do not manage to free cash flow margin percent that is not what drives the long term value for the owners it s the long term growth of free cash flow dollars and to your point there there are some headwinds on that with the capex that we re talking about to start up the company well for the future but of course we are only doing that because we think that is going to drive even faster growth of the long term trend of free cash flow dollar so we ll continue to focus on that because we think that is what drives value for the long term owners dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president okay thank you chris and we ve got time for one more call operator and we ll go tore svanberg of stifel tore svanberg stifel analyst yes thank you for squeezing me in as far as the question on controlling the supply chain you talked about 80 outsourced now i believe that s kind of the more advanced nodes but should we assume that that 80 is just going to grow and that you re going to rely less and less on foundries going forward rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah so you said 80 outsourced it s 80 insourced just to make sure 80 tore svanberg stifel analyst yeah rafael yeah sorry rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah so 80 our own wafers and yeah that should grow over time as we continue to add this wafer fabs that we re talking about all in 300 millimeter which the efficiency of 300 millimeter is huge because 300 millimeter wafer accounts for almost 2 3 times a 200 millimeter wafer and these are pretty large wafers for efficiency purposes in fact rfab2 is going to be bigger than rfab1 so yeah it s reasonable to deduce that that percent will increase over time tore svanberg stifel analyst very good and then as a follow up and i don t want to steal your thunder from february but in the past you had talked about capacity of 22 billion obviously you re going to go through capacity expansion here for the next 12 to 18 months would you share any new numbers with those i don t 25 billion 28 billion anything at all rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations yeah no it s a great question thanks for the setup for february we will talk about that in february so until then what i would tell you is you ve heard us talk about dmos6 and rfab1 roughly that s a potential of about 8 billion of annual revenue on 300 millimeter than rfab2 and this is all dependent highly dependent on mix so these are not exact numbers but rfab2 with that caveat rfab2 should add another 5 billion of annual revenue again when it s full week obviously not on day one and lehi should add 3 billion to 4 billion of annual revenue so we re thinking in terms of that and we re thinking even beyond that because as we look at the company s potential for growth into the next 10 and 15 years then we are not stopping just thinking in the next four or five years we re thinking 10 15 years and we ll talk about that in february in more detail dave pahl head of investor relations and vice president great and i think we can go ahead and wrap up rafael rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance and operations okay so let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously at our core where engineers and technology is the foundation of our company but ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share while we strive to achieve our objective we will continue to pursue our three ambitions we will act like owners who will own the company for decades we will adapt and succeed in a world that s ever changing and we will be a company that we re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor when we re successful our employees customers communities and owners all benefit thank you and have a good evening operator duration 41 minutes call

listen to this article listen to this article editor s note business content from the new york times will now be included with your subscription to finance commerce not a subscriber start your subscription here after months of negotiations over president joe biden s big social spending bill congressional democrats looking for ways to pay for it have zeroed in on america s billionaires to squeeze more money from the very wealthy they are looking toward a change in the tax code that would reinvent how the government taxes investments at least for the few hundred richest families and lean against the accumulation of enormous fortunes in the future details of the plan remain sparse as of monday and negotiations over the overall spending package are fluid but the idea from the senate finance committee chair ron wyden is essentially to apply a more stringent version of capital gains taxes on the billionaire class treasury secretary janet yellen said in an appearance sunday on cnn it would help get at capital gains which are an extraordinarily large part of the incomes of the wealthiest individuals and right now escape taxation the proposal raises conceptual questions about what counts as income when americans buy assets shares of stock a piece of real estate a business that become more valuable over time they owe tax only on the appreciation when they sell the asset this is a long standing feature of the capital gains tax true throughout its century plus history by contrast those who earn their money from working owe income taxes every year on those earnings the rationale is that just because something has increased in value doesn t mean the owner has the cash on hand to pay taxes moreover for those with complex holdings like interests in multiple privately held companies it could be onerous to calculate the change in valuations every year with ambiguous results by charging capital gains tax only when an asset is sold both problems are solved the taxpayer has the money to pay the tax bill and the sales price is presumably a fair market value but it has also opened up immense possibilities for the very wealthy to legally keep their tax burden very low to a degree that has become more clear in recent years in effect a person can accrue capital gains indefinitely on a vast scale while owing no tax other than on dividends or other cash distributions from those assets they can borrow against those assets to cover their spending without triggering a sale all that means according to a paper from the white house published last month that from 2010 to 2018 the wealthiest 400 families in america paid an average of 8 2 of their income in taxes counting unrealized capital gains appreciation as income the average income tax rate for all americans in 2018 without that capital gains adjustment was 13 and it was 25 among the top 1 of earners propublica the nonprofit news organization obtained the tax returns of many ultra wealthy people and reported that among other extraordinary examples amazon founder jeff bezos saw his wealth rise by 99 billion from 2014 to 2018 while he paid 973 million in taxes in that span less than 1 the wyden plan would require the very wealthy those with over 1 billion in assets or three straight years of income over 100 million to pay taxes based on unrealized gains at that tier of wealth the logic goes the usual considerations arguing against a so called mark to market capital gains tax don t apply those are sophisticated taxpayers with access to loans or other source of liquidity for example who hold assets that for the most part can reasonably be valued annually it could create some very large tax bills for that small sliver of americans if a family s 10 billion net worth rose to 11 billion in a single year a capital gains rate of 20 would imply a 200 million tax bill and by applying the new tax system only to a few hundred families that are very wealthy democrats are betting that they will not cause excessive hassles to millions of moderately wealthy americans put differently it s one thing to insist bezos pay tax on his unrealized billions of dollars in amazon gains every year but another to insist all small town dentists estimate what their practice is worth and write a check to the irs if it has become more valuable still having a cutoff at which the new capital gains system applies could create perverse incentives too if you have a threshold you re giving people a really strong incentive to rearrange their affairs to keep their income and wealth below the threshold said leonard burman institute fellow at the tax policy center people might do things to keep their income just below the threshold that could be really inefficient it also complicates the administration s efforts to improve compliance among high income people who are the people most able to control what shows up on their tax return and what doesn t he said it also raises conceptual questions given its similarity to another idea that has emerged among left of center tax experts in recent years a wealth tax that idea embraced by elizabeth warren and bernie sanders in their campaigns for the presidency would require the very wealthy to pay some small percentage of their net worth each year warren advocated a 3 tax for billionaires for example the wyden plan by contrast would tax only the unrealized gain a billionaire family had but the long term capital gains rate is 20 for assets with modest returns the math of those two tax systems would work out similarly but the new approach would cause more volatile swings in the money a rich family owes and the refunds it receives each year as asset prices move up and down kyle pomerleau a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute said the approach would be better than a wealth tax at taxing the extraordinary returns investors receive because of what are known as economic rents what the wealth tax is failing to tax are rents or supernormal returns the returns to luck market power a good idea pomerleau said i think if you are worried about inequality due to market power a tax that captures rents is better than one that exempts them entirely notably leading democrats are on different pages on whether to think of the wyden billionaires tax as equivalent to a wealth tax on cnn on sunday house speaker nancy pelosi said we probably will have a wealth tax while yellen said later on the same show that it s not a wealth tax but a tax on unrealized capital gains of exceptionally wealthy individuals the distinction could also have legal significance either policy would probably attract constitutional challenges but the wyden proposal is probably on safer ground burman said legal experts have been exchanging views on the matter even with no legislative text yet available if some version of the plan becomes law that isn t the only question there would need to be rules on how the value of illiquid assets art for example should be calculated and how to handle enforcement and any exceptions all of which means the discussion over what this provision would mean will not end if it becomes law the practical implications and fights over the details would just be starting this article originally appeared in the new york times
we are facing an unprecedented global energy crunch demand for energy is continually rising and the production of energy is not keeping pace one of the biggest reasons for this is that large financial institutions have become extremely hesitant to fund any new energy projects that will add more carbon emissions to the environment instead they want to fund projects that will help us transition to the new green economy but meanwhile we are getting to a point where we will soon see widespread shortages of traditional forms of energy so now we all get to suffer a lack of oil is pushing the price of gasoline to alarming heights shortages of natural gas are already causing tremendous disruptions in asia and europe we are being told that we are facing a propane armageddon this winter and supplies of coal have dropped to dangerously low levels around the world in other words we are potentially heading into the most painful global energy crisis in modern history when cnn asked blackstone ceo stephen schwarzman about this he openly admitted that we are going to end up with a real shortage of energy blackstone ceo stephen schwarzman warned tuesday that high energy prices will likely set off social unrest around the world we re going to end up with a real shortage of energy and when you have a shortage it s going to cost more and it s probably going to cost a lot more the private equity billionaire told cnn international s richard quest at a conference in saudi arabia when the power goes out people are not going to be happy and people are really not going to be happy if it goes out for an extended period of time according to schwarzman we will soon see very unhappy people all over the globe you re going to get very unhappy people around the world in the emerging markets in particular but in the developed world schwarzman said at the future investment initiative what happens then richard is you ve got real unrest this challenges the political system and it s all utterly unnecessary sadly he is right that this global energy crisis did not have to happen if the global elite had continued to fund traditional energy projects at the pace that was needed we could have avoided this nightmare to a very large degree but traditional forms of energy are now being shunned and billions of people will suffer as a result meanwhile prices throughout our economic system continue to rise at a very alarming pace just check out what has been happening to the price of turkey the u s department of agriculture for example released data recently showing the average wholesale price of grade a frozen 8 to 16 pound turkey has spiked by 21 91 since last year that means what cost 1 15 per pound a year ago will now ring at at 1 41 and just for context the same would have cost 96 cents in 2019 and 84 cents in 2018 if math isn t your thing that s a 68 wholesale price increase in just two years overall we are being told that this upcoming thanksgiving will be the most expensive thanksgiving that any of us have ever experienced matthew mcclure paid 20 more this month than he did last year for the 25 pasture raised turkeys he plans to roast at the hive the bentonville arkansas restaurant where he is the executive chef and norman brown director of sweet potato sales for wada farms in raleigh north carolina is paying truckers nearly twice as much as usual to haul the crop to other parts of the country i never seen anything like it and i ve been running sweet potatoes for 38 or 39 years brown said i don t know what the answer is but in the end it s all going to get passed on to the consumer unfortunately more price hikes are on the horizon in fact kimberly clark is opening warning that they are going to be boosting prices even higher prices of toilet paper diapers facial tissues and paper towels will likely rise in coming weeks as irving based consumer giant kimberly clark warned monday that inflation and supply chain concerns aren t likely to be resolved quickly so i would stock up on paper products while you still can in case you haven t figured it out yet inflation is eventually going to get far worse than what we witnessed during the 1970s at this point even many top democrats are warning that high inflation is with us to stay here is one recent example former president barack obama s chief of global development on tuesday predicted inflation was here to stay despite the biden administration s protestations to the contrary prices will go higher and the fed has misread the inflation dynamics in a big way former global development council chairman mohamed el erian said in an afternoon interview with fox news sandra smith adding that the federal reserve was still hostage to this notion that it s transitory and the shortages that we are currently experiencing are ultimately going to get worse too right now we are already facing the worst shortage of alcoholic beverages since the 1930s when asked about his empty shelves by a reporter one gas station owner said that he has never seen anything like this supply chain issues are impacting the alcohol supply in the u s and it s making alcohol more expensive and difficult for bars and liquor stores to get i have so many empty shelves in the two years of doing this i ve never seen anything like this gas station chain owner ali ali said as i discussed yesterday now biden wants to take countless more truck drivers off the road and that will make our supply chain headaches a whole lot worse and as energy prices escalate that will push all prices throughout our economic system higher and higher and higher yes all of this is really happening this is not a drill we are in the early chapters of a full blown economic meltdown of epic proportions and nothing will ever be the same after this if you want to keep waiting for conditions to return to normal you are going to be waiting for a really really long time we have entered a truly horrible nightmare and

index was developed by citigroup global markets limited the index administrator and index calculation agent the description of the index included in this pricing supplement and in the accompanying index supplement is based on rules formulated by the index administrator which are attached as annexes to the accompanying index supplement the index launched on august 2 2021 and therefore has a limited performance history the index is derived from an underlying index that differs from the index only in that it does not include the index s currency conversion feature described below that underlying index launched on september 5 2019 the index tracks the performance of a hypothetical investment rolled annually in a futures contract on a european union allowance eua also referred to as a carbon emissions allowance the index s futures contract is the december futures contract on euas that is currently traded on the ice endex exchange the ice an eua is the tradable unit under the european union emissions trading scheme the eu ets giving the holder the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide co2 or the equivalent amount of two more powerful greenhouse gases nitrous oxide n2o and perfluorocarbons pfcs see carbon trading markets mechanisms in the accompanying index supplement for additional information about the eu ets and euas the futures contracts underlying the index have expiration dates in december of each year the index tracks a single futures contract expiring in december of each year and then as the expiration date of that futures contract approaches will roll out of the expiring futures contract and into the futures contract with an expiration date in the next succeeding december by continually rolling out of an expiring contract and into another futures contract with a later expiration date the index maintains continuous exposure to an eua futures contract the value of the index s futures contract will fluctuate with changes in the market value of its underlying eua eua pricing is set by supply and demand supply is determined by the number of euas and other carbon allowances that are available to the market euas are currently issued annually by the member states of the european union pursuant to an allocation plan approved by the european commission and are based on agreements under the kyoto protocol demand is determined by the volume of carbon emitted during the year in relation to the annual allocation the main factors influencing volumes emitted in the short term are the weather relative fuel prices general economic activity and the amount of electricity generated from non fossil fuel sources the value of the index s futures contract will fluctuate not only based on changes in the market value of the underlying eua but also based on factors that are unique to a futures contract such as supply and demand in the futures market the time remaining to the maturity of the futures contract and market interest rates over the term of the contract as discussed in more detail under description of the citi commodities benchmark mono index eua emissions usd index background on futures contracts generally in the accompanying index supplement these factors are likely to cause a position in the futures contract to reflect a carry cost which will lower the return on the futures contract as compared to a direct investment in the underlying eua accordingly we expect the performance of the index to generally reflect changes in the value of its underlying eua as reduced by a carry cost we expect the carry cost to rise if market interest rates rise in addition while the index s futures contract is denominated in euro the level of the index is denominated in u s dollars on each index business day the index converts the returns on the eua futures contract in euro terms into a u s dollar return based on the eur usd spot rate because the index is a futures based index the performance of the index is expected to reflect not only the performance of the underlying eua tracked by the eua futures contract but also the carry cost associated with the eua futures contract which will reduce the performance of the index the index is an excess return index which in this context means that its performance will be based solely on changes in the settlement price of the eua futures contract an excess return index is distinct from a total return index which in addition to changes in the settlement price of the underlying futures contract would reflect interest that could be earned on funds notionally committed to the trading of futures contracts this section contains only a summary description of the index and does not describe all of its important features in detail before investing in the securities you should carefully review the more detailed description of the index contained in the section description of the citi commodities benchmark mono index eua emissions usd index in the

applicable early valuation date as described herein these examples are for purposes of illustration only and the values used in the examples have been rounded for ease of analysis in the table below the index performance factor represents the closing level of the index on the final valuation date divided by the initial index level accordingly an index performance factor of 100 00 means that the closing level of the index on the final valuation date is equal to the initial index level an index performance factor of greater than 100 00 means that the closing level of the index on the final valuation date is greater than the initial index level and an index performance factor of less than 100 00 means that the closing level of the index on the final valuation date is less than the

illustrates that if the index does not appreciate sufficiently to offset the underwriting fee and the accrued tracking fee the redemption amount at maturity will be less than the issue price example 3 the level of the index declined from the pricing date to the final valuation date and the index performance factor as of the final valuation date is 80 00 on the maturity date you would receive a

you may lose up to all of your investment subject to the minimum redemption amount unlike conventional debt securities the securities do not repay a fixed amount of principal at maturity or upon earlier redemption instead the redemption amount at maturity or earlier redemption will depend on the performance of the index the securities provide for a return at maturity or upon early redemption at the holder s option that will reflect 1 to 1 upside and downside exposure to the performance of the index from the pricing date to the applicable valuation date reduced by the underwriting fee an accrued tracking fee and in the event you elect to require us to redeem the securities during the early redemption fee period an early redemption fee accordingly if the index does not appreciate

you will incur a loss on your investment in the securities you may lose up to your entire investment in the securities subject to the minimum redemption amount the securities will underperform the

amount will be at the time of exercising that right if you elect to exercise your right to require us to redeem the securities prior to maturity you must comply with the procedures set forth on annex a to this pricing supplement in all events the redemption amount will be based on a level of the index determined after you have complied with such procedures moreover unless you comply with such procedures prior to 12 00 p m london time on an index business day the relevant early valuation date will be the next index business day after you have complied with such procedures as a result you will not know the redemption amount that you will receive at the time of exercising your right to require us to redeem the securities the level of the index may decline significantly after you have exercised that right and as a result the redemption amount you receive may be significantly less than you anticipate at the time of exercising that right early redemption at the holder s option during the early redemption fee period will be subject to an early redemption fee if you exercise your right to require us to redeem the securities during the early redemption fee period the redemption amount you receive will be reduced by an early redemption fee the securities are subject to the credit risk of citigroup global markets holdings inc and citigroup inc if we default on our obligations

can be sold at that price or at all cgmi may suspend or terminate making a market and providing indicative bid prices without notice at any time and for any reason if cgmi suspends or terminates making a market there may be no secondary market at all for the securities because it is likely that cgmi will be the only broker dealer that is willing to buy your securities at any time accordingly an investor must be prepared to hold the securities until maturity or otherwise rely on its early redemption right for liquidity ps 6 citigroup global markets holdings inc the value of your securities prior to maturity will fluctuate based on the performance of the index and other factors we expect that the value of the securities at any time will depend substantially on the level of the index at that time if the level of the index declines following the pricing date the value of your securities will also decline perhaps significantly in addition the accrued tracking fee increases over the term of the securities which will have the effect of steadily reducing the value of the securities as time passes lastly any reduction in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of the issuer or guarantor may adversely affect the value of the securities you should understand that the value of your securities at any time prior to maturity may be significantly less than the issue price holders of the securities will not benefit from regulatory protections of the commodity futures trading commission or any similar non u s regulatory authority the securities are our direct obligations the net proceeds to be received by us from the sale of the securities will not be used to purchase or sell futures contracts for the benefit of the holders of securities an investment in the securities does not constitute an investment in futures contracts and holders of the securities will not benefit from the regulatory protections of the commodity futures trading commission the cftc or any similar non u s regulatory authority afforded to persons who trade in such contracts among other things this means that we are not registered with the cftc as a futures commission merchant and you will not benefit from the cftc s or any other non u s regulatory authority s regulatory protections afforded to persons who trade in futures contracts on a regulated futures exchange through a registered futures commission merchant for example the price you pay to purchase the securities will be used by us for our own purposes and will not be subject to customer funds segregation requirements provided to customers that trade futures on an exchange regulated by the cftc unlike an investment in the securities an investment in a collective investment vehicle that invests in futures contracts on behalf of its participants may be subject to regulation as a commodity pool and its operator may be required to be registered with and regulated by the cftc as a commodity pool operator or qualify for an exemption from the registration requirement because the securities will not be interests in a commodity pool the securities will not be regulated by the cftc as a commodity pool we will not be registered with the cftc as a commodity pool operator and you will not benefit from the cftc s or any non u s regulatory authority s regulatory protections afforded to persons who invest in regulated commodity pools if the index is discontinued we may redeem the securities early for an amount that may result in a significant loss on your investment the index administrator is not required to publish the index throughout the term of the securities the index administrator may permanently cancel the index including for example as a result of a discontinuance of trading of the index s underlying futures contract if the index is discontinued we will redeem the securities for an amount per security equal to the redemption amount determined as of the date of publication of the last available closing level of the index prior to the date of such discontinuance the redemption amount in this scenario may be less than the stated principal amount and you may lose up to your entire initial investment subject to the minimum redemption amount in addition the redemption amount may be significantly less than the amount you would have received had you instead been able to hold the securities to maturity for example the index may be discontinued as the result of a market disruption that had a significant adverse effect on the level of the index before the discontinuance and thus on the redemption amount that market disruption may be resolved by the time of the originally scheduled maturity date and had your payment on the securities been determined on the scheduled final valuation date you might have achieved a significantly better return if a commodity hedging disruption event occurs during the term of the securities we may redeem the securities early for an amount that may result in a significant loss on your investment if a commodity hedging disruption event occurs we may redeem the securities prior to the maturity date for an amount equal to the redemption amount determined as of the early redemption notice date see description of the securities commodity hedging disruption event in the accompanying index supplement for more information the redemption amount in this scenario may be less than the stated principal amount and you may lose up to your entire initial investment subject to the minimum redemption amount in addition the redemption amount may be significantly less than the amount you would have received had we not elected to redeem the securities and had you been able instead to hold them to maturity for example the redemption amount may be determined during a market disruption that has a significant adverse effect on the redemption amount that market disruption may be resolved by the time of the originally scheduled maturity date and had your payment on the securities been determined on the scheduled final valuation date rather than on the early redemption notice date you might have achieved a significantly better return our offering of the securities is not a recommendation of the index the fact that we are offering the securities does not mean that we believe that investing in an instrument linked to the index is likely to achieve favorable returns in fact as we are part of a global financial institution our affiliates may have positions including short positions in the eua futures contract underlying the index or in instruments related to such futures contract and may publish research or express opinions that in each case are inconsistent with an investment linked to the index these and other activities of our affiliates may affect the level of the index in a way that negatively affects the value of and your return on the securities the index level may be adversely affected by our or our affiliates hedging and other trading activities we expect to hedge our obligations under the securities through cgmi or other of our affiliates who may take positions in the eua futures contract underlying the index or in financial instruments related to such futures contract and may adjust such positions during the term of the securities our affiliates also take positions in the eua futures contract underlying the index or in financial instruments related to such futures contract on a regular basis taking long or short positions or both for their accounts for other accounts under their management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers these activities could affect the level of the index in a way that negatively affects the value of and your return on the securities they could also result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the securities declines ps 7 citigroup global markets holdings inc the securities calculation agent which is an affiliate of

securities risk factors relating to all securities our affiliate is the securities calculation agent and in that capacity may make important determinations with respect to the securities in the accompanying index supplement the u s federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities are unclear there is no direct legal authority regarding the proper u s federal tax treatment of the securities and we do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service the irs consequently significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain and the irs or a court might not agree with the treatment of the securities as prepaid forward contracts if the irs were successful in asserting an alternative treatment of the securities the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the securities might be materially and adversely affected moreover future legislation treasury regulations or irs guidance could adversely affect the u s federal tax treatment of the securities possibly retroactively if you are a non u s investor you should review the discussion of withholding tax issues in united states federal tax considerations non u s holders below you should read carefully the discussion under united states federal tax considerations and risk factors relating to the securities in the accompanying index supplement and united states federal tax considerations in this pricing supplement you should also consult your tax adviser regarding the u s federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or non u s taxing jurisdiction key risks relating to the index the following is a summary of key risks relating to the index the summary below should be read together with the more detailed risk factors relating to the index described in risk factors relating to the securities in the accompanying index supplement the following discussion of risks should also be read together with the section description of the citi commodities benchmark mono index eua emissions usd index in the accompanying index supplement which defines and further describes a number of the terms and concepts referred to below the index is subject to the risk of a decline in the price of a european union allowance the index tracks the performance of a hypothetical rolling position in a futures contract on a european union allowance or eua also referred to as a carbon emissions allowance the price of the eua futures contract will depend in significant part on the market price of an eua accordingly the index will be adversely affected by any decline in the market price of an eua the market price of an eua is determined by supply and demand supply is determined by the number of euas and other carbon allowances that are available to the market euas are currently issued annually by the member states of the european union pursuant to an allocation plan approved by the european commission and are based on agreements under the kyoto protocol any increase in supply could have a negative effect on the price of an eua the supply of euas is within the control of the member states of the european union if those states decide to increase the number of euas the price of an eua would likely decline alternatively if other carbon allowances are created or increase in supply that would also likely have an adverse effect on the price of an eua demand for euas is determined in significant part by the volume of carbon emitted during the year in relation to the annual allocation the main factors influencing volumes emitted in the short term are the weather relative fuel prices general economic activity and the amount of electricity generated from non fossil fuel sources increased fuel prices and or lower economic activity would be likely to reduce demand for euas and therefore reduce the price of an eua the increased usage of alternative sources of energy that do not rely on fossil fuel would also likely reduce demand for euas and therefore reduce the price of an eua furthermore if penalties for exceeding carbon emissions caps are lessened or are not enforced that would likely reduce demand for euas and therefore reduce the price of an eua it is impossible to predict whether the price of an eua will rise or fall if it falls the level of the index will be adversely affected the performance of the index is expected to be reduced by the carry cost associated with the eua futures contract and therefore is expected to underperform the price performance of the underlying eua the index provides exposure to the price of an eua futures contract and not to the spot price of an eua the value of the eua futures contract will fluctuate not only based on changes in the market value of the underlying eua but also based on factors that are unique to a futures contract such as supply and demand in the futures market the time remaining to the maturity of the futures contract and market interest rates over the term of the contract as discussed in more detail under description of the citi commodities benchmark mono index eua emissions usd index background on futures contracts generally in the accompanying index supplement these factors are likely to cause a position in the eua futures contract to reflect a carry cost which will lower the return on the futures contract as compared to a direct investment in the underlying eua accordingly we expect the performance of the index to generally reflect changes in the value of its underlying eua as reduced by a carry cost we expect the carry cost to rise if market interest rates rise the index is subject to currency exchange rate risk the level of the index is denominated in u s dollars but the underlying eua futures contract is traded in euro to calculate the index level the daily return of the underlying eua futures contract in euro terms is converted into u s dollars if the underlying eua futures contract has a positive return from one index business day to the next this currency conversion feature means that the resulting positive return on the index will be less than it would have been ps 8 citigroup global markets holdings inc based on the underlying eua futures contract return alone if the euro decreases in value relative to the u s dollar over that period conversely if the underlying eua futures contract has a negative return from one index business day to the next this currency conversion feature means that the resulting negative return on the index will be greater i e more negative than it would have been based on the underlying eua futures contract return alone if the euro increases in value relative to the u s dollar over that period the index is subject to risks associated with non u s futures exchanges the index s eua futures contract is traded on a non u s futures exchange investments linked to the value of futures contracts that are traded on non u s exchanges involve risks associated with the markets in those countries including risks of volatility in those markets and governmental intervention in those markets the index is subject to uncertain legal and regulatory regimes the futures contract on carbon emissions allowances included in the index is subject to legal and regulatory regimes that may change in ways that could adversely affect the level of the index the effect of any future regulatory change including but not limited to any future changes to kyoto and various worldwide carbon legislation is impossible to predict but could cause unexpected volatility and instability in carbon emissions markets with a substantial and adverse effect on the performance of the index suspension or disruptions of market trading in the eua futures contract may adversely affect the level of the index futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors including the lack of liquidity in the markets the participation of speculators and government regulation and intervention in addition some futures exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuation in some futures contract prices that may occur during a single business day these limits are generally referred to as daily price fluctuation limits and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of these limits is referred to as a limit price once the limit price has been reached in a particular contract no trades may be made at a price beyond the limit or trading may be limited for a set period of time limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at potentially disadvantageous times or prices if these circumstances arise with respect to the eua futures contract tracked by the index they could adversely affect the level of the index changes in law or regulation relating to the eua futures contract may adversely affect the level of the index commodity futures contracts are subject to legal and regulatory regimes that impose significant regulatory requirements on the trading of such instruments and on market participants regulatory organizations such as the european securities and markets authority may seek to implement regulations that could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and depth of the commodities futures and derivatives markets including the markets for the eua futures contract any change in the application of these laws or regulations or any proposal of new laws or regulations affecting the eua futures contract or the carbon emissions allowances market generally may have a material adverse effect on the level of the index prices of commodity futures contracts are characterized by high and unpredictable volatility which could lead to high and unpredictable volatility in the index the market price of the eua futures contract included in the index tends to be highly volatile and may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors the prices of commodities and commodity futures contracts are subject to variables that may be less significant to the values of traditional securities such as stocks and bonds these variables may create additional investment risks that cause the level of the index to be more volatile than an index tracking the price of traditional securities the index is calculated on an excess return basis the index is calculated on an excess return basis and not on a total return basis as an excess return index the index reflects the returns that are potentially available through an investment in the notional positions held by the index by contrast a total return index in addition to reflecting those returns would also reflect interest that could be earned on funds committed to the trading of the underlying positions the index does not include such a total return feature the index has limited actual performance information the index launched on august 2 2021 accordingly the index has limited actual performance data because the index is of recent origin with limited performance history an investment linked to the index may involve a greater risk than an investment linked to one or more indices with an established record of performance a longer history of actual performance may have provided more reliable information on which to assess the validity of the index s methodology however any historical performance of the index is not an indication of how the index will perform in the future hypothetical back tested index performance information is subject to significant limitations all information regarding the performance of the index prior to august 2 2021 is hypothetical and back tested as the index did not exist prior to that time it is important to understand that hypothetical back tested index performance information is subject to significant limitations in addition to the fact that past performance is never a guarantee of future performance in particular o the index administrator developed the rules of the index with the benefit of hindsight that is with the benefit of being able to evaluate how the index rules would have caused the index to perform had it existed during the hypothetical back tested period the fact that the index generally appreciated over the hypothetical back tested period may not therefore be an accurate or reliable indication of any fundamental aspect of the index methodology o the hypothetical back tested performance of the index might look different if it covered a different historical period the market conditions that existed during the historical period covered by the hypothetical back tested index performance information are not necessarily representative of the market conditions that will exist in the future ps 9 citigroup global markets holdings inc it is impossible to predict whether the index will rise or fall the actual future performance of the index may bear no relation to the historical or hypothetical back tested levels of the index the index administrator and index calculation agent is our affiliate and may exercise judgments under certain circumstances in the calculation of the index although the index is rules based there are certain circumstances under which the index administrator or index calculation agent may be required to exercise judgment in calculating the index as described in more detail in the accompanying index supplement in exercising these judgments the fact that the index administrator and index calculation agent is our affiliate may cause its interests to be adverse to yours the index administrator and index calculation agent are not your fiduciaries and are not obligated to take your interests into account in calculating the index any actions taken by the index administrator and index calculation agent in calculating the level of the index could adversely affect the performance of the index an investment linked to the index does not constitute ownership of the eua futures contract underlying the index the index is described as tracking a hypothetical investment in the eua futures contract because there is no actual portfolio of assets to which any investor is entitled or in which any investor has any ownership or other interest the index is merely a mathematical calculation that is performed by reference to hypothetical positions in the index s eua futures contract and the other index rules hypothetical back tested and historical index performance information this section contains hypothetical back tested performance information for the index all index performance information prior to august 2 2021 is hypothetical and back tested as the index did not exist prior to that date hypothetical back tested index performance information is subject to significant limitations the index administrator developed the index rules with the benefit of hindsight that is with the benefit of being able to evaluate how the index rules would have caused the index to perform had it existed during the hypothetical back tested period the fact that the index generally appreciated over the hypothetical back tested period may not therefore be an accurate or reliable indication of any fundamental aspect of the index methodology furthermore the hypothetical back tested performance of the index might look different if it covered a different historical period the market conditions that existed during the hypothetical back tested period may not be representative of market conditions that will exist in the future the hypothetical back tested index information has been calculated by the index administrator the index administrator has advised us that it has calculated the hypothetical back tested index levels by applying the index methodology substantially as described under description of the citi commodities benchmark mono index eua emissions usd index to the actual published settlement prices of the underlying eua futures contract during the back tested period it is impossible to predict whether the index will rise or fall by providing the hypothetical back tested and historical index performance information below we are not representing that the index is likely to achieve gains or losses similar to those shown in fact there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular investment one of the limitations of hypothetical performance information is that it did not involve financial risk and cannot account for all factors that would affect actual performance the actual future performance of the index may bear no relation to the hypothetical back tested or historical performance of the index the graph below depicts the hypothetical back tested performance of the index for the period from january 3 2011 to august 1 2021 and actual historical index performance for the period from august 2 2021 to october 22 2021 on october 22 2021 the closing level of the index was 311 151 ps 10 citigroup global markets holdings inc

this article is more than 2 years old getty images while some advertising funded internet giants like facebook and snap inc are feeling the brunt of apple s recent data privacy changes google seems less worried today google parent alphabet inc reported a record 65 1 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2021 with the company s advertising business increasing 43 2 to 53 1 billion quarterly search advertising made up the bulk of revenue with 37 9 billion in the third quarter rising from 26 3 billion during the same period in 2020 youtube ads accounted for another 7 2 billion up from 5 billion in q3 2020 and google s ad network revenue brought in 7 9 billion according to google chief business officer philipp schindler retail advertisers were once again the key revenue driver over the past three months followed by advertisers in media and entertainment finance and travel industries e commerce and connected tvs are also fueling google s growth schindler said youtube s reach is becoming increasingly incremental to tv with connected tv being the fastest growing screen meanwhile brands including sephora target and walmart have been experimenting with the company s shoppable live streams the strong results come in the middle of an earnings season clouded by apple s recent changes to its data privacy settings the ios updates which allow users to opt out of letting companies collect their personal data and serve up hyper targeted ads have prompted many on wall street and madison avenue to speculate about how adoption might damage the broader digital advertising industry when asked by an analyst whether apple s data privacy changes impacted google s own advertising business alphabet chief financial officer ruth porat said they had a modest impact on youtube revenues primarily in direct response schindler then added that apple s efforts are just one aspect of the many broader ecosystem changes that are underway our focus is on supporting developers small and large advertisers creators publishers so that they are able to mitigate impacts to their businesses schindler said we really see the future of digital advertising being built on advances in privacy preserving on device technologies which support the free and open internet and obviously a robust ads ecosystem although google was able to avoid any major impact its rivals are facing setbacks last week snap inc s stock price plummeted 25 after missing quarterly revenue estimates by 130 million on a quarterly earnings call with investors snap founder and ceo evan spiegel said it underestimated the changes and that apple s new measurement solution did not scale as we had expected however he said the company s first party data was still leading to conversions at similar rates suggesting that the company would still find a way around the problems this has definitely been a frustrating setback for us spiegel said but i think over the long term these privacy changes and protecting privacy for users of ios and of course the snapchat community is really important for the long term health of the ecosystem it s something that we fully support facebook also blamed apple for its slower than usual growth on monday the social network reported third quarter ad revenue of 21 2 billion an increase of 33 more than the same period last year however facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg told investors that if it wasn t for apple s ios14 changes we would have seen positive quarter over quarter revenue growth the impact which facebook began noticing in the second quarter before hitting critical mass over the past three months led to weaker ad targeting that has driven up advertising costs along with making it harder to measure campaign effectiveness i think we re certainly going to be watching how advertisers react to the challenges with the apple platform and how that intersects with pricing as we get into the stronger demand season for q4 facebook cfo david wehner told investors during a follow up call because it s going to affect pricing and roi and when you have higher prices we ll just have to see what is the advertiser reaction in that environment as it relates to the targeting on the ios platform other companies had fewer complaints earlier today twitter which reported revenue and user growth that met analysts expectations said the impact it s seen from ios changes has remained modest however the company said it s still too early to know what the long term impact might be despite avoiding any major dents from apple s privacy google also faces a number of challenges on the regulatory front on friday a u s district judge unsealed an antitrust lawsuit filed by more than a dozen state attorneys general alleging google gave itself an unfair advantage through its digital advertising auctions that let the company win more auctions and charge far higher ad rates than its rivals the lawsuit also alleges that google colluded with competitors to rig parts of the digital advertising market and slow down various data privacy efforts from apple and regulators as one senior google employee admitted he analogy would be if goldman or citibank owned the nyse according to the lawsuit led by texas attorney general ken paxton or more accurately the analogy would be if goldman or citibank were a monopoly financial broker and owned the nyse which was a monopoly stock exchange google has disputed the lawsuit since it was originally filed in december in a statement emailed to forbes a google spokesman described the allegations as misleading and riddled with inaccuracies while claiming the company lets publishers keep more revenue than the lawsuit outlines in reality our advertising technologies help websites and

south korea teacher s credit union is adding btc to their balance sheet reports suggest that the union has nearly 40 billion in assets and they plan to start investing in btc from next year to gain exposure to bitcoin the credit union is planning to wait till a btc etf is launched in korea and this is expected to happen in the first half of 2022 they have no interest in buying bitcoin directly from exchanges what does this mean korea teacher s credit union will become the first pension fund in south korea to add btc to their balance sheet it means that in the future we can expect other pension funds to follow suit and allocate something to btc as well as of now i am dearly waiting for the launch of the first btc etf in south korea an official from the credit union said as there are some well made cryptocurrency linked etf products by asset managers such as korea s mirae asset global investments we plan to invest in the etf products after consultation with domestic asset managers as of now they have 40 of their assets in alternative assets 10 in domestic and 9 in foreign stocks so a hefty addition of btc will add an excellent balance to the portfolio other pension funds adding btc while korea teacher s credit union plans to add btc to their balance sheet the houston fund already did they look after 6 600 active and retired firefighters and their families active ones contribute 9 of their salary to the fund and the fund adds more than double that at present it is estimated to hold around 5 5 billion in assets and has invested 25 million into btc and eth this shows that as the price of btc hit an all time high the adoption rates are skyrocketing i think it s happening the period when we will see btc and crypto everywhere the adoption is at its peak almost every company fund the bank is getting involved in bitcoin in some way or the other maybe this is what it looks like before a parabolic bull run what are your thoughts on the koreateacher ss credit union adding btc and do you think that more pension funds in the country will follow it soon let us know in the comments below also if you found our content informative do like and share it with your friends also read square s cash app is now supported by sellers as a payment option
not long ago the notion of hard nosed institutional investors giving two hoots about the size of a company s carbon footprint would have been laughable miners were measured on how much iron ore they dug out how much profit they made and the size of their dividend the carbon dioxide emitted as part of the process would not have come into the equation but times have changed major shareholders are almost as likely to ask what a company is doing to curb its emissions as ask about its bottom line and bluechip firms around the world are falling over themselves to burnish their environmental credentials rio tinto generates more than 31m tons of carbon emissions a year as boris johnson prepares to host the cop26 climate change conference in glasgow from sunday the race among big corporates to achieve net zero carbon emissions is already well under way last week rio tinto announced plans to cut carbon emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 at a cost of well over 5bn in doing so it trumped rival bhp which earlier revealed plans to cut emissions by at least 30pc by 2030 before hitting net zero by the middle of the century some of the world s biggest carbon emitters from ftse 100 miners anglo american and glencore to oil and gas majors bp and shell have already announced their own net zero ambitions here in australia which is a massive exporter of fossil fuels governments have long dragged their heels on climate change only yesterday prime minister scott morrison pledged to achieve net zero by 2050 just in the nick of time he is due to fly to glasgow tomorrow however he said the plan would not include ending australia s fossil fuel industry or more ambitious targets for 2030 a key objective of the cop summit little wonder perhaps given the debate in australia has been framed by many as a battle between the metropolitan elites of sydney and melbourne and blue collar oil and gas workers in the bush who face losing their jobs but for all his previous resistance to net zero morrison is renowned as a pragmatist who does not want australia to be left behind as other countries shift to net zero economies last week rio tinto announced plans to cut carbon emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 at a cost of well over 5bn public support has rallied behind doing more to tackle climate change following the terrible black summer bush fires of two years ago and just like the bosses of rio and bhp he is fully aware that money talks and that the big money has already spoken more than 600 investors managing over 43trillion in assets have signed up to climate action 100 a pressure group set up in 2017 to persuade the biggest greenhouse gas emitters to tackle climate change the list of signatories reads like a who s who of the fund management industry from blackrock the world s largest fund manager to wall street giants goldman sachs and jp morgan as well as invesco and legal general they all believe the smart money is on companies which cut emissions and embrace new greener technologies whether it be solar energy or hydrogen power those which fail to do so will be left behind of course setting a target to achieve net zero is one thing doing it is another net zero carbon emissions means removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as is emitted by a combination of greener technologies and storing carbon in the ground getting to net zero particularly for miners responsible for between 4pc and 7pc of global greenhouse gas emissions will not be easy rio generates more than 31m tons of carbon emissions a year its chief executive jakob stausholm who will be among those schmoozing at the glasgow conference laid out his net zero strategy last week billions will be spent on wind energy and particularly solar power which is not in short supply in the iron ore heartlands of north western australia the goal is to fully electrify the giant mine rail and port system in the region but it faces an even bigger challenge in its global aluminium division which generates 70pc of its emissions in queensland and new south wales its smelters will be largely powered by coal until towards the end of the decade rio would require five gigawatts of wind and solar energy to power them it is a big task but a do able challenge stausholm insists but big investors will be holding rio to its promise

economics has a longstanding identity crisis when it comes to positive versus normative analysis the positive camp views the field as properly devoid of moral sentiment the normative camp thinks maximising social welfare is the discipline s mission the positives endorse only reforms delivering pareto gains winners without losers the normatives choose sides using economics to do most good at least harm nowhere is the conflict between the value free science of economics and the moral mission of political economy the discipline s original name clearer today than in the economics of climate change nordhaus seminal nobel prize winning work identified anthropogenic planetary heating as the world s most dangerous externality and carbon mitigation as the proper response nordhaus 1979 2017 he also raised a host of issues that now occupy a small army of climate scientists and economists the list includes the linkage between carbon emissions and atmospheric concentration the impact of carbon concentration on global mean temperature the dependence of regional on global temperature the sources sizes measurement and geographic distribution of damages the potential for tipping points global policy coordination uncertainty the role of green investment the green paradox and last but really first the optimal carbon tax yet for all its value added nordhaus invocation of a social planner whose intergenerational preferences dictate optimal climate policy inextricably conflated questions of economics and morality the 700 page stern climate report stern 2007 commissioned by the uk government adopted nordhaus approach however stern summoned forth a social planner who cared far more for posterity and therefore calculated a far higher optimal carbon tax in questioning the ethics of nordhaus social planner who had reigned supreme for years stern opened the flood gates in short order a bevy of economists including six current or future nobel laureates 1 were hotly debating the social planner s ethically correct time preference rate the rate at which to discount as in make less of the welfare of the unborn economists cherish scientific objectivity or at least the appearance of scientific objectivity hence when joined the social planner approach was quickly re packaged in positive terms the trick was to assume intergenerationally altruistic agents each of whom cared for their offspring but sadly no one else s the role of carbon policy was to keep these single agents from free riding on one another doing so involved maximising the representative single agent s utility which low and behold devolved to nordhaus selfsame social planner problem however the time preference rate could now be viewed as an objective component of household preferences not a matter of religious creed stated differently any given single agent model s weighting of the welfare of the unborn was suddenly rationalised as a matter of professional judgement about an objective quantity not an ethical declaration this ex post rationale might hold water were we to live in a world of intergenerational altruists we do not most people conduct their economic lives with little or no regard for the economic welfare of their immediate let alone future descendants this is plain as day in cohort and household data 2 greta thunberg got all this right in her 2019 united nations address you are failing us but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal the eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us i say we will never forgive you 3 unfortunately greta missed a golden opportunity to cut a deal with her nemeses imagine greta continuing her speech with these words since we cannot count on you to act morally let me propose bribing you to save the planet adopt a high global carbon tax however cut other taxes so on balance you are better off my and future generations will pay higher taxes to service the deficits you run and if you insist on helping yourself to the same degree as you help us cut your other taxes by enough to make that happen can today s and tomorrow s world uniformly gain from carbon taxation the ability to share the gains from taxing emissions and not just across generations but across regions 4 is inherent in the positive economics of externalities we demonstrate this well established critically important but routinely ignored point in three recent papers kotlikoff et al 2021a 2021b 2021c the papers feature life cycle models populated by unashamedly selfish agents who do what comes naturally burn fossil fuels to their pocketbook s content with no regard to its future damage in particular kotlikoff et al 2021c features 18 regions and 80 overlapping generations living in each region we model the relationship between carbon emissions and the global average temperature based on the latest climate science folini et al 2021 predicated average global temperature is used to determine via pattern scaling e g lynch et al 2017 kravitz et al 2017 and references therein region specific temperatures we posit a net damage function which like that of krusell and smith jr 2018 permits cold regions to potentially benefit from climate change and hot regions to experience extreme damages our new damage function generates the same aggregate damages as in nordhaus s dice model 5 given our updated climate module however unlike many other integrated assessment models we incorporate the costly extraction of coal oil and gas and model clean energy production taking account of its rapid rate of technological change without any carbon policy that is in the business as usual bau scenario many regions face a dire future figure 1 shows regions specific maximal future damages as a share of a region s gdp figure 1 regional bau losses and gains as percentage of gdp our primary focus is determining the carbon policy that delivers present and future mankind the highest uniform percentage welfare gains the uniform welfare improving or uwi policy arguably the policy with the highest chance of global adoption all agents current and future in all regions face lifetime net transfers that in conjunction with the optimal uwi carbon tax path generate the same percentage increase measured as a compensating consumption differential in full or remaining lifetime utility the optimal policy comes with substantial transfers between generations and regions figure 2 shows net transfers over time for each region figure 2 net transfers as a share of the present value of remaining or full lifetime consumption in the 6x case year 0 is 2017 in our solution regions that will suffer a lot from climate change make large transfers to northern regions which suffer much less or even gain thus our solution focuses on the transfers necessary to achieve a win win in the presence of climate change this entails particular generations in very poor regions like india making very large transfers as a share of their consumption because they gain the most from carbon taxation 6 our optimal uwi policy can deliver more than a 4 welfare gain to all of humanity the optimal uwi carbon tax starts at roughly 100 per tonne of co2 and rises in real terms at roughly 1 5 per year the optimal uwi carbon tax path rapidly ends coal production roughly halves the duration of oil and gas production reduces the peak global mean temperature increase by 1 5 degrees and dramatically reduces climate damage figure 3 shows our model s projected co2 emissions in each region under the bau scenario and under our optimal taxes in our model the decline of optimal emissions is dramatic in all regions figure 3 total co2 emissions measured in gtco2 as a function of years starting in 2017 we also examine how much carbon taxes can improve without a global effort it turns out that china s participation in uwi carbon policy is crucial without it peak global carbon damages will equal at least 60 of those under bau however even if china the us and europe jointly introduce taxes the optimal uwi carbon policy fails to be very effective the inability of subsets of regions to get close to the joint global optimum reflects in large part general equilibrium effects when one region or a subset of regions imposes carbon taxes they drive down the price of dirty energy this in turn leads non participating regions to increase their use of fossil fuels this black paradox is akin to the green paradox which we also examine in our paper postponing the implementation of the optimal uwi tax until 2040 taking into account its growth reduces the uwi gains from 4 35 to 2 73 delay reduces maximum uwi gains and increases emissions during the period of delay not only relative to immediate policy implementation but also relative to engaging in no policy for example 2030 carbon emissions are 13 higher than under bau concluding remarks to conclude economists have however inadvertently inserted moral sentiment into resolving the gravest of economic externalities they did this by first positing a social planner and then justifying that assumption by assuming something at full odds with man made climate change that current generations are intergenerationally altruistic indeed that they care at the margin as much about future generations as they care about themselves this practice adopted for it seems computational ease has kept climate policy as advanced by most economists hostage to ethics in so doing it has fostered a generational war far worse it has effectively vanquished analysis as well as discussion of the compensation bribes if you will needed to enact meaningful carbon taxation it is past time to set aside explicit and implicit irreconcilable debate over intergenerational fairness and let economics do what it s designed to do guide the sharing of gains and in the process get everyone on board to fix the problem references abel a and l j kotlikoff 1994 intergenerational altruism

prime minister scott morrison has handed down his plan to secure the nation s transition to carbon neutrality by 2050 in an australian way but not everyone is convinced by the government s revised climate policy mr morrison has sold the plan as a technology focused approach that gets the balance right between harnessing the opportunities and limiting the threats of the energy transition read more scott morrison unveils australia s plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 the commitment from the coalition has come only days before mr morrison leaves for the co26 united nations climate summit in glasgow but climate policy analysts are cautioning the response falls short on a lack of detail public modelling and failure to formally commit to a stronger short term target what is the government s plan fronting a press conference on tuesday mr morrison confirmed his government would go to glasgow with the net zero target for midcentury mr morrison announced the policy alongside a slideshow and accompanying document describing the response as uniquely australian our plan for net zero by 2050 is the plan i believe australians want because it gets it right he told reporters the plan outlines the government s intention to spend 20 billion on low emissions technologies by 2030 focusing on investments in hydrogen low cost solar and low emissions steel and cement it s also planning to invest in storing carbon underground through carbon capture and storage or sequestration this is expected to result in up to 60 to 100 billion in public and private investments over the same period it s not a revolution but a careful evolution to take advantage of changes in our markets mr morrison said grattan institute energy and program director tony wood said the plan marked a step forward but the technology roadmap didn t cover the ground required for a transition to net zero this isn t a plan to get to net zero by 2050 this is a plan to develop technologies that will contribute to that he told sbs news he described the response as necessary but not sufficient to reach the destination if we are going to be serious about this we have to complement the target and the technology plan with the policies and financial markets to deliver it he said no change to 2030 target the government s push to reach net zero by 2050 will be supported by an updated projection for 2030 to reduce emissions by 30 to 35 per cent but it won t formally update its current official short term target to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 on 2005 levels countries had been called on to increase the ambition of the climate pledges ahead of the cop26 summit with the united states promising a 50 to 52 per reduction and britain 68 per cent by 2030 mr morrison holds a document outlining his net zero emissions plan source aap some pacific nations had also been pleading with australia to cut harder its emissions sooner professor will steffen from the climate council said australia s short term response was unlikely to improve the reception of its response in glasgow we ll still be at the laggard back of the pack what glasgow was really looking for is more ambitious targets he told sbs news our standing will be still very low in terms of the global mix when we go into glasgow how will australia get to net zero the government s plan says australia s emissions have reduced 20 per cent since 2005 and explains how it expects the transition to net zero to be completed according to the plan almost half of the remaining 80 per cent reduction would be secured through the technology roadmap global technology trends are expected to account for 15 per cent of emissions reduction by 2050 while international and domestic offsets represent 10 to 20 per cent in cuts a further 15 per cent is expected to be achieved through technological breakthroughs but the australian institute s climate and energy program director richie merzian has raised concerns that the plan s reliance on offsets focuses too heavily on prolonging the life of fossil fuel industries a good net zero by 2050 plan should be based on technology that works now not technology that supports fossil fuel industries to do less in the future he told sbs news can the plan achieve political consensus despite the net zero midcentury target now being unanimously agreed to by the coalition and labor political division over climate policy continues in canberra one point of contention is the government s decision not to reveal the modelling behind the plan with mr morrison indicating this would be released eventually labor s climate change spokesperson chris bowen said the policy response was a scam that did little to update the government s technology roadmap released last year i ve seen more details in fortune cookies than the documents released by the government today he told reporters read more these young australians have an urgent message for scott morrison ahead of cop26 opposition leader anthony albanese also wouldn t say if his party would adopt the coalition s updated 2030 emissions projections as a target what we ve said very clearly is that we would await glasgow and what comes out of glasgow before we finalise all of our policies when it comes to climate change mr albanese said the greens who want net zero by 2035 have also criticised the climate policy for not taking stronger short term action how has it been received the climate plan claims it will improve gross national income by 1 6 per cent compared with inaction and floats the creation of 62 000 new roles in regional mining and heavy industry australian chamber of commerce and industry welcomed the practical response it said would help achieve the technological and economic

san diego business wire oct 26 2021 today ethos asset management inc usa announced the formation of ethos asset sa pty ltd in johannesburg a recent creation and addition to the ethos group the company was incorporated on october 18 th 2021 by the president and ceo of ethos asset management inc usa carlos santos in johannesburg this new operation and physical presence will enable ethos to overcome some of the challenges in receiving financial guarantees and other financial instruments into its usa banks given certain strict south african banking regulations the ethos team is relying on the fact that south africa has a very well developed modern banking system that will allow ethos to conduct its ongoing day to day financing activities in the southern african development community sadc region and to penetrate new markets by providing much needed investment in local businesses corporations governments and community based organisations the company considers this move to be a significant development in the continued growth and expansion of the ethos group the move will go far to address the cross border banking and finance laws which are tightening globally this new local presence in south africa is designed to support ethos transactions and increase operations each day with sadc countries and the continent of africa as a whole carlos santos president and ceo of ethos stated we were very excited and motivated to establish a subsidiary of ethos in south africa this will provide new african clients and potential partners in the region with the opportunity to be financed by ethos dynamically efficiently and personally recent changes to cross border laws and the continuing crisis of covid have significantly affected the banking system several banks in the united states where ethos conducts primary operations closed their international trade desks to protect their potential exposure to the default of other institutions and reduce overall risk to the sector and some bankers believe that this internal policy reduces general systemic risk johnnie eigelaar ceo jn equity pty ltd in cape town said this is a significant step in creating the ability to have alternative funding in south africa that is generated off shore but raised and re paid in south africa without having the usual risks of exchange rate fluctuations and exchange control requirements attached to off shore funding models this initiative will not only assist south africa with raising affordable funding with favourable terms for all types of projects but also the greater sadc region and africa as a whole by utilising the well established network and footprint that sadc businesses and banks have in africa what is refreshing is that the focus is funding not management or control just funding a great added product brought to the table by ethos is the philanthropic financing facility which would have a real impact for local businesses and community based projects which are looking to make a sustainable difference thabo motea cfo ethos said south africa is the most sophisticated and developed economy in africa and has some high class companies in finance real estate and business services

by julia chatterley calls for increased regulation of facebook continue to grow louder after leaked internal documents became public and whistleblower frances haugen s testimony showed that the social media platform has repeatedly failed to rein hate speech and misinformation on friday a consortium of 17 us news organizations began publishing stories collectively called the facebook papers based on hundreds of internal company documents which were provided by haugen s legal counsel the consortium which includes cnn reviewed the redacted versions received by congress cnn s julia chatterley spoke with roger mcnamee co founder of elevation partners an early facebook investor and former adviser to mark zuckerberg about the criticism the company faces and what regulation of the social media platform should look like here s what he had to say chatterley i vividly remember you telling me that back in 2016 you went to sheryl sandberg and you went to mark zuckerberg and you said guys you ve got a problem and you have to get ahead of this and i listened back to how mark spoke on conference call and earlier in the show i sort of referred to it as denial what do you make of his response in the face of what we ve seen in the last 24 hours mcnamee julia i think mark zuckerberg has an enormous public relations problem he has been very successful for years at deflecting criticism by claiming a right to free speech the problem is that the underlying business model of facebook where you bring three billion people onto one network with no boundaries and no safety net then combine that with a business model that s based on essentially promoting emotionally intense content in order to promote engagement and then add into that the ability to target people with extreme precision and the result is that an enormous number of ideas that have lived for years at the fringes of society things like white supremacy and anti vax have suddenly been thrust into the mainstream and done huge damage and so there s really nowhere for mark to go on this issue he can attempt to deflect it but i think the evidence that francis haugen provided is unequivocal and it s from facebook s own internal research chatterley i mean he says facebook says it s being taken out of context to your point and i mentioned this at the top of the show it s half the world in terms of monthly active users it s now 3 6 billion people around the world that are using one of these products and we had the outage of their products two weeks ago where it felt like for small businesses they couldn t operate most of us were working out how we could call people and we had to go back to traditional forms i mean we ve had so many examples of how powerful facebook become are we at the point now where for lawmakers there is no choice mcnamee i would like to think that s true julia because the problem is not social media the problem is this business model and the culture of relentlessly pursuing profit at all costs when companies like facebook and google and amazon get to be the scale of a nation so that they act like governments the conflict with democracy are unavoidable and we as a country are faced with a moment of truth either congress and the courts are going to pursue their job which is to basically protect consumers or we re done because if you think about it almost every major problem we have going on in this country is made worse by internet platforms like facebook and we have a need for something that looks like a food and drug administration to ensure safety of tech products we need to have privacy so that people are not manipulated by corporations that know absolutely everything about them and then obviously as you point out we need some kind of competition regulation that makes sure that small businesses are not held captive to a single platform chatterley facebook just announced their earnings and said look we re spending 5 billion on safety measures but we re going to spend 10 billion investing in augmented reality and that part of the business which to me is quite fascinating and actually investors continue to reward them for monetizing in very dangerous ways as you ve pointed out with the algorithm in the way that more eyeballs are generated with extreme content i don t really see any sort of break here in terms of changing behavior for advertisers going to facebook in small business cases because they have to because this is how they get access to consumers facebook as you said is a profit maximizer in continuing to do this and you like to see you would hope that this is a point where regulators step in to change things but that takes time it could be years roger mcnamee julia i think in the interim we need the judicial system to do its job one of the things that became clear from francis haugen s releases is that facebook has crossed some legal lines that create great jeopardy for example think about there was a whole wall street journal article that was about human trafficking that is a clear felony and facebook knowingly allowed it to take place on its platform there s a ton of evidence from the francis haugen files that facebook knowingly did not do everything it could have done to prevent stop the steal from turning into a violent insurrection we also know from other cases where redactions were removed last week that there is an antitrust case in texas the attorney general of that state is pursuing facebook and google for price fixing and digital advertising and the redactions seem to suggest a tremendous awareness of those two companies that they re violating antitrust law which is itself a violation and that is again a felony at the federal level and so i think if we see the securities and exchange commission pursuing the opportunities it has relative to disclosure and insider trading and if we see the justice department going after human trafficking the insurrection and the other aspects that have come up there like antitrust then i believe you re going to buy time for regulators to pass legislation to do what they need to do chatterley also the information that you provide to investors surely and how truthful you re being in terms of the impact that you re having with investors to your point the last time we checked human trafficking facilitating the drug trade was illegal does that go right up to mark zuckerberg and to sheryl sandberg mcnamee well there is a case in delaware where i believe six pension plans including i think some state pension plans have sued facebook for a failure to properly disclose what was going on during cambridge analytica the implication of which was that the stock sales made by the executives were in fact in violation of insider trading rules and these things are really serious and it is incumbent upon the securities exchange commission to do an investigation and if they find that the evidence that has been revealed is correct to actually pursue a case and i do think that is if you re going to have a rule of law if you re going to have a democracy you have to enforce the laws and you have to defend democracy and that s really the choice we re all faced with today chatterley the benefit of having huge power and huge wealth like a company like this is that you can afford to hire lobbyists and i think anyone who spent time in washington d c or brussels knows the power of that kind of expenditure and the voices in ears care to imagine roger how much they re spending on lobbyists and how many people they ve hired in washington mcnamee yeah i mean the answer is tens of millions of dollars for facebook alone but the industry the big tech companies are the largest spenders in washington by a lot and i believe that s also true in brussels and the one piece of advice i have for all governments outside the united states is to pursue the aspect of this that is most appropriate for you so in europe privacy regulations really are paramount i think in the way people think about it and the general data protection regulation has proved to be grossly inadequate they really need to think about banning the use of any kind of intimate data in third party transactions so think about health care location financial web browsing applications use that kind of stuff which is so intimate and allows manipulation you know that s the kind of thing that any country can ban inside its borders you don t need a coordinated response here because these companies are so dangerous that each country has its own way of looking at it and i would encourage them all to pursue the right course for them chatterley you know very quickly as i was poring over the information in the facebook papers this weekend i was furiously texting using whatsapp calling my family back home using whatsapp the irony is not lost on me of the utility value to me personally while i have this conversation how do you price those two things mcnamee it s really hard i mean people ask me all the time should i get off these things and i say look if you re a small business it s really hard to get off of facebook if you re a rock and roll band it s impossible to get off of facebook and whatsapp is so important to people across borders and the issue isn t the products themselves it s the business model it s the culture of facebook and companies like it which basically compromise the interests of the people who use their products constantly and that s what we have to stand up and defend the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights

rio tinto leads the way as miners join race to net zero with the firm announcing plans to cut carbon emissions by half by 2030 rio tinto trumped rival bhp which earlier revealed plans to cut emissions by at least 30pc by 2030 before hitting net zero by the middle of the century the company generates more than 31m tons of carbon emissions a year its chief executive jakob stausholm laid out his net zero strategy last week not long ago the notion of hard nosed institutional investors giving two hoots about the size of a company s carbon footprint would have been laughable miners were measured on how much iron ore they dug out how much profit they made and the size of their dividend the carbon dioxide emitted as part of the process would not have come into the equation but times have changed major shareholders are almost as likely to ask what a company is doing to curb its emissions as ask about its bottom line and bluechip firms around the world are falling over themselves to burnish their environmental credentials as boris johnson prepares to host the cop26 climate change conference in glasgow from sunday the race among big corporates to achieve net zero carbon emissions is already well under way last week rio tinto announced plans to cut carbon emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 at a cost of well over 5bn in doing so it trumped rival bhp which earlier revealed plans to cut emissions by at least 30pc by 2030 before hitting net zero by the middle of the century some of the world s biggest carbon emitters from ftse 100 miners anglo american and glencore to oil and gas majors bp and shell have already announced their own net zero ambitions here in australia which is a massive exporter of fossil fuels governments have long dragged their heels on climate change only yesterday prime minister scott morrison pledged to achieve net zero by 2050 just in the nick of time he is due to fly to glasgow tomorrow however he said the plan would not include ending australia s fossil fuel industry or more ambitious targets for 2030 a key objective of the cop summit little wonder perhaps given the debate in australia has been framed by many as a battle between the metropolitan elites of sydney and melbourne and blue collar oil and gas workers in the bush who face losing their jobs but for all his previous resistance to net zero morrison is renowned as a pragmatist who does not want australia to be left behind as other countries shift to net zero economies last week rio tinto announced plans to cut carbon emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 at a cost of well over 5bn public support has rallied behind doing more to tackle climate change following the terrible black summer bush fires of two years ago and just like the bosses of rio and bhp he is fully aware that money talks and that the big money has already spoken more than 600 investors managing over 43trillion in assets have signed up to climate action 100 a pressure group set up in 2017 to persuade the biggest greenhouse gas emitters to tackle climate change the list of signatories reads like a who s who of the fund management industry from blackrock the world s largest fund manager to wall street giants goldman sachs and jp morgan as well as invesco and legal general they all believe the smart money is on companies which cut emissions and embrace new greener technologies whether it be solar energy or hydrogen power those which fail to do so will be left behind of course setting a target to achieve net zero is one thing doing it is another net zero carbon emissions means removing as much greenhouse gas from the atmosphere as is emitted by a combination of greener technologies and storing carbon in the ground getting to net zero particularly for miners responsible for between 4pc and 7pc of global greenhouse gas emissions will not be easy rio generates more than 31m tons of carbon emissions a year its chief executive jakob stausholm who will be among those schmoozing at the glasgow conference laid out his net zero strategy last week billions will be spent on wind energy and particularly solar power which is not in short supply in the iron ore heartlands of north western australia the goal is to fully electrify the giant mine rail and port system in the region but it faces an even bigger challenge in its global aluminium division which generates 70pc of its emissions in queensland and new south wales its smelters will be largely powered by coal until towards the end of the decade rio would require five gigawatts of wind and solar energy to power them it is a big task but a do able challenge stausholm insists but big investors will be holding rio to its promise
let s just say up front that there continue to be conflicting signals about whether or not inflation is a very short term problem or something that might last a while just today goldman sachs released a research note saying inflation resulting from supply chain issues will continue into next year but will be on a steep decline and should be back around 2 a little over a year from now but the alternative view that inflation could be around longer is picking up steam and that could be very bad news for president biden advertisement today the ny times notes that a critical metric called the break even point an estimate of what investors in the bond market think inflation will be going forward jumped up to about 3 percent for the first time in more than a decade last friday a key measure of the bond market s expectations for inflation over the next five years known as a break even rose to a new high friday briefly topping 3 percent that meant investors expected inflation to average about 3 percent a year for the next five years far higher than any time in the decade before the pandemic hit measures of inflation expectations over longer periods such as over the next 10 years also rose to multiyear highs while the fed chair jerome h powell and other central bank officials have spent months saying higher inflation was a transitory result of pandemic driven supply chain problems there has lately been good reason to believe that price rises could be a more lasting concern analysts say the crucial concern for bond market investors was that prices seemingly unrelated to the pandemic were also beginning to move higher foremost among them was monthly rents which tend to rise for long stretches once they start moving upward rents jumped 0 5 percent from august to september the quickest rise in about 20 years energy prices also jumped 25 percent last month driven by sharp increases in gasoline and fuel oil costs rising crude oil prices are behind the surge and there is little sign that those pressures are going away any time soon advertisement when bond investors look at all of these surging prices they move their investments from regular bonds to inflation protected bonds this article from yahoo news explains how comparing the yields of the two types of bonds gives an estimate of what investors in this market think inflation will be over a given time period so let s say that you have a 10 year cd certificate of deposit that has yielded 5 over the course of the investment nominal yield you also hold an inflation linked investment that has yielded 2 9 over the same time period real yield in this case your breakeven inflation rate is 2 1 5 2 9 2 1 this would indicate that over the next 10 years today s investors expect inflation to average around 2 1 of course that number isn t guaranteed it s simply an expectation based on the inflation rate of today and over the last 10 years using that same example if you believe that in the next 10 years inflation will average more than 2 1 you may want to consider purchasing treasury inflation protected securities tips if you believe that inflation will average less than 2 1 in the coming decade a nominal treasury might be the better choice for your portfolio the ny times was specifically looking at the break even rate on five year bonds which is at 2 99 today so investors buying up inflation protected bonds are essentially betting that inflation over the next five years will be higher than 2 98 percent if it is they ll make more on those protected bonds than they would have on regular non inflation adjusted bonds again that doesn t mean it will happen it just means that serious investors are betting it will and because these are big time investors the federal reserve will pay attention to those expectations advertisement elsewhere the times points out that longer term inflation would be very bad news for president biden and democrats in general an inflation surge is presenting a fresh challenge for mr biden who for months insisted that rising prices were a temporary hangover from the pandemic recession and would quickly recede instead the president and his aides are now bracing for high inflation to persist into next year with americans continuing to see faster and sustained increases in prices for food gasoline and other consumer goods than at any point this century that reality has complicated mr biden s push for sweeping legislation to boost workers expand access to education and fight poverty and climate change and it is dragging on the president s approval ratings which could threaten democrats already tenuous hold on congress in the 2022 midterm elections recent polls shows americans concerns over inflation are eroding their economic confidence and dimming their view of mr biden s performance democrats were already facing an uphill battle in next year s midterms but put that aside for a moment no matter what else it s about every presidential election is about the economy if inflation is high for the next three years the argument for biden s reelection or that of kamala harris if biden bows out will evaporate like people s paychecks indeed the times notes some economists are already saying the inflation we re seeing is self inflicted the result of handing out too much money during a supply chain crisis advertisement some economists including veterans of previous democratic administrations say much of mr biden s inflation struggle is self inflicted lawrence h summers is one of those who say the stimulus bill the president signed in march gave too much of a boost to consumer spending at a time when the supply chain disruptions have made it hard for americans to get their hands on the things they want to buy mr summers who served in the obama and clinton administrations says inflation now risks spiraling out of control and other democratic economists agree there are risks the original sin was an oversized american rescue plan it contributed to both higher output but also higher prices said jason furman a harvard economist who chaired the white house council of economic advisers under president barack obama higher inflation sets the country up for a change election in 2024 and that s bad news for joe biden and democrats

ethos asset management inc usa expands and incorporates subsidiary in south africa tweet today ethos asset management inc usa announced the formation of ethos asset sa pty ltd in johannesburg a recent creation and addition to the ethos group the company was incorporated on october 18th 2021 by the president and ceo of ethos asset management inc usa carlos santos in johannesburg this new operation and physical presence will enable ethos to overcome some of the challenges in receiving financial guarantees and other financial instruments into its usa banks given certain strict south african banking regulations the ethos team is relying on the fact that south africa has a very well developed modern banking system that will allow ethos to conduct its ongoing day to day financing activities in the southern african development community sadc region and to penetrate new markets by providing much needed investment in local businesses corporations governments and community based organisations the company considers this move to be a significant development in the continued growth and expansion of the ethos group the move will go far to address the cross border banking and finance laws which are tightening globally this new local presence in south africa is designed to support ethos transactions and increase operations each day with sadc countries and the continent of africa as a whole carlos santos president and ceo of ethos stated we were very excited and motivated to establish a subsidiary of ethos in south africa this will provide new african clients and potential partners in the region with the opportunity to be financed by ethos dynamically efficiently and personally recent changes to cross border laws and the continuing crisis of covid have significantly affected the banking system several banks in the united states where ethos conducts primary operations closed their international trade desks to protect their potential exposure to the default of other institutions and reduce overall risk to the sector and some bankers believe that this internal policy reduces general systemic risk johnnie eigelaar ceo jn equity pty ltd in cape town said this is a significant step in creating the ability o have alternative funding in south africa that is generated off shore but raised and re paid in south africa without having the usual risks of exchange rate fluctuations and exchange control requirements attached to off shore funding models this initiative will not only assist south africa with raising affordable funding with favourable terms for all types of projects but also the greater sadc region and africa as a whole by utilising the well established network and footprint that sadc businesses and banks have in africa what is refreshing is that the focus is funding not management or control just funding a great added product brought to the table by ethos is the philanthropic financing facility which would have a real impact for local businesses and community based projects which are looking to make a sustainable difference thabo motea cfo ethos said south africa is the most sophisticated and developed economy in africa and has some high class companies in finance real estate and business services manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade south africa is the gateway to africa for investors due to its comparative sophistication ease of doing business continental expertise and ability to act as a base for critical services e g auditing for doing business on the rest of the continent i am especially

half its original size president joe biden s big domestic policy plan is being pulled apart and reconfigured as democrats edge closer to satisfyingtheir most reluctant colleagues and finishing what s now about a 1 75 trillion package how to pay for it all remained deeply in flux tuesday with a proposed billionaires taxrunning into criticism as cumbersome or worse that s forcing difficult reductions if not the outright elimination of policy priorities from paid family leave to child care to dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors the once hefty climate change strategies are losing some punch too focusing away from punitive measures on polluters in a shift toward instead rewarding clean energy incentives pressure mounting biden met tuesday evening with two holdout democrats sens joe manchin of west virginia and kyrsten sinema of arizona according to a person who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting the president is pushing for an agreement before he departs for global summits later this week get new england news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for necn newsletters all told biden s package remains a substantial undertaking and could still top 2 trillion in perhaps the largest effort of its kind from congress in decades but it s far slimmer than the president and his party first envisioned house speaker nancy pelosi told lawmakers they were on the verge of something major transformative historic and bigger than anything else ever attempted in congress according to another person who requested anonymity to share her private remarks to the caucus we know that we are close said rep joyce beatty d ohio the chair of the congressional black caucus after a meeting with biden at the white house and let me be explicitly clear our footprints and fingerprints are on this however vast differences among democrats remain over basic contours of the sweeping proposal and the tax revenue to pay for it from the white house press secretary jen psaki said biden still hoped to have a deal in hand to show foreign leaders the u s government was performing effectively on climate change and other major issues but she acknowledged that might not happen forcing him to keep working on the package from afar she warned about failure as opposed to compromise the alternative to what is being negotiated is not the original package she said it is nothing more lawmakers journeyed to the white house for negotiations on tuesday and emerged upbeat that the end product would be substantial despite the changes and reductions being forced on them by manchin and sinema together the two senators have packed a one two punch manchin forcing supporters to pare back health care child care and other spending and sinema causing democrats to reconsider their plans to reverse the trump era tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy resolving the revenue side is key as biden insists all the new spending will be fully paid for and not piled onto the national debt he vows any new taxes will hit only the wealthy those earning more than 400 000 a year or 450 000 for couples and corporations he says must quit skipping out on taxes and start paying their fair share but the white house had to rethink its tax strategy after sinema objected to her party s initial proposal to raise tax rates on corporations and the wealthy with a 50 50 senate biden has no votes to spare in his party instead to win over sinema and others the democrats were poised to unveil a new plan for taxing the assets of billionaires and on tuesday they unveiled a proposal to require corporations with more than 1 billion in income to pay a 15 minimum tax winning sinema s backing here s the heart of it americans read over the last few months that billionaires were paying little or no taxes for years on end said sen ron wyden of oregon chairman of the senate finance committee helming the effort under wyden s emerging plan the billionaires tax would hit the wealthiest of americans fewer than 1 000 people it would require those with assets of more than 1 billion or three years consecutive income of 100 million to pay taxes on the gains of stocks and other tradeable assets rather than waiting until holdings are sold a similar billionaire s tax would be applied to non tradeable assets including real estate but it would be deferred with the tax not assessed until the asset was sold overall the billionaires tax rate had not been set but it was expected to be at least the 20 capital gains rate democrats have said it could raise 200 billion in revenue that could help fund biden s package over 10 years republicans deride the billionaires tax and some have suggested it would face a legal challenge and key fellow democrats were also raising concerns about the billionaires tax saying the idea of simply undoing the 2017 tax cuts by hiking top rates was more straightforward and transparent rep richard neal d mass the chairman of the ways and means committee said our plan looks better every day under the bill approved by neal s panel the top individual income tax rate would rise from 37 to 39 6 on those earning more than 400 000 or 450 000 for couples the corporate rate would increase from 21 to 26 5 the bill also proposes a 3 surtax on the wealthiest americans with adjusted income beyond 5 million a year less concerned about

plans to expand medicare coverage with dental vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors child care assistance free pre kindergarten a new program of four weeks paid family leave and a more limited plan than envisioned to lower prescription drug costs on climate change coal state sen manchin rejected biden s earlier clean energy strategy as too punitive on providers that rely on fossil fuels instead the white house floated an ideato beef up grants and loans to incentive clean energy sources manchin s resistance may scuttle one other tax idea a plan to give the irs more resources to go after tax scofflaws he said he told biden during their weekend meeting at the president s home in delaware that that plan was messed up and would allow the government to monitor bank accounts

photo metrosideros polymorpha kalapana hawaii by brocken inaglory cc by sa 3 0 via wikimedia commons design advocates have been pointing out the logical and evidential problems with adaptive radiation for many years for example see here for casey luskin s comments darwinians insist that their theory can handle these cases of rapid evolutionary change even the cambrian explosion even though darwin himself preferred a theory of slow gradual accumulation of small variations his modern disciples say that the environment forces adaptations to occur rapidly sometimes but remain static other times surely some of them must have secret doubts about the special pleading put forth in spite of the evidence for example amy mcdermott in pnas embeds evolutionary assumptions into a darwinian narrative that pictures environments causing diversification he knew that bursts of rapid species formation often accompany transitions to new habitats if fish arose in the oceans but then invaded freshwater multiple times perhapsthey d gone through bursts of speciation that explain the relatively high diversity of freshwater fish per unit area today a habitat however has no foresight to cause a fish to adapt it has no power to force rare beneficial mutations to appear that could be selected much less could it do this in bursts of speciation the fish would easier go extinct unless something else is going on genetically super abundant code here s a new idea to ponder choi et al publishing in pnas have proposed a very un darwinian account of how spectacular adaptive radiations occur on oceanic islands such as hawaii this has been a paradox of evolutionary biology they admit maybe the diversity is an outworking of ancient polymorphisms of ancestors with a rich gene pool some of the most spectacular adaptive radiations of plants and animals occur on remote oceanic islands yet such radiations are preceded by founding events that severely limit genetic variation how genetically depauperate founder populations give rise to the spectacular phenotypic and ecological diversitycharacteristic of island adaptive radiations is not known we generated genomic resources for hawaiian metrosideros a hyper variable adaptive radiation of woody taxa for insights into the paradox of remote island radiations we posit that divergent selection and differential sorting of an unexpectedly rich pool of ancestral variation drove the diversification of lineages recurring use of ancient variants from a richer than expected gene pool may explain how lineages can diversify to fill countless niches on remote islands there s a hypothesis you may wish to consider the genetic diversity was already present in the ancestors before now evolutionists have assumed that an organism will have only the genes it needs to survive if instead the ancestors had a richer than expected gene pool when they entered a new habitat adaptive radiation amounts to a sorting out of existing information not the creation of new information by neo darwinism s mutation selection process a large pool of ancestral variants would have served as readily available genetic variation for adaptation without the waiting times required for de novo adaptive mutations indeed we discovered that genomic divergence and potentially the genetic basis of reproductive isolation between early diverging metrosideros taxa was shaped by divergent selection targeting ancestral variations over evolutionary young de novo variations design and foresight it would be reasonable to expect an intelligent designer to have the foresight to do this if the goal was to fill the earth with living creatures able to adjust to a wide variety of environments the solution would be to enrich the operating system of each type with a rich pool of code and apps for handling unforeseen challenges more than would be needed for the initial launch darwinism by contrast would not expect to keep code around that was not being used it should be stated that the authors are not denying darwinism adaptive radiations demonstrate the remarkable power of natural selection as a driver of biological diversity they say their attention is on islands which they believe to be a special case adaptive radiations on remote oceanic islands are especially interesting as colonization of remote islands is expected to involve population bottlenecks that restrict genetic variation adaptive radiations in such settings are especially impressive and even paradoxical given the generation of high species richness from an initially limited gene pool several classic examples of adaptive radiation occur on oceanic islands such as darwin s finches from the galapagos islands anole lizards from the caribbean islands hawaiian drosophilids and hawaiian silverswords to name a few the authors chose a plant because there are no genomics studies of plant adaptive radiations in geographically restricted systems such as remote islands the example they researched is a woody plant in the hawaiian islands metrosideros that exhibits considerable diversity after what they believe was a single founder event hawaiian metrosideros is a landscape dominant hypervariable and highly dispersible group of long lived possibly 650 y woody taxa that are nonrandomly distributed across hawaii s heterogeneous landscape including cooled lava flows wet forests and bogs subalpine zones and riparian zones about 25 taxa or morphotypes are distinguished by vegetative characters ranging from prostate plants that flower a few centimeters above ground to 30 m tall trees and leaves range dramatically in size shape pubescence color and rugosity faced with the paradox of the founder effect in traditional neo darwinism which should have caused inbreeding and genetic decline instead of adaptive radiation they took a different approach our findings suggest that diversification of hawaiian metrosideros was facilitated by reassortment of an unexpectedly rich pool of ancestral polymorphisms considering other hypotheses they discounted other hypotheses they knew that a single founder with a limited genome should degenerate due to inbreeding if there were several founders however offering more standing variation hybridization and introgression could only go so far did multiple species arrive in hawaii independently unlikely they say because of the distance from the presumed ancestral home in australia or its closest transfer point in the marquesas islands south of the equator 3 000 km away they consider polyploidy as a source of genetic variability but it is not certain how much of the radiation can be attributed to the duplication of functional genetic elements or to the ploidy increase itself nor is the variability simply a case of phenotypic plasticity experiments on heritable traits indicate that the morphotypes are distinct genetic groups genetic comparisons with specimens from new zealand and other pacific islands support their remaining hypothesis the ancestral stock was already rich with genetic diversity phylogenetic analysis produced a reticulate network diagram not a branching tree probably due to subsequent hybridization of the diversifying populations after all their genomic analysis of 131 individuals from 11 taxa found across the islands they decided our findings suggest that diversification of hawaiian metrosideros was facilitated by reassortment of an unexpectedly rich pool of ancestral polymorphisms they believe their conclusion can shed light on other cases like the african cichlid fish and darwin s finches new functional mutations did not just pop into existence by chance there was considerable ancestral polymorphism in the gene pool that was able to be sorted in various ways lego diversification speaking of cichlids mcdermott entertains a similar non darwinian explanation for the rapid diversification of these darwin icon fish in african lakes she quotes evolutionary biologist ole seehausen from the university of bern whose team found similar genomic richness in those populations they found hundreds of distinct dna regions strongly tied to different ecological niches and scattered across 22 chromosomes we think that s the key to make hundreds of species and not just two or three seehausen says when the fish hybridize they can rearrange these modular genes almost like lego bricks he says to build many possible combinations suited for example to a rocky inshore fish that feeds on insects or one that eats the same bugs but lives in weedy lake grass explaining diversity by ancestral genomic richness relieves biologists of having to claim that 500 new species evolved in just the last 15 000 years by the old neo darwinian process of waiting for beneficial mutations to show up it might also relieve them of having to wave the magic wand of convergent evolution if ancestral genomic richness equipped organisms to adapt the case of convergence in marine mammals see yuan et al in pnas could be reconsidered with that in mind and another rethink could come for junk dna that has misled evolutionists for decades researchers at the whitehead institute at mit are looking at non coding regions as locations where adaptation is occurring they re calling it the origin of species dna edition which is very different from darwin s conception the light went on for researchers when they realized that the difference between apes and humans for instance may reside in the non coding regions that had been dismissed as junk after we realized the function the fact that satellite dna is quite different between species really hit like lightning yamashita said all of a sudden it became a completely different investigation follow up questions the conclusion by choi et al about ancestral genomic richness could be expanded by researchers not already sold on neo darwinism id friendly geneticists could look for additional examples of this explanation for spectacular radiations in biology the distribution of super abundant functional information implies top down overdesign rather than bottom up emergence what a great starting point for taking the speciation problem out of naturalism and into intelligent design specifically some follow up questions for design research might be as follows

san diego business wire today ethos asset management inc usa announced the formation of ethos asset sa pty ltd in johannesburg a recent creation and addition to the ethos group the company was incorporated on october 18th 2021 by the president and ceo of ethos asset management inc usa carlos santos in johannesburg this new operation and physical presence will enable ethos to overcome some of the challenges in receiving financial guarantees and other financial instruments into its usa banks given certain strict south african banking regulations the ethos team is relying on the fact that south africa has a very well developed modern banking system that will allow ethos to conduct its ongoing day to day financing activities in the southern african development community sadc region and to penetrate new markets by providing much needed investment in local businesses corporations governments and community based organisations the company considers this move to be a significant development in the continued growth and expansion of the ethos group the move will go far to address the cross border banking and finance laws which are tightening globally this new local presence in south africa is designed to support ethos transactions and increase operations each day with sadc countries and the continent of africa as a whole carlos santos president and ceo of ethos stated we were very excited and motivated to establish a subsidiary of ethos in south africa this will provide new african clients and potential partners in the region with the opportunity to be financed by ethos dynamically efficiently and personally recent changes to cross border laws and the continuing crisis of covid have significantly affected the banking system several banks in the united states where ethos conducts primary operations closed their international trade desks to protect their potential exposure to the default of other institutions and reduce overall risk to the sector and some bankers believe that this internal policy reduces general systemic risk johnnie eigelaar ceo jn equity pty ltd in cape town said this is a significant step in creating the ability to have alternative funding in south africa that is generated off shore but raised and re paid in south africa without having the usual risks of exchange rate fluctuations and exchange control requirements attached to off shore funding models this initiative will not only assist south africa with raising affordable funding with favourable terms for all types of projects but also the greater sadc region and africa as a whole by utilising the well established network and footprint that sadc businesses and banks have in africa what is refreshing is that the focus is funding not management or control just funding a great added product brought to the table by ethos is the philanthropic financing facility which would have a real impact for local businesses and community based projects which are looking to make a sustainable difference thabo motea cfo ethos said south africa is the most sophisticated and developed economy in africa and has some high class companies in finance real estate and business services

been primarily from the continued demand for wet slips and dry storage needs for our members forward demand for dry storage and wet slip rental is ahead of where they were at this time last year in large part through our best in class marina network locations and services we have also remained active and growing and improving our portfolio in the third quarter through the date of this earning s call we had 22 properties across our three segments deploying over 500 million of capital and adding over 7 400 sites our recently acquired four lease portfolio of nine manufactured housing communities in the midwest comprises of over 2 500 high quality sites with expansion growth opportunities and ample room for existing vacancies on the marina side our acquisitions of puerto del rey puerto rico our largest marina in the caribbean continues to strengthen our irreplaceable network of marina assets puerto del rey now allows for a safe harbor member to remain within the network while traveling from the northeast all the way down to the caribbean our acquisition teams remain extremely active and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities we are seeing across each of sun s business segments furthermore we have a proven track record of maximizing value from our acquisitions as we integrate them onto the sun platform this includes adding value for our operational platform proprietary technologies the scale of our marketing and booking platforms including campspot and potential repositioning of acquired properties as the leading industry consolidator we believe our cycle tested ability to create value through acquisitions will continue to result in attractive accretive growth this activity is supported by the ongoing proactive focus and maintaining financial flexibility additionally we are continually evaluating our portfolio for assets which no longer fit with our long term strategic and growth objectives to that end in the third quarter we completed the disposition of six assets or total sales price of 162 million representing a blended cap rate the low fours that further demonstrates the value of sun s portfolio we have a deep bench of incredibly talented team members a well positioned balance sheet and a healthy pipeline and internal and external growth opportunities and we remain optimistic in our ability to deliver on each of our performance objectives i ll now turn the call over to john to discuss our operational performance john john b mclaren president and chief operating officer thank you gary sun delivered a strong third quarter across the board outperforming our previous expectations our results reflect the combination of the stability of our best in class portfolio as well as the contributions from our growth initiatives across all three of our business segments for the third quarter combined same community manufactured housing and rv noi increased 12 4 from the third quarter 2020 the growth in noi was driven by a 12 8 revenue gain supported by a 150 basis point increase in occupancy to 98 9 and the 3 7 weighted average rental rate increase our expenses were up 13 7 from the prior year same community manufactured housing noi increased by 2 6 from 2020 and same community rv noi increased by 30 6 and our rv growth was 15 2 for the quarter as a result of a 5 rental rate increase and the effect of over 100 conversions to annual leases over the trailing 12 months our retransient revenues were up 29 compared to last year this is on top of the 5 transient growth we experienced in the third quarter of 2020 over 2019 when we began to see the benefits of travelers who are seeking drive through vacation options and took advantage of our resorts in desirable destinations when we issued second quarter results in late july we shared the transient rv revenue for the second half of the year was 15 2 ahead of the original budget today an accounting for the third quarters actual contribution it has accelerated to 18 3 ahead of original budget as of this earnings call our fourth quarter transient rv revenue is 19 6 ahead of the original budget the increased levels of consumer engagement discussed last quarter have continued year to date rv website traffic is up 10 compared to last year and 120 compared to 2019 and we have seen our social media following and interaction continue to grow with more than 1 4 million followers on the three major platforms instagram facebook and tiktok our best salespeople have always been our residents and guests and their reach to spread the word has been meaningfully amplified through our social media engagement we have also continued to sign up members to our pilots sun rv resorts loyalty program and while it s still in its early days initial interest and feedback has been very positive in short we believe we are seeing strong evidence of two important trends first that many travelers are learning now and trying out an rv vacation and second once travelers have discovered their sunnier side through an rv vacation it becomes part of their future vacation considerations additionally sun has simplified the reservation process with our campspot platform which in turn enhances the demand for rv vacations at sun rv resorts with respect to our total mh and rv portfolio we continue to pursue our strategy of filling existing vacancy and creating additional revenue producing opportunities through expansion and conversions in the third quarter we gained 576 revenue producing sites of our revenue producing site gains over 430 were transient rv sites converted to annual leases with the balance being added to our manufactured housing expansion communities we have now converted almost 1 200 transient rv sites to annual leases year to date which exceeds any prior full year figure and demonstrates the successful execution of this internal growth lever the rv site conversions result in an average 50 increase in site revenues during the first year of conversion with an additional benefit of transient site scarcity pushy rates moving on to new construction in the third quarter we delivered over 320 new sites approximately 70 of which were greenfield ground up developments and the remainder were expansions to existing communities one of the ground up developments delivered this quarter was the next phase of smith creek crossing a manufactured housing community in granby colorado the first phase of 82 sites has been filling up rapidly since opening a year ago and we anticipate this next phase to continue to see the high demand for attainable housing in the area and home sales in the third quarter were also strong home sales volume was up 64 year over year as we sold more than 1 100 homes in the quarter these results are a clear reflection of the value proposition that the sun manufactured housing community offers the healthy demand for these homes and the home value is maintained in our communities applications to live in a sun community are up 13 2 year to date and we anticipate we will continue to see strength in our manufactured housing business given the tight housing market and the demand for quality attainable housing turning to the marina business we ended the quarter with 120 properties comprising nearly 45 000 wet slips and dry storage spaces which includes the acquisition of six properties for approximately 250 million completed in the third quarter same marina rental revenue growth for the portfolio of 75 properties owned and operated by safe harbor since the start of 2019 with 17 8 for the nine months of 2021 over 2019 this is a cagar increase in rental revenue of 9 9 for the quarter and 8 5 year to date through the end of september 2021 better than expected performance in the marina portfolio continues to come from demand for wet slips and dry storage spaces we have also witnessed higher margins on the service business with water del marina center and drive being the leading contributors to this outperformance great service creates stronger slip rental demand and higher member retention in summary sun s growth engines continue to deliver strong results our internal levers are driven by the fundamentals of sun s operating platform and by expansion site deliveries our total image portfolio stands at approximately 97 occupancy providing us with more than 200 basis points of occupancy upside as well as additional growth potential by adding further expansion sites over time in the rv business robust transient demand continues we also anticipate continued momentum and conversions of transient annual leases each year we expect to build on our successful track record of delivering and filling expansion sites we have an inventory of 7 500 expansion sites a portion of which we intend to strategically deliver each year targeting 10 to 14 unlevered irrs in addition our external growth pipeline is robust across all three businesses with opportunities to continue to consolidate each industry as well as pursuing selective ground up developments we are pleased for our performance year to date and we expect to continue delivering on our objectives karen will now discuss our financial results in more detail karen karen j dearing executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer and secretary thanks john for the third quarter sun reported core ffo per share of 2 11 31 9 above the prior year and 0 05 ahead of the top end of our third quarter guidance range outperformance was achieved across annual and transient rv and marinas during its subsequent to quarter end we acquired approximately 500 million of operating properties bringing our year to date total to 1 1 billion adding 38 properties totaling nearly 12 000 sites to support our operations and growth expectations we have been active in enhancing our balance sheet and in capital markets activity which provides the capacity and flexibility to pursue our ongoing growth pipeline last quarter we received investment grade ratings which provides us with an additional attractive source of financing subsequent to the end of the third quarter we issued 600 million of senior unsecured notes in our second bond offering of the year across seven and 10 year maturities additionally we utilized our atm program and completed the sale of 21 4 million of forward shares of common stock we ended the second quarter with 4 7 billion of debt outstanding at a 3 3 weighted average rate and a weighted average maturity of 9 6 years as of september 30 we had 72 million of unrestricted cash on hand and a net debt to trailing 12 months recurring ebitda ratio of 4 9 times we are raising our full year 2021 core ffo guidance to a range of 6 44 to 6 50 per share a 0 16 increase at the midpoint from our prior range this increase includes our outperformance in the third quarter with the remainder due to contributions from recent acquisitions and increased expectations across each of our businesses we expect core ffo for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 1 24 to 1 30 per share we are also increasing full year same community noi growth guidance to a range of 10 9 to 11 1 up 70 basis points from the previous midpoint of guidance of 10 3 the fourth quarter same community noi growth guidance is 7 2 to 8 as a reminder our guidance includes acquisitions through the date of this call but does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions or capital markets activities which may be included in research analyst estimates this completes our prepared remarks we will now open the call for questions operator questions and answers karen j dearing executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer and secretary thank you our first question is from nick joseph with citi please proceed with your question nicholas joseph citigroup global markets inc analyst thank you i was hoping you d provide some more commentary around the marina performance versus underwriting so for full year 2021 what s contemplated in updated guidance versus your initial expectations for safe harbor karen j dearing executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer and secretary overall the marina portfolio has been outperforming our initial underwriting annual and transient both slips and storage rents have been outperforming service nois have been outperforming i think there s a little offset for utility expenses and some payroll and incentive costs in the marina portfolio but we our guidance into the end of the year does include some amount of outperformance and certainly the impact of the acquisitions that the marina port that we ve done in the marina portfolio nicholas joseph citigroup global markets inc analyst thanks can you quantify the outperformance gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer we have it broken out i d say i think the churn is nicholas joseph citigroup global markets inc analyst can you move closer to the microphone it s very hard to hear you gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer sure we are having a little bit of audio difficulties at sun s today so i apologize for those as we got started at the beginning of the meeting can you hear me ok now nicholas joseph citigroup global markets inc analyst yes a little bit you must be on a boat at safe harbor gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer i wish i could tell you i was floating up and down on the waves but we are here in southfield michigan doing what we always do i think we don t have it broken up out follow up and discuss a little bit more with karen but the best thing that we can point to is that we re getting those strong third quarter results as compared to 19 of 9 9 growth in and year to date 8 5 and as karen indicated the demand for wet slips and dry slips similar to rv with boat sales increasing especially the large boat sales year over year at the highest level from what i understand that there s been just more and more demand and at the end of this month we ll mark the 12 month one year period of time since we closed on the transaction with safe harbor as we ve indicated it is outperforming our initial underwriting but we re also very pleased that the acquisitions once put on the safe harbor operating platform have been outperforming our underwriting there as well so we do experience in the marina side exactly what we re experiencing in mh and rv and have been for the last 20 plus years once put on a very professional best in class platform as they have at safe harbor we are extracting greater returns than initially underwritten so same kind of outperformance nicholas joseph citigroup global markets inc analyst thanks and then what s your appetite for additional marina international expansion and can you talk through the strategic rationale of any additional acquisitions there gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer yes nick i think we ve shared it on our calls before we will be looking at a few points of international marina acquisitions the benefit and then part a lot of what we re seeing with the outperformance relates to the strategic footprint and networking that the safe harbor management team has been able to design i talked about in my remarks you can start in maine today even a little north of maine being in safe harbor marina and travel all the way down to the caribbean staying in the network now what we d like to do is be able to keep that network transatlantic if you will and we will look for a couple of points where our larger vessels in particular who had to one side of the ocean for half of the year and the other side of the atlantic for the other half of the year and stay in the safe harbor network so nothing to share on that yet but we are working diligently to find a couple of points transatlantic nicholas joseph citigroup global markets inc analyst thank you operator our next question comes from keegan carl with berenberg please proceed with your question keegan carl berenberg analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions first just a bit more color on the same community rv noi growth i guess how much of it was a function of volume versus pricing and then on the labor side of things do you think your noi was actually improved by the current labor shortage john b mclaren president and chief operating officer yes this is john so in the quarter we saw about a little bit over 15 increase on the rate side and about 8 increase in occupancy so that s kind of the splits for that what was the second question i m sorry i missed that keegan carl berenberg analyst yes on labor so do you guys think it actually was a tailwind for noi growth just given there is a current labor shortage and you probably have less people working than anticipated john b mclaren president and chief operating officer well i mean we just like everybody else we had a little bit of shortage particularly at the beginning of the season with our seasonal help that we have with the communities but nothing of significance keegan carl berenberg analyst okay john b mclaren president and chief operating officer i think one of the things that we discussed on our last call with regard to that any savings we might have had from the shortage of people was really eroded by how we took up our wages at that level and when you increase them to attract new personnel you ve also got to raise your existing personnel to those new higher wages and that was started to be incorporated first and second quarter and actually is in our guidance through the end of the year and we expect to incorporate it into 2022 keegan carl berenberg analyst got it and then on marinas can you give us a little additional color on the reconfiguration of certain assets what is the typical cost associated with this and how long does it take to transform what goes into determining what specific locations are best for it and as it s completed how much revenue uplift do you anticipate on it removing moving smaller slips and adding larger ones john b mclaren president and chief operating officer is that specifically to marinas or is that to all of our platforms keegan carl berenberg analyst yes specifically to marinas gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer it s gary and well i don t have those specific numbers for you i can share that we look to get low double digit 12 13 14 returns on the capital invested for that type of repositioning average length of time to combine the docks and perhaps make them more efficient for the larger boats is approximately 12 months that can be longer if permitting slows things down certainly can be in the covid environment but it is a big part of the long term plan just as it is in the mh and rv where reconfigure mh and rv sites but oftentimes that the zoning and entitlement is there works great to ground just to the beginning and build the community up all over again that s not the case with marinas it s mostly just reconfiguring the slip sizes keegan carl berenberg analyst great thanks for your time operator our next question comes from joshua dennerlein with bank of america please proceed with your question joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst yes good morning everyone hope everyone is doing well i saw that the number of rental homes over the quarter dropped it seemed to drop a fair bit was that driven by the asset sales you did or just higher convergence throughout the quarter karen j dearing executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer and secretary hi josh yes you ticked both of the reasons so you re seeing the impact of the dispositions of those six properties within them what there were about 625 rental homes and on a year over year basis we converted about 200 more rental homes to owner occupied and so both of those things are impacting the rental program joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst okay awesome awesome and then i m curious on the marina front any new initiatives on that side of the business for 2022 i know this year you launched a in august in newport is there a possibility to kind of expand that to other markets and then also i d love to hear just an update on how that went john b mclaren president and chief operating officer yes what was the beginning of it with regard to marina and new initiatives what was the beginning of the question joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst yes just curious on if there are any new initiatives on the marina upfront for 2022 gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer yes i think i wouldn t reference any of them as new i would say they re a continuation of just a very unique opportunity to roll up the best of the best i mean when you look at the quality of management and quality of the existing marinas the focus is really membership and networks so that we can keep all of the safe harbor members within the safe harbor network so it s really about the geographic footprint as i mentioned earlier north to south east to west when we get into the inland lakes the ability oftentimes to travel from one of the oceans from one of the inland lakes to the st lawrence seaway things like that so that network remains very very important the usage again securities for sun is opening up a lot of doors with regard to the long standing relationships the safe harbor management team has with mom and pop owners who for estate planning and tax planning have not been able to sell even though they might like to so i think that you ll continue to see a lot of the same but we ll have the ability to be enormously selective and really acquire only the what we refer to as the best of the best as we build out the platform going forward so we remain enormously excited about the opportunity here again i touched on it already it s the same ability to be able to harness accelerated growth by acquiring a marina and putting it on the safe harbor platform applying the management skills the economy skill the technology so a very very exciting place i d also add what was really interesting to realize that even after almost 1 billion of acquisitions since we ve acquired safe harbor less than a year ago percentage of rental revenue today 18 to 19 is exactly where it was when we acquired the platform and it just indicates the continued opportunity within the mh and rv platform as well so for one year out we re really pleased with what we see joshua dennerlein bank of america analyst awesome thanks operator our next question comes from wes golladay with baird please proceed with your question hey good morning everyone i had a follow up on the safe harbor and the marina acquisitions at this point how much of your targeted marina network do you have today gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer it s great question wes we also shared with the market when we acquired the safe harbor platform we had a approach that said we would look to take percentage of rental revenues up to perhaps 24 25 of the entire portfolio as i indicated we re currently still at 18 19 with the 1 billion of acquisitions so we really have a great opportunity we ve shared the cap rates being 200 basis points to 300 basis points greater than mh rv in some cases more a great benefit of the network effect the relationships from the founders the builders and the patriots at safe harbor the brewer family is one we often refer to their networking effect so we really do have a really bright future ahead of us with regard to potential acquisitions so we really expect to be disciplined we re probably selectively acquiring about 20 of what s being reviewed so really a lot of headroom to go moving forward wesley golladay robert w baird co analyst okay and then i guess when we look at the footprint of safe harbor it looks like the west coast is where you re lightest is that going to be a little bit harder to build up gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer i would suggest everything seems to be a little bit more expensive on the west coast so there is no doubt about that but we carefully are focused on where the greatest growth boat sales and slip demand is that will lead to the greatest value creation for our stakeholders so we are working on the west coast but i d suggest very selectively a lot more demand on the east side of the country right now than the west side wesley golladay robert w baird co analyst got it and then if i could just switching gears real quick to campspot can you update us on how many third party sites are now affiliated with the application and then what we are bookings for the platform in the third quarter john b mclaren president and chief operating officer yes i can tell you we ve got on the reservations side we ve got over 1 000 folks that are using that system throughout the rv universe gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer i don t think we have any more updated information at this time other than we re extraordinarily excited about what s taken place there and the fact is that a new ceo has been put in place and we re really excited about the opportunity in front of us with campspot wesley golladay robert w baird co analyst okay thanks everyone gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer yes there s nothing like it out there in the rv world right now so it s the first of its kind wesley golladay robert w baird co analyst all right thanks operator our next question is from john pawlowski with green street please proceed with your question john pawlowski green street advisors analyst thank you john or karen could you provide a breakdown of the major expense line items that drove the 14 growth in the quarter and just give us a sense for how long we should expect double digit growth expense growth to continue karen j dearing executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer and secretary sure john so i ll break it down between manufactured housing and rv so mh expenses were higher notably in payroll obviously due to the proactive wage increases that we discussed last quarter the client repair expense i believe a comparable period in 2020 was low i don t think we were up to full operations last quarter so that growth would be higher finally we had higher than expected real estate tax assessments florida trim notices came in and then we had some significant assessment increases texas had some also although we are appealing a number of those assessments the third quarter really reflects the cumulative nine month impact of those higher assessments that s mh rv variable expenses were up due to really the higher transient activity things like supply and repair vacation rental expense utilities that s really based on just the higher transient activity and it also was impacted by the wage increase that we discussed i think as you think about what we are implying for fourth quarter same community growth i think you re looking at with that 7 2 to 8 noi growth you re looking at revenues in the 7 to some of the 7 8 and opex in the maybe 6 7 to 7 5 range john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay and just in terms of what s going on right now in the labor market and your proactive stance and increase in wages and then repair and maintenance can you just help us bracket reasonable best and worst case scenarios for expense growth over next year just help us understand what kind of on the labor side and the repair and maintenance and the pressure on expense growth karen j dearing executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer and secretary that kind of a tough one to put up we don t really have any we don t have guidance out for next year so it s tough to give you specifics on that i would think that with the wage increase that we did put in place that proactive wage increase it s something that was pretty pretty standard for wage increases i think that if you just think about expenses overall and potential inflation impact since we already did wages we ve got let s say we re in the process of renewing our property insurance right now so we ll have a better idea on pricing very near term we already talked about real estate taxes and how dependent they are on assessments and we hope successful appeals so that leaves supply and repair expenses that have that potential inflationary pressure no different than any other company any operating business so and supply and repairs are about 12 to 13 of our opex so i think that s as much color as i can provide you on seeing something for next year john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay no i understand but the payroll the increases to payroll costs are those largely done now or should we expect another batch of large increases next year karen j dearing executive vice president treasurer chief financial officer and secretary well because we put them in in the third and fourth quarter we expected the whole impact to be about 16 million and so we would have anticipated 8 million that would hit next year john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay last one for me john could you just provide some color on how you re approaching the rental rate settings for mh renewal increases that you ll be sending out these next few months john b mclaren president and chief operating officer sure as you know john we take a very long term approach virtually with everything we do it s our continued reassessment of the communities as well as the predictability of our rent increases is a big part of the reason why our residents live within our communities an average of 14 years and as you probably know this really saves on the cost of turnover which is not much in any given year it s really sort of a balancing act as i might have shared before and i think it s important to remember that the rate increase is just one of the growth levers that we have certainly occupancy growth is a big case as we ve seen over the years it s important to maintain resident equity in their homes and improve it because that actually helps our home pricing and margins at the same time because of the growth there we are keenly focused on the social responsibility side of things with the rent increase as we ve shared before especially hopefully the later stages of covid but really it s about consistency across all of our stakeholders and the kind of performance that we ve had over the last 20 years in our noi it s been very consistent and so i think last year we finished out at about a 3 4 weighted average increase that we had and i think i said in my remarks that we re at 3 7 for this year so we re seeing that expand a bit but once again i m not really in a position to really guide to anything in 2022 at the time but i think you can see sort of the trajectory where it s moving john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay that helps thank you very much operator our next question is from anthony powell with barclays please proceed with your question anthony powell barclays analyst hi good morning you mentioned that you are making good progress in converting transient rv sites to annual and that s helping you on the pricing side on the transient rv spaces how do you balance pricing versus getting more new customers interested in rv ing and what s the optimal mix between annual and transient sites in any given rv community john b mclaren president and chief operating officer good question i think the way to answer your question is to first off is back to what we ve seen in the rv portfolio overall i mean all the performance indicators continue supporting the transient rv and rv overall is stronger than ever there s a lot to unpack with that vacations continue to be drawn to the outdoors even as air travels opened up over the course of this year when we look at internally just kind of going through the numbers again we saw 30 over 30 growth in transient rv noi each quarter while 15 2 rv in annual revenue growth and those 1 500 conversions over the last 12 months you were referring to and one of the drivers of that has been we ve had over 143 000 new customers status on our rv resort in the first three quarters of 2021 our web based traffic is up another 10 from the historical site high from last year and a lot of increase in guests that are of younger ages 18 to 24 and the 25 to 34 buckets and then everything we re doing our social media with 1 4 million followers across three major platforms that are out there and so from the balance perspective it s really going to be determined based on the function of a resort and even within a resort that s going to be a function of how much revenue is being derived by a single site within the resort certainly if we re getting no let s just say 20 000 of revenue annually on a site that would have if we converted to an annual and it s getting 15 that s not a conversion that we would do but in sites that are having a lower revenue we are converting those sites first and so it s really sort of that optimal mix but it s really on a per community per resort basis versus than looking at something sort of overarching across the portfolio anthony powell barclays analyst and just how do you replenish those lost transient sites once you convert them is there a way for you to do that gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer can you say that one more time anthony powell barclays analyst well have you replenished a transient site that converted if you want to i guess continue to attract new customers into those sites into the community so if you convert one transient site into annual do you then aim to i guess add a new transient site elsewhere in the community john b mclaren president and chief operating officer if it s possible i mean we look all over all over our portfolio and add expansions to our existing communities gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer i don t think we look at it on a community by community basis but more on a portfoliowide basis so two things happen we look for transient opportunities in the acquisition pipeline where john and his team can convert as we ve shared so when we do convert a transient to annual the first year of pickup in revenue is approximately 50 on that site so acquisitions team members will be guided when we want to focus and rv transient and when we went to shut it off in the acquisitions period of time right now 1500 sites through the first three quarters is the highest level of conversions that we ve seen so you will probably see us reduce naturally the amount of transient by the conversions and then at that time we would seek to acquire more properties so we can have that conversion opportunity and then as john mentioned the expansion finding the ground adjacent or oftentimes being able to acquire rv communities that have expansion opportunity as we did this last quarter is what we d focus on to replenish it anthony powell barclays analyst got it maybe one more for me the home sales numbers have been very strong is this sort of a new run rate of home sales for you or it will even further and is there any kind of one time bump in home sales given just all the increased demand due to covid dislocation migration any color there would be great john b mclaren president and chief operating officer i think it s a run rate we can expect maybe with a little bit more growth in front of it too so i mean that s what we aim for each year and it s just some incremental pickup in terms of clients price and margin and then really on the price and the margin side it s really got a lot to do with all of it frankly as once again it speaks to the high quality of the communities and the demand that s out there for affordable housing and that s what we offer so i d expect it to grow a little bit gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer yes the only thing i d add anthony where we one of the restrictors is vacancy so we build expansion sites so that we can fill them up and sell homes and then secondly in our acquisition strategy which we ve shared over the last 15 plus years being able to buy vacancy within a existing community is really very accretive for us for the portfolio that we closed on this quarter is a great example of that we have the opportunity as a well capitalized and experienced manager to take the opportunity of those vacancies and accelerate the sales and the occupancy and enhance early growth in those properties so those kinds of opportunities are really something we d like to focus on john b mclaren president and chief operating officer and then i d also just add in properties that have a higher occupancy we re seeing nice growth in our brokered resident to resident resale transactions picking up sales to that vehicle as well anthony powell barclays analyst okay thank you operator our next question is from michael goldsmith with ubs please proceed with your question michael goldsmith ubs analyst good morning thanks a lot for taking my question acquisitions this quarter seem to be a little bit more tilted toward properties with development opportunities or land that can be developed is that a conscious effort maybe a reflection of the returns you can get from development relative to mature properties john b mclaren president and chief operating officer yes absolutely i mean we like the combination of all of it i mean acquiring operating assets are accretive that we can expand the yield on as well as ones like gary was just talking about where the vacancy upside to pickup through occupancy gains that is exactly in our wheelhouse and something that we ve demonstrated for many years that we re very good at michael goldsmith ubs analyst do you think that becomes a bigger part of the growth algorithm going forward john b mclaren president and chief operating officer yes michael goldsmith ubs analyst that s helpful and building off the prior question as you have your conversations with communities for the upcoming year you said you kind of mentioned that rate growth had kind of accelerated from last year and it could look to pick up a little bit more how does that breakout between all age communities and age restricted communities and then separately are these communities are they asking for new or different amenities in a post covid world gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer i think i mean typically you re going to see on average you re going to see a higher increase in all age community then you do in an age restricted community as far as the addition of amenities as part of that process that s something from a capital improvement standpoint and again the long term perspective that we have it s just a continual thing for us anyway and it s not really the trade as much as it s just what we do ok continue to keep the communities beautiful so that we can grow them with all the different levers that we have michael goldsmith ubs analyst thank you very much operator there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to gary shiffman for closing remarks gary a shiffman chairman and chief executive officer well i ll apologize for any audio difficulties today we re certainly going to look into this new system we installed we thank everybody for participating this is a management team that is as excited as ever to
