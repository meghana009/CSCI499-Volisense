san diego california sirhan sirhan the man alleged to have assassinated robert kennedy at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5 1968 has been recommended for parole sirhan a christian was convicted of slaying kennedy however there is considerable evidence that he was not responsible for the late attorney general s death sirhan was originally sentenced to death but that sentence was later commuted to life in prison after sirhan agreed on his lawyer grant cooper s advice to admit to the shooting even though he had no recollection of it cooper who was widely criticized for this tactic and for not investigating the crime had offered the jury the concession to sway the jury from recommending the death sentence for his client sirhan an exercise boy at racetracks and a stock clerk and delivery boy at a health food store at the time and to this day says he has no recollection of shooting kennedy and was badly advised by his legal counsel there is plenty of evidence to suggest sirhan did not fire the fatal shot kennedy at the ambassador hotel in los angeles was shot at point blank range from behind the bullet piercing just below his ear the autopsy performed by chief medical examiner coroner thomas noguchi concluded the gun had been fired no more than one or 2 inches from kennedy sirhan however a 24 year old palestinian immigrant on a jordanian passport was standing several feet in front of him and shooting indiscriminately another problem for sirhan s legal team was that they were only provided with the autopsy report well into the trial just as there is significant doubt about the killer of his brother john kennedy in dallas texas in 1963 robert kennedy s death too has been clouded with speculation it has been suggested sirhan may have been subjected to coercive hypnosis in a real life version of the manchurian candidate several witnesses said he was in a trance like state it is known that well into the 1960s the cia had a project in operation that was in full experimentation mode whereby individuals were being hypnotized and instructed to carry out actions in a waking state and to say things that would be compatible with the actions they were instructed to undertake other evidence to throw doubt on sirhan s role in the assassination is that a number of witnesses swore that up to 13 shots were fired at the time when sirhan s gun only held eight bullets robert kennedy jnr a lawyer who was just 14 when his father was assassinated says he harbours doubts about sirhan s guilt he visited him in prison a little over two years ago i went there because i was curious and disturbed by what i had seen in the evidence he told the washington post at the time i was disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father my father was the chief law enforcement officer in this country i think it would have disturbed him if somebody was put in jail for a crime they didn t commit kennedy has called for a reinvestigation of the assassination his sister former maryland lieutenant governor kathleen kennedy townsend is expressing doubts too bobby makes a compelling case she told the washington post i think the investigation should be reopened paul schrade who was in the kennedy entourage and who was shot while walking behind him still remembers the night he immediately started shaking hands with kitchen workers he said of kennedy the tv lights went on i got hit i didn t know i was hit i was shaking violently and i fell then bob fell i saw flashes and heard crackling the crackling actually was all the other bullets being fired witnesses reported that kennedy said is everybody okay is paul all right schrade when he recovered tried to set the record straight since 1974 he has been trying to get the case reopened yes he did shoot me yes he shot four other people and aimed at kennedy schrade said in an interview with the washington post the important thing is he did not shoot robert kennedy why didn t they go after the second gunman they knew about him right away they didn t want to know who it was they wanted a quickie i m interested in finding out how the prosecutor convicted sirhan with no evidence knowing there was a second gunman schrade said as with lee harvey oswald everything was down pat for the lapd when kennedy went down sirhan confessed to the killing at trial he claims this was done on his lawyer s instruction he took hours of target practice with his pistol earlier in the day and he had the gun with him when he went into the ambassador hotel that night he had been seen at a kennedy speech at the ambassador two days earlier he had a newspaper clipping critical of kennedy in his pocket and had written rfk must die repetitively in notebooks found at his home none of which he had any recollection of and he waited in the pantry for about 30 minutes according to witnesses who said he asked if kennedy would be coming through there with five wounded victims and kennedy having been shot 3 times that accounted for the eight bullets in sirhan s gun game set and match witnesses however said bullet holes were found in the door frames of the ambassador hotel s pantry and photos showed investigators examining the holes in the hours after the shooting this would imply there was a second shooter lead crime scene investigator dewayne wolfer said at the time the holes were not bullet holes and the doors had since been destroyed though los angeles authorities had promised transparency in the case the police and prosecutors refused to release their files until 1988 when they produced a flood of new evidence for researchers the washington post said in its report among the material was an audiotape first unearthed by cnn journalist brad johnson which had been inadvertently made by polish journalist stanislaw pruszynski in the ambassador hotel s ballroom and turned over to police in 1969 pruszynski s microphone had been on the podium where kennedy spoke and tv footage shows him detaching it and moving toward the pantry as the shooting happens the post report says in 2005 audio engineer philip van praag said the tape revealed that about 13 shots had been fired he said he used technology similar to that of the shotspotter used by police to alert them to gunshots and which differentiates gunshots from firecrackers or other loud bangs van praag said mid last year that different guns create different resonances and that he was able to establish that two guns were fired that they fired in different directions and that some of the shot impulses were so close together they couldn t have been fired by the same gun he said he could not say precisely 13 shots but certainly more than the eight contained by sirhan s gun said the washington post report there were too many bullets robert f kennedy jr said you can t fire 13 shots out of an eight shot gun he described sirhan s trial as really a penalty hearing it wasn t a real trial at a full trial they would have litigated his guilt or innocence i think it s unfortunate that the case never went to a full trial because that would have compelled the press and prosecutors to focus on the glaring discrepancies in the narrative that sirhan fired the shots that killed my father kennedy told the post he was asleep in his dorm at georgetown preparatory school in bethesda md on june 5 1968 when a priest woke him and told there was a car waiting outside to take him to the family home hickory hill in mclean va the priest didn t say why in his memoir american values lessons i learned from my family kennedy said his mother s secretary was waiting for him jinx hack told me my father had been shot but i was still thinking he d be okay he was after all indestructible robert f kennedy jr his older sister kathleen and brother joe flew to los angeles on vice president hubert h humphrey s plane air force two at good samaritan hospital kennedy wrote his father s head was bandaged and his face was bruised a priest had already delivered last rites his mother was there i sat down across the bed from her and took hold of his big wrestler s hand he wrote i prayed and said goodbye to him listening to the pumps that kept him breathing each of us children took turns sitting with him and praying opposite my mom my dad died at 1 44 a m a few minutes after doctors removed his life support my brother joe came into the ward where all the children were lying down and told us he s gone sirhan has been in prison for over fifty two years now after commencing his sentence at the rj donovan correctional center on 23 may 1969 he became eligible for parole in april 1972 his record shows he was first granted parole in 1982 but that was rescinded his hearing on friday which

parole grant was rescinded at his last parole hearing in 2016 schrade spoke on sirhan s behalf and apologized for not coming forward sooner to advocate for his release and exoneration although the board of review has recommended sirhan aged 77 be released it could be some months yet before this comes about and may not yet happen the board s legal division is required to review all decisions resulting in a grant of parole decisions are reviewed to determine if the panel made an error of law if the panel s decision was based on an error of fact or if there is new information that should be presented to the board any of which when corrected or considered by the board has a substantial likelihood of resulting in a substantially different decision upon a rehearing if the chief counsel or a hearing panel member does not refer the decision to the full board for review the decision will become final within 120 days after the date of the parole hearing parole decisions that become final are subject to review by the californian governor gavin newsom the governor has 30 days to review a decision he may take no action and allow the decision to stand reverse the decision or refer the decision to the full board for review en banc and a vote at one of its monthly executive board meetings if the governor takes no action on a parole grant sirhan will be scheduled for release if the

board for en banc review and a vote the board may affirm the hearing panel s decision modify the decision or order a rescission hearing to determine whether the inmate s grant of parole should be rescinded newsome a democrat will have to contend with conflicting sentiments of kennedy s family robert kennedy jnr and his brother douglas have supported sirhan s application for parole while six of their siblings joseph p kennedy ii courtney kerry chris maxwell and rory kennedy have opposed it we are devastated that the man who murdered our father has been recommended for parole the six kennedys said in a letter to the parole board we adamantly oppose the parole and release of sirhan sirhan and are shocked by a ruling that we believe ignores the standards of parole of a confessed first degree murderer in the state of california we are in disbelief that this man would be recommended for release they added please read and share statement from my family regarding today s recommendation of parole for sirhan sirhan pic twitter com 60klc1fhxu rory kennedy roryekennedy august 28 2021 robert kennedy jnr however was pleased with the outcome my father i think would be really happy today my father believed in compassion the ideals of our justice system are the possibility of redemption and the importance of forgiveness he didn t believe the justice system was just about revenge he said

have enough credit history by sunday it was clear they would be riding out the storm at home in his family s duplex apartment our bank account is empty we can t afford to leave he said owens said the majority of people in his low income neighborhood are in the same predicament they want to leave to protect families but have no choice but to stay a lot of us here in my neighborhood have to just hunker down and wait not knowing how bad it s going to get it s a terrifying feeling he said there people who have funds to lean on are able to get out of here but there s a big chunk of people that

for protection with the governor warning it could take 72 hours for emergency responders to arrive some parishes imposed curfews beginning sunday evening forbidding people from going outside we re as prepared as we can be but we re worried about those levees said kirk lepine president of plaquemines parish on the state s gulf coast plaquemines one of the most vulnerable parishes is home to 23 000 people along the mississippi delta lepine feared water topping levees along highway 23 that s our one road in and out he said ida is also forecast to bring extremely life threatening storm surges of up to 16 feet of water with the region stretching from burns point in louisiana to ocean springs mississippi most at risk of inundation new orleans is not forecast to see high surges amid worries flood water could overcome the city s levees and other flood defenses which were bolstered in the wake of katrina everyone who cares about new orleans is worried said andy horowitz a history professor who wrote katrina a history 1915 2015 horowitz fled to alabama with his family from their home near new orleans french quarter some 14billion was spent strengthening levees after katrina but that may still be insufficient in the face of climate change he said as a result of the storm the mississippi river is flowing in reverse in southeastern louisiana as ida pushes immense amounts of sea water ashore according to flood control authorities the big easy was warned to expect between 15 and 20 inches of rainfall forecasters fear such a downpour could cause widespread flash floods as the city s pumping system struggles to cope on sunday edwards said he expects ida to be a big challenge for us while speaking with cnn s jake tapper on state of the union edwards said louisiana is as ready as we can be but he expects ida to be a very serious test of our levy systems especially in our coastal louisiana this is not the kind of storm that we normally get edwards told associated press this is going to be much stronger than we usually see and quite frankly if you had to draw up the worst possible path for a hurricane in louisiana it would be something very very close to what we re seeing after the failure of katrina in 2005 the state invested in shoring up the levy system the governor said ida will be the most severe test but he expects the levees to hold the next 24 36 hours are just going to be very very critical for us here in edwards said in addition edwards compared ida to be similar in strength to 2020 s hurricane laura at landfall laura had been louisiana s strongest measured hurricane since 1856 your window of time is closing it is rapidly closing by the time you go to bed tonight you need to be where you intend to ride this storm out and you need to be as

000 in the coming days edwards said edwards added that 10 000 electrical linemen were also stationed around louisiana with another 10 000 contracted on a needed basis officials had ordered widespread evacuations of low lying and coastal areas jamming highways and leading some gasoline stations to run dry as residents and vacationers fled although edwards said it was impossible to evacuate patients from hospitals louisiana hospitals were treating some 2 450 covid 19 patients after a surge in infections edwards said with many in some of the state s parishes already nearing capacity when speaking to wolf blitzer dr katherine o neal chief medical officer or our lady of the lake regional medical center in baton rouge said her hospital is ready to sustain ida but will be stretched thin due to a spike in covid 19 patients this hospital is ready to sustain quite a bit of damage ready to sustain quite a bit of power outages we re talking about rationing supplies getting ready for days of having our team here but we have the ability to do that o neal said what the hospital is lacking is space in addition to health care workers because of covid we have 619 people in house today we have 157 covid patients which is just unbelievable and still higher than we ve ever seen in this pandemic before o neal said once again we find ourselves dealing with a natural disaster in the midst of a pandemic said jennifer avegno the top health official for new orleans lady of the sea general hospital in lafourche parish near where ida made landfall reported extensive roof damage all patients and staff are fine at this time without injury although our hospital has sustained significant damage hospital ceo karen collins said in a message relayed via facebook the hospital s phone system was down once it is safe to do so they will evacuate their small number of patients state health department spokeswoman aly neel said in an email details on the number of patients involved were not immediately available the governor also said 22 nursing homes and 18 assisted living facilities have been evacuated though evacuating the largest hospitals was not an option because there simply aren t other places to send them anticipating that power could be out for weeks in places edwards said a big focus will be on making sure there is enough generator power and water at hospitals so they can keep up with vital patient needs such as providing oxygen or powering ventilators i hate to say it this way but we have a lot of people on ventilators today and they don t work without electricity he said the

mississippi on sunday as ida began to barrel in with the storm set to be the worst on record to hit louisiana route 90 in gulfport mississippi saw roads flooded by ida with the category 4 hurricane set to bring flash floods and storm surges of up to 15 feet hundreds stranded in jefferson parish towns because they couldn t afford to evacuate hundreds of residents in jefferson and st john the baptist parish are stranded as floodwaters exceeding 10ft high and fierce wind gusts make it impossible for first responders to reach them officials in lafitte and jean lafitte say that a failed levee was to blame for the surging floodwaters the chief of police of the town of jean lafitte in jefferson parish said that at least 400 people who were not able to heed the mandatory evacuation order before the storm due to physical or financial reasons are trapped in the area rescue crews are unable to reach them as floodwaters measuring between 10 and 12ft high and sustained winds of 70mph make the area inaccessible according to wwno tv they re scared because they ve never seen this jean lafitte police sergeant jason leorwald said of the stranded residents they ve never faced a storm like this before our residents have gone through this their whole lives and they didn t think that this would happen those that stayed made a personal decision according to leorwald he said financial constraints prevented many of them from evacuating lafitte police chief marcel rodriguez said i m hearing that they feel like they re trapped and they understand that nobody can get there but they are in panic mode and they ve got a good right to be i mean right now if they have 10 foot of water they re basically there in the gulf of mexico in a hurricane the storm is so powerful that louisiana governor john bel edwards said that first responders will have to wait until sunrise on monday to search for stranded residents even as reports surface of trapped victims edwards told cnn on sunday that authorities are aware of distress calls from across southeast louisiana particularly from jefferson parish which issued mandatory evacuation orders on thursday according to the governor however conditions as of late sunday simply do not allow for crews to offer assistance at the height of a hurricane you can t get first responders out because it s just simply too dangerous the wind speeds don t allow for that edwards told cnn advertisement officials at ochsner health which runs the largest hospital network in louisiana said roughly 15 of the network s hospitals are in areas potentially affected by ida the network evacuated some patients with particular medical needs from small rural hospitals to larger facilities warner thomas president and ceo of ochsner health said sunday that the system decided preemptively to evacuate a smaller hospital in st charles parish when the storm s track shifted a bit east he said 35 patients were moved to other hospitals in the region over a little less than three hours when it comes to power at their facilities mike hulefeld said they are in pretty good shape three of their facilities in areas affected by ida were moved to generator power in anticipation of losing city power hulefeld said the hospital network ordered 10 days of supplies for facilities in areas that might be affected by ida and everything arrived saturday each facility has backup power that was tested and a backup fuel truck on site many of the chain s hospitals also have water wells in case city water goes out with people evacuating and potentially going to stay with relatives or in shelters medical officials said they are concerned the hurricane could translate into more coronavirus infections in coming days just as hospitalization numbers are going down thomas said the hospital system has seen a decline in almost 200 coronavirus patients over the past week across all their facilities officials said sunday they have been making the rounds and talking to staff in the hospitals often referred to as the a team because they re the ones that go into lockdown when a hurricane arrives and work until the storm passes and they can be relieved the hurricane comes on top of the year and a half long pandemic that has been an amazing stress on health care workers and many are sad and frustrated folks realize they got a job to do there are people who need to be cared for thomas said but it does take a toll dr jeff elder medical director for emergency management at lcmc health said the system s six hospitals went into lockdown mode sunday employees were going to stay at the hospitals for the duration of the storm arrived saturday and early sunday and would sleep there elder said one of the first things their hospitals do when storms arrive is discharge patients who are able to leave however the patient load is high because of the pandemic so they re not able to reduce by much he said the hospitals in the system are more robust since 2005 s hurricane katrina we ve learned a lot since 2005 he said key pieces of infrastructure are now raised to keep them out of flooding for example at university medical center in new orleans which was built after katrina the generator is raised diesel supplies are protected and the first floor doesn t have essential services so even if flood waters get that high nothing essential is lost all hospitals in the system have generator backup power elder said he also stressed that communication is now much better between hospitals in the hospital system as well as with various levels of government the storm will travel upwards through midweek with a local flash flood threat penetrating inland into tennessee valley ohio valley central appalachians and mid atlantic a few rotating cells in ida s rainbands may generate tornadoes from southeast louisiana into southern mississippi southern alabama and the florida panhandle sunday into monday this threat might spread as far north and east as the tennessee valley and northern georgia monday into tuesday according to the national weather service jefferson parish which sits close to new orleans is said to be particularly vulnerable to a breach the sky over new orleans grew dark on sunday morning with the city s i 10 freeway largely deserted as locals prepared for ida a satellite photo taken from the international space station shows just how large ida is as it sits off the coast of the us an astonishing satellite image showed lighting bolts flashing amid storm ida as it moved towards the louisiana coast leeville in louisiana is pictured starting to flood as ida rolled in on sunday morning hurricane expert eric blake tweeted sunday that the strength of ida has made him sick to his stomach this would be the first time the newly upgraded defenses have been breached since they were strengthened in the wake of katrina on sunday longtime nbc weatherman al roker headed straight into the storm making certain viewers got a firsthand look at the category 4 hurricane and what it was doing along the banks of louisiana judging from roker s report of the storm things are escalating quickly during sunday s report the 67 year old weatherman was plummeted by waves as the storm surged upwards of 15 16 feet in new orleans on sunday morning new orleans which is set to be hit by the full force of the storm saw its 911 service go down with locals urged to call a far longer number instead although service has since been restored it is currently around 50 miles off the louisiana coast and is expected to make landfall later on sunday in addition a tornado warning is in effect for southeast mobile county and grand bay in pointe coupee parish with twisters a common occurrence at the outer edges of hurricanes as the make landfall evacuations have begun amid warnings of storm surges of up to 15 feet with jefferson parish president cynthia lee sheng saying of the predicted inundation i want to reiterate the storm surge that we are expecting is unsurvivable hurricane expert eric blake also tweeted his horror at the weather event writing i feel sick to my stomach watching this hurricane ida s eye is clearing out and the rapid intensification continues at this point be ready for the one of the strongest to ever make landfall in louisiana this is a very sobering morning godspeed according to the national hurricane center ida sustained winds of 150 mph just 60 miles south of the mouth of the mississippi river continuing its way toward louisiana and the gulf of mexico it would take merely 7 mph for ida to transition into category 5 storm the nhc said the strongest category if ida does become a cat 5 hurricane it will be the first on record to have made landfall in louisiana with hurricane ida intensifying over the gulf of mexico saturday and barreling towards the gulf coast thousands of fleeing residents clogged highways as they raced inland and the new orleans airport cancelled all of sunday s inbound and departing flights a car sits parked on a levee close to new orleans amid fears the flood defenses could be overcome by hurricane ida how similar is ida to katrina hurricane ida shares some similarities with hurricane katrina but it s size and wind speed suggest it could be a more concentrated destructive storm similarities wind speed katrina hit louisiana as a category 3 storm with 125 mph winds ida will hit the city as a category 4 with slightly higher winds of 130 mph timing katrina made landfall on august 29 2005 ida is making landfall on august 29 2021 exactly 16 years later differences size katrina was a larger storm which means it was weaker and its damage was more spread out ida is smaller which makes for a stronger storm with more localized damage angle katrina hit new orleans from the south but ida is entering from the southeast which will put new orleans under the storm s strongest part the northeastern quadrant infrastructure new orleans infrastructure has been updated since katrina in 2005 when much of the damage was blamed on the levee failures that allowed for extreme flooding it remains to be seen how they will hold during ida advertisement on sunday morning alabama governor kay ivey issued a state of emergency for alabama s coastal western counties effective at 2 00 p m as of early sunday morning ida was a category 3 storm with whipping winds of 115 mph it was about 145 miles southeast of the mouth of the mississippi river according to the national hurricane center but it quickly strengthened to a category four with forecaster sam lillo tweeting ida is the furthest north hurricane on record in the atlantic to deepen 50mb millibars in 24 hours or less millibars are units used to record pressure edwards said that the storm will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in louisiana since at least the 1850s it s predicted to cause heavy downpours and a tidal surge that could plunge most of the louisiana shoreline under several feet of water we re going to catch it head on bebe mcelroy told the associated press as she prepared to leave home in the coastal louisiana village of cocodrie i m just going around praying saying dear lord just watch over us we re not the same state we were 16 years ago edwards said on saturday pointing to a federal levee system that s seen major improvements since katrina swamped new orleans in 2005 this system is going to be tested the people of louisiana are going to be tested but we are resilient and tough people and we re going to get through this edwards said 5 000 national guard troops were being staged in 14 parishes for search and rescue efforts with high water vehicles boats and helicopters and 10 000 linemen were on standby to respond to electrical outages jackson mississippi mayor chokwe antar lumumba told cnn during a tv interview at 11pm saturday that he s most concerned about how city s infrastructure will hold up and said the city s hospitals are already filled because of the covid 19 surge brought on by the delta variant for those who will be weathering the storm were reminded by president joe biden not to forego covid precautions if you have to move to shelter make sure you wear a mask and try to keep some distance we re still facing the highly contagious delta variant as well new orleans mayor latoya cantrell urged residents reminded residents during mid day saturday press conference that he local covid surge has city hospitals at full capacity she called on those planning to flee from the life altering hurricane to do so immediately and for those planning to ride out the storm to finish their preparations and shelter in place as quickly as possible this is our time your time to prepare yourselves now this is it she said check on your neighbors your friends of course your family assist them when needed in hurricane katrina we learned that we are all first responders the city s french quarter had also begun to disappear behind plywood boards new orleans normally bustling canal street lay empty saturday with a cvs already boarded up alabama governor kay ivey and edwards had a call with biden on friday afternoon to synchronize federal and local storm preparation and response plans also on the call was fema administrator deanna criswell homeland security advisor liz sherwood randall and director of intergovernmental affairs julie rodriguez fema is pre positioning food water generators and other resources in the at risk region the president s office said saturday a local buys plywood at a home depot in new orleans on saturday in preparation for hurricane ida canal street in new orleans stood deserted on saturday night as locals prepared for hurricane ida to hit the city on sunday the city s famed bourbon street looked far quieter than usual as ida was forecast to hit on the 16th anniversary of hurricane katrina levees strengthened in wake of katrina could be overcome by ida since hurricane katrina the federal government has spent 14 5 billion on levees pumps seawalls floodgates and drainage that provide enhanced protection from storm surges and flooding in new orleans and surrounding suburbs south of lake pontchartrain the system is a 350 mile network of levees floodwalls canals 24 pumping stations and 99 pumps within the city of new orleans suburbs have their own pump systems levees are made from compacted soil whereas floodwalls are erected from man made materials usually metal and cement the national hurricane center forecasts between 10 to 15 feet of floodwaters in the west bank area which lies east of the main part of the city the area is named for its position on the mississippi river the upper range of that estimate would overtop most of the southwest facing levee walls facing the gulf of mexico in that area the average height of the levee walls facing southwest according to nola com is 14 feet if forecasted flood levels prove true floodwaters will rise over levees for the first time since the system was upgraded post hurricane katrina in 2005 over 50 levees failed throughout new orleans leaving 80 percent of the city underwater the surge is predicted to weaken as it flows over the marshes and land of southern jefferson parish shrinking in height and intensity as it moved further inland and toward the levees surrounding the communities near the mississippi river exactly how much of an effect that would have however is not clear armoring a new strategy applied to the levee system since hurricane katrina involves strategically planting grass and laying mats along the inside of the levees this prevents floodwaters that flow over the walls from eroding soil at the levee s base which could cause the structure to collapse however because water has never made it over the retaining walls before this erosion prevention system has never been tested in practice southeast flood protection authority west region director nicholas calli whose agency oversees the levees said to nola com that he was confident that the system would work as designed authorities predict that the rest of the system lining the mississippi river to the north of the city of new orleans is not expected to be overwhelmed by high water levels a surge of storm water in theory would be slowed and lowered in height as it flowed over the marshes and land of southern jefferson parish putting the walls protecting the communities near the mississippi river it is unclear how much however water that overtakes the levees would be pumped out by the same water pumps used to divert rainwater that falls within the levee s walls outside of its perimeter parts of the 2billion of drainage equipment installed since 2005 can pump out as much as 4 7 inches of rainwater each three hours according to the army corps of engineers combined the corps said the pumps have a capacity of over 50 000 cubic feet per second cfs or 400 000 gallons of water authorities urged residents on friday to clean leaves and detritus around storm drains to prevent the system from clogging and therefore slowing the removal of water while some of the pumps were built more recently according to new orleans sewerage water board executive director ghassan korban some are antiques officials tried to bring an electrical turbine online on friday in an attempt to provide a back up power source for less reliable pumps three of the 99 pumps are not operation an obstacle that korban said will be solved by the redundancy of the system and its back ups just weeks ago on august 6 the army corps of engineers recommended 1 7billion dollars in renovations to the system to ensure that it will work reliably until 2078 among proposed changes were raising the height of 99 miles of the levees replacing over a mile of floodwalls and building an additional 3 2 miles of additional flood walls advertisement meanwhile the president implored local authorities to reach out for federal assistance should they need it before the projected hurricane makes landfall i need to know everything you think we need to do he said at a press conference just before 2 pm if you haven t gotten the authority for it tell me now we ll get it done thank you thank you thank you everything that you re doing to prepare for this dangerous storm is going to mitigate the impact and potential disastrous results that will so many people in the region terrebonne lafourche plaquemines orleans st charles port fourchon and st mary parish all mandated evacuations for some or all of their residents and new orleans employers let their employees go home by 6pm so they have adequate time to seek shelter ida was a tropical depression just two days earlier but it strengthened so quickly that new orleans officials said there was no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of the city s 390 000 residents new orleans mayor latoya cantrell said the city did not have sufficient time to mandate evacuations inside the levee system or to open up additional lanes of traffic known as contraflow to allow more people to evacuate an evacuation of that magnitude requires coordination with the state and neighboring locales so that inbound lanes on are highways can be converted to shunt traffic away from the city even without the mandatory evacuation traffic on interstate 10 out of new orleans was heavy or at a standstill throughout the day saturday roads were congested as early as 4 am reports indicate many more heeded the officials warnings and vacated the area but those who chose to hunker down in new orleans and the surrounding areas along the coast boarded up their homes and businesses and made preparations the city s emergency planners simultaneously traumatized and prepared for the worst by hurricane katrina have promised a very robust very quick post storm evacuation inundated with surrendered pets louisiana s society for the prevention of cruelty to animals is also at full capacity and will similarly transition to post storm operations after hurricane katrina in 2005 70 percent of homes were damaged to some degree and more than 1 800 people died ten to 15 feet of water is expected to collect around the mouth of the mississippi river the national hurricane center said and lower levels of flooding could extend as far east as the coastlines of adjacent mississippi and alabama in the capital of baton rouge marvin broome said he had no choice but to stay home because his wife is the mayor sharon weston broome the 73 year old english teacher said in a phone interview he was stashing family valuables and important papers in a safe part of their home while mayor broome dealt with the city of 224 000 predicted storm surges were already happening exceeding 6 feet in some parts of the coast parts of highway 90 that runs along the louisiana and mississippi gulf coast had become a choppy river according to videos posted on social media mayor broome signed an emergency disaster declaration and said her city had preemptively stationed sand and sandbags at eight strategic locations as the storm approached white house press secretary jen psaki said on friday that fema will send nearly 150 medical personnel and almost 50 ambulances to the gulf coast to assist strained hospitals terrebonne parish officials also told everyone to evacuate wwl tv reported if you can leave on your own please leave on your own parish president gordon dove said we are the bullseye by every indication of everything we have found heavy rainfall and flooding

consider evacuating arnold said the city could be under high winds for about ten hours at governor edwards request biden issued a pre landfall federal emergency declaration on friday which authorized the department of homeland security and fema to begin coordinating disaster relief efforts nobody was out there shrimping today opening day of shrimp season said george barisich a shrimper to cbs news so that ought to tell you when i got in this morning late last night about 75 80 percent of the boats already left meteorologist steve bowen head of global catastrophe insight at the risk and consulting firm aon said the area that was about to get hit is especially vulnerable with large swaths of industries that could cause environmental damages as well as homes that still have tarps instead of roofs from multiple storms in 2020 it s not just the coastal impact it s not just new orleans bowen said we re certainly looking at potential losses well into the billions on friday ida smashed into cuba s small isle of youth off the southwestern end of the caribbean island nation toppling trees and tearing roofs from dwellings jamaica was flooded by heavy rains and there were landslides after the passage of the storm many roads were impassable forcing some residents to abandon their homes ida the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2021 atlantic hurricane season

just off the coast of florida locals have begun to evacuate areas of louisiana in ida s path shelves of a new orleans walmart were emptied ahead of the hurricane set to be one of the worst to ever hit the area as the storm plowed into cuba on friday night the national weather service warned that it shows no signs of weakening if ida maintains a good inner core it will intensify quickly as it enters the gulf don t underestimate this if you are asked to evacuate leave or you re putting your life in danger the nws asserted in another tweet the nws wrote the time to act is now hurricane ida is now forecast to make landfall as a category 4 hurricane this will bring significant impacts to southern louisiana and southern mississippi no major changes to the track at this time moved just a touch to

oil prices to rise to 75 per barrel before end of year ubs oil prices which fell on thursday on renewed concerns over covid 19 is likely to move higher to reach 75 per barrel before the end of the year according to the latest analysis we anticipate brent crude will rise to 75 a barrel by december that should benefit global energy stocks which are still pricing in a brent crude price of only 55 60 swiss bank ubs said in a research note on thursday after posting an upswing in recent days oil dropped 45 cents to 71 80 a barrel on thursday there have been renewed concerns that restrictions related to the pandemic could dampen the economic recovery as well as demand for oil ubs said that the price of oil does look set to remain volatile but the upward trend is likely to resume it said that the global trend toward economic normalisation is still intact and should boost oil demand according to estimates by the international energy agency iea oil demand rose by 3 8 million barrels per day in june almost three times faster than the seasonal norm the increase in demand has been due to the improved mobility in north america and europe the same trend has also been observed in india where oil demand recovered swiftly after the restrictions were lifted in may the latest positive news on infections in china reinforces our confidence that restrictions which are affecting just a few areas rather than whole cities will soon be lifted and have only a modest economic impact we see chinese oil demand starting to recover in september ubs said besides ubs said the recent agreement of the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec and its allies to lift production each month by 400 000 barrels per day is not set in stone it cited that the saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman has made it clear that the group can delay or reverse the planned production increases if necessary ubs also said that they see oil and commodities more broadly as a hedge against the risk that inflation proves more sustained than currently forecast we expect broadly diversified commodity indexes to deliver mid to high single digit total returns over the next three to six months source reuters reporting by cleofe maceda editing by mily chakrabarty

louisiana gov john bel edwards reassured his constituents during a press conference on sunday afternoon that the state was prepared to take on the forces of hurricane ida as the storm raged there is no doubt that the coming days and weeks are going to be extremely difficult for our state but as a state we ve never been more prepared edwards said edwards said the state had 900 people as part of the search and rescue efforts split among 21 teams standing by during the storm and its aftermath out of the state s 692 floodgates 459 had been closed edwards said and although officials reaffirmed their confidence in the levees which have been improved since hurricane katrina hit 16 years ago edwards said the state was expecting overtopping on some of the levees will it be tested yes edwards said of the flood protection system but it was built for this moment he also urged residents not to panic about overtopping overtopping and levee failure are not the same thing he said obviously we will continue to monitor our flood protection systems edwards warned that people may need to prepare shelter in place for up to 72 hours after the storm while he implored people to stay home he said if people needed to go out and got stuck that it could be a while for help to arrive he added that parishes would be deciding on and announcing curfews for their respective residents those who evacuated need to check with their local officials before returning edwards said he said that 1 542 people were currently being sheltered across the state
kabul the woman had never seen a taliban fighter before an artist and former social media influencer based here in the afghan capital she had spent most of her adult life in the city s liberal circles taliban rule felt foreign and frightening the city s swift fall to the militants this month was terrifying she said and she spent days locked inside her apartment she feared a knock on the door and a swift death sentence when it didn t come she ventured downstairs in place of the guards who ordinarily sat outside her building were taliban fighters she froze but then said hello i was shocked they were respectful she said they exchanged pleasantries it made me think maybe these people are not who we thought they were still she has yet to leave her apartment building she has seen reports on television and heard stories from friends and family of arbitrary beatings and extrajudicial executions she doesn t know what could await her just a few blocks away two weeks after the taliban overran kabul seizing control of the capital and the country for the first time in 20 years afghans across the capital are bracing for what comes next for some each day is now infused with crippling fear others say the city is in a state of limbo advertisement some afghans particularly former government officials and members of the security forces fearful of taliban retribution have been in complete hiding since the taliban swept across kabul one former afghan special forces officer who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals said he has had to change his safe house multiple times after receiving threatening phone calls i don t know how long i can live like this he said sunday as the realization sunk in that he would not be evacuated from the country like many of his colleagues and he would have to move again the city has become a prison but on the streets shades of normality are returning as some residents are attempting to return to life as usual while tiptoeing around their new rulers on a recent morning the owner of an electronics shop collected thick stacks of paperwork as he prepared to confront the taliban commander who commandeered his family s home after kabul s fall advertisement we always heard they were less corrupt than the previous government that their justice is swift now i will see said 74 year old muhammad ameen who was living outside the country the last time the taliban ruled afghanistan he donned a skull cap and scarf traditional elements of taliban garb to prepare for the meeting see now i m a talib he said and chuckled but when asked about business his mood shifted sitting in a tidy shop stocked with flat screen televisions and modern washing machines he has hardly sold 20 worth of merchandise since the city fell the taliban takeover brought with it a freeze on the country s financial reserves and a halt in much of the aid that has kept afghanistan afloat for years banks have not fully reopened and people cannot access cash yes there are people in the markets he said pointing to pedestrians and traffic outside his door but now people come into my shop begging to sell their personal belongings not asking to buy anything on the edges of kabul s old city fabric shop owners also grumbled about a drop in sales since the taliban takeover but many blamed the international community for imposing financial restrictions and largely stopping aid the only sales that have increased they say are of conservative clothing for women advertisement women want to wear darker color abayas now said muhammad younis helping out in his family s shop until he can return to studying islamic law at a university the 19 year old described himself as a conservative muslim but said he was also afraid of what a taliban takeover would mean for kabul but when they came he said it wasn t that bad a handful of fighters visited the shop a few days after he reopened and looked around i asked them about the future he said and they said there is peace now and it will improve day by day as long as the foreigners leave and don t betray us younis said he didn t support the previous government because of crime corruption and the poor economy but he isn t convinced taliban rule will be better share this article share right now we are just hearing them talk he said only after we see their behavior and their actions can we make a decision about them across town in the neighborhood of karte parwan safiullah nasri said he closed his bookstore the day he heard the taliban had pushed into kabul and didn t expect to reopen for weeks if ever the modern shop stocks materials ranging from religious texts to american and european novels koranic volumes are neatly displayed across from a table stacked with copies of eat pray love advertisement nasri 30 expected the militants wouldn t approve of his business but less than a week into taliban rule a commander showed up at the shop and demanded it be reopened he ushered his fighters in and they immediately started looking through the study guides he said and pulled a few examples off the shelves the fighters were young and were attending university or preparing to return they were mainly interested in books about islamic political systems and economics i was so surprised at the level of education he observed among the small group of fighters in his shop i think they know that they need to study these things if they want to have a government next door zabiullah qadiri is running one of the few businesses that has seen an improvement in profit since the taliban took over kabul a motorcycle repair shop advertisement the previous government unable to control petty theft and the wave of targeted assassinations carried out largely by people on motorcycles banned the bikes from kabul s streets i m happy about the improved security situation said qadiri 40 he doesn t worry about crime the way he did just a few weeks ago he said corruption along with the government appeared to vanish overnight every time the officials would come to collect my taxes they would always ask me for more money now that doesn t happen he said it s possible the new system could be better but like many others he hasn t made up his mind he s waiting to see if the militants impose restrictions of the sort they enforced during their rule in the 1990s and how they approach public services such as education taliban leaders say they will announce new laws once a government is formed the group is in negotiations to reach a power sharing government with the former afghan officials who remain in kabul advertisement muhammed shoaib 26 works in a trendy barber shop in kabul s chandawal neighborhood he said he can t decide how he feels about the taliban until the group announces its new laws we don t know if we will be able to shave or to wear our hair like this he said referring to the modern asymmetrical cuts displayed in photographs on the wall behind him a photographer in a nearby store expressed the same anxious wait we hear they have changed but we don t know if they still see our occupation as illegal as against islam muhammad sadiqqi 47 said in the photography shop established by his grandfather during the taliban rule of the 1990s he was imprisoned and beaten for having a photography studio the shop was closed for five years it reopened in 2001 after the united states invaded afghanistan and took control of kabul advertisement i m still afraid of them shoaib said but we are still a bit hopeful because they haven t banned television so maybe they also won t ban photography others whose professions were strictly illegal under the taliban s previous rule aren t taking a chance this time around among the tens of thousands of afghans evacuated by the united states were activists government workers proponents of women s rights and members of the security forces one women s rights activist who couldn t flee the country instead fled her family home and is in hiding with a friend once the taliban took over she said the education and career that once made her proud now make her feel threatened she s deactivated her facebook account and rarely ventures out into the streets the few times i have been out she said she s noticed fewer women on the street and their clothing has changed advertisement the clothes of young girls which used to be colorful are now black and long everyone tries not to be seen she said the taliban have announced amnesties and made moderate promises but i never trust the taliban to be honest in their actions she said i think they are just waiting to be recognized by the international community and then they will implement their strict policies

harvard geneticist richard c lewontin age 92 died on july 4 at his home in cambridge massachusetts he is considered one of the most prominent modern researchers in genetic diversity in humans and animals among his signal contributions was to demonstrate the exceedingly small genetic differences between various human populations which are mischaracterized under the scientifically invalid concept of races as compared to many other species thus supporting the relatively recent common ancestry of all living humans he was a strong opponent of racist claims promoted by pseudo scientific charlatans such as nicholas wade that there are significant genetically based differences in intelligence between different races born in 1929 lewontin earned a master s degree in mathematical statistics 1952 and a ph d in zoology 1954 both from columbia university then taught at various institutions until joining the harvard faculty in 1973 he combined his knowledge of mathematics and molecular biology to elucidate the mechanisms of evolutionary change he rejected attempts to explain human culture and behavior as being directed solely or primarily by genetics as for example advocated by his harvard colleague e o wilson the founder of sociobiology which he critiqued in not in our genes biology ideology and human nature 1984 cowritten with steven rose lewontin s early work in the mid 1960s lewontin and hubby 1966 initially carried out using the fruit fly drosophila and pioneering the use of computer simulation in the study of single gene loci demonstrated that genetic diversity within species was in general far greater than had been previously thought indeed many different versions of a particular gene known as alleles can exist within a species at any given time with little deleterious effect under existing environmental conditions this contrasted with the view that mutations are usually detrimental and are soon selected out leading to relative genetic uniformity the pool of genetic diversity discovered by lewontin may well be an evolutionary advantage in that it can provide the raw material on which a species may draw figuratively speaking when selective pressures change and new adaptations based on the existing genetic variation allow the species to survive in an altered environment this research prompted a whole new field of research into genetic polymorphism this earlier research gained added relevance when in 1972 lewontin published a paper in which he presented an analysis of human genetic variation based on blood proteins before dna sequencing was available sampled from west eurasian african east asian south asian native american oceanian and australian populations which demonstrated a lower genetic diversity among homo sapiens than in many other species it revealed that within group e g population race variation is greater approximately 85 percent than between group variation at roughly 7 percent these findings were described in a book the genetic basis of evolutionary change published in 1974 to place this finding in context the predominant factors in the development of genetic diversity between populations are distance and time these include geographic separation leading to reduced interbreeding and therefore restricted gene flow between populations the length of time during which the separation has occurred leading to the accumulation of different random mutations in each population known as genetic drift compounded by the effects of different selective pressures due to varied environments cumulatively leading to the buildup of genetic differences if enough time passes and inter population gene flow is sufficiently reduced these separate populations are likely to accumulate substantial genetic differences to the extent that they are no longer able to interbreed and therefore constitute separate species while modern racist theories do not go so far as to claim that human races represent different species obviously false since all modern humans can successfully interbreed and produce viable offspring the implication is that sufficient genetic differentiation has occurred between geographically disparate populations so as to lead to significant differences in such attributes as intelligence propensity to violence etc on the contrary the strong implication of the contrast in genetic diversity between humans and many other species that was identified by lewontin is that modern humans evolved relatively recently in evolutionary terms from a single ancestral population located in africa and that despite having spread widely across the globe genetic differentiation between populations has been extremely limited this interpretation has been strongly supported by subsequent research in other words observable variation in physical characteristics such as skin color which have been used to define races are entirely superficial and of no fundamental significance the relative lack of genetic diversity among modern humans may be attributed to at least two factors first the well documented and extensive migrations of populations over thousands of years especially since the development of agriculture have to a significant degree counter acted the tendency toward regional genetic isolation secondly and perhaps more importantly the entirety of human evolution at least from the first appearance of the genus homo roughly two million years ago if not before has been characterized by an ever increasing reliance on culture and technology rather than changes in physical attributes intelligence has become human s primary mode of adaptation lewontin often described himself as a marxist a dialectical and materialist approach in his scientific work is evident it appears for example in his article organism and environment he argued that many researchers see darwinism as viewing organisms merely reacting to selective forces generated by their environment on the contrary he argued that organisms play an active role in creating their environment they are one opposite in the dialectical interaction among all the physical and biological components collectively acting and reacting to each other and are thus engaged in an ever changing dynamic that produces the environment elsewhere he criticized the concept that at any given time organisms are optimally adapted to their contemporaneous environment rather than being in constant adaptive flux he once said science is a social activity just like being a policeman a factory worker or a politician intent on disseminating the results of his research to a wide audience lewontin authored or coauthored a number of books and essays many of the latter published in the new york review of books aimed at the non specialist in 1985 for example he coauthored with richard levins the dialectical biologist which he dedicated to frederick engels in it he characterized the concept of race as an indication of the power of socioeconomically based ideology over the supposed objectivity of knowledge curiously he downplayed the significance of the human genome project which he viewed as a reductionist effort to define a blueprint for a human being which he associated with attempts to genetically delineate races iq and promote eugenics to the contrary it is a significant accomplishment when understood as elucidating one opposite in the dialectical interaction between biology and environment in the development of human beings lewontin felt that a scientist also has a responsibility to engage in politics as academics we are supported by society in a pretty nice way to make a claim on the resources of society you have to do more than say i want to satisfy my intellectual curiosity that s just a kind of masturbation that is not justified as far as i m concerned so you have to do politics science provides you with legitimacy when you lose your legitimacy as a scientist you lose your legitimacy as a commentator his strong commitment to scientific integrity is well known however his view of himself as a commentator defined his political activities which were clearly reformist and not revolutionary while he criticized capitalism s distorting effects on science lewontin s marxism does not appear to have gone beyond protest politics in his youth and social criticism in his later years he opposed the vietnam war including resigning from the prestigious national academy of sciences due to its collaboration with the us department of defense and criticized scientists such as edward teller who were involved in military research his later social commentary included criticism of agribusiness for developing genetically modified crops not for superior quality but to entrap farmers into having to buy seed from them rather than being able to use a portion of the previous year s crop as seed stock for the new season he was associated with such protest groups as science for the people after it was purged of its more radical elements and science for vietnam there is no indication that he was ever directly involved in explicitly socialist politics or the specific struggles of the working class lewontin collaborated for a time with stephen jay gould another harvard professor who is also noted for opposing genetic determinism including in the famous essay the spandrels of san marco and the panglossian paradigm a critique of the adaptationist programme in it they proposed that certain components of an organism s genetic makeup are necessary in order for other mechanisms to function properly but are not in themselves necessarily adaptive highlighting the high degree of complexity in the interaction of various genes the scientific dispute between the three harvard colleagues became so heated that wilson reportedly would avoid sharing an elevator with either gould or lewontin lewontin is also known for refusing to take credit for work actually accomplished by his students in this he is the rare exception to a practice all too common in academia later he broke with gould over what he perceived as the latter s quest for celebrity in an interview he described the basis for his falling out with gould now i should warn you about my prejudices steve and i taught evolution together for years and in a sense we struggled in class constantly because steve in my view was preoccupied with the desire to be considered a very original and great evolutionary theorist so he would exaggerate and even caricature certain features which are true but not the way you want to present them richard lewontin made significant and substantial contributions to our understanding of biological evolution and human diversity he will be missed

tactic and for not investigating the crime had offered the jury the concession to sway the jury from recommending the death sentence for his client sirhan an exercise boy at racetracks and a stock clerk and delivery boy at a health food store at the time and to this day says he has no recollection of shooting kennedy and was badly advised by his legal counsel there is plenty of evidence to suggest sirhan did not fire the fatal shot kennedy at the ambassador hotel in los angeles was shot at point blank range from behind the bullet piercing just below his ear the autopsy performed by chief medical examiner coroner thomas noguchi concluded the gun had been fired no more than one or 2 inches from kennedy sirhan however a 24 year old palestinian immigrant on a jordanian passport was standing several feet in front of him and shooting indiscriminately another problem for sirhan s legal team was that they were only provided with the autopsy report well into the trial just as there is significant doubt about the killer of his brother john kennedy in dallas texas in 1963 robert kennedy s death too has been clouded with speculation it has been suggested sirhan may have been subjected to coercive hypnosis in a real life version of the manchurian candidate several witnesses said he was in a trance like state it is known that well into the 1960s the cia had a project in operation that was in full experimentation mode whereby individuals were being hypnotized and instructed to carry out actions in a waking state and to say things that would be compatible with the actions they were instructed to undertake other evidence to throw doubt on sirhan s role in the assassination is that a number of witnesses swore that up to 13 shots were fired at the time when sirhan s gun only held eight bullets robert kennedy jnr a lawyer who was just 14 when his father was assassinated says he harbours doubts about sirhan s guilt he visited him in prison a little over two years ago i went there because i was curious and disturbed by what i had seen in the evidence he told the washington post at the time i was disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father my father was the chief law enforcement officer in this country i think it would have disturbed him if somebody was put in jail for a crime they didn t commit kennedy has called for a reinvestigation of the assassination his sister former maryland lieutenant governor kathleen kennedy townsend is expressing doubts too bobby makes a compelling case she told the washington post i think the investigation should be reopened paul schrade who was in the kennedy entourage and who was shot while walking behind him still remembers the night he immediately started shaking hands with kitchen workers he said of kennedy the tv lights went on i got hit i didn t know i was hit i was shaking violently and i fell then bob fell i saw flashes and heard crackling the crackling actually was all the other bullets being fired witnesses reported that kennedy said is everybody okay is paul all right schrade when he recovered tried to set the record straight since 1974 he has been trying to get the case reopened yes he did shoot me yes he shot four other people and aimed at kennedy schrade said in an interview with the washington post the important thing is he did not shoot robert kennedy why didn t they go after the second gunman they knew about him right away they didn t want to know who it was they wanted a quickie i m interested in finding out how the prosecutor convicted sirhan with no evidence knowing there was a second gunman schrade said as with lee harvey oswald everything was down pat for the lapd when kennedy went down sirhan confessed to the killing at trial he claims this was done on his lawyer s instruction he took hours of target practice with his pistol earlier in the day and he had the gun with him when he went into the ambassador hotel that night he had been seen at a kennedy speech at the ambassador two days earlier he had a newspaper clipping critical of kennedy in his pocket and had written rfk must die repetitively in notebooks found at his home none of which he had any recollection of and he waited in the pantry for about 30 minutes according to witnesses who said he asked if kennedy would be coming through there with five wounded victims and kennedy having been shot 3 times that accounted for the eight bullets in sirhan s gun game set and match witnesses however said bullet holes were found in the door frames of the ambassador hotel s pantry and photos showed investigators examining the holes in the hours after the shooting this would imply there was a second shooter lead crime scene investigator dewayne wolfer said at the time the holes were not bullet holes and the doors had since been destroyed though los angeles authorities had promised transparency in the case the police and prosecutors refused to release their files until 1988 when they produced a flood of new evidence for researchers the washington post said in its report among the material was an audiotape first unearthed by cnn journalist brad johnson which had been inadvertently made by polish journalist stanislaw pruszynski in the ambassador hotel s ballroom and turned over to police in 1969 pruszynski s microphone had been on the podium where kennedy spoke and tv footage shows him detaching it and moving toward the pantry as the shooting happens the post report says in 2005 audio engineer philip van praag said the tape revealed that about 13 shots had been fired he said he used technology similar to that of the shotspotter used by police to alert them to gunshots and which differentiates gunshots from firecrackers or other loud bangs van praag said mid last year that different guns create different resonances and that he was able to establish that two guns were fired that they fired in different directions and that some of the shot impulses were so close together they couldn t have been fired by the same gun he said he could not say precisely 13 shots but certainly more than the eight contained by sirhan s gun said the washington post report there were too many bullets robert f kennedy jr said you can t fire 13 shots out of an eight shot gun he described sirhan s trial as really a penalty hearing it wasn t a real trial at a full trial they would have litigated his guilt or innocence i think it s unfortunate that the case never went to a full trial because that would have compelled the press and prosecutors to focus on the glaring discrepancies in the narrative that sirhan fired the shots that killed my father kennedy told the post he was asleep in his dorm at georgetown preparatory school in bethesda md on june 5 1968 when a priest woke him and told there was a car waiting outside to take him to the family home hickory hill in mclean va the priest didn t say why in his memoir american values lessons i learned from my family kennedy said his mother s secretary was waiting for him jinx hack told me my father had been shot but i was still thinking he d be okay he was after all indestructible robert f kennedy jr his older sister kathleen and brother joe flew to los angeles on vice president hubert h humphrey s plane air force two at good samaritan hospital kennedy wrote his father s head was bandaged and his face was bruised a priest had already delivered last rites his mother was there i sat down across the bed from her and took hold of his big wrestler s hand he wrote i prayed and said goodbye to him listening to the pumps that kept him breathing each of us children took turns sitting with him and praying opposite my mom my dad died at 1 44 a m a few minutes after doctors removed his life support my brother joe came into the ward where all the children were lying down and told us he s gone sirhan has been in prison for over fifty two years now after commencing his sentence at the rj donovan correctional center on 23 may 1969 he became eligible for parole in april 1972 his record shows he was first granted parole in 1982 but that was rescinded his hearing on friday which

parole grant was rescinded at his last parole hearing in 2016 schrade spoke on sirhan s behalf and apologized for not coming forward sooner to advocate for his release and exoneration although the board of review has recommended sirhan aged 77 be released it could be some months yet before this comes about and may not yet happen the board s legal division is required to review all decisions resulting in a grant of parole decisions are reviewed to determine if the panel made an error of law if the panel s decision was based on an error of fact or if there is new information that should be presented to the board any of which when corrected or considered by the board has a substantial likelihood of resulting in a substantially different decision upon a rehearing if the chief counsel or a hearing panel member does not refer the decision to the full board for review the decision will become final within 120 days after the date of the parole hearing parole decisions that become final are subject to review by the californian governor gavin newsom the governor has 30 days to review a decision he may take no action and allow the decision to stand reverse the decision or refer the decision to the full board for review en banc and a vote at one of its monthly executive board meetings if the governor takes no action on a parole grant sirhan will be scheduled for release if the governor reverses a grant of parole sirhan will be scheduled for a new parole hearing within 18 months from the date of the inmate s last parole hearing if the governor refers a decision to the full board for en banc review and a vote the board may affirm the hearing panel s decision modify the decision or order a rescission hearing to determine whether the inmate s grant of parole should be rescinded newsome a democrat will have to contend with conflicting sentiments of kennedy s family robert kennedy jnr and his brother douglas have supported sirhan s application for parole while six of their siblings joseph p kennedy ii courtney kerry chris maxwell and rory kennedy have opposed it we are devastated that the man who murdered our father has been recommended for parole the six kennedys said in a letter to the parole board we adamantly oppose the parole and release of sirhan sirhan and are shocked by a ruling that we believe ignores the standards of parole of a confessed first degree murderer in the state of california we are in disbelief that this man would be recommended for release they added please read and share statement from my family regarding today s recommendation of

in early august the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported to the united nations with a terrifying message global temperatures are now higher than at any other time in the past 125 000 years and even if we stop adding carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere this very moment temperatures will continue to rise over at least the next three decades the result expect worse heatwaves floods and extreme events such as droughts hurricanes cyclones and wildfires calling it a code red for humanity u n secretary general antonio guterres urged world governments to take immediate and decisive action a brief history of the ipcc the ipcc was formed in 1988 when the u n and the world meteorological organization wmo an organization with roots in vienna in the late 1800s that formed to facilitate the exchange of weather information across national borders teamed up to address a growing concern the burning of fossil fuels was releasing dangerously high levels of carbon dioxide which was known to trap heat within the atmosphere today the ipcc is made up of more than 200 scientists hundreds of independent reviewers and thousands of governmental advisers worldwide who spend years culling through the latest scientific research in this case over 14 000 scientific articles to create a report intended to inform the 195 member governments of the united nations the core team of scientists is not employed by the u n and most donate their time and talent this recent effort represents the most highly researched and scrutinized document on the state of climate change the world has ever seen once the draft report was completed months ago all 195 member states reviewed and ok d the document line by line coal and oil a growing concern by the 1800s fueled by the industrial revolution the burning of coal had increased dramatically by the late 1800s plumes of black smoke coated entire towns near coal fired plants with soot and the associated negative health and environmental implications were of growing concern to both communities and scientists coal is composed of compressed fossil plant material that grew in tropical wetlands millions of years ago it is 65 to 95 carbon but it also contains hydrogen sulfur oxygen and nitrogen when burned these gases are released into the atmosphere up until then small amounts of coal had been used for millennia there is evidence that the chinese first mined coal as early as 3490 b c e later many other societies greeks aztecs ro mans and likely all human societies with access to coal used it as a source of power greek scientist theophrastus a pupil of aristotle wrote sometime in 200 b c e that among the materials that are dug because they are useful those known as coals are made of earth and once set on fire they burn like charcoal like coal crude oil was used by ancient human societies as a source of fuel but also as water proofing and medicine native americans used the tarry black liquid as a salve for wounds and for the construction of airtight structures such as baskets and lodging like coal oil is formed by the compression of ancient fossils in a process that takes millions of years oil is roughly twice as energy dense as coal up until the late 1800s oil was not widely used to power the industrial revolution however by 1859 when col edwin drake drilled the first crude oil well in titusville pennsylvania there was a growing realization of oil s value as a source of transportable energy up until that point when such oil wells had been struck it was mostly done by accident by people intending to drill for water the black sticky goo was considered more of a nuisance than a powerful source of energy eventually gasoline at first thought of as a useless byproduct of crude oil production and natural gas found along with oil were also understood as valuable eunice newton foote a 19th century american scientist s alarming discovery in 1857 two years before drake s discovery eunice newton foote began exploring the atmospheric implications of burning fossil fuels her study in the american journal of science titled circumstances affecting the heat of the sun s rays showed that different gases trap heat differently the experiment was ingenious yet simple foote placed thermometers into glass test tubes filled each tube with a different gas oxygen common air carbon dioxide and hydrogen which she then sealed with a cork and placed in the sun her findings the hydrogen rose to 104 f the oxygen to 108 f common air to 106 f and co2 to 125 f her conclusion an atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature two years later scientist john tyndall demonstrated that mixing water vapor and thermal infra red energy from sunlight with gases such as carbon dioxide had a magnifying effect on heat laying the groundwork for what is now known as the greenhouse effect by the 20th century oil had fast become the preferred global source of energy initially there were only five main petroleum based companies three in the united states exxon gulf and mobil one in britain british petroleum and one in the netherlands royal dutch shell when world war i began in 1914 most of the armies involved used horses and carriages however fueled by a burgeoning influx of combustion engine innovations and increasing supplies of oil by these companies by the end of the war armies were able to deploy tanks and airplanes super charged by the war s innovations from that point the worldwide use of fossil fuels ballooned as did the associated emission of carbon into the atmosphere at around the same time another greenhouse gas methane with 80 times the heat trapping potential of co2 was also being increasingly released into the atmosphere methane is a by product of fossil fuel production but more than two thirds emanate from landfills and agriculture as garbage decays and as cows sheep and goats ruminants digest food methane is released today methane is the second largest contributor to climate change the production of cement and steel also contributes co2 to the atmosphere by the 1970s scientists and even the oil industry itself were warning governments of the increasing risks of burning fossil fuels and by the 1980s the data were clear on june 24 1988 a headline in the new york times reported that global warming has begun expert tells senate the article highlighted data from nasa that showed increasing temperatures and a recommendation for sharp cuts in the burning of fossil fuels to battle the shift in 1800 the worldwide emission of carbon was a few million tons a year today more than 40 billion tons of co2 is emitted annually with china the united states and the european union the largest contributors key findings from ipcc 2021 thousands of details are outlined in the ipcc report which is intended as a source of highly vetted information that policymakers can use when crafting legislation the report is not written for the public and therefore much of the information is highly technical it does not make predictions or include recommendations much of the forward looking science is based on models that give a range of possible outcomes the entire ipcc document has been reviewed and authorized often word by word by all of the u n member countries because of this past reports have often been widely considered to be watered down beyond recognition from their initial drafts however this ipcc report is different this one states unequivocally that humans are the cause of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels has raised the global temperature by 1 1 c or roughly 2 f this increase might not sound like much but such a global rapid increase in temperature has not been witnessed in the last 2 000 years we now find ourselves in a world where the average global temperature is higher than any time before the last ice age another key element of the report is that because greenhouse gases have already been released into the atmosphere the trend toward higher temperatures will continue for at least the next three decades each of the last four decades has seen increasing temperatures so our recent experiences with hotter dryer more ferocious weather events are expected to worsen another key point in the report is that if the world gets to what is called net zero emission of greenhouse gases within the next 30 years that temperature increases will stabilize albeit at those higher levels so whereas all the current best science points to more extreme conditions than we currently face if no action is taken the predicament may reach levels that pose an existential threat to the human race net zero does not mean that the use of oil cows or landfills will end anytime soon in fact most believe that the emission of greenhouse gases will continue to increase the hope is that offsets will combat the increase these include mechanically removing co2 and methane from the atmosphere planting more trees developing methods to reduce methane escape from landfills and using different food stocks algae for example to reduce methane emission from animals what the world looks like at higher temperatures the paris agreement adopted a goal of halting temperature increases to between 1 5 and 2 0 c by midcentury as mentioned above we are currently at 1 1 c but to put what seems like a relatively small temperature change into perspective a world at 1 5 c is bad enough but at 2 0 c basically all coral reefs would be gone ocean levels would cover low lying islands and many coastal locations extreme heat and drought would impact nearly half of the world s population crops would fail to grow in many regions swaths of forests would die back and large populations of plants animals and humans would be displaced beyond 2 0 c things would get even uglier as temperatures increase the impact on different areas of the planet will look very different some areas will see increased rain while others will witness drought in an agricultural region such as the napa valley an increase of 1 5 c will result in more frequent and worse droughts more ravenous wildfires higher nighttime temperatures that will hinder fruit development on vines new disease pressures as insects and viruses normally kept in check by winter frosts will find increased range decreases in groundwater access and intermittent significant flooding the newest ipcc report sounds yet another alarm for the world to urgently address the key sources of climate change the burning of fossil fuels methane emissions and other contributors such as cement and steel production there is still hope that we can stabilize global average temperatures at 1 5 c but even at those levels the world will look very different 30 years from now photos napa county students rally to protest climate change napa climate strike napa climate strike napa climate strike napa climate strike napa

air india has asked a new york court to dismiss a petition filed by britain s cairn energy for the seizure of its assets to enforce a 1 2 billion arbitral award against the indian government saying the litigation was premature as an appeal against the arbitration award was still pending the petition by ai which is separate to the indian government s plea in a washington court seeking the dismissal of cairn s lawsuit to seek confirmation of the arbitral award said the new york district court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a mere hypothetical question or one that depends upon contingent future events that may or may not occur advertisement cairn first moved a court in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking confirmation of the arbitration award and then filed a petition in the new york court to seek declaration of air india as alter ego of the indian government and so it should be made liable to pay the 1 26 billion arbitral award an international arbitration tribunal in december last year set aside the levy of capital gains tax using a 2012 retrospective legislation on a 2006 reorganisation of the india business that cairn carried before listing it on local stock exchanges it ordered india to return the value of shares seized and sold dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld to enforce levy with india refusing to pay cairn moved courts in the us cairn s petition to confirm the award is pending in the district court for the district of columbia air india said in the august 23 petition
all year or even longer investors have had a big worry what if the fed does something silly given that the us central bank is an august organisation stuffed with people who know what they are doing what if it never gets that far but someone does accidentally say something silly the annual central banker jamboree at jackson hole in wyoming last weekend think davos without the politicians or hangers on was always likely to offer an opportunity for some banker to say something open to awkward interpretation this year s virtual event provided a chance for fed chief jay powell to drop a big hint that he might just twist off the gushing monetary stimulus taps silliness is of course in the ear of the beholder reasonable people can dispute the merits and demerits of aggressive interest rate cuts and supersized monetary stimulus and whether either make matters better or worse even bankers not generally the cuddliest of creatures recognise that well meaning central bank largesse could be exacerbating economic inequalities by pumping up the asset values of the rich but fund managers charged with managing other people s money know that if the federal reserve the world s central bank in all but name were to pull back hard and fast on the monetary support it has provided since the pandemic struck last year that would upset the bond market that change would surely have an impact on other asset values for portfolio managers at least that seems a silly idea the memory of the taper tantrum shock when former fed chief ben bernanke signalled an unexpected withdrawal of support in 2013 very much lives on notably few investors ever suggest that too much easing is an error tightening up and hitting stock markets on the other hand is known in chin stroking circles as a policy mistake the sense of anticipation for powell s speech was intense sure in the dog days of august while most sensible people in the northern hemisphere are on holiday rather than glued to financial data terminals trading volumes are low anyway at least for us and european stocks they were well below average true to form key us stocks barometers such as the s p 500 and the nasdaq have kept hitting record high after record high this year even so jackson hole had been looming over the market for months it was a hurdle that those who fear tighter policy had to clear on friday the big day finally came powell like the other attendees spoke remotely this event was shifted online just days before it kicked off that did enough to dampen expectations of hints of a radical shift in policy if the threat from the delta variant could force an event like this online went the thinking then that concern would encourage some fed caution about jacking up interest rates in the end despite a chorus of other fed officials discussing the virtues of stepping back from stimulus relatively quickly powell opted for a safe route he painted a picture of an economy that is healing and gave a strong hint that the fed could start retracting its stimulus this year but he also spoke diplomatically of the dangers of acting too soon responding quickly may do more harm than good he said the ill timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired today with substantial slack remaining in the labour market and the pandemic continuing such a mistake could be particularly harmful no wonder us share prices climbed in response he added enigmatically there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks so where does this leave us likely back where we were before powell spoke this sense of insecurity of going it alone is one that investors have learned to live with some more reluctantly than others given the distorted nature of economic data on inflation and everything else since the shock of the first pandemic lockdowns fed officials have learnt to be humble says salman ahmed global head of macro and strategic asset allocation at fidelity international the investment industry has hundreds of economists analysing data but ultimately when the fed creates a narrative the market takes it seriously he says but now the fed is effectively saying we re in the same camp as you watching the data we have nothing special this will leave markets to the whim of ebbs and flows in the bond market for some time and possibly ahmed says for years at one point earlier this year it was all inflation is coming and it will destroy everything two weeks later everyone was talking about deflation there s no anchor narrative yet officials will continue to disagree with each other generally politely but sometimes perhaps in more barbed terms data releases will continue to build a case for less stimulus one day and then for more the next powell did not spoon feed the market on friday nor will the fed spoon feed it again for some time

opportunities and the public health and economic fallout of covid 19 are only making matters worse said luis guardia president of frac people who experience food insecurity often need to make difficult decisions like choosing between food and medicine or food and rent when people have a hard time putting food on the table it not only harms them it has costly implications on our nation s economy and health system mike halligan ceo of god s pantry in lexington kentucky said that despite a greater need for services many food banks are seeing fewer people many people who are truly hungry who are food insecure are benefiting from two key programs that are being offered by the federal government he said one is the stimulus checks and the other is increased snap benefits so we are actually even though the need is up we are actually seeing less people right now reaching out for emergency food assistance through a food bank or a food bank because they have available to them benefits related to the pandemic but he said he expects food insecurity to rise as federal benefits like federal unemployment assistance and eviction moratoriums end those benefits go through the end of september all of those benefits are helping address hunger and they re allowing folks to get food from a grocery store rather than having to go to a food bank or a food pantry he said but the fundamental issue of food insecurity does not go away it does not change where people will then access food is what will change and we expect to see more individuals accessing food through emergency food assistance programs like those that are offered at god s pantry food bank when those federally funded benefits go away later this year in rural areas of the state halligan said school programs helped families feed children during the school year those have changed to help families but they would likely change again when the federal benefits end is providing funding for families to go buy groceries to feed their children in the summer when they might otherwise be going to a summer feeding program or some kind of after school feeding program he said so it s making it easier for households with kids in rural america and rural kentucky to get food through a grocery store but with that incremental benefit again that s one that expires at the end of september we expect to see some differences in the fall versus what we re seeing right now in kentucky he said four of the 10 most food insecure counties in the united states are in eastern kentucky of the 50 most food insecure counties in the united states 14 are in central and eastern kentucky most of them halligan said are rural the biggest reason for the food insecurity in those areas is lack of access to food not just in how far away from food residents in those counties live but in access to affordable food halligan said he hopes lawmakers see that now especially in rural areas it s no longer a matter of providing food and hoping people show up but now more a matter of getting food to the people as in providing them with cards that help them buy food on their own the average household that needs food assistance needs it three times a year for three to four months and it s cyclical he said we need to ask ourselves how can we improve access to food in a country with such abundance how can we ensure that anyone across the united states has access to food and has ways of accessing it that is cost effective
cape may cape may officials are reexamining the use of surfboats following the death of a teenage lifeguard in an accident off a new jersey shore beach earlier this month officials said 16 year old norman inferrera was rowing one of the boats aug 19 when the vessel was broadsided by a wave and flipped over knocking him unconscious he was flown to cooper university medial center in camden where he died the following night the phoenixville pennsylvania teen was spending his first summer working as a lifeguard at cape may gov phil murphy ordered flags at half staff in inferrera s memory and city council members voted to name a beach in his honor the press of atlantic city reports that cape may officials have decided that guards will not train on or use the boats for at least the remainder of the year mayor zack mullock said the city will take a careful look at the boats place in modern lifesaving and on the beach some have suggested that after more than a century of use surfboats belong to another era superseded by rescue surfboards and personal watercraft veteran lifeguards however say they continue to serve a vital role beach patrol chief harry back said the van duyne surfboat the standard for most beach patrols in the region was designed to get through the waves and provide a stable platform for rescues back acknowledged that their use has dropped in recent years but said that is due to the changing shape of the beach a replenishment program beginning in 1991 created a steeper beach that means most rescues tend to be closer to the beach he said prior to replenishment they were used frequently he said they still function as a rescue vessel in certain circumstances they re there in case they re needed other guards agreed that the best rescue approach depends on factors such as the beach slope wave strength current direction and strength and the size of the crowd and each variable changes day to day wildwood beach patrol chief steve stocks called surfboats another tool in the toolbox and said that on some days the boat is the best tool in the toolbox the boat provides a platform where the lifeguard is up out of the water affording a much better view of the crowd he said a guard can even stand in the boat and get a raised view similar to that afforded by a lifeguard stand on the beach he said stocks acknowledged however that the boat has taken a lesser role to the rescue surfboard in recent years a single guard on a rescue board can move safely through a crowd and quickly reach a swimmer in distress and that s sometimes a better option he said copyright 2021 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed look inside this amazing cape may victorian home
the world has finally awoken to the existential imperative of securing a rapid transition to a green economy finance will play a pivotal role in that process but while financial institutions have made a big show of doing their part issuing green bonds and installing green lightbulbs far too many continue to provide capital to the fossil fuel industry and support other parts of the economy that are incompatible with a green transition such financing actively fuels the climate crisis many of these investments are long lived discovering developing and fully exploiting a new oil field takes decades stretching well beyond the horizon in which the world must become carbon neutral to prevent catastrophic levels of warming as such these projects almost certainly will become stranded assets holdings that have lost their value and usefulness amid the fight to save the planet these losses pose a risk to the investor and potentially to the economic system and the planet because most owners of stranded assets will selfishly fight to exploit their holdings no matter what financing for these investments creates an adverse political dynamic there are powerful lobbies committed to fighting the green transition lest they be the ones left holding the bag moreover if the transition succeeds these same groups will demand compensation effectively socialising the downside risk of investments that never should have been undertaken in the first place if history is any guide they will succeed in making themselves whole ideally we would simply ban such investments but for now this option is politically infeasible in the united states and many other countries another option is to deploy regulatory tools since markets are short sighted and often fail to account fully for key risks the obligation to ensure financial stability falls on those charged with overseeing the economy including central banks the 2008 financial crisis showed what can happen when even a small part of the world s asset base us subprime mortgages gets repriced the repricing of assets that are likely to be affected by climate change could have systemic effects that will dwarf those of 2008 the fossil fuel sector is just the tip of the melting iceberg for example rising sea levels and increasingly common extreme weather events from wildfires to hurricanes could force a sudden repricing of vast swathes of land and real estate too thus regulators need to require full disclosure of climate risk which includes not just physical dangers but also direct and indirect financial risks even if there is not unanimity about the magnitude of these risks or the pace of the coming change prudence requires disclosure of what could happen under the plausible scenarios that have been extensively discussed in intergovernmental panel on climate change assessments and elsewhere moreover a policy regime capable of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 combining carbon pricing with regulations will almost surely have a significant impact on asset prices if the economy moves too slowly in a green direction it increases the transition risk rather than a smooth efficient transition to carbon neutrality with gradual adjustments in asset prices we could end up with a more chaotic one in which prices would jump at critical moments when markets fully internalise the reality of the change to mitigate this risk finance must not only stop providing funds for investments that despoil our environment it also must provide funds for the investments needed to move us in the right direction we may need both carrots and sticks to nudge the industry along for example banks that make climate risky investments should be obligated to hold more reserves to reflect that risk investors have been warned those who nonetheless continue to make investments in fossil fuels should not effectively be subsidised by the public through the deductibility of losses in the us the government underwrites the vast majority of residential mortgages going forward it should do so only for green mortgages loans for homes that are well insulated and energy efficient furthermore to encourage investments that are predicated on a high carbon price governments could issue guarantees that if the price of carbon turns out to be lower than expected in say 20 years the investor will be compensated this would function as a kind of insurance policy pressing governments around the world to uphold their commitments under the paris climate agreement these and other similar policies will assist the green transition but even with such prodding the private financial sector is unlikely to do enough on its own many of the critical investments that we need are long lived and private financial markets too often focus on the short term to help fill the gap green development banks have already been created in many jurisdictions including the state of new york elsewhere existing development banks mandates have been broadened to include green development these institutions are making an important contribution not just in providing finance but also in assisting with the design and structuring of the green projects themselves the climate crisis demands enormous economic and societal changes we have no choice but to change how we consume produce and invest the challenge is manageable but if it is to be managed well finance must play its part and that will take more than a little prodding from civil society and governments alike project syndicate joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in economics is university professor at columbia university and a member of the independent commission for the reform of international corporate taxation
it does not matter where you are you must have seen prices of certain things rise sky high one of those objects is our beloved automobiles it has been a rough year for everybody and industries did not have it easy either americans love cars and the demand is always there no matter what though the demand diminished during the pandemic it has seen a huge resurgence now so much so that automakers are struggling to keep up with the demands you may only be able to browse your favorite cars on carhp but you may not actually be able to purchase them when did all of this start after the pandemic or during the pandemic you could say automobile industry suffered a big blow due to the lockdown and the demand suddenly plummeted they stopped their factories and their production when they did open up they were faced with the semiconductor shortage now with the people demanding vehicles and the manufacturers suffering from the low supply the market has gone crazy as a result the prices of cars have shot up massively if we take a look at the statistics from kelley blue book s analysts they report that the transaction price for new vehicles in january of 2021 was 40 857 just a year ago it was 38 747 those are pretty insane stats on average the price increased by more than 5 within a year even edmunds reports that the average new car transaction in 2021 has been around 40 000 it is not possible for everyone to afford a new vehicle in this market the market is massively inflated while there are various reasons for this the only one that we would be worried about is the demand and supply chain there is a chart that displays the average increase in price per brand if we take a look at that we see that stellantis chrysler had the highest increase in price between january 2020 and january 2021 it s almost around 10 the second highest on the list is volkswagen group and all the automakers under them which saw an 8 increase companies like acura honda gm hyundai kia toyota all experienced a price hike of 6 7 on average ford saw an increase of 4 volvo saw 3 however bmw and mazda barely saw any increase in price on the bright side there are automakers who had a drop in their prices in the same time period nissan saw a reduction of 4 and tesla also saw a reduction of around 5 mitsubishi saw a big reduction of 8 but out of all the manufacturers listed in kelley blue book s list the average among them turns out to be 5 45 increase on average not good news for those who wanted to buy new cars this year kelley blue book also released a list that captures similar details about transactions but according to the category of cars sold new compact cars are sold for an average of 22 394 crossovers cost 30 557 when new electric cars are 53 701 and so on the list varies widely and features all types of cars including entry level luxury cars full size pickups high performance cars luxury cars luxury suvs etc except for high end luxury cars electric vehicles and high performance cars all the other categories saw an increase in their price tag but high performance cars are the ones who experienced the highest reduction in price a massive cut of 16 63 if you are looking for a compact car or a crossover you might get away by paying just about 2 extra however if you want a full size suv or a luxury car you will need to shell out an additional 10 if you want a minivan to drive your family around in get ready to pay 12 extra no matter what type of car you choose chances are you would have to end up paying more than you would have last year and if a model is in demand you can easily expect to pay a hefty sum above the msrp the ones who would rather buy a used car are also not safe used car prices have also shot up significantly over the past few months in 2021 the average used car transaction is 23 000 which is quite tough to wrap your head around but what is causing the prices of new cars to rise so high well inflation is the primary reason but there is another obvious factor staring at us in the face yes the pandemic due to the pandemic a lot of industries have been hit hard workers losing their jobs companies losing their employees it all has been a tough emotional journey as you already might have heard there is an acute semiconductor shortage in the world semiconductors are used to create electronics all of the electronics inside your car are made with semiconductors with the shortage of semiconductors cars are basically handicapped that means no infotainment system no modern safety system no start stop system etc nobody wants a modern car without these features without the semiconductor chips automakers are finding it tough to manufacture cars and meet the demand companies like ford and gm are being forced to manufacture incomplete vehicles without the semiconductor chips put in them they are storing these incomplete vehicles in their lots when the stocks replenish they hope to fit these cars with the chips and send them to the market gm also thought about not including wireless chargers and some other features in some of their cars due to the shortage of chips apart from this shortage the demand just keeps growing last year people were forced to stay inside their homes and nobody had a demand for cars the automakers suffered and even temporarily shut down their factories however with the pandemic slightly subsiding and people being called back to work the demand is growing faster than ever people who saved money during the pandemic are also looking for new vehicles but due to the shortage in supplies the automakers cannot keep up with the increasing demand we all know high demand low supply high price this is the primary culprit behind the drastic increase in price toyota has not been affected by the semiconductor shortage as much as ford or gm has but all the companies are more or less in the same boat as to when everything is going to be normal we have no clue we can only wait and hope for the best

facing its own logistic issues indeed there is a very real chance this festive season will look less like a happy yuletide tale and more like the grinch when the pandemic first forced shut the doors of china s factories in january last year the world began to feel the impact practically immediately all of a sudden the stream of various products parts and materials from the asian country in some cases simply evaporated as arguably the world s most draconian lockdown choked off tightly wound supply chains here in australia this was best illustrated by the sizeable quantity of empty shelves of some large retailers such as kmart as supply issues began to significantly impact the availability of goods to consumers empty shelves at kmart in ashfield sydney in july 2020 pictures benedict brook news com au across practically every industry from construction to automotive hairdressers to furniture retailers supply chain issues have begun to impact businesses and the flow of goods to households for example where once you could order a new couch from one of the nation s large furniture retailers and have it in under a month customers are now often facing extremely long waits that at times stretch into the territory of you ll get it eventually a 12 month wait for stock now as a result of multiple outbreaks of the delta covid 19 strain in china and elsewhere throughout the manufacturing hubs of the world these issues have actually significantly worsened since the initial supply chain shocks of march and april last year when combined with the enormous level of western government stimulus driving the highest level of demand for manufactured goods in history there is little hope that the current supply chain issues can be resolved by the start of the 2022 lunar new

their first effort was to crowdfund enough money to buy tickets for amini for a flight to pakistan four tickets were bought but overnight conditions deteriorated it was clear the taliban were going to take kabul much faster than anyone had thought the next day sunday the group urged the family amini her mother and her two younger brothers to leave their home and go to kabul 30 kilometres away as the taxi entered the city amini saw people taking selfies with taliban closer to the airport british troops turned them away there was no way through my friends each one is a diamond haseen fatima amini afghan refugee over whatsapp the friends conferred what next they told amini she should stay close to the airport the family went to her uncle s who lived close by a few hours later the plane tickets were cancelled there would be no more commercial flights out of kabul haseen amini and her family with the help of us and canadian contacts made by her friends got permission to board a spanish military plane on august 24 the following days became a blur of activity emails phone calls and visa applications as the six chased down every lead every contact every friend of a friend and tapped the extensive uwc global network they took turns on the group chat with amini telling her that of course the airport would reopen she had to stay hopeful they worked around the clock advertisement they had tough conversations what if the pakistan land border was the best option could they ask amini and her 17 year old brother who had visas and current passports for that country to leave their mother and other brother behind amini discussed it with her family they agreed that if she could get out she should even if that meant leaving the others behind my friends each one is a diamond amini told the australian financial review in a zoom interview with all the group smiling alongside her on the screen logged in from their respective cities when i was scared when i was crying they gave me hope airport chaos they ran another chat without amini where possibilities were raised and dashed they managed to secure a letter from a french government minister authorising immediate entry for amini and her family the airport opened up again sort of to afghan civilians by tuesday august 17 the group decided collectively to send amini back to the airport by this time the taliban had set up filter points through which everyone had to pass as they fought their way through amini her little brother and her mother were beaten by the shoulder stocks of machine guns wielded by the taliban advertisement the family somehow managed to push their way through as far as the green zone at the airport where foreign military prevailed american dutch polish and german authorities were calling out names amini thought her family s turn would come that hope crumbled when an american soldier revealed the letter from the french minister was not enough her family s names weren t on any of the embarkation lists the situation deteriorated taliban soldiers started shooting first into the sky and then into the crowd people started running mass panic amini saw children die in the stampede from their respective countries her friends watched horrified as news clips streamed from the airport eventually the family retreated there was nothing else to do after she was back at her uncle s amini told her friends that her eyes hurt after seeing kids die in front of her that night there was a lot of shooting close by the situation seemed hopeless for those forced to witness the violence and the terror crowds wait at the airport at kabul ap the next day fearful the taliban would invade her uncle s house amini and her family returned to their home the taliban had taken over shops services prices for phone credit and food had skyrocketed the friends tried to send more money but all transfers to afghanistan are now blocked that night the group received a message saying amini was going to bed hungry but as the messages pinged around europe and down to singapore the friends kept going even if we got to a dead end we kept pushing in the hope something would come out of it says lola sweeney on the group interview advertisement we wanted to exhaust every option sleep didn t matter it was all about helping someone who really needed to get out of afghanistan sweeney says the group pulled each other through added david busley from germany every one of us had a low a point where we thought this was impossible but we always lifted each other up saying look this is a lead this is another it was the distribution of work that made this miracle happen on thursday august 19 a european mp who has long advocated for victims of terrorism got in touch the spanish government contacted earlier in the week advised that amini was now on their list an email would come with the date of her evacuation flight tell her and the family to come to the abbey gate wearing red and yellow scarves and to shout españa when nearby the soldiers amini s departure instructions three days later on sunday august 22 the email arrived tell her and the family to come to the abbey gate wearing red and yellow scarves and to shout españa when nearby the soldiers read the instructions it was suddenly clear that spain would take not just amini but also her two brothers and her mother it was a huge achievement but they still had to get out a us contact promised to organise transport for the family to pick them up from their home but the day wore on and there was still no firm pick up time finally the group decided they couldn t wait any longer they sent amini and her family to the airport for the third time advertisement it s risky the taxi will use up most of the money amini has left the airport is chaos will they get through they arrived at 11am some 12 hours later the group hears from amini the family have to get through three filter points one each controlled by the taliban by islamic state khorasan and the united states two hours pass the family gets through the first filter point and then it s another two hour wait till the next amini sent quick furtive updates she s terrified as she watches the taliban soldiers some drunk and is k beating people the group plead with her to be careful to stay off her phone by early monday morning the family have made it through the final filter point manned by is k the group that four days later would claim responsibility for a suicide bomb attack at the airport with the help of us and canadian contacts made by her friends as well as the spanish documentation the family have permission to board a spanish military plane finally after many more hours of anxious waiting the friends received a photo of the family on board a plane it s about 3am in europe on tuesday august 24 advertisement later that day the family arrives in madrid they have left their country their friends everything they knew they are now seeking asylum in spain her friends are fundraising again what this had taught them busley says was that every refugee has a story this is their story amini hopes to study again soon i ask myself why me why should i be the one to be rescued i have to do what i can to help those left behind especially the women and the children those of us who have left have to work hard we have to educate ourselves our families and the people of afghanistan so one day we can show we have the power to run the country who knows maybe in the future there will be a woman president of afghanistan

meetings with underlings fellow workers clients and investors turned almost entirely virtual anything that used to involve people crowding into spaces from performance reviews to shareholder jamborees roadshows and initial public offerings moved to cyberspace since march 2020 the nasdaq exchange in new york has held more than 150 virtual bell ceremonies the hong kong stock exchange has conducted at least 140 the aggregate amount of time people spent on microsoft s teams video conferencing platform tripled to 45m hours a day zoom went from being a moderately successful startup to a verb and for some people a four letter word now that many companies are reopening their offices and reconfiguring their work arrangements into something hybrid they are also rethinking their approach to meetings love them or more often loathe them powwows are an integral part of modern commerce managers must therefore decide which parts of remote experience if any they want to keep a poll of more than 7 000 people in ten countries by zoom found that two thirds would prefer a mix of virtual and in person meetings in future as with all work that is part remote and part not in other words the future of meetings looks messy fully virtual meetings are not going anywhere zoom s shares fell sharply on august 30th but only in response to an announcement that its growth had slowed in the latest quarter lumi a service which helps organise shareholder meetings says that 90 of this year s gatherings will be fully remote compared with 11 in 2019 openexchange a firm that provides virtual and hybrid events for companies and investors expects to run 200 000 of them in 2021 up from 4 000 in 2019 the rampant delta variant of covid 19 which is forcing firms to postpone their fuller return to the conference room is one reason but not the only one virtual meetings allow more people to attend than if participants had to travel to distant locations online gatherings can also be more flexible during the pandemic british workers scheduled meetings at times they would normally be commuting to and from work according to research by doodle a scheduling service video conferences also seem to work just fine for many purposes deloitte a consultancy surveyed 1 000 executives in america involved in private equity transactions and mergers and acquisitions it found that 87 of respondents said their firms were able to close deals in a purely virtual environment more than half would prefer to maintain this after the pandemic but virtual get togethers have drawbacks too more can be packed into a day leading to zoom fatigue another phrase that has entered common parlance they are also less likely to end on time a study by microsoft showed that the average meeting in microsoft teams lengthened from 35 to 45 minutes compared with a year earlier probably because they lack physical prompts such as people getting up to leave or the next group barging into the conference room for their own conclave hybrid meetings where some people are present in person and others dial in present a particular challenge most organisations have underinvested in the audiovisual technology that ensures that those dialling in are seen heard and do not feel like second class citizens in most pre pandemic meeting rooms such considerations were an afterthought poor lighting and ill placed microphones are common such technical niggles can be fixed with better technology and cleverer design of office space companies are experimenting with larger higher quality screens voice tracking cameras that follow the speaker and tools that limit background noise software that transcribes or records meetings is becoming standard easing pressure on employees to attend every session silicon

back to offices earlier than most it is now urging its bankers to get back on planes to meet clients in person jpmorgan s boss jamie dimon has made the firm s fleet of private jets available to

dimon may be on to something seven in ten respondents in zoom s study thought that it was important to meet clients physically fearful of forsaking good ideas that emerge from spur of the moment meetings many companies are reshaping their spaces to facilitate such serendipity whenever workers do deign to show up at the office a poll of 400 international firms by knight frank a property consultancy found that more than half expect the share of collaborative spaces in their portfolios to increase over the next three years nokia a finnish maker of telecoms equipment says that from next year around 70 of its office space will be dedicated to collaboration and teamwork dropbox a cloud storage firm has sold its headquarters in san francisco its new sites known internally as studios will feature larger conference rooms with versatile layouts and whereas big majorities of people tell surveys they favour hybrid work they clash over what this means for meetings specifically with respect to large gatherings the clear preference seems to be for virtual settings which 61 of zoom s respondents favoured compared with 39 opting for the physical conference room but the preferences differed by gender with around 44 of men preferring to attend large group meetings in person compared with just 33 of women whom studies show to be less likely to speak up in meetings and likelier to be interrupted by men with respect to smaller team meetings remote workers were split evenly between wanting to join in person and preferring to do so virtually and some countries work cultures look particularly averse to virtualisation 41 of french workers insisted they would only meet in person see chart some decisions will be straightforward enough meetings where crucial calls are made or new clients introduced will almost certainly take place in person when it comes to less consequential yet still important confabs the calculation will be more complicated one thing is certain a great many

by rocky swift tokyo reuters moderna inc s covid 19 vaccine contamination woes in japan widened after two regions put temporary holds on shots following the discovery of foreign substances in more batches the disruption to moderna nasdaq supplies comes as japan battles its worst wave of covid 19 yet driven by the contagious delta variant with new daily infections exceeding 25 000 this month for the first time amid a slow vaccine rollout the latest reports of vaccine contamination came from gunma prefecture near tokyo and the southern prefecture of okinawa prompting temporary holds on sunday on shots from two new moderna lots that followed the nationwide suspension of 1 63 million doses last week a tiny black substance was found in a moderna vaccine vial in gunma an official from the prefecture said while in okinawa black substances were spotted in syringes and a vial and pink material was found in a different syringe japan s health ministry said some of the incidents may have been due to needles being incorrectly inserted into vials breaking off bits of the rubber stopper the ministry and takeda pharmaceutical which distributes the moderna vaccine in japan said there were no safety issues from the okinawa and gunma incidents and that there was no need for nationwide suspensions gunma and okinawa can resume using vials from the lots in question as long as they do not contain foreign materials the ministry told a briefing late on monday the contamination cases come on the heels of a government report on saturday that two people died after receiving moderna shots that were among lots later suspended the government had said that no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and that the suspension was a precaution the causes of death are being investigated it is unlikely in my opinion that contamination of foreign substances led directly to sudden deaths said takahiro kinoshita a physician and vice chair of cov navi a vaccine information group if the contaminated substances were dangerous enough to cause death for some people probably many more people would have suffered from some symptoms after the vaccination however further investigations are definitely needed to evaluate the harm of the particular doses in question look at the bigger picture japan earlier halted the use of 1 63 million moderna doses shipped to 863 vaccination centres nationwide after takeda received reports of contaminants in some vials some 500 000 people received shots from those supplies taro kono the minister in charge of the vaccine push has said moderna and spanish pharma company rovi which bottles moderna vaccines for markets other than the united states said at the time that the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue in one of rovi s production lines rovi said in a statement on sunday that an investigation was under way in coordination with moderna takeda and the health authorities takeda also said on monday that the investigation was ongoing rovi shares closed down 13 5 on monday nicholas rennick an australian doctor practicing at the ntt medical centre in tokyo said the contamination is a serious problem and there is need to investigate but given rising covid 19 cases moderna vaccinations should continue with appropriate precautions severe covid 19 cases are at record levels in japan leaving many people to recuperate at home amid a shortage of critical care beds only 44 of its population has been fully vaccinated lagging vaccination rates of several developed countries we ve got thousands of delta variant patients around japan as we speak spreading the virus and so many of the population remain unvaccinated and unprotected rennick said we have to look at the bigger picture

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news today all political and all age cohorts hold record or near record positive views favoring labor over big business the steady rise in public support for labor and concurrent declining support for big business suggests a transformational shift in employer employee relations a unionized tesla workforce right now could benefit tesla as it would follow a shift in public opinion in favor of organized labor as someone who self financed my own college education through to a doctorate i experienced firsthand the vagaries of being a restaurant worker i remember walking into the kitchen and ducking as a french knife flew across my field of vision i heard constant tirades and slurs my co workers and i stood on our feet hour after hour without a break we were paid below minimum wage during periods when no tipping customers were present health insurance or vacation time advanced notice of schedule sick days not for us as restaurant workers post higher education i entered the teacher workforce and spent 20 years as a secondary english educator supported by the massachusetts teachers association and the national education association i received pay increases based on performance reviews years served and education accumulated health benefits allowed my family to have security length of work days descriptions of duties protocols for everything from acceptable work behavior to emergencies the union collaborated and negotiated with the school district as to what an appropriate workplace should be like being part of a union changed my life a unionized tesla workforce is an opportunity that could improve tesla give a boost to thousands of staff and help tesla s image and long term vision infrastructure bill draws upon union support the senate gave overwhelming bipartisan approval on august 10 to a 1 trillion infrastructure bill to rebuild the nation s deteriorating roads and bridges and fund new climate resilience and broadband initiatives delivering a key component of president biden s agenda the vote which was 69 to 30 was uncommonly bipartisan according to the new york times the bipartisan endorsement that included a nod to transportation should be instructive to tesla joining us president biden for the public face of the announcement were executives from general motors ford and stellantis who made broad and noble statements about their commitments to electric transportation electric vehicles however are only a merest hint of these companies us sales with 1 5 for gm 1 3 for ford and none yet for stellantis so far this year tesla which manufactures only battery electric vehicles was excluded from the white house photo shoots and conversations yeah seems odd that tesla wasn t invited responded tesla ceo elon musk in a tweet responding to a cleantechnica article about it yeah seems odd that tesla wasn t invited elon musk elonmusk august 5 2021 that exclusion makes me sad tesla has been nothing less than revolutionary as it has opened up the us and world to all electric transportation by making electric transportation mainstream it disrupted a legacy industry and offered a new business model and consumer approach disclaimer i am a tesla stockholder the united automobile aerospace and agriculture workers uaw union was also at the white house ceremony uaw represented workplaces range from multinational corporations small manufacturers and state and local governments to colleges and universities hospitals and private non profit organizations the uaw has more than 400 000 active members in more than 600 local unions and has 1 150 contracts with some 1 600 employers in the us canada and puerto rico the uaw represents workers at gm ford and stellantis but has been battling so far unsuccessfully to organize tesla workers at its us plant in fremont california indeed right now tesla is the only large us automaker without a unionized workforce uaw spokesperson brian rothenberg said he was not aware that tesla was not invited to the event court rulings on tesla unionization controversies in 2017 tesla workers at its auto plant contacted the uaw to seek assistance to unionize we have a long history of engaging directly with our employees on the issues that matter to them and we will continue to do so because it s the right thing to do a tesla spokesperson countered administrative judge amita tracy pointed to 12 company actions in 2019 that violated us labor laws that included letting security guards harass workers who were passing out union pamphlets in the parking lot banning employees from wearing pro union t shirts and buttons repeatedly interrogating union organizers and eventually firing one of them later the national labor relations board based their decision on tracy s ruling from 2019 and ordered tesla to make tesla s chief executive delete a tweet that was seen as threatening to labor organizers who were discussing how to unionize within the company the federal board also ordered tesla to reinstate a terminated employee richard ortiz who was a union advocate the order added that elon musk had illegally threatened workers with the loss of stock options if they unionized the guardian reports that complaints from workers over being fired for engaging in efforts to unionize at tesla have become common i was a union supporter i wore a union shirt almost every day to work and my supervisor at the time asked me why i wore it said jim owen who left the tesla factory in fremont california in march 2018 due to concerns for his safety after a robot almost severely injured him while working on car hoods he told me upper management wouldn t appreciate me wearing it unionization would be good for tesla its workers president biden has taken a big step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions with an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric a move made with vocal backing from the prominent us automakers the biggest thing that s happening here is there s a realization on the part of both labor and business now that this is the future we can t sit by biden told reporters at the white house clearly tesla is not a company content to sit by it continually files patents to improve the quality of tesla manufacturing but as a longtime fremont autoworker wrote in fortune we will only have a truly sustainable future if workers have a seat at the table throughout the transition from oil gas and internal combustion engines to batteries charging stations and zero emission vehicles workers want to unionize so that they can have input into wages hours working conditions and the many other issues that arise in the relationship between a worker and employer unions help set the standards for education skill levels wages working conditions and quality of life for workers while not always the case union negotiated wages and benefits are generally superior to what non union workers receive in germany right now labor unions are pressuring tesla it s likely there will be a public relations campaign and protests to exert political and social pressure on tesla to become what is considered a good corporate citizen there could be organized rolling strikes or guerilla actions like slowing down work at a tesla supplier or attempts to influence tesla s leadership from within the biden administration has promised to strengthen union rights incentivize unionization and encourage collective bargaining research exposes how public feeling today toward labor is more positive and public feeling toward big business more negative than at any time in 5 decades workers increasingly want to unionize over half of us workers say they would vote to unionize at their place of employment while only 11 of us employees currently belong to one the bottom line is that if tesla was to become a union shop both sides would benefit with a stable workforce comes predictable labor costs tesla would be viewed publicly as an employer that makes a workforce safer more productive and more effective through training better equipment and making better use of their knowledge the uaw in turn can be transparent in recognizing the needs of tesla to be responsive to customers and competitive in its markets it has already stated recently that the auto industry is now investing billions in the growth of electric vehicles which could result in major changes in where and how vehicles are produced a recent survey from consumer reports found a third of us car buyers are considering an electric car the next time they purchase a new car having a tesla company story that involves union workers and living wages would be a competitive advantage commercially as those soon to be ev drivers would be more likely to choose a tesla if their new car had been manufactured at a union facility have a tip

cape may officials are reexamining the use of surfboats following the death of a teenage lifeguard in an accident off a new jersey shore beach earlier this month officials said 16 year old norman inferrera iii was rowing one of the boats aug 19 when the vessel was broadsided by a wave and flipped over knocking him unconscious he was flown to cooper university medial center in camden where he died the following night the phoenixville teen was spending his first summer working as a lifeguard at cape may gov phil murphy ordered flags at half staff in inferrera s memory and city council members voted to name a beach in his honor the press of atlantic city reports that cape may officials have decided that guards will not train on or use the boats for at least the remainder of the year mayor zack mullock said the city will take a careful look at the boats place in modern lifesaving and on the beach some have suggested that after more than a century of use surfboats belong to another era superseded by rescue surfboards and personal watercraft veteran lifeguards however say they continue to serve a vital role beach patrol chief harry back said the van duyne surfboat the standard for most beach patrols in the region was designed to get through the waves and provide a stable platform for rescues back acknowledged that their use has dropped in recent years but said that is due to the changing shape of the beach a replenishment program beginning in 1991 created a steeper beach that means most rescues tend to be closer to the beach he said prior to replenishment they were used frequently he said they still function as a rescue vessel in certain circumstances they re there in case they re needed other guards agreed that the best rescue approach depends on factors such as the beach slope wave strength current direction and strength and the size of the crowd and each variable changes day to day wildwood beach patrol chief steve stocks called surfboats another tool in the toolbox and said that on some days the boat is the best tool in the toolbox the boat provides a platform where the lifeguard is up out of the water affording a much better view of the crowd he said a guard can even stand in the boat and get a raised view similar to that afforded by a lifeguard stand on the beach he said stocks acknowledged however that the boat has taken a lesser role to the rescue surfboard in recent years a single guard on a rescue board can move safely through a crowd and quickly reach a swimmer in distress and that s sometimes a better option he said
menafn syndication bureau of the 29 articles in the final statement of the recent arab league summit in saudi arabia none expressed support toward the arabs living on the iranian side of the arabian gulf despite recent incidents that show how they are being squeezed by the regime it is of course highly distasteful to have to speak in terms of race ethnicity and sectarian divisions but that is the unavoidable tone of politics in iran tehran exploits all this in the furtherance of its regional ambitions that in the case of arab residents within its borders has resulted in amnesty international s cataloging of infringements of those rights they share with all humanity that is to say their very human rights indeed recent iranian politics is a sad history of repression against minorities of all stripes living on the northern shores of the gulf while some might argue that the arab league refrained from mentioning the plight of iran s arabs out of respect to national sovereignty article 23 of the statement denounced human rights violations of the government of myanmar against the country s muslim minority showing that the league could have expressed similar support toward oppressed communities of arabic and other descent much closer to home this was a missed opportunity according to amnesty international iran s ethnic minorities including arabs azerbaijani turks baluchis kurds and turkmen have remained subject to entrenched discrimination curtailing their access to education employment adequate housing and political office the persian or farsi language remained the sole medium of instruction during primary and secondary education contributing to higher drop out rates in minority populated areas in its 2017 2018 report the organization wrote that members of minorities who spoke out against violations of their rights faced arbitrary arrest torture and other ill treatment grossly unfair trials imprisonment and the death penalty in a most recent example iran s state tv failed to mention arabs as one of the country s minorities in a children s program and when the arabs of ahwaz in the southwest protested the iranian authority s marginalization of arab origins and its efforts to erase their arab identity according to the group iran human rights monitor security forces detained 140 protesters the rights group also claimed that over the past decade ahwaz has witnessed growth in non arab migration into their residential areas with government support the aim of disrupting the demographic composition in the northeast iranian kurds found themselves taking to the streets between december 28 and january 7 to protest against the government denouncing its policy of corruption repression and martial law according to the washington kurdish institute despite the official narrative about a monolithic and ancient civilization iran is all but homogenous it is under the mullahs a vast country that is stitched together with myths that alternate between nationalism and religion with tehran using either or both to serve the repressive purposes of its government iran s duplicity between nationalism and religion has also been applied to its foreign policy azerbaijan has an overwhelmingly shia population yet tehran the self proclaimed leader of the world s shia has allied with christian armenia against the ethnically turkish azeris in iraq however iran behaves as the leader of the shia pitting the country s shia arabs against sunni arabs swinging between persian nationalism and international shiism iran has bullied communities here there and everywhere as it seeks to enforce a hegemony it has insisted on the name persian gulf for instance for the body of water where arabs form a majority of those who live on its shoreline and islands on more than one occasion iranian foreign minister javad zarif has called for the expansion of the concept of the persian gulf to include the red sea and especially to count yemen on its littoral the country where iran has been actively funding arming and training militias that have undermined local sovereignty and stability more successfully iran launched an international pr campaign that has secured the use in international circles of the name persian gulf though semantics may be a poor excuse tehran nevertheless has cited the common use of this name as an alibi for its expansion and dominance good relations between neighbors are built on mutual respect of each other s sovereignty iran however has used national chauvinism to repress ethnic minorities at home and has deployed world shiism to agitate communities in countries throughout the middle east as long as tehran fails to observe international rules and norms there is no reason why its neighbors most of whom came together in saudi arabia for the arab league summit should respect iranian sovereignty and not express solidarity with iran s oppressed minorities arab as well as those of other ethnic stock for perhaps nowhere is iran s ambition for regional prowess felt more keenly than at home where the suppression of rights for minorities is part of its revisionist rewriting of history minorities in iran after all have no place to turn to they could do with some champions abroad hussain abdul hussain is the washington bureau chief of kuwaiti daily al rai and a former visiting fellow at chatham house in

bloomberg western digital corp is pitching a fresh proposal to acquire kioxia holdings corp four years after it lost out on a bid to take over the former toshiba corp chip unit but the u s company s offer faces familiar hurdles among the challenges kioxia s senior management would prefer going public officials in the japanese government are concerned about losing control of a chipmaker and chinese regulators are likely to block a u s takeover according to people familiar with the matter kioxia plans to file for its initial public offering as soon as next month to capitalize on strong investor demand for chip stocks said one of the people asking not to be named because the matter is private western digital and its bankers have been aggressive in pitching a deal offering a high price and describing it as a merger the people said bain capital which controls kioxia along with toshiba is open to a combination one person said political opposition may be the biggest hurdle japan s government has always been protective of its high tech companies and the powerful ministry of economy trade and industry helped decide the bidding war four years ago when toshiba sold a controlling stake in the chips unit to the bain led consortium one faction at meti is open to discussing a western digital deal but another faction opposes a sale one person said japan s government has been planning to invest billions of dollars into fostering the domestic semiconductor industry so losing control of its most prominent chipmaker would seem to be in conflict with that goal meti hasn t decided whether to approve the deal prime minister yoshihide suga and akira amari the politician championing local semiconductor investment will likely make the final decision one person said china is a bigger hurdle beijing has been increasingly resistant to approving acquisitions by american companies as tensions with the u s government surge chinese regulators have yet to approve nvidia corp s proposed acquisition of softbank group corp s arm ltd with many analysts proclaiming the deal effectively dead chinese approval of a kioxia sale could also prove problematic if the memory chip manufacturer falls into the hands of an american company it would be directly subject to any restrictions on sales determined by president joe biden s administration kioxia s management risks getting tied up in a merger deal that china could review for a year or two and then reject the deal has zero merit to kioxia said akira minamikawa an analyst a omdia he pointed out that kioxia and western digital already cooperate on the production of nand flash memory the american company would likely use its control to shift the balance toward memory chips for personal computers rather than for smartphones as kioxia has preferred by buying kioxia western digital wants to change allocation of output for the biggest benefit for the u s company he said the world is short of computer chips here s why quicktake the deal is already a stretch for western digital financially the proposed acquisition which would be done with cash and stock would value the target at more than 20 billion one person has said western digital s market value is just below that level certain factors have changed in favor of a deal since western digital failed in its bid four years ago chief executive officer steve milligan who led the charge at that time and infuriated top executives at toshiba left his post last year yasuo naruke the former ceo of toshiba memory who forcefully fought the takeover passed away last year relations between the two companies are less bitter but not warm milligan s replacement is david goeckeler who has been floated as the likely candidate to run the combined company but kioxia has not yet agreed on who will take the ceo job or which top executives would lead the management one person said the structure has also not been determined japanese financial institutions which would likely be needed to finance a deal have not been involved yet the person said financing would have to be worked out after the structure of the deal is finalized 2021 bloomberg l p
thousands of dana auto parts workers across the united states are voting to reject the five year sweatshop contract that the united auto workers uaw and united steelworkers usw are trying to force through major plants have already voted no by overwhelming margins including pottstown pennsylvania fort wayne indiana paris tennessee warren michigan and danville kentucky workers at other plants will be voting early this week this rebellion against dana the uaw and usw is a powerful step forward for dana workers and for the international working class after 18 months of a pandemic that has killed over 650 000 people in the us and more than 4 million worldwide the no vote is a sign of a growing sense in the working class that massive levels of social inequality are intolerable and that something must be done the reality at dana explodes the arguments of groups like the democratic socialists of america dsa and publications like jacobin and left voice which falsely present the trade unions as workers organizations at informational meetings held sunday to discuss a proposed five year contract overworked and exhausted workers erupted at uaw and usw officials who refused to let workers see the full contract and are collaborating with management by requiring overtime to help the company stockpile products in case of a strike concerned that the uaw and usw will commit ballot fraud workers at many plants took the independent initiative to send delegations of rank and file workers to monitor the counting of votes workers are rebelling against conditions that bring to mind the work of turn of the 20th century muckrakers like photographer jacob riis or author upton sinclair sinclair s 1906 novel the jungle described unsafe unsanitary and exhausting conditions confronting immigrant workers in chicago s back of the yards meatpacking district that would be very familiar to dana workers today the fact that conditions in 2021 are arguably worse than before the rise of industrial unions is a product of decades of betrayals carried out by the afl cio and trade unions everywhere in this union shop dana workers receive only one unpaid day off every three months they regularly work 20 40 or even 60 days in a row without a break with shifts as long as 12 hours workers pass out from heat exhaustion suffer heart attacks seizures or contract covid 19 on the job while the usw and uaw keep production moving no matter the cost to human life the company and union treat workers worse than animals when dry ridge kentucky dana worker danny walters had a seizure at work neither the company nor the uaw called his wife to inform her the worker received a notification hours after his death saying he had been mandated to come to work the next day dana workers view walters premature death as a symbol of the many layers of injustice they continue to face every day and have pledged to carry forward their struggle in his name such horror stories are common at dana plants which workers call slave ships prisons and sweatshops workers are paid next to nothing while the company s ceo trump supporter james kamsickas made over 10 million in 2020 and while the company doles out tens of millions in dividend payouts to wealthy shareholders the company received 9 million in funding from the bipartisan corporate bailout known as the cares act while production continued through the entire pandemic workers confront not only one ruthless company but the entire capitalist system the extreme exploitation of dana workers is not the exception under capitalism but the rule as millions die preventable deaths from the pandemic this law of capitalist exploitation has propelled governments across the world to enact policies that the bmj formerly british medical journal described as social murder forcing students back to school so that their parents can go back to work to be exploited for profit even amid the spread of the deadly delta variant the policy of the ruling class is to guarantee corporate profit and fuel the astronomical rise of global stock exchanges no matter how many millions die dana workers have begun to coalesce around a committee established by dana workers from critical plants across the country the dana workers rank and file committee dwrfc has won wide support by raising the demand for an 8 hour day and 40 hour week as well as 75 percent raises and workers control over plant safety during the pandemic many dana workers report that the world socialist web site has been an invaluable tool in their struggle providing guidance and information about the company as well as that related to the experience of past struggles dana workers have been studying the lessons from the volvo workers rank and file committee vwrfc established by virginia workers during their struggle against the company and the uaw as well as the lessons of the 2019 wildcat strike of auto parts workers in matamoros mexico the struggle at dana is part of a growing international rebellion of workers across the world an imf report published last week warned that the world is in the midst of a massive eruption of the class struggle the report says the number of general strikes and mass protests has skyrocketed by a staggering 244 percent between 2011 the year of the arab spring and 2019 of particular concern for the financial aristocracy the number of general strikes increased by 821 per cent on international workers day 2021 may day the international committee of the fourth international called for the formation of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees or iwa rfc the icfi wrote the iwa rfc will work to develop the framework for new forms of independent democratic and militant rank and file organizations of workers in factories schools and workplaces on an international scale the working class is ready to fight but it is shackled by reactionary bureaucratic organizations that suppress every expression of resistance it will be a means through which workers throughout the world can share information and organize a united struggle to demand protection for workers the shutdown of unsafe facilities and nonessential production and other emergency measures that are necessary to stop the spread of the virus the rebellion at dana confirms the need for the development of an international alliance of committees to direct the struggle of the working class the socialist equality party and the wsws are committed to assisting dana workers and all workers in establishing and building a network of rank and file committees in the us and throughout the world

the lofty and jagged peaks of jackson hole could be the most valuable warning of all gold is the ultimate market solution as delta continues to wreak havoc in the usa and around the world sell australia remains our other central mantra we were the first to call that a recession was already underway in australia only over the weekend have a few competitors and the government begun to acknowledge this as a risk it is already a reality we are in it the absurdity of buying stocks in this economic reality will become increasingly apparent to all market participants us stocks rallied on the combination of powell and data our highlights last week were two fold the market could very well have a knee jerk upward response but was already losing momentum i stand by both statements i feel that loss of momentum encourages the view that the knee jerk rally after powell will be short lived monday momentum follow through likely but after that we could be pitching over yet again powell tapering will happen this year the fed has continued to move closer to our early forecast of tapering this year and interest rate hikes next year what the market liked was that interest rates will not be occurring at the same time as tapering and are therefore some time off it always amuses me when the stock market gets excited over something not happening that was never going to happen in the first place tapering comes first then rate hikes interest rate hikes when they finally arrive will be so far behind the inflation curve that the economic situation will be dire an aggressive rate hike cycle larger than it needed to be awaits the united states and likely australia as well inflation will continue to gather momentum far beyond the federal reserve s current expectations the spread of delta will only further the inflation process while at the same time again degrading the economy exactly what is being seen in australia at the moment in a profound way us consumer spending it was positive though only an average kind of performance despite the recent escalation in consumer debt this is not a good sign it suggests many americans are borrowing just to keep the household going layoffs remain high and the increasing human and economic toll of delta is steadily rising us core pce inflation up 0 3 in july is of concern that the previous number was revised higher allowed people to suggest this is a slowing from june s 0 5 really though as this number could be revised higher as well all we actually know is that we currently have a two month average of 0 4 in the real world right now we can be sure there are gathering further inflationary pressures australian gdp q2 revised australian gdp data for the second quarter will be released this week it could well be lower than the previous estimate what is certain is that it is pretty much immaterial the afr today calls it the risk of a surprise recession there is nothing surprising about it at all australia is in recession q3 q4 and possibly into q1 next year as well the rolling over of the australian economy was already in place as forecast before the resumption of lockdowns the damage to the economy is already permanent there is no super spend no further need for renovations no broad jobkeeper that so helped those in need while creating a profit windfall for some the targeted measures now in place are more appropriate but some are slipping through the cracks the ultimate damage however is being done by the psychological impact on small and medium sized businesses and families the main employers of the nations workforce many will not be coming back regardless of eventual re openings back to school in october for nsw how will that be possible if children become very ill and are even hospitalised if this trend were to develop further we already see early signs in which case there will be no early return to school this is not an argument for or against lockdowns as a strategy it is merely an assessment of the likely force of delta and potential re thinking of government policies on the matter the australian recession can turn into a depression not the most probable scenario and not my forecast but while others see risk of recession i can see we are already there and the risk is far greater still than people can accept or acknowledge there has been a complete failure at the federal and state level to understand just how damaging the current situation is to the long term outlook we will come through this and things will get better the pace of that recovery will however be slower than any of us would like the recovery will not be a rebound of the likes previously experienced it will be a long haul and at times a struggle especially as this situation is not in isolation the rest of the world has renewed problems too as a trading nation with harsh domestic lock downs our economy is already on its knees

the pic is suing iqbal survé s sekunjalo independent media for r700 million related to the 2013 takeover of independent newspapers in court papers it has emerged that former pic chief executive dan matjila secretly signed away the pic s ability to claim back the money accruing to state pensioners the pic is now trying to repudiate matjila s agreements with survé as unlawful the public investment corporation pic says it was owed r709 839 328 45 by iqbal survé s sekunjalo independent media sim as at 31 may last year this debt stems from the pic s funding of sim s takeover of the independent media group in 2013 with punitive interest that would easily be over r800 million by now which really belongs to the government employees pension fund gepf managed by the pic there is only one problem sim claims that the debt does not exist and even if it does exist it ranks so far behind other large debts that in practice it will never have to be repaid sim might very well be right thanks to the actions of dr dan matjila the pic s former chief executive outlined in court papers recently obtained by amabhungane the documents show that after dragging sim to court with a liquidation application in november 2019 the pic was stumped when survé surprised them with a secret agreement signed by matjila in december 2017 it was a so called subordination agreement annexed to sim s responding papers and it showed matjila had made astonishing concessions to sim which drastically weakened the pic s position the agreement states in order to assist the company the creditor agrees to subordinate for the benefit of the other creditors of the company both present and future so much of its claims liabilities and obligations of whatsoever nature and however arising against the company as would enable the claims of such other creditors to be paid in full if sim were ever to be liquidated the pic will not prove or tender to prove a claim in respect of its subordinated claim which proof would reduce or diminish any dividend payable to other creditors due to a roughly r1 billion debt owed to chinese funder interacom by sim which is effectively broke a subordination agreement in practice extinguishes the pic s claim because the chinese would be paid out in full before the pic got a cent another clause reads no shareholder of the creditor shall take or enforce any action arising from any event of default howsoever arising against the company in other words the pic is effectively banned from taking legal action to protect its rights then there is the clincher the subordination will in effect be permanent the creditor hereby agrees that until such time as the assets of the company as fairly valued exceed its liabilities as fairly valued it shall not be entitled to demand or sue for or accept repayment of the whole or any part of the said amount owing to it so if the agreement stands the pic has no claim on the money it is owed unless sim somehow reverses its hopeless insolvency the papers also claim the existence of this agreement came as a shock to the pic in june last year the pic under new leadership launched another court application to claim back the money from sim this time including an attempt to quash the matjila agreement in its particulars of claim the pic states before sim annexed the subordination agreement to an answering affidavit delivered relating to an application issued by the gepf against sim to place the latter in winding up the pic alternatively the gepf had no knowledge of the existence of this subordination agreement the subordination agreement adds to the litany of claims that matjila repeatedly prejudiced the pension fund to make deals that favoured survé this agreement accompanied an equally hard to justify share and claims sale agreement that amabhungane has previously reported on here both these agreements were tied to the failed listing on the jse of survé s african unicorn sagarmatha technologies in which the pic was set to sink billions of rands amabhungane has also recently reported on how the south african clothing and textile workers union sactwu another funder of the 2013 sim takeover of independent finds itself in the same bind as the pic like matjila sactwu general secretary andre kriel was persuaded to sign the same subordination and claim sale agreements a rush to sign off the pic court papers show how matjila rushed to sign off on the sagarmatha deal alongside the share and claims and subordination deals with survé before the pic s relevant investment committee could even formally consider it as it turns out the committee rejected the deal not knowing matjila had already signed it endangering hundreds of millions of rands belonging to government pensioners a major chunk of the debt related to the 2013 independent deal was due for repayment in august 2018 but it was clear much earlier that there would be a default according to the court papers between august and september 2017 sim started having meetings with the pic about the gepf s exit strategy from its investments in sim and independent media and or a potential investment opportunity in the subsidiary company that sekunjalo holdings intended to list on a recognised stock exchange the deal survé had in mind was that the pic would give up its loan claims as well as its shares in sim and in independent itself in exchange for sagarmatha shares these sagarmatha shares would allegedly be worth r1 5 billion but this figure was based on a valuation provided by survé s own company this neat escape trick was captured in a survé letter to matjila dated 14 september 2017 asking him to simply personally sign off on the deal please accept this offer by countersigning in the space provided below upon which a binding agreement will come into existence at this point survé was already making outlandish claims about the international interest in his supposed technology venture which largely consisted of a bailout for independent we are pleased to announce that sagarmatha has also attracted to its advisory board and as shareholders technology billionaires from the usa holland china singapore and india sagarmatha will more than likely have at its listing some of the world s prominent technology billionaire investors as shareholders and as members of its international advisory board signalling a significant vote of confidence in sagarmatha amabhungane has previously reported on how survé s claims about his company were about as real as the african unicorn unicorn is colloquialism for a technology start up worth more than a billion dollars following survé s daring gambit to have matjila sign off without further ado the johannesburg stock exchange jse apparently raised unspecified concerns it would later be the jse itself that scuppered the sagarmatha listing months later a second letter dated 1 december 2017 was sent by survé to matjila subsequent to comments received from the johannesburg stock exchange jse in relation to the original offer letter we hereby substitute and replace the original offer letter with this offer letter and the contents hereof in order to address the concerns of the jse this time around the offer at least contained some of the normal checks and balances one would expect in a deal purportedly worth r1 5 billion this included the condition that each party acquires the necessary approvals for them to enter into the sale agreement for the pic that condition would be the consideration of the proposal by its private equity priority sector and small medium enterprise fund investment panel peppsfip this panel did meet to consider the sekunjalo proposal a few days after survé s letter on 6 december it roundly rejected the core basis of the deal getting paid in sagarmatha shares of doubtful value sekunjalo claimed the shares were worth r39 62 each the pic s internal research came up with a value of r7 06 instead of these shares the panel insisted on a cash payment for the gepf s exit from independent the panel would also not make a commitment to investing in sagarmatha for all practical purposes these conditions amounted to a wholesale rejection of the deal but not for dr dan unbeknownst to his colleagues matjila had already signed sekunjalo s offer on 1 december the day it arrived in the mail still acting alone and according to the court papers without any authority unlawfully alleging to represent the gepf matjila signed the full share and claims sale agreement on 13 december heedless of the committee s decision the secret subordination agreement which cut off exit from the sagarmatha pipe dream is not properly dated but a signed copy is included in the court papers the pic s arguments to repudiate the subordination deal are based on matjila s alleged lack of authority to make investment decisions of this magnitude without jumping through any number of hoops involving the peppsfip and other executives none of that happened and no due diligence was done claims the pic matjila told amabhungane he was unaware of this latest litigation between the pic and sim until we brought it to his attention for the record though it is important for me to record that i have never acted outside the company mandate and delegated authority whilst i was the chief executive of the pic i had no pre existing relationship with dr surve whom i have only met in the course my work at pic like many other investors and pic clients see matjila s full response here in testimony before the mpati commission of inquiry in july 2019 matjila had said that there was a continuous engagement with dr surve and the reason for this was not because of friendship per se but i and my colleagues were worried that the pic was increasingly exposed to high risk survé told other pic employees he considers matjila a good friend according to other testimony at the commission no escape the pic is trying to wriggle out of the share and claims sale agreement on two bases one is that matjila had no power to sign it the agreement should also not be read to force the pic into trading its claims on and shares in independent and sim for useless sagarmatha shares the agreement was explicitly tied to the sagarmatha listing the effective date at which the share swop was deemed to happen was according to the agreement the day that an announcement was made on the jse s sens news service indicating how many shares are getting listed on the exchange that announcement went out on 28 march 2018 even though the listing ultimately failed nothing in the agreement however said that it was conditional on the listing succeeding even if that seems like an obvious inference the pic is arguing the agreement must be read to imply that the sale and exchange would only be implemented upon the successful listing of sagarmatha s ordinary shares on the jse listing within a reasonable time after the signing of the the subordination agreement is different it makes no explicit reference to the sagarmatha listing at all after the listing fell away the subordination agreement appears to remain in force unless sim s hopeless financial state is dramatically reversed and the assets of the company as fairly valued exceed its liabilities as fairly valued here the pic s argument is that matjila had no authority to sign the deal without going through the pic s checks and balances same old story the listing of sagarmatha was a transparent attempt to bail out sim and independent media by having the pic forgive its debt and in addition invest several billion rands more it would have been the culmination of a series of increasingly generous pic investments in survé companies that started with the listing on the jse of premier fishing in march 2017 the fishing company was 100 owned by african equity empowerment investments aeei which is survé s main investment vehicle for the listing it sold 45 of the company with 23 75 going to the pic for r278 million the manoeuvres to help sim escape its debt obligations in december 2017 coincided with matjila s even more damaging actions in relation to the listings of survé s ayo technology solutions that same month once again he allegedly circumvented the pic s internal processes in order to invest a staggering r4 3 billion in ayo as with sagarmatha the ayo shares matjila made the pic buy were grossly overvalued in the ayo case the investment was forced through with matjila allegedly signing an irrevocable agreement to make the investment on 14 december two weeks after sealing the irregular sim deal and a mere day after signing the share and claims agreement this signature again predated a formal consideration of the deal by the pic a week later the pic is also trying to get its money back from ayo again relying on the argument that matjila had gone rogue
last week s supreme court ruling striking down the biden administration s eviction moratorium will vastly accelerate the ongoing housing crisis in the us this is all the more so since it takes place in the midst of a worsening pandemic that has killed over 654 000 people in the us alone as of this writing moreover the federal unemployment supplement will expire across the country in a matter of days and consumer prices including for housing continue to surge although evictions are not tracked in the us nationally the princeton university eviction lab has documented 488 069 evictions since mid march 2020 in the six states and 31 cities it tracks with some cities already at or above pre pandemic eviction levels rents across the country are skyrocketing tampa florida is leading the way with a 15 6 percent increase in rent in just the first half of 2021 the highest jump in the country according to data from costar a national real estate group the next highest rates of increase have been seen in austin texas 15 3 percent raleigh north carolina 14 9 percent orlando florida 14 5 percent and phoenix arizona 13 7 percent housing advocates protest evictions earlier this month ap photo brittainy newman file last week the commerce department reported that the government s key inflation gauge the core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 3 6 percent in july compared to the same month a year ago the biggest jump since may 1991 a broader index including volatile food and energy prices rose 4 2 percent year over year the highest reading since january 1991 energy and food have risen 23 6 percent and 2 4 percent respectively year over year accounting for much of the inflation the national equity atlas estimates that around 6 4 million households are behind in rent though the center on budget and policy priorities puts that number as high as 11 million total rental debt is estimated to be 21 3 billion averaging 3 300 for each household that is behind on rent payments while 46 5 billion in pandemic related federal assistance has been allocated only some 11 percent has actually been distributed with some states including new york failing to date to distribute a single penny the world socialist web site spoke with william kilgore a housing activist with the tenants union in st petersburg florida on the implications of the termination of the eviction moratorium st petersburg located on florida s gulf coast is the largest city in pinellas county with a population of 272 000 according to us census bureau 2019 statistics the median household income in pinellas county is 54 000 with 11 4 percent of the population officially in poverty though federal reserve economic data fred puts its poverty rate at 12 2 percent between 2015 and 2019 the owner occupied housing unit rate was 67 percent meaning that roughly a third of housing is owned by landlords and management companies here in pinellas we have just over 2 000 open eviction cases since the start of the pandemic kilgore said we are looking at these cases moving to the final eviction they don t yet have the writ of possession the final eviction order that has the deputy turn over property to the landlord and remove any tenants remaining on the property and by force if necessary there have been 2 500 writ of possession orders since march of last year one thing about the cdc moratorium is it was weak to begin with and only covered nonpayment of rent if you had financial hardship from covid it would protect you in this case but landlords can get around this by evicting you for violation of a lease agreement if you have an unauthorized person staying at your place or simply at the end of the lease term they would tell you they are not continuing the lease kilgore explained that some landlords were holding off on filing because of the eviction moratorium and will now start filing he said court proceedings for debt payments for rent are something we will see in the next several months even the next years comparing the impact to that during the great recession which was triggered by the 2008 financial crisis he said many indebted and bankrupt homeowners are still dealing with the consequences of that crisis in court addressing the social impact he said people are going to be falling into permanent poverty some folks are going to be having a real hard time and it s going to continue to affect the health of the community in florida we ve seen some of the highest rates of covid and now we are seeing the largest surge so far almost 21 000 new cases were recorded in the state on saturday according to official figures nearly 44 000 floridians have died of covid 19 to date there was a study by ucla that estimated there were 10 000 additional covid 19 deaths tied to evictions in the first four or five months of the pandemic before the moratorium so i think we are going to see a larger number of deaths due to this they are willing to sacrifice people s lives in order to maintain the multibillion dollar rent industry st petersburg is a sign of things to come for the rest of the us the sun belt region has seen the highest housing price increases as housing demand outstrips supply affecting rentals as well as private homes the number of us rental apartments shot up by around half a million in the second quarter of 2021 according to industry consultant realpage the biggest quarterly increase since data began to be collected in 1993 occupancy was at a record high of 96 9 percent last month also in july the cost of new leases compared to what previous tenants paid surged 17 percent mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics told bloomberg businessweek the entire housing market is on fire across the board from homeownership to rental from high end to low end from coast to coast in the lead up to the striking down of the moratorium little or no effort was made by the biden administration and the democratic party which controls both houses of congress to extend the ban on evictions the right wing supreme court majority remarked in its unsigned eight page ruling that congress was on notice that a further extension would almost surely require new legislation yet it failed to act in the several weeks leading up to the moratorium s expiration the reality behind pathetic pleas from so called progressive democrats such as ayanna pressley alexandria ocasio cortez and cori bush for legislation to extend the eviction ban is the determination of the biden white house and the democratic congressional leadership to end all federal aid programs enacted during the pandemic except for the trillions being pumped into the financial markets by the federal reserve to protect and expand the fortunes of the corporate oligarchs this is an integral part of the bipartisan policy dictated by the ruling class to reopen the schools and return to business as usual even as covid infection hospitalization and death rates soar to new record highs the aim is to blackmail workers back into unsafe factories workplaces and schools under threat of destitution and homelessness
the rank and file committee for safe education in turkey calls on educators parents and students to oppose the full reopening of schools for in person education from september 6 as the delta variant of covid 19 spreads rapidly and the pandemic is out of control all over the world the ruling class and its political representatives are exploiting the concerns of parents and the working class as a whole about the education psychology and future of children to enforce this policy however their decisions are not based on children s educational needs but on the ruthless profit drive of the ruling class they aim to use schools as nurseries so that parents can be forced to go to work we together with rank and file safety committees in other countries with whom we stand in solidarity as part of a global fight against the pandemic respond to this criminal policy no child s or educator s life and well being can be sacrificed for capitalist profit a policy of death versus a strategy of eradication the covid 19 pandemic rages on having caused 4 5 million officially recorded deaths worldwide and more than 10 million according to various studies as well as permanent health damage for masses of people in turkey as in most of the world the government is normalizing mass deaths and suffering pursuing a mitigation strategy against the pandemic not aiming to eradicate it this is a failed strategy that relies on supposedly combatting the pandemic with methods such as masks and vaccinations while opening up economic and social life almost completely this deadly policy implemented by the government without any serious objections from opposition parties or trade unions can only be stopped by the independent intervention of the working class and youth before it causes another disaster action must be taken to stop school openings the reopening of schools in february march 2021 undeniably contributed to turkey becoming an epicentre of the pandemic earlier this year while the number of infections recorded in turkey on march 1 was under 9 800 it grew to 40 000 by april 1 by mid april turkey led the world in infections with 63 000 daily cases over the same period the daily death toll jumped from 60 to nearly 400 in six months since march the total number of people infected with covid 19 in turkey has risen from 2 7 to 6 3 million the death toll also doubled from 28 000 to about 56 000 these figures the product of the policy of opening up for the sake of capitalist profit and wealth make clear that stopping the spread of the delta variant and containing the pandemic despite increased vaccination requires more comprehensive measures scientists have explained that the only way out is combining worldwide vaccination with large scale public health measures to eradicate the pandemic at an online event titled for a global strategy to stop the pandemic and save lives sponsored by educators rank and file safety committees in the us uk and australia dr malgorzata gasperowicz of the university of calgary in canada explained if we have transmission in the community it s not safe to reopen schools full stop unless we have no transmission we shouldn t reopen in person schools before adding if we combine both vaccines and public health measures we can stomp it out she also noted that between 3 and 12 percent of children infected with covid 19 develop long covid with potentially debilitating effects on mental health and cognitive development dr gasperowicz s studies make clear that had aggressive and coordinated measures been taken at the start of the pandemic the virus could have been eradicated within weeks today they show that this can be accomplished in two months while fighting the more transmissible delta variant schools are not safe like most governments however the policies of president recep tayyip erdoğan s government are guided not by these scientific facts but by the interests of the ruling class prioritising profit over life the government and the education ministry meb have done nothing to create conditions for safe in person education in schools since the beginning of the pandemic no preparations were made in the recent months while there was no in person education this exposes claims that the ruling class is concerned about children s education as lies if education was the government s true concern thousands of new schools could have been built during this period hundreds of thousands of unassigned teachers could have been hired and class sizes of at most 15 children created however hundreds of thousands of students have been deprived of remote education due to the state s failure to provide the necessary materials no additional budget has been allocated for education no new schools opened no new teachers and school personnel hired and no steps taken to eliminate the threat of infection linked to the use of public transport however in the same period millions of people lost their jobs and millions of workers were forced to work in unsafe conditions while billions were poured into the financial markets and the pocketbooks of the rich the education ministry has not taken any measures other than making masking mandatory in schools closing its eyes to the inevitable outbreaks that will occur when children and teachers are packed into crowded classrooms precisely because outbreaks are inevitable in the schools in the current health conditions it is critical to oppose the reopening of schools and pursue a strategy of strict social distancing to eradicate the virus as for leaving vaccination as the personal choice of teachers and school staff and requiring the unvaccinated to be tested for covid 19 twice a week this makeshift solution is part of the government s bankrupt response to the pandemic vaccination is a mandatory requirement for all educators and eligible students to attend school but only under appropriate conditions when there is not a risk of mass infection attending school is not a question of personal freedom in fact no one has the right to make others sick while risking their own lives according to health minister fahrettin koca speaking on august 27 72 5 percent of teachers are fully vaccinated the vaccination rate of the entire turkish population is only 58 percent contrary to the government s claims both rates represent a failure not success today in turkey where more than 90 percent of all cases originate from the delta variant the daily number of cases is around 20 000 and deaths are close to 250 people per day scientists state that after the delta variant along with other social distancing measures about 85 percent of the population should be fully vaccinated nonetheless the unions support the government s policy advocating school reopenings for in person education while admitting that no necessary measures have been taken the eğitim sen union s slogan is precautions should be taken schools should be opened in september but it also admits that no action has been taken for it nevertheless it continues to support this policy and refuses to mobilise its tens of thousands of members and parents against school reopenings in unsafe conditions however the same eğitim sen had criticised the education ministry announcing that at least 45 educators died of covid 19 between march 5 and april 26 2021 moreover this policy has received statements of support from the turkish medical association ttb which has played a significant role in scientifically opposing the government s social murder policy throughout the pandemic the ttb s school health working group together with many education unions issued a statement on august 13 declaring fully in person education is necessary the statement admitted that no official preparations have been made for the return of students and educators to schools in safe conditions nonetheless it insists that schools should be opened and kept open in any case however the section titled criteria that will form the basis for the decision to open and close schools based on provinces and districts and the measures to be taken at schools makes clear that schools should not be reopened according to the ttb s own standards the most important of these criteria is whether the number of new cases per 100 000 people in the last seven days is over 100 if it is higher than 100 it means there is a high and dangerous spread of the disease overall in turkey the number of cases per 100 000 people is nearly 165 today in only 11 of its major 81 cities less than 14 percent of the total population live in these 11 cities is this rate below 100 but the rate is increasing in these areas as well in this case the ttb recommends that secondary schools and high schools switch to online learning while pre schools and primary schools remain open with class sizes of no more than 30 which is still a very high number however most schools cannot meet the 30 student limit according to a survey by eğitim sen only 15 percent of schools in turkey have class sizes of fewer than 20 fully 93 percent of the teachers participating in the survey said that it is impossible to provide the necessary social distancing in their classrooms those who advocate school reopening under these conditions claim that the probability of children catching covid 19 transmitting it and being harmed by the disease is very low compared to adults however this claim is false and has been scientifically refuted data from the united states where more than 60 percent of schools have started in person education reveal the magnitude of the danger more than 4 5 million children in the us have been infected to date according to the american academy of pediatrics the us reported 180 000 child covid 19 cases in the week ending august 19 a 50 percent increase in just one week there were less than 10 000 child cases just two months ago even worse more than 1 900 children are currently hospitalised and 24 children died from covid 19 in one week clearly this policy means that children will die or suffer long term harm from covid 19 for a safe reopening of schools the rank and file committee for safe education recognises the need to reopen schools safely and advocates the only viable scientific policy for doing so to stop the pandemic and save lives measures to eradicate covid 19 in turkey and worldwide should be implemented in a coordinated manner schools and non essential workplaces should be closed full income protection provided to affected workers and small business owners and a global vaccination campaign initiated together with other social distancing and public health measures implementing this strategy depends on the intervention of the working class and youth including educators independent from all establishment parties and trade unions instead of transferring billions to the corporations the super rich must be expropriated and the following demands implemented for the immediate closure of all public and private schools all teachers and students must be provided with good computers and high speed internet access free of charge to ensure quality online teaching resources for teachers schools and online learning new schools and day care centres should be opened in each neighbourhood to ensure safe conditions without the use of buses or public transportation and all unassigned education workers should be immediately employed as permanent staff before any school reopens all ventilation systems must be modernised janitorial and nursing staff hired and class sizes permanently reduced to no more than 15 students everyone has the right to access public and scientific education the subordination of education to capitalist profit must be stopped and all private schools nationalised private school teachers and other teachers employed on contract should be hired as permanent staff and all teachers basic wages increased full income protection to all parents and caregivers who stay home with their children the money handed over to the rich must be used to provide full income to those who cannot work because they must stay home with their children no loss of income for educators who choose to stay home teachers and education workers who refuse to work in unsafe conditions must be provided with full income and benefits for the duration of the pandemic not fined or penalised the imposition of flexible working conditions on remote education should end teachers working hours should be strictly followed and overtime worked on a voluntary basis and paid attempts to put cameras in classrooms permanently under the pretext of the pandemic violates democratic rights and must be withdrawn immediately for free speech and the protection of whistle blowers those who speak out against unsafe working conditions whether in schools factories warehouses hospitals or offices must be defended against victimisation by employers or state officials all workers who have been victimised must be rehired with back pay resources should be used to promptly make millions of vaccines available and private hospitals nationalised amid this public health emergency hundreds of thousands of health workers should also be employed immediately defend refugees and immigrants the over 5 million refugees and immigrants in turkey constitute the most vulnerable section of society they should be promptly included in the vaccination campaign and benefit from all health services free of charge official data on refugees situations should be released regularly no in person school examinations during the pandemic in order to combat the psychological damage the pandemic causes in children and all of society psychological counsellors should be employed and accessible free of charge our demands are based not on what the corporations and the politicians claim is affordable but what is necessary to protect the lives and well being of children educators and the entire working class our aim is to mobilise the working class as an independent social force against the dangerous reopening of schools and for the defence of public education we call on all educators parents and students who support this initiative to contact us to establish rank and file committees for safe education and to expand this vital struggle for public health

in recent months reporting by propublica confirmed that some of the wealthiest billionaires in the united states are paying virtually no income tax on the incredible gains in their fortunes 1 worse a massive loophole in the tax code allows these billionaires and other wealthy americans to escape income tax on their gains for their entire lifetimes even as regular americans pay income tax on every paycheck to pay for the transformative investments in his build back better agenda president joe biden has proposed tax reforms to close a capital gains loophole favoring the wealthiest americans this change is the most important way that biden s plan combats the tax code s preferential treatment of income from wealth over income from work under the american families plan afp only a small fraction of americans those with very large untaxed gains would be affected mainly because the plan exempts the first 1 million of untaxed gains per person 2 and while critics of the president s plan have argued that it would harm family farms and businesses these claims are unfounded as this issue brief explains many of these claims are based on flawed studies including some that do not even analyze the actual biden proposal the fact is that under the afp the vast majority of americans including family farmers and small business owners would be exempt from new taxes since the proposal is targeted at those with large untaxed gains moreover the proposal includes special protections for owners of family farms and businesses who plan to keep their enterprises in the family because of these protections critics harshest claim that the biden plan would force families to sell their farms and businesses thereby preventing transfers from one generation to the next is simply not true the afp closes a loophole that allows huge fortunes to permanently escape income tax to support vital public investments president biden s plan would raise 3 6 trillion in revenue from high income americans and corporations over the next decade including nearly 350 billion from reforming the taxation of capital gains 3 capital gains are the growth in the value of assets between when they are bought and when they are sold because of the extreme concentration of wealth in the united states capital gains accrue overwhelmingly to the very rich according to data from the congressional budget office households in the top 1 percent of the income distribution collect nearly 486 000 per year on average in realized capital gains those in the bottom 20 percent make just 67 4 central to president biden s tax reform is his proposal to repeal the stepped up basis loophole which shields these types of gains from income tax while protecting the savings of ordinary americans figure 1 stepped up basis is one of multiple ways that capital gains receive favorable tax treatment under the existing tax code gains on assets are generally not taxed until they are sold if a wealthy person buys stock for 1 million and it rises in value to 11 million they do not owe any tax as long as they hold the asset even though they have become 10 million wealthier 5 if the person sells the asset they would realize a 10 million gain and include that amount in their taxable income assuming the person has held the asset for more than one year the gain would be taxed at the rates for long term capital gains which are significantly lower than those for other forms of income 6 though the asset value grew over years the tax is deferred until sale and is subject to much lower rates when it is taxed by contrast income derived from labor such as wages is generally taxed as it is earned and is subject to ordinary rates moreover stepped up basis allows gains on assets to permanently escape income tax if the owner never sells the asset during their lifetime if an individual holds an asset until their death the gain is simply erased at that time no one neither the decedent nor their heirs pays any income tax on the gain accrued during the decedent s life as the propublica reporting illustrates the wealthiest billionaires in the country pay hardly any income tax from year to year because they often sell little to none of their stock holdings 7 this means that some of the largest fortunes in human history will permanently escape income tax if congress fails to change the revenue code before these billionaires pass their fortunes to their heirs 8 biden s tax reforms only affect a tiny share of americans the afp does not repeal the stepped up basis loophole entirely under the plan up to 1 million in untaxed gains per person 2 million per couple would still be exempt from taxation this would come on top of other capital gains carveouts including the exemption of 250 000 of gain on home sales 500 000 for couples and the exclusion of sales of qualified small business stock 9 unsurprisingly very few people would be affected by these tax hikes robert mcclelland of the tax policy center estimates that a miniscule 3 percent of households have unrealized capital gains greater than 1 million per person 10 above the exemption levels president biden s plan would repeal stepped up basis by counting gifts and bequests of appreciated assets as realization events requiring the original owner to include the appreciation of the asset in their taxable income in the case of a bequest this would fall on a decedent s final income tax return 11 taxes on liquid assets such as stocks would be due that year but taxes on nonliquid assets such as farms and businesses could be paid over 15 years 12 moreover the afp allows heirs of family owned farms and businesses to defer taxes indefinitely so long as the farms or businesses continue to be owned and operated by members of the family taxes are only owed on the original owner s gain when the enterprise is sold or is no longer operated by the family 13 for this reason no one inheriting and operating a family farm or business would be forced to sell it for the purpose of paying new taxes under the biden plan 14 critics of the afp ignore its specific protections for family farms and businesses president biden s proposals to tax the rich are overwhelmingly popular 15 consequently the president s critics have been hesitant to attack his plan directly for example a recent cnbc profile of the business lobbying group america s job creators for a strong recovery acjsr noted the following the coalition aims to turn the narrative away from a debate about taxing the rich and the biggest corporations to pay for roads and bridges the organizers themselves acknowledge that that rhetorical battleground leans strongly in democrats favor in public opinion polls 16 acjsr has instead mischaracterized president biden s plan as a tax hike on families eric hoplin one of the group s leaders claimed that the biden proposal would enact record high taxes on america s individually and family owned businesses a phrase acjsr has reiterated in multiple outlets 17 other groups have similarly accused the afp of harming family farmers 18 an article in the northern ag network paraphrased sen steve daines r mt as saying that the president s plan would destroy the generational handoff of farms and ranches 19 daines also said that he only way montana farmers and ranchers could get through this would be to sell off part or even all of the family farm or ranch 20 daines quote implies that income tax would be due on family owned farms or ranches when they are handed down to another generation but that is not true for two reasons first most family farm and ranch owners would fall well under the exemption thresholds in the afp and second even those with more than 2 million of gain will be able to defer their income taxes indefinitely so long as their farm or business continues to be owned and operated by members of their family 21 critics of the afp cite misleading and flawed studies to make these tenuous assertions appear valid president biden s critics have cited two studies one from the agricultural and food policy center afpc at texas a m university and another from the accounting firm ey formerly known as ernst young 22 both studies dramatically overstate the impact on family farmers and business owners from repealing stepped up basis and neither directly examines the biden plan nonetheless the studies have gained attention because of the novelty of their conclusions which greatly exceeds the strength of their evidence the afpc study on july 21 2021 sen john boozman r ar claimed on the senate floor that president biden s plan would crush rural america 23 he highlighted a study that republicans on the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry and the house committee on agriculture had requested from the afpc 24 boozman asserted that if president biden s plan were implemented 92 of the 94 representative farms selected by the afpc would be impacted with an average additional tax liability of more than 720 000 per farm 25 in a similar vein house agriculture committee republicans cited the study to claim that if combined with a wholly separate bill changes that mirror president biden s plan would cost those 92 farms an average of 1 4 million each 26 finally sen john thune r sd cited the afpc study in a fox news op ed writing but the biden administration is targeting this longstanding part of the tax code as it scrambles to pay for its far left crusade to permanently grow the federal government and fund the massive tax breaks they re proposing for wealthy americans in blue states the texas a m agricultural and food policy center studied how this new tax would affect family operations and it found that 98 percent of the representative farms in its 30 state database would pay a big price how much on average the proposal would increase the tax liability by 726 104 per farm nobody likes paying taxes but this heavy additional burden again often on unrealized gains has the potential to force families to sell off part of the farm or lose the farm entirely just to pay a tax bill 27 for starters policymakers should recognize that the afpc study does not consider president biden s plan rather the study focuses on an estate and gift tax bill the for the 99 5 percent act introduced in congress and another proposal the sensible taxation and equity promotion step act of 2021 put forward as a discussion draft 28 the for the 99 5 percent act sponsored by sen bernie sanders i vt and rep jimmy gomez d ca would change the taxation of estates gifts and trusts in a number of ways most notably by decreasing the exemption amount and introducing higher marginal rates for the estate tax 29 president biden s budget however currently includes no estate tax changes 30 like the afp the step act sponsored by sen chris van hollen d md seeks to eliminate the stepped up basis loophole it also includes a 1 million exemption threshold 2 million for couples and allows new tax liabilities to be paid over 15 years 31 but unlike the president s proposal the draft of the step act did not include specific protections for family farms and businesses the reason that no protections are spelled out in the bill is precisely because it is a discussion draft and its authors have invited outside input before introducing an actual bill 32 as noted above president biden s plan guarantees that no taxes will be owed on family operated farms and businesses until those farms or businesses are ultimately sold this deferral of tax liability was not included in the step act discussion draft studied by the afpc more importantly the afpc study contains multiple methodological flaws first the afpc s selected farms are hardly representative of family farms nationwide although the word representative makes dozens of appearances in the afpc report there is little clarification as to who or what is being represented 33 at one point the authors briefly note that afpc s representative farms and ranches are all assumed to be full time commercial scale family operations 34 this means that the afpc s 94 farms are unrepresentative of family farms generally according to 2019 data from the u s department of agriculture usda just 8 2 percent of all family farmers own commercial farms moreover these commercial farmers are far wealthier than the 91 8 percent of noncommercial farmers 35 this skews the afpc study toward the very wealthiest family farmers second even after limiting itself to commercial farms the study gives disproportionate weight to large commercial farms the most recent afpc study does not discuss the selection criteria for the farms but in a march 2021 afpc study of the same 94 farms the researchers noted afpc has developed and maintains data to simulate 94 representative crop farms dairies and livestock operations chosen from major production areas across the united states often two farms are developed in each region using separate panels of producers one is representative of moderate size full time farm operations and the second panel usually represents farms two to three times larger 36 for afpc farm households median net worth was roughly five times the national median and average net worth was nearly four times the national average 37 see table 1 this discrepancy cannot be explained away by confounding factors for example even if one were worried about the usda s inclusion of small residential farms in its sample this would not explain the large differences in net worth between afpc commercial family farms and the commercial family farms surveyed by the usda table 1
hong kong asian markets mostly rose monday following a record breaking close on wall street after federal reserve boss jerome powell indicated the central bank would be cautious in winding down its ultra loose monetary policy and was in no hurry to lift interest rates in a closely watched speech friday powell said the world s top economy was well on the road to recovery from last year s pandemic induced collapse with millions of jobs recovered and growth at its strongest in decades advertisement the fed s bond buying programme and colossal government spending worth trillions of dollars provided crucial support and helped drive an equity market rally for more than a year but traders have for months been debating when the crutch will be removed in order to prevent inflation from spiralling out of control and the economy overheating and powell in a speech to the jackson hole symposium of central bankers soothed concerns about the bank s approach saying it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year but he added that would not be a signal for an increase in borrowing costs to follow soon after instead taking into account the impact of the delta variant on the recovery as widely expected fed chair powell s jackson hole speech did not provide a definitive answer to the tapering decision said national australia bank s rodrigo catril but his dovish undertones on his views on inflation as well as the emphasis on decoupling the rate hike decision from tapering resulted in a risk positive market reaction he added that friday s release of jobs data for august will be key with a strong reading raising the possibility of a start to tapering in september advertisement but our sense is that in october the policy meeting is likely to have a better sense of the state of the labour market following the end of the unemployment benefit closing in september kids back at school as well as the impact from delta infections on the labour market eli lee at bank of singapore said depending on the economic data for august the fed could announce a taper as early as its next meeting in september but our base case scenario is that the fed will prime the markets again on tapering in september and announce in november that it will begin reducing its asset purchases in december all three main indexes on wall street rallied with the s p 500 and nasdaq chalking up new records and the positive mood filtered through to asia where tokyo hong kong shanghai sydney seoul singapore wellington taipei and jakarta were all in positive territory oil prices rose to extend last week s gains with demand optimism returning as traders bet on the recovery outlook while investors were also eyeing production capacity in the united states with the powerful hurricane ida slamming into the gulf of mexico for a category four you could be looking at four to six weeks or more of downtime for the refineries andy lipow president of lipow oil associates llc in houston said wednesday s meeting of opec and other major producers is also being keenly awaited with some observers saying the fast spreading delta covid variant could cloud the outlook and force countries to slow their planned output increases key figures around 0230 gmt tokyo nikkei 225 up 0 3 percent at 27 718 86 break hong kong hang seng index up 0 3 percent at 25 472 16 shanghai composite up 0 3 percent at 3 532 28 dollar yen down at 109 79 yen from 109 82 yen 205 gmt friday pound dollar up at 1 3769 from 1 3766 euro dollar up at 1 1808 from 1 1793 euro pound up at 85 76 pence from 85 64 pence west texas intermediate up 0 2 percent at 68 85 per barrel brent north sea crude up 0 6 percent at 73 15 per barrel new york dow up 0 7 percent at 35 455 80 close your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up london ftse 100 up 0 3 percent at 7 148 01 close gsg

an employee at a poverty relief workshop in dongxiang autonomous county gansu province on may 14 xinhua the astonishing transformation of chinaâ its economic prowess its rapid urbanization without slum cities its scientific and technological prowess the education of its vast population its modern infrastructure which is the envy of much of the world and its continually evolving pattern of governance that has enabled all these developmentsâ has of course all occurred under the leadership of the communist party of china cpc the unprecedented accomplishments that china incessantly rolled out all required the vision skill staying power and constant transformation of the cpc itself they demanded the continual summing up of its experiences and what polls suggest is popular support for the cpc s leadershipâ little of this can be viewed objectively or approached with an open mind in the u s obligatory objectivity part of the problem even among those open to a more accurate and sensitive understanding of china lies in how the cpc is like no other political party in the worldâ and that its accomplishments are a reflection of this as the austrian philosopher ludwig wittgenstein once said the limits of our language are the limits of our world washington well understands that who rules the words often fashions what is seen and how it is judged the critical need for the effort to find different concepts frameworks and keywords in china and elsewhere to challenge those often limiting and imprisoning theories and words reflective of western centrism remains to this day their absence in discussions in the u s often precludes any understanding of why the cpc became a central feature in the solution to china s problems instead of standing in their way why china has not adopted western systems of governance but sought its own why and how the cpc evolved its developing patterns of governance out of a distinctive set of historical revolutionary and core aspects of chinese civilization and more how the cpc has sustained national unity and stability today that enables a rapidity of prolonged change like no other nation has ever undergone all this contributes to making it difficult for americans to understand what china hands john service edgar snow and several of their peers already knew in their bonesâ namely how and why the cpc had come to embody the historic mission to lead china from some of its darkest days into a radically transformed modern socially more just society there was no model and no blueprint for doing this but that s another way of underlining just how for over a century amid a constantly changing and threatening environment the cpc found ways often through tumultuous struggles to remain a dynamic experimenting often highly pragmatic party capable of transforming itself while remaining true to its central vision in the most diverse of circumstances diversity and development in the long run the deeply rooted determination of the cpc to find an independent path for china has resulted in a genuine opening up toward a more multipolar diverse world today it further uncovers new possibilities for many nations that tie in with china s determination to create a fairer society that can inherently reinforce how other nations understand their own struggles to find an appropriate path to grow it suggests different ways countries can think about governing themselves this is inherently tied into developing far more effective means of global governanceâ and how and why respect for effective assertions of national independence is a central part of this so much more needs to be done the mere vision does not suffice global economic governance reform of the global financial markets and a model of unbiased governance reflective of the needs of the timeâ these all stand at their beginnings china extends to all the aforementioned its own experiencesâ as well as the awareness that the historically oppressed nations those still deep in poverty those coping with waves of immigration have claims of justice that need to be a part of any viable vision of governance nevertheless this is just to underline why developing concepts and visions of global governance need as china has long insisted to be opened up to the urgent needs and realities of the non western world if it is difficult to find the right words to understand china in the u s on certain subjects this is far less so in the non western world where china s impact seems to me to be more positively understood even in the u s there is some awareness of the imperative necessity to find new ways of governanceâ and thus a shared language may be easier here than in some other areas i ve read the three volumes of xi jinping the governance of china published by the foreign languages press i was struck by how he weaves together a commitment to the rejuvenation of china core aspects of chinese civilization and a chinese vision of socialism that is deeply rooted in the very origins of the cpc his perspective on global problems is certainly wide rangingâ including a deep commitment to an eco civilization the need to embrace and come to terms with the revolution of artificial intelligence and the call for new forms of global governance it s indeed rare to see a global leader so comfortably quoting from the diverse cultures of the world to develop his thoughts what this conveys to me is a conviction that while we may live in a globalizing world this does not require a globalized standardized and homogenized vision of humanity xi s articulation of the chinese dream of national rejuvenation certainly speaks directly to this here what emerges reflects what is perhaps most enigmatic in man s historical experienceâ that we can speak of humanity but nowhere in fact can we convincingly discover a simplified universal ethos humanity has played out its destiny in a diversity of languages a multitude of moral experiences and a considerable number of philosophies and religions humanity in this sense is irreducibly plural in the words of xi if world civilizations are reduced to one single color or one single model the world will become monolithic and a dull place to live on the technical and scientific level it is relatively easy to communicate popular culture for instance seems easily shared certainly the problems we must somehow face together are frighteningly varied yet on the deeper level of historical creation diverse civilizations need to communicate with each other with nuance and an appreciation that cultural differences are a constant source of enrichment for humanity this is a very different and more inspirational attitude than what one often finds among americans who argue that it is the very decline of cultural distinctions that measures the progress of civilization in the end given its cultural density and enduring civilization and a commitment not just to wealth and power but to social justice i came away from these books with a sense of why china may more easily encompass an appreciation of humanity s variety than the homogenous globalization often seen central to washington s fading vision of a u s centric world yet america s fading vision is not a sign of loss as so many in the u s believe it is instead suggestive of the possibility however small that america as it has sometimes been in the past will be more open to the world as it actually isâ and accept the approaching place of china in it and in that world china will be the resurgent if transformed and modernized civilization that was long one of the greatest of all achievements of humanity this is an edited excerpt of an article first published on cnfocus com the author is an

jackson hole hubris was operating at full strength last week as investors around the world anxiously awaited the announcement on friday that would send the markets into hyperdrive the broad averages had in fact churned impassively for several days ahead of whatever lame twaddle concerning the tapeworm lay in store the question of when the fed will begin to tighten following a loosening binge that has persisted more or less continuously for a hundred years is the focus of portfolio managers tiny febrile brains these days how quickly they forget for taken together the last dozen or so tapeworm utterances hints and titillations would seem to imply that if tightening is coming at all which everyone knows it is not it s unlikely to commence before oh maybe the end of 2022 or for good measure 2023 vague enough for you this dovish meme has been recycled so many times that it s a wonder it can still send shares soaring and yet it does alternating with fleeting dips of feigned fear and dread whenever the fed even whispers that it will someday be necessary to bring its surreal balance sheet into a semblance of control colloquially this is known as taking away the punch bowl an annoyingly dumb cliche coined by a benighted news media to make the somewhat esoteric concept of tightening go down easier with readers who are rightly confused about the bottom line getting high in august still you have to give the charlatans who manage our expectations their due since they ve riveted investors attention whenever someone affiliated with the central bank farts burps or clears his throat on friday fed chairman powell did all three metaphorically speaking in promising there would be some tapeworming of monthly bond purchases by the end of this year we ve heard this so many times before that if you bet on it be sure to get odds since powell and his colleagues fully understand that any real tapeworming would send the global economy into eclipse for a decade their alternative is to keep talking and it must be conceded that this strategy seems to be working at least for now considering that powell s mildly hawkish speech on friday pushed stocks sharply higher it would appear the fed has got spin control dialed in if so it would not be the first time that investor ebullience along with the stock market reached frightening heights in the month of august meanwhile although it s impossible to predict when the obligatory dovish take back is coming from the spinmeisters it is as certain as the next sunrise and apt to follow a punitive selloff on wall street keeping the stock market pumped is all the fed really cares about anyway but it requires bigger and bigger lies to hide this unseemly fact it helps that the hacks who invent the news are fully onboard and brainwashed by the fed s brand of egghead razzmatazz to believe americans can borrow and spend their way to wealth and prosperity moreover because the news media have been conditioned to hang on every nonsensical word from the central bank even a low level fed functionary can impact global securities markets just by reeling off a few scripted bullet points at a rotary club luncheon this dynamic resembles the relationship between the press and corporate muckety mucks who quiver in their guccis whenever they have to face some hack reporter dispatched to sound them out on the topic du jour the scribes invariably report out the story with proper awe and fear filing dispatches that in the fed s case would have us believe they ve got everything perfectly under control yeah sure bipolar behavior the fund managers know better of course even if we tend to think of them as chimpanzees whose buying decisions mainly entail force feeding other people s money into a handful of faang stocks while constantly rotating a bunch of others to make investors think their savings are hard at work so if the chimps are slightly smarter than we tend to think they are why do they drive shares wacky every time the fed roils the air with flatulent piffle we ve heard a hundred times before the answer lies at the heart of the stock market s embarrassing histrionics which are simply a reflex like an earthworm writhing in strong sunlight as implied above investors big small and in between have their testicles pudenda wired directly to the fed s pr defibrillator thus even the smallest jolt of ludicrously mis imagined news will tend to induce violent spasms however they occur not because investors or anyone else take the fed s insultingly stupid obfuscations seriously but because they fear that all the other idiots in the money management business will react to those obfuscations in the way they ve been hired to react machines do the actual buying and selling when the news hits the tape but if the algorithms appear panic stricken it is only because they ve been programmed to anticipate the bipolar behavior that accounts for most price movement in so called securities markets it is left to stockbrokers analysts and the news media to explain why these reactions are not only rational but healthy and ultimately bullish

christmas is not the only sacred day to be cannibalized by commerce while the commercialized holiday season has created its own mythology around a jolly old elf and flying reindeer carrying a big box sleigh full of gifts the halloween season has commercialized more than mythological monsters like vampires werewolves and mummies it s also reshaped the image of the very priestesses of the celebration witches just ask a witch if she s flown her broom lately no laughs willow kelly a witch in the shenandoah valley reclaiming group a facebook group that includes over 140 members she does

rituals with opposition to the christian church and worship of the devil witches didn t fare that much better in america at first think salem massachusetts circa 1692 in virginia apparently the pagans were of a heartier stock the only woman convicted of witchcraft by witch dunking in the commonwealth s history grace sherwood also known as the witch of pungo survived being tied feet to hands crosswise and thrown into the lynnehaven river in july of 1706 having been long suspected of cursing a neighbor s crops if she sank and drowned her name would have been cleared if she floated the pure river water was rejecting her because of her evil nature and she would be proven a witch accounts differ with an official plaque near what is now called witchdunk point bearing her story saying she floated and another account saying she dropped beneath the surface but managed to free herself of her bonds and swim to shore when she pulled herself up the bank she was considered guilty of witchcraft and sat in a local jail until 1714 when she was released paid back taxes on her property and lived out the rest of her life quietly until her death at 80 years of age many years later a post colonial period governor named timothy kaine pronounced an official pardon upon grace sherwood on the anniversary of her trial he wrote with 300 years of hindsight we all certainly can agree that trial by water is an injustice we also can celebrate the fact that woman s equality is constitutionally protected today and women have the freedom to pursue their hopes and dreams today july 10 2006 as 70th governor of the commonwealth of virginia i am pleased to officially restore the good name of grace sherwood there is no indication in the historical record that grace sherwood ever practiced witchcraft but there are people among us who have chosen to pursue their hopes dreams by becoming witches and wiccans and following paths other than our newer western religious traditions they do live among us and their answers to some of the basic questions people have about witches what do they believe can they really do magic might surprise you walking the labyrinth or what s a witch daybreak comes later and later in october after a wet summer leaves are just starting to turn to red and amber and willow kelly walks her labyrinth as she does every morning the labyrinth a winding path with its borders of hand placed bricks some covered with bright moss sprawls across a backyard of wild grass and clover adjacent stands an old oak with a circumference of at least ten feet looking down on willow kelly as she walks the path she s chosen you make more turns away from the center than towards the center she says about the labyrinth s pattern but end up in the center anyway as part of her walk she includes drumming and chanting is it magic well it s a personal practice you could also call it a spell she says just as many people of faith begin their day in prayer continue it in practices communal and individual so witches have their ways of connecting daily life with spiritual life for lynchburg area wiccan priestess ashley carroll there s hardly a difference between the two in my daily life on my drive to work or when i m walking in between buildings or even if it s from my car to the house i notice my natural environment around me and to me the natural environment is rife with the divine carroll is a third degree wiccan priestess in the gardnerian tradition that s a specific tradition within wicca that has spoken to me and there are many many wiccan traditions and you know wicca s just a subset of paganism so there are many pagan traditions as well she says via phone from lynchburg on oct 17 i m one of those individuals that believes that the divine is inherent in the environment around us you know all the way down to the blade of grass that we walk on says carroll certainly i m just a regular person who has a job just like anybody else but it can become that much more special if i take a moment and reflect on what i believe is the sacredness of our existence within this universe both willow and ashley began to find their paths in their early teens after childhoods spent especially attentive to nature and the seasons willow kelly who lives near gypsy hill park and met us for her interview in the quiet park behind the smith center on oct 18 is a witch in the reclaiming tradition one of the things i love about my tradition is it doesn t dictate belief if you read the reclaiming principles of unity it s pretty clear that there are values but not beliefs we re not ascribing like this is what you have to believe in order to do this willow says so for some people it s completely metaphoric for some people it s like carl jung meets joseph campbell with really good music and costumes she says with a laugh and for other people it is connecting with a goddess or god or gods like there s a pantheon people can believe in these multiple gods and goddesses and they can be standing next to an atheist in a ritual and still not have a problem with that because of the way that each person finds their access into the world s meaning every day sort of unfolds differently she says and part of the primary tradition that i work in is we call ourselves an evolving dynamic tradition and we say that we re ecstatic and to me what that means is how can i be present with what s happening in this moment and how can i most fully be with what s happening in this moment and bring whatever kind of love or grace i can bring so for me i do have certain practices i do daily starting with the early morning walk through the labyrinth spells of tolerance and intention the main difference carroll sees between traditional religion and wicca is the difference between orthodoxy and orthopraxy meaning that wiccans are governed by our practices not by our beliefs she says so monotheistic christians are orthodoxy driven individuals they believe across the board in jesus christ as the savior whereas with wiccans there s no way that i could ever say that all wiccans are polytheists or all wiccans are pantheists some can be agnostic i ve even known atheistic wiccans i think the only way that you can exhibit truly who you are and to act as a representative of your spiritual path or your religion is through right action so if i m going to preach tolerance of others and you know i would hope for the same in return but i m going to act tolerant of others that extends to anyone who believes witches and wiccans are part of an occult system that is itself governed by a devil in opposition to god locally for a few years in the mid 1980s a woman who said she was a former witch would lecture at several staunton churches about the dangerous allure of witchcraft janelle bickel now janelle wade of just believe ministries said she had turned to the dark arts as a way to escape a destructive and abusive childhood but had gone too far when she tried to turn back to the light she told those attending her lectures demons of satan assailed her one throwing a car through a second floor bedroom in her house as a self described blood covenant witch she had messed with satanic powers and barely escaped with her life she said a quick search for blood covenant witch shows the phrase appears almost exclusively in christian writings about witchcraft carroll is not surprised at the story or at the natural response of christians to equate pagan rituals with devil worship as far as the devil worship thing goes carroll says i certainly understand from their perspective why they would view any belief system certainly magic or belief in any other god other than theirs as being devil worship that is what they re taught carroll goes on to talk about the actual practices that bind some wiccans we re governed by our practices we do similar practices an example we cast circles before any sort of ritual that is something that wiccans tend to do gardnerian wiccans can trace our lineage of initiation into this particular path all the way back to gerald gardner who first started initiating women and men into wicca in the 1960s carroll says gardnerian wicca is oathbound meaning that the practices are not spoken of outside of the initiated so carroll cannot get into the details of specific rituals or spells she says it s that way to protect the integrity of the practices as well as that of the tradition s members despite that sense of secrecy it s also intentionally social while some witches wiccans and pagans practice a mostly solitary spiritual life gardnerian wiccans celebrate together with these like practices the idea is that you practice with other people so it s community based so your practices your experiences are met with others those interested in learning more do not have to commit to joining a coven there are groups called groves that meet where people can join in conversation with initiated gardnerian wiccans to learn more before making that jump which carroll says may not be the path for everyone so what is magic asked to define magic in witchcraft willow calls up a quote attributed to early 20th century writer dion fortune magic is the art of changing consciousness at will so for me willow says it s about practices that shift my awareness that shift my consciousness and that bring me more into right relationship with myself and life around me i hold that intention as i walk into the labyrinth she continues and when i get to the center i do the primary working of the spell i could give you the whole layout of it but at the root of it is to be a force of love that empowers heals creates and transforms the world around me everything can have magic in it and often does for me i also am constantly organizing teaching facilitating things like that on a daily basis different small groups different projects that i m working on some of those are classes workshops and events her classes are always a combination of downloading skills giving people something actual like here s how to do this thing while at the same time reminding people that a class is just a container in the experience as a teacher you don t have to hold all the knowledge in the room it s more like i m going to set up a thing i m going to tell you some things i know and then we re going to experience some stuff and open it up to the whole knowledge in this room carroll s answer coming from a different tradition has similar resonance what we mean by magic is intention and intention put out into the universe that is meant to manipulate energy in such a way that it will manifest in the way that you desire so magic as far as wicca is concerned is a relatively small part of what we do so for example if we were to meet on one of our sabbats we are largely gathering to celebrate whatever that sabbat is and then to celebrate with our gods so let s say we wanted to do magic for healing she says she describes the casting of a circle indoors as a kind of privacy fence that creates sacred space while also serving as protection some people might believe in malignant spirits or something of that sort so we cast the circle to create sacred space that s really the main point about that magic can include dancing to raise energy or you can chant to raise energy you can include certain types of incense or you may want to use certain types of gemstones to enhance the effects of the energy you are creating with a certain intention in mind what about other trappings of the trade the cauldrons the herbs the brooms like any tools of magic they are all just enhancement you don t really need them to conduct magic what s really needed with magic is the right intention and the belief that whatever it is that you re doing will actually come to fruition speaking of brooms at the sign of the witchiest broomstick willow kelly needed more than just a sign that she should pursue this spiritual path so she asked for three i said okay i m gonna pray for a sign if this is supposed to be my path i need three clear big green lights from the universe or the multi verse to say go through this door willow she asked for three because she understood at a certain point that by choosing this path she d be labelled as an outsider i d be choosing to wear a target that elicits negative attention she had to be sure so she lay down her challenges to the universe and herself and one of them happened to involve a broom the first was to find a polestar book about witchcraft and to pick the right one without much thought the first book she picked up after acknowledging that thought was to ride a silver broomstick by silver ravenwolf she felt an immediate connection with the author and took that as a positive sign next perhaps wackiest was a sudden urge to walk into a non witchy place and find the witchiest object she could imagine waiting for her like a big green light from the world to keep going down this path the place her local hardware store in a small california town of just over 5 000 people the object the witchiest broom she could imagine i walk in there and i find the witchiest broom i ve ever seen in my life i mean it s like actually hanging by the door when i walk in and it s on sale for five dollars or something ridiculous like that and i still have it she says lastly she wanted to find a familiar an animal companion to be her partner in this journey she had decided on a sheltie and an associate just happened to have a four month old sheltie she felt an immediate bond and he is just the most amazing dog on the planet later as she continued her study of ravenwolf s book she came across a passage describing how the book s author had also decided to find a familiar to help her along her journey the familiar she found happened to be a four month old sheltie willow wrote to the author and the two exchanged correspondence for six months setting the young willow firmly on her path she gave herself those challenges and what seemed like random coincidences had meaning for her this doesn t mean that she sees everything in the world as a personal message but these three experiences caused her to take the path seriously i do believe in chance and coincidence absolutely but sometimes it s like are you kidding me i mean if that s a coincidence then i think way to go random you re awesome more halloween was once last chance to find a husband history more 2018 guide to halloween happenings in the valley more a walk along staunton s dark history

amid deepening divisions with us ruling circles over the direction of monetary policy federal reserve chairman jerome powell tried to tread a fine line in his address to the annual jackson hole economic symposium on friday morning the divisions which are reflected in the fed s governing body are between those who favour a continuation of the fed s ultra loose monetary policy fearing a too rapid ending could trigger financial turbulence and those who maintain it is helping to fuel inflation and creating a dangerous bubble in financial assets in his remarks powell tried to give something to both sides the fed has said it will continue its purchases of financial assets government bonds and mortgage backed securities at the rate of 120 billion a month until it sees substantial further progress in reaching the goals of average inflation of 2 percent and maximum employment the new york stock exchange in new york s financial district as traders wait to hear what federal reserve chair jerome powell says in a speech at the fed s annual conference ap photo mary altaffer file with headline inflation now ranging between 4 and 5 percent he said the test had been met on inflation and with clear progress towards maximum employment he was moving to support a cutback in asset purchases at the last meeting of the policy making federal open market committee fomc held in july he said i was of the view as were most participants that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year but it appears that powell has pushed back against those on the fomc who are in favour of having the fed declare at its september meeting that it will start the reduction the general opinion in financial markets is that any such decision will be announced in november with implementation to begin early next year in the lead up to the jackson hole gathering held virtually for the second year in a row more hawkish members of the fed s governing body including dallas fed president robert kaplan kansas city president esther george and st louis president james bullard gave interviews in which they called for an easing of asset purchases as early as october seeking to strike a balance between these views and at the same time assure wall street there would not be any sudden cut in the supply of ultra cheap money that has sent stocks to record highs powell s speech was marked by on the one hand on the other hand statements in remarks that were music to the ears of the stock market he said if a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed the ill timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired today with substantial slack in the labour market and the pandemic continuing such a mistake could be particularly harmful at the same time he indicated when the fed would move he warned that if wage increases were to move materially and persistently above the levels of productivity gains businesses would likely pass those increases on to customers a process that could become the sort of wage price spiral seen at times in the past powell said at present there was no evidence of wage increases that might threaten excessive inflation but the fed would continue to monitor this carefully one of the most important features of the speech so far as wall street was concerned was the separation of any easing in asset purchases from the question of a rise in its base interest rate which has been at virtually zero since the onset of the pandemic in march 2020 powell said the timing and pace of a reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the time of interest rate liftoff for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test not surprisingly his speech was welcomed on wall street the market had opened the day higher but then climbed still further after the speech had been delivered the s p 500 rose by 0 9 percent to a new record high and the tech heavy nasdaq rose by 1 2 percent also hitting a new record the situation in the markets stands in marked contrast to that facing the working class the supreme court s decision to strike down the ban on evictions means that millions face the prospect of being turned out of their homes in the coming days and weeks at the same time emergency unemployment assistance is about to be cut off while the powell speech was the occasion for financial market celebration the monetary policies of the fed are provoking concerns that they are leading to a disaster in the lead up to the jackson hole conclave the british magazine the economist published an editorial calling for the reversal of quantitative easing qe citing a recent uk parliamentary committee s assessment that the bank of england had a dangerous addiction to buying bonds it said that on current forecasts the balance sheets of central banks in the major economies would reach 28 trillion by the end of the year a quarter of which was attributable to qe during the course of the pandemic it warned that the bloated balance sheets of central banks were a threat to public finances in the us on the eve of the central bank symposium former treasury secretary lawrence summers was even more critical he wrote an op ed piece for the washington post in which he likened the fed s present policy mindset to that which produced the experience of vietnam and now the debacle in afghanistan making policy incrementally focusing on adjusting current policy to avoid near term pain rather than stepping back and assessing whether the current state of affairs makes sense can lead to terrible outcomes he wrote he said the buying of treasury bonds and other securities was warranted in 2008 and 2009 and again in the spring of 2020 when bond markets were in danger of collapse but made little sense today there was no case that the best way to promote more spending in the economy was by buying financial assets and at a time when bubble risks are surely very high the goal of policy should not be further inflating asset prices taking issue with the claim that inflation is transitory he said the economy s two largest markets for labour and housing suggest that significant inflation will be sustained underscored by reports of shortages from supermarkets to semiconductors the fed used to believe in pre empting inflation then it announced it would not act until there was evidence now it is in a posture of not even beginning to reduce the most generous monetary accommodation in history until presented with conclusive proof of excessive inflation he wrote summers went on to assert that the fed was maintaining its present course on qe not because anyone had analysed it was appropriate in the current conditions but because it felt the need to maintain credibility given previous commitments and due to a reluctance to accept immediate pain associated with changing course coupled with the belief that it could manage the situation down the road this assessment is only partially true the issue confronting the fed is not simply immediate pain a passing condition the underlying fear is that such has been the escalation
